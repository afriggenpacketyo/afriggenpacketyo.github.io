          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump concluded without a firm agreement for the supply of long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. Trump expressed a desire to avoid escalating the conflict, stating he hopes the war can end without the need for such weapons, though discussions will continue. The meeting occurred shortly after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with plans for a future summit between them. Zelensky remained realistic about the missile prospects but suggested the threat alone pressures Russia.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has firmly rejected any cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), labeling the party as the Christian Democrats' (CDU) "main opponent" in upcoming elections. He dismissed the AfD's offers of collaboration, stating their true aim is to destroy the CDU. Merz also attributed the AfD's rise partly to former Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 refugee policy and subsequent decisions by the Scholz government. His comments reaffirm the CDU's "firewall" against the far-right amid its growing popularity.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered one of the most dominant postseason performances in baseball history, powering the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Ohtani hit three solo home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out ten batters while allowing only two hits over six shutout innings. This historic two-way display secured a four-game sweep in the National League Championship Series. His efforts earned him the NLCS MVP award and put the Dodgers in a position to become the first repeat champions in 25 years.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are set to begin a new round of trade negotiations next week in Malaysia, aiming to prevent further escalation of their tariff conflict. President Donald Trump acknowledged that the current high tariff rates on Chinese goods are "not sustainable" but defended them as a necessary response to China's trade practices. The talks follow China's recent expansion of export controls on rare-earth elements, a move that prompted Trump to threaten even higher tariffs. Both sides hope to de-escalate the economic dispute before a previous tariff truce agreement expires. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study of the Galleri blood test has yielded promising results for early cancer detection, identifying over 50 different types of cancer, many of which lack existing screening programs. The trial, involving 25,000 adults in North America, successfully detected cancer in 62% of positive results, with more than half found at an early, more treatable stage. The test works by finding fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood and correctly identified the cancer's origin in 90% of cases. The NHS is currently conducting a larger trial to determine its future use.</p>

Allies of the president have characterized the events as "Hate America" rallies and raised concerns about potential unrest.

          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the seven-year prison sentence of former congressman George Santos, leading to his immediate release. Santos had served less than three months after being convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.

          <p>The damage from a severe storm that struck remote western Alaska is so extensive that many of the 2,000 displaced residents may not be able to return home for at least 18 months. The remnants of Typhoon Halong caused catastrophic flooding, destroying up to 90% of homes in some villages. Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested a major disaster declaration from the White House to secure federal aid for the affected communities. Evacuees are being airlifted to shelters in larger cities like Anchorage, where they face the challenge of starting new lives.</p>

          <h2>Alibaba Cloud Develops System to Drastically Reduce Nvidia GPU Usage for AI Models</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 23:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Cloud has created a new computing pooling system, named Aegaeon, which it claims can reduce the number of Nvidia GPUs needed to run AI models by up to 82%. The system addresses the inefficiency of allocating dedicated GPUs to thousands of different AI models, many of which are used only sporadically. During a three-month test, Aegaeon allowed Alibaba's model marketplace to serve dozens of large language models using just 213 GPUs instead of the previously required 1,192. This innovation could significantly lower the costs associated with serving AI workloads. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Judge Sets June 2026 Deadline for Retrial in Etan Patz Murder Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 22:47:26 EDT</div>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that prosecutors must begin a retrial for Pedro Hernandez, the man convicted in the 1979 kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz, by June 1, 2026. If jury selection for what would be his third trial does not commence by that date, Hernandez will be released from prison. This ruling follows a federal appeals court decision that overturned his 2017 conviction due to incorrect jury instructions regarding his confession. Hernandez's attorneys have consistently argued that his confession was false and a product of mental illness.</p>

          <p>At least 15 people were detained following confrontations between protesters and Illinois state police outside the Broadview ICE detention center near Chicago. Tensions escalated when demonstrators moved beyond designated protest zones, and officers equipped with helmets and batons moved in to clear a roadway. The incident is the latest in a series of heated protests at the facility, where federal agents have previously used chemical irritants on crowds. The clash occurred despite a recent court order requiring federal agents to wear body cameras during such operations.</p>
