        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese humanoid robot startup X Square Robot has successfully secured approximately $100 million in its latest funding round, primarily led by Alibaba Cloud. This substantial investment marks the Shenzhen-based company's eighth financing round in under two years, accumulating a total of $280 million. The company simultaneously launched Wall-OSS, an open-source AI foundation model for robotics, and its Quanta X2 robot, which features advanced human-like functionalities. This move underscores the intensifying global race in AI-integrated robotics, with X Square Robot aiming for "robotic butlers" within five years. They also anticipate bringing down consumer prices to around $10,000 in three to five years, a critical step for mass market adoption, despite current AI for robots lagging behind generative AI advancements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Continuous glacier melt in Austria's Dachstein Glacier has revealed an old ski lift, the Hunerkogel, built in 1969 and buried since the late 1970s. This dramatic reappearance serves as a stark visual indicator of the rapid glacial retreat occurring across the European Alps due to rising global temperatures, with some glaciers losing up to four inches of ice daily. Scientists and policymakers are working on solutions to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and slow down further loss, though glaciers like Dachstein may never fully recover. The melting contributes to rising sea levels and intensified extreme weather events globally, emphasizing the urgency of climate action.</p>

Davies was an instrumental figure in Supertramp, widely recognized for his distinctive soulful vocals and his unmistakable touch on the Wurlitzer organ, contributing to iconic hits like "Goodbye Stranger" and "Bloody Well Right." His profound legacy as a songwriter and his unwavering commitment to sustaining the group, even after Roger Hodgson's departure, leaves an enduring mark on the history of rock music.</p>

          <p>A collaborative study by China and the US, utilizing seismic data from NASA's now-retired InSight lander, has made a surprising discovery: Mars possesses a solid inner core approximately 600 kilometers (373 miles) in radius. This finding challenges previous assumptions, as Mars was not expected to have cooled sufficiently to form such a core, unlike Earth and the Moon. The existence of this solid core, representing about 18% of Mars's radius, could prompt a re-evaluation of the planet's geological evolution. This significant scientific advancement offers new insights into planetary formation and could revive the long-debated idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics.</p>

The yen weakened, and government bond yields continued to rise amidst persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty, reflecting investor pricing of tighter monetary policy. This political shift introduces a period of extended uncertainty for Japan's Q4 2025, with potential for further market fluctuations depending on the new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

This phenomenon occurs when the Earth aligns between the sun and moon, casting a shadow that makes the moon appear an eerie deep red. The red hue results from sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more easily, a process similar to how sunsets appear red. This celestial event, which has captivated humanity for millennia, provided a stunning visual display for observers in various parts of the world, reminding us of the wonders of the cosmos.</p>

          <p>The families of three girls murdered in the Southport knife attack are hoping a public inquiry will thoroughly investigate the circumstances that led to the tragedy. The inquiry's first phase will examine the history of the 18-year-old perpetrator, Axel Rudakubana, and his interactions with various agencies, including any missed opportunities for intervention by the criminal justice, education, and social care systems. The families emphasize the attack was preventable and seek to ensure no other families endure similar pain, advocating for significant changes in how such risks are managed. Impact statements from surviving children's families and other victims will also be heard, aiming for justice and prevention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is projected to lose approximately $30 billion in international tourism revenue this year, as its political environment and a strong dollar deter foreign travelers. This decline, a "sharp and widespread" drop in arrivals, is redirecting tourist spending to other countries, particularly Canada, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Canada, for instance, saw domestic travel surge, while many Canadians are now flying to Mexico and the Caribbean instead of the US. This trend indicates a significant shift in global travel patterns, with the US share of international travel continuing to fall and not expected to recover within the next decade.

          <p>Santa Monica city leaders are considering declaring a fiscal emergency due to an ongoing budget crisis, exacerbated by over $229 million in legal settlements related to alleged sexual assault by former police dispatcher Eric Uller. The city faces additional claims from over 180 victims, further straining its finances. City services, already cut during the COVID-19 pandemic, have not been restored to pre-pandemic levels, and significant capital projects remain unfunded. With expenditures exceeding revenue in the upcoming fiscal year, the city's financial stability is in jeopardy, prompting calls for bold action to prevent bankruptcy and address the crisis.</p>

This significant seizure highlights the pervasive issue of animal smuggling, which poses a severe threat to biodiversity and ecosystems globally. Despite Nigeria being a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), it remains a hub for the illegal wildlife trade, valued at $8 billion to $10 billion annually, due to factors like loose borders, corruption, and lax enforcement.

          <p>President Trump has clarified his previous "war" threat against American cities, stating he intends to "clean them up" rather than engage in conflict, amidst discussions of deploying National Guard troops. His initial social media post, referencing a Vietnam War film, drew sharp criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who called it a threat to the Constitution. Trump's administration is considering federal intervention in heavily Democratic cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans, despite local reports of declining crime rates. A federal judge recently ruled Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles as illegal, adding legal complexities to his plans.</p>

          <p>Superchief Gallery, a prominent indie art space in downtown Los Angeles known for its counterculture focus, is facing possible closure this month due to financial difficulties. Co-founder Bill Dunleavy attributes the struggle to a decline in sponsorships and digital art sales, reflecting a broader downturn in the global art market and cautious consumer spending. This potential closure adds to a growing list of businesses shuttering in downtown LA, which has struggled to rebound post-pandemic, despite claims of more openings than closures. The gallery, which relocated after a 2020 explosion, is actively fundraising through Patreon and events to cover its significant monthly expenses.</p>

          <p>Florida's controversial plan to make school vaccinations voluntary, championed by Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, is expected to take 90 days to implement and will initially only apply to chickenpox and a few other illnesses. Mandates for measles, polio, diphtheria, and other critical diseases will remain unless state lawmakers introduce new legislation. Ladapo's stance, including comparing vaccine mandates to "slavery," has drawn significant criticism from health experts and lawmakers, who warn of potential outbreaks of preventable diseases and highlight his history of altering data. This move signals a departure from established public health policy, despite overwhelming evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that the Treasury Department would face massive refunds, potentially totaling $750 billion to $1 trillion, if the Supreme Court voids President Trump's tariffs.

While confident in a favorable Supreme Court ruling, the administration is exploring backup plans, such as implementing tariffs through other legal authorities like Section 232 or sector-specific levies, to maintain trade policy objectives. The outcome of this legal battle could significantly disrupt trade and impact businesses that have paid these duties, creating considerable economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
