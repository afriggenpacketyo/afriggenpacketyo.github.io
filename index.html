Witnesses claim she was attacked before the incident and was searching for her attackers when she encountered the agents.

          <p>Antonio Zappulla discusses the increasing threats to press freedom worldwide, focusing on restrictive "foreign influence" laws being adopted by various countries. These laws, often vaguely worded, are used to target independent media and NGOs receiving foreign funding, labeling them as "foreign agents" and subjecting them to legal penalties and social stigma. The article highlights the impact on journalists in countries like Russia and Belarus, where such laws have forced many into exile and limited their ability to report freely. Zappulla urges democracies to carefully consider the details of similar legislation to avoid unintended consequences and emphasizes the need for legal support for journalists facing these challenges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration has imposed a 25% tariff on key auto parts, including engines, impacting Japan's car industry. To ease the impact, the administration will help manufacturers relocate supply chains for car parts used in the United States over the next two years. Japan shipped around 6 trillion yen worth of vehicles to the United States last year, with auto parts accounting for one-third of Japan's total exports to the U.S. Automakers can offset the tariffs for 15% of the suggested retail price of vehicles assembled in the U.S. during the first year and 10% in the second year.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political controversy. Former President Akufo-Addo spent $58 million of public money on the $400 million project, which has stalled at its foundations due to Ghana's economic crisis. The unbuilt cathedral is now a target of the new government's anticorruption initiative, and the project has lost public support. Critics argue that the funds should be used for more pressing needs, especially given Ghana's current economic struggles.</p>

          <p>Analysts express skepticism about Ukraine's capacity to supplant China as a top source of critical minerals for the US, despite a recent deal between the two countries. Most of Ukraineâ€™s mineral stores are located in Russian-occupied territories, and extracting the remaining resources will take years due to a lack of processing capabilities. China controls a significant portion of the world's rare earth elements, making it difficult for Ukraine to compete in the short term. The experts said this will still leave American companies scrambling to source the materials as Beijing restricts its supply amid trade disputes.</p>

The impact assessment, conducted by civil servants, estimates the financial costs and savings involved, projecting potential savings for the NHS ranging from Â£5.84m to Â£59.6m after ten years. However, staffing and training costs for an assisted dying service could exceed Â£10m annually.

          <p>Europe is exploring alternatives to US credit card firms like Visa and Mastercard due to concerns over reliance on American payment systems. ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasizes the need for a European digital payment system to maintain control over digital payments. While some experts question the extent of US dominance, the rise of app-based payments through American tech firms like Apple Pay and Google Pay raises further concerns. The article discusses potential solutions, including Russia's model of domestic processing and the development of a digital euro, but challenges remain in implementation and consumer adoption.</p>

          <h2>York Outer MP Calls for Reconsideration of Alcohol Ban in Football Stands</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luke Charters, the MP for York Outer, is urging a rethink on the ban of alcohol consumption in football stands, suggesting a modern approach to the issue. Legislation from 1985 prohibits fans from drinking alcohol in view of the pitch in the top five tiers of English men's football. Charters proposes limited trials to assess the impact of lifting the restrictions, drawing comparisons with other sports and countries where alcohol consumption is permitted. The Football Supporters Association supports the call for trials, highlighting the need for a conversation about responsible drinking in football stadiums.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's promise of a "golden age" for the U.S. economy is off to a chaotic start, according to The Guardian. The article notes that GDP shrank for the first time in three years, and Trump quickly blamed the previous administration. The author argues that the new administration's trade policies and tariffs are creating uncertainty and negatively impacting consumer spending and business investment. While Trump insists his policies will revitalize the economy, concerns are growing among rural and lower-income voters, with many disapproving of his handling of the economy.</p>

The antibodies found in his blood have shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests. This discovery could lead to a universal antivenom, addressing the global issue of snakebites that cause numerous deaths and disabilities annually.</p>
