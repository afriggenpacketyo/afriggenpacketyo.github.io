        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the release of disappointing jobs data. The move came after the BLS reported that the U.S. added only 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations, and revised previous months' figures downward. Trump accused the agency of rigging the numbers, a claim he made without evidence, sparking criticism that he is politicizing economic data and undermining trust in government statistics. The dismissal has been condemned by economists and former officials as a step seen in authoritarian states.</p>

          <p>A growing educational consulting sector in China is offering students a shortcut to prestigious graduate programs by helping them produce and publish research papers. For a significant fee, these agencies, often called 'academic paper mills,' guide students through a research process, promising publication in a leading journal to bolster their applications. This trend highlights the intense competition for limited university placements both in China and internationally. Critics worry about the ethical implications and the authenticity of the academic work produced through these commercial services.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel experts, the primary reason for purchasing an early boarding upgrade on a flight is to secure overhead bin space for carry-on luggage. With airlines increasingly charging for perks, passengers without elite status or premium tickets often board last, risking having to check their bags. While some co-branded credit cards offer priority boarding, another option is to buy the upgrade as an add-on, which can cost around $24 on some carriers. Experts suggest that for travelers prioritizing overhead space, the fee can be a worthwhile expense to avoid inconvenience at the gate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders's recent procedure for bladder cancer, surgeons are detailing the process of neobladder reconstruction. The surgery involves removing the patient's bladder and creating a new one from a section of their small intestine. Because the new organ is made from the patient's own tissue, it avoids immune system rejection and the need for immunosuppressant drugs. While the procedure allows for a relatively normal life, patients must retrain themselves to use the restroom, as the neobladder cannot signal the brain, and often face issues with incontinence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia has remained officially silent following President Trump's announcement that he ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to the country, a move prompted by a social media dispute with former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Russian media outlets have largely dismissed Trump's action as a 'temper tantrum,' with military commentators suggesting it is meaningless bluster rather than a genuine military escalation. This lack of an official response from the Kremlin suggests Moscow is either not taking the threat seriously or is still formulating its strategy. Analysts note Trump's history of unpredictable actions, questioning if this is a tactic or a personal reaction.</p>

The White House and DHS state that the coordinated efforts, including mass deportations, are deterring migrants from attempting the dangerous jungle journey. Officials claim the message that U.S. borders are closed to illegal entry is spreading globally, leading to the sharp decline in attempts.</p>

          <p>A growing number of major Jewish American organizations, including traditionally staunch supporters of Israel like the American Jewish Committee, are publicly expressing deep concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. As a UN-backed group warns of a worsening famine, these organizations are urging Israel and all involved parties to ensure aid reaches Palestinian civilians. This shift reflects a broadening discomfort within the American Jewish community over the war's civilian toll, moving beyond left-leaning groups to include more mainstream institutions. The statements often balance support for Israel's security with an appeal to Jewish values and international humanitarian law.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese official has called on authorities in the southern city of Foshan to intensify efforts to control an outbreak of chikungunya fever. Vice-Premier Liu Guozhong urged the city to implement strict quarantine measures, improve prevention protocols, and eliminate mosquitoes to cut off the spread of the virus. As of late July, Guangdong province had reported over 4,800 cases, with Foshan accounting for about 60% of them. The mosquito-borne illness causes fever and severe joint pain, and while there have been no fatalities, the number of cases has continued to rise.</p>

          <p>A rising number of professionals are choosing to live in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen while commuting daily to their jobs in Hong Kong, a trend driven by the desire for more affordable and spacious living arrangements. These cross-border commuters trade a long journey, often 90 minutes or more each way, for the ability to live alone in a larger apartment than they could afford in Hong Kong's expensive rental market. Social media platforms are filled with posts from people sharing tips on navigating the commute, from finding the best neighborhoods in Shenzhen to choosing the most efficient border checkpoints.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest round of tariffs on a wide range of countries has sent shockwaves through global markets, with stocks falling in Europe, Asia, and the United States. The executive order imposes steep duties on imports from trading partners including Canada, India, and Switzerland, with the new rates set to take effect on August 7. The move has created significant uncertainty, with allies like Canada expressing disappointment and industries such as French wine producers warning of a 'brutal' impact. The news, combined with a weak U.S. jobs report, has amplified concerns about a global economic slowdown.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tennessee are searching for Austin Robert Drummond, a 28-year-old man suspected of killing four of his relatives. The victims were identified as the parents, grandmother, and uncle of a seven-month-old baby who was found abandoned but safe in a front yard. Police believe Drummond dropped off the infant after the murders, an act they described as a sign of 'compassion' amidst the violence. Drummond, who has a prior criminal record and was out on bond, is considered armed and dangerous, and a reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a temporary order that blocks the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in Southern California. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision, which found a 'mountain of evidence' that federal enforcement tactics were unconstitutionally targeting people based on factors like race or language. The lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups on behalf of detained immigrants and U.S. citizens who were swept up in raids. The court's decision is a significant check on the administration's aggressive immigration strategy in the region.</p>

          <p>A massive rescue operation is in progress in central Chile to reach five miners trapped after a partial collapse at the El Teniente copper mine, the world's largest underground copper mine. The collapse was triggered by a magnitude 4.2 earth tremor, which killed one worker and trapped the five others at a depth of over 900 meters. State-run company Codelco reported that rescue teams are advancing through the debris but have not yet made contact with the miners. Operations at the mine have been halted as all resources are focused on the race against time to save the trapped workers.</p>

Speaking on a podcast, the UK-born politician explained that she has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s and considers the UK her home. Badenoch, who returned to England at age 16 due to Nigeria's political and economic climate, said her early experiences there shaped her conservative political views. The statement comes after she previously faced criticism from Nigeria's vice-president for comments seen as denigrating the country.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research team has made a groundbreaking discovery about the evolutionary history of the potato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists found that the modern potato originated from a hybridization event that occurred about nine million years ago between an ancestor of the tomato and a tuberless, potato-like plant. This ancient cross-breeding was a key driver in the development of the tuber, the starchy part of the plant that has made it a staple food crop worldwide. The findings, published in the journal Cell, shed new light on the origins of this globally important food source.</p>

Dennis Bouanga scored for LAFC, but the team was hampered by a red card given to Nathan Ordaz in the first half.
