          <h2>Supreme Court Likely to Uphold Transgender Military Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 17:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Vox senior correspondent, despite arguments that a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military is discriminatory, the Supreme Court is likely to reinstate the ban. The court has historically shown deference to the military, even permitting activities that would violate the Constitution in a civilian context. This includes allowing sex discrimination and restricting religious practices, which sets a precedent that favors the Trump administration's position, especially given the court's current conservative majority. The ban is expected to harm the US military by losing trained personnel. </p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man in New Jersey has been charged with arson for allegedly starting a wildfire that has consumed over 15,000 acres. Authorities say the fire was caused by an improperly extinguished bonfire. The fire started in Waretown and spread into Lacey Township, destroying a commercial building. While the fire is about 50% contained, it is expected to burn for days, and smoke has prompted air quality concerns in New York City.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from withholding funds from 'sanctuary cities.' The ruling follows a lawsuit brought by San Francisco and other local governments challenging the administration's efforts to limit cooperation with federal immigration agents. The judge cited irreparable harm to the cities and counties, including budgetary uncertainty and undermining trust with their communities. The ruling is a victory for sanctuary cities, reiterating their right to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.</p>
