        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has framed the ongoing government shutdown as a strategic chance to eliminate federal agencies and projects favored by Democrats. This follows the administration's recent freezing of billions in funding for infrastructure and climate initiatives, primarily in Democratic-leaning states. The President announced a meeting with OMB Director Russell Vought, a key figure in Project 2025, to identify which agencies could face temporary or permanent cuts. This approach marks a significant escalation, treating the funding lapse not just as a political impasse but as a tool to enact long-term policy changes and reduce the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>The director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Todd Arrington, has resigned after a conflict with the Trump administration over a gift for King Charles III. Arrington reportedly resisted a request to give an original sword from the library's collection to the monarch during a state visit, arguing it was the property of the American people. He suggested a replica as an alternative, which was ultimately provided by West Point for the official gift exchange. Sources suggest that some within the administration were displeased with Arrington's refusal to release the historical artifact, leading to his departure from the institution.</p>

          <p>A terrorist attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, England, has left two people dead and four others with serious injuries. The incident occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, when a suspect drove a car into a group of worshippers and then began a stabbing attack. Police responded quickly, shooting and killing the attacker, who was wearing what appeared to be an explosive vest. Two other suspects have since been arrested in connection with the attack, which has been widely condemned by U.K. and international leaders, who have pledged increased security for Jewish communities.</p>

The crash occurred when their bus driver experienced a medical emergency, causing the vehicle to flip over multiple times. HARDY described a harrowing moment where he believed he was dead and the difficulty of flagging down help afterward. The incident led to significant physical injuries for everyone on board and caused the singer to suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks, for which he later sought hospitalization and therapy.

          <p>An attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, which police are treating as a terrorist incident, resulted in the deaths of two Jewish worshippers. The attacker used a vehicle to ram into people before beginning a stabbing spree, injuring four others seriously. Worshippers reportedly prevented the assailant from entering the synagogue building before armed police arrived and shot him dead. Authorities believe they know the suspect's identity and have made two additional arrests. The incident has prompted heightened security measures at synagogues across the United Kingdom and drawn condemnation from political and religious leaders.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver and current Formula 1 championship leader Oscar Piastri stated that his difficult weekend at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix taught him valuable lessons about risk management. Piastri crashed during practice, qualifying, and the main race in Baku, allowing his teammate Lando Norris and Red Bull's Max Verstappen to close the gap in the title race. Heading into the Singapore Grand Prix, Piastri emphasized that while the experience was a reminder of how quickly things can change, he does not plan to make revolutionary changes to his driving style. He believes focusing on the strategies that have worked well throughout the season is the key to maintaining his championship lead.</p>

The object, identified through satellite imagery in a lagoon on Nikumaroro island, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. The theory posits that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan landed on the island and were marooned. If the expedition successfully identifies the wreckage as Earhart's Electra 10E plane, the university hopes to recover it, fulfilling her original plan to return the aircraft to Purdue after her world flight.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown could cost the economy approximately $7 billion each week and reduce GDP growth, according to economic analysis. Past shutdowns have resulted in significant costs, with the 34-day closure in 2018-2019 costing the economy an estimated $11 billion due to lost productivity and delayed government spending. This time, the Trump administration has indicated it may pursue permanent layoffs of federal workers rather than temporary furloughs, potentially altering the fiscal impact. The White House is using the shutdown to target funding for projects in states won by political opponents, adding a new layer of economic pressure.</p>

The currency swap with China has been a crucial financial tool for Argentina, allowing it to manage foreign reserves and settle international debts.

Paloma Shemirani, 23, died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma after rejecting chemotherapy in favor of alternative methods like coffee enemas, which were advocated by her mother, Kate Shemirani. The coroner stated that Paloma had an 80% chance of a complete cure with standard medical treatment. The ruling concluded that while the mother's care was 'incomprehensible,' it did not constitute unlawful killing, highlighting the tragic outcome of familial influence and medical misinformation.</p>

The enduring myths of her being a spy or being captured were largely fueled by her husband for financial gain and later repurposed for wartime propaganda and Cold War-era fears.

This article argues that focusing on a stock's nominal price is misguided and that underlying fundamentals and valuation are far more critical indicators of potential returns. Using the example of choosing between International Paper at under $40 and Nvidia at nearly $500 in late 2023, the article illustrates how the higher-priced growth stock delivered vastly superior returns. The key takeaway is that true value is determined by a company's growth outlook, not its share price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown means that all active-duty military service members must continue to perform their duties but will not receive their pay until the funding impasse is resolved. While civilian Defense Department employees deemed non-essential are furloughed, those in critical roles will also work without pay. Federal law guarantees back pay for all government employees once the shutdown ends. Legislation to ensure troops get paid on time during a shutdown did not pass before the deadline. In response, some financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering no-interest loans to affected service members.</p>

Israel stated the vessels were approaching a combat zone and violating a naval blockade, while the flotilla organizers called the interception illegal. The incident has drawn international criticism, with Colombia expelling Israeli diplomats in protest. Israel's Foreign Ministry confirmed the activists were being transferred to an Israeli port for deportation and released footage showing Thunberg on one of the boats, stating she was safe and well.</p>

          <p>German Unity Day, celebrated annually on October 3rd, commemorates the formal reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. The date was chosen over November 9th, the day the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, because the latter is also the anniversary of the tragic 1938 Nazi pogroms. While an official festival is hosted by a different federal state each year, the day is generally observed quietly by most Germans. Despite three decades of political unity, recent polls suggest a persistent divide in perceptions and economic conditions between the former East and West, indicating that the process of growing together is still ongoing.</p>

Tenev highlighted Robinhood's offering of tokenized U.S. stocks in Europe as an early example of this trend, suggesting it will become the standard way for international investors to gain exposure to U.S. markets.

Democratic-commissioned surveys echo these findings, indicating that economic concerns like the cost of living remain the top issue for this group.

          <p>The legacy of primatologist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, extends beyond her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees to her unwavering advocacy for animal rights. Goodall used her scientific stature to challenge the ethical basis of humanity's treatment of animals, vocally opposing factory farming and invasive animal experimentation. Her stance often placed her at odds with the mainstream scientific community, which has historically been resistant to the animal rights movement. By aligning with groups like PETA and serving on the board of the Nonhuman Rights Project, Goodall translated her scientific findings on animal intelligence into a moral imperative for empathy and action.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter of 2025, with a total of 497,099 units. The rise in sales was likely boosted by U.S. buyers rushing to purchase vehicles before a key federal tax credit expired at the end of September. However, production for the quarter saw a slight decline compared to the previous year. The company's performance was hampered by a sales slump in Europe, attributed to competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Tesla also reported significant growth in its energy storage business, deploying 12.5 GWh of its battery products.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has resulted in approximately 750,000 federal employees being furloughed, while hundreds of thousands more in essential roles are required to work without pay. The shutdown began after the Senate failed to pass a short-term funding bill, with Democrats opposing the measure over disputes related to Affordable Care Act subsidies and Medicaid cuts. In an unusual move, the Trump administration has directed agencies to prepare layoff plans, threatening permanent job cuts.

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is primarily driven by a political battle over enhanced tax credits for health care plans purchased on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. These subsidies, which have made coverage more affordable for millions since 2021, are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats refused to support a funding bill that did not extend them, warning that premiums could more than double for many enrollees. Republicans argue the extension is too costly and should not be tied to the government funding fight, creating the impasse that led to the shutdown.</p>

          <p>The immediate focus on the political beliefs of mass shooters in the U.S. is a counterproductive response that overlooks more relevant factors, according to experts. A growing body of research suggests that many recent perpetrators are more influenced by online extremist subcultures and the notoriety of previous shooters than by traditional left-right politics. This digital radicalization fosters a fixation on violence that transcends simple political binaries. Experts argue that by trying to categorize shooters as simply 'Democrat' or 'Republican,' society misses the complex grievances and psychological factors that truly drive such acts of targeted violence.</p>
