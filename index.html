          <p>The United States has enacted a steep 50% tariff on Indian goods, including an additional 25% penalty over India's purchases of Russian oil and weapons, making India one of the highest-tariffed countries. This move threatens to significantly impact India's export-driven industries and economic growth. In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged Indian citizens and businesses to embrace "Made in India" products and announced plans for tax reforms, including a simplified Goods & Service Tax (GST) system, to stimulate domestic consumption and mitigate the tariffs' economic blow. Experts anticipate these fiscal measures will support a consumption recovery and boost GDP, despite global trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's industrial companies experienced a slower decline in profits in July, falling 1.5% year-on-year, the smallest contraction since May. This improvement is attributed to government policies aimed at curbing overcapacity and aggressive competition among producers. While the manufacturing sector saw profit growth, the mining sector continued to decline, and overall profit margins remain under pressure due to softened domestic demand and persistent deflationary trends. Policy measures promoting a rebound in prices are gradually showing effects, contributing to a continuous recovery in corporate profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has suspended over 20 employees who signed an open letter, known as the "Katrina Declaration," criticizing the Trump administration's alleged dismantling of post-Hurricane Katrina reforms. The letter accused the administration of appointing unqualified leaders, cutting staff, and terminating infrastructure grants. Suspended employees were placed on paid administrative leave, with FEMA defending its reforms as necessary to address inefficiency. This move highlights ongoing tensions within the agency regarding its direction and preparedness for future disasters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's escalating tariffs are prompting nations in the Global South, including Brazil, Russia, India, and China, to strengthen their own alliances, particularly through BRICS, as a counterweight to US economic leverage. These countries perceive the tariffs as an infringement on their sovereignty and are exploring alternative trade partners and bypassing the US dollar for transactions. This shift suggests a potential long-term backfire for Trump's protectionist policies, fostering a more multipolar global economic landscape. The article emphasizes how these tariffs are pushing traditional US allies like India to reconsider their geopolitical alignments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European leaders are increasingly realizing they must independently defend Ukraine and their own security against Russian aggression, as US support under Donald Trump appears unreliable. Despite recent diplomatic efforts, Trump has shown reluctance to pressure Russia, ruled out NATO membership for Kyiv, and imposed a "war tax" on European arms purchases for Ukraine. This shift has left Europe facing political and economic challenges in boosting military aid and establishing credible security guarantees, with memories of past peacekeeping failures looming. The article highlights Europe's strategic loneliness in the evolving geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>China's Tiangong space station has achieved significant progress in container-free material science research, surpassing similar capabilities on the International Space Station (ISS). Scientists used electrostatic levitation to suspend and heat tiny metal samples to approximately 3,000 degrees Celsius, enabling the study of heat-resistant materials for fusion reactors, rocket engines, and hypersonic vehicles. These findings, developed by a team at Northwestern Polytechnical University, demonstrate the reliability of Tiangong's laboratory cabinet and support fundamental research for advanced aerospace applications.

          <p>Civil rights advocates, including the NAACP, have filed a lawsuit to overturn Texas's new redistricting map, alleging it unconstitutionally dilutes the electoral influence of Black voters and favors Republicans. They argue that despite white voters comprising 40% of the state, they control 73% of congressional seats, and the mid-decade redistricting is racially motivated. Republicans, however, insist the maps adhere to the Voting Rights Act and reflect a growing number of minority voters turning Republican.

          <p>A German court has convicted a 16-year-old Syrian national, Mohammad A., for supporting a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna last year. The teenager was found guilty of preparing a serious act of violence and supporting a terrorist act abroad, receiving a suspended 18-month sentence. Prosecutors stated he communicated with an individual in Austria planning to use knives or explosives outside the stadium, with the CIA estimating potential casualties in the "tens of thousands." The defendant made a "comprehensive confession" during his closed-door trial.</p>

          <p>Dezi Freeman, 56, is the focus of a major manhunt in Australia, accused of killing two police officers and injuring another. Described as a conspiracy theorist and "sovereign citizen," Freeman rejects government authority and has a documented history of anti-police rhetoric, comparing officers to Nazis. His behavior reportedly became more extreme during the Covid pandemic, leading to arrests and contentious court appearances where he attempted to "arrest" officials. An experienced bushman, Freeman's familiarity with the dense terrain near his property poses a challenge for authorities in the ongoing search.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested he already has a replacement in mind for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, even as she vows to sue the administration over her removal. Speaking during a cabinet meeting, Trump indicated he would consult with Treasury and Commerce secretaries on the appointment. This follows his nomination of economic adviser Stephen Miran for another Fed board position earlier this month. Cook and her attorney maintain Trump's attempt to fire her is illegal, intensifying the legal and political battle over the independence of the central bank.</p>

          <p>US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel has reversed its decision to adopt a modernized logo, reinstating its traditional "Old Timer" figure after significant public outcry. The company's attempt to rebrand, which removed the iconic image of a man leaning against a barrel, sparked accusations of abandoning its Southern-style roots. President Donald Trump was among those who publicly criticized the change, applauding the reversal. This incident demonstrates the strong emotional connection customers have to established brand identities and the potential for negative market reactions to perceived departures from core values.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump is reportedly investigating whether former senior FBI officials mishandled classified documents related to the 2016 Russia investigation. These documents were allegedly found in "burn bags" at FBI headquarters. This probe follows years of Trump's criticism of the "Crossfire Hurricane" investigation, which he has labeled a "hoax." Recent declassifications by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard have fueled accusations of a "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama-era intelligence leaders, though former President Obama's spokesperson called these allegations "bizarre." No criminal charges have been filed in this ongoing investigation.</p>

Trenell Marquise Williams, a 38-year-old security guard on the tour, has been arrested and charged in the slaying. The incident occurred at a building associated with Williams' merchandise, which has since received an eviction notice due to "criminal activity."
