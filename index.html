          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, experienced a large-scale combined drone and missile attack early Saturday, with explosions and machine gun fire heard throughout the city, forcing residents to seek shelter in subway stations. This nighttime assault occurred shortly after Russia and Ukraine initiated a major prisoner exchange, the first phase of an agreement reached in Istanbul. Debris from intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least four city districts, resulting in injuries and fires. The prisoner swap involved the exchange of hundreds of soldiers and civilians, marking a rare instance of cooperation amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, expressed optimism that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance following another round of talks with U.S. Cabinet members.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also serving as the national security adviser, has revealed a significant restructuring of the National Security Council, reducing its staff by at least half. The downsizing comes as President Trump has built his national security and foreign policy teams with officials who largely share his skepticism of foreign interventions. The changes are likely to help Mr. Trump conduct foreign policy debates in his preferred style, with advisers taking the presidentâ€™s desired outcomes and finding a way to comply with them. Some National Security Council officials from other agencies are returning to their original offices, and others are being placed on administrative leave, effective immediately.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn, are leaving the firm to start their own law firm, a major blow following Paul Weiss's decision to make a deal with President Trump to avoid restrictions on its business. The partners' departure follows criticism of the firm's chairman, Brad Karp, for capitulating to the president. Ms. Dunn, who oversaw debate preparation for Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, was supportive of the decision to strike a deal with Mr. Trump. Since Paul Weiss reached the deal with the Trump administration, Ms. Dunn and Ms. Rhee represented the company in court as the judge began the process of determining how to address the monopoly identified by her ruling.</p>

          <p>Investigators are examining whether foggy conditions and technical glitches at a San Diego airport may have contributed to a fatal plane crash. A Cessna 550 crashed into a residential neighborhood, killing all six aboard, including a former drummer for The Devil Wears Prada and a high-profile music agent. The airport experienced two issues: the Automated Surface Observing Station was inoperative due to a power surge, and one of the runways had a lighting system issue. The pilot did not report any issues or declare an emergency, and the plane was not equipped with a flight data recorder.</p>

          <p>Meteorologists are raising concerns about the impact of cuts to National Weather Service balloon sites, implemented by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), on the accuracy of weather forecasting. At least 13 of nearly 100 balloon sites were cut or reduced, including sites in Michigan, Wisconsin, and areas prone to severe weather. These cuts have left gaps in data that could have helped during recent extreme weather events. Meteorologists emphasize that weather balloons provide irreplaceable data on air pressure and moisture, which cannot be duplicated by satellites or radar, and the cuts may compromise public safety.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to dispatch hundreds of border agents to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in arresting unauthorized immigrants within the U.S. interior. This effort will involve personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Border Patrol agents and officers from the Office of Field Operations and Air and Marine Operations. The plan underscores the administration's campaign to scale up its crackdown on illegal immigration. The effort also suggests interior enforcement operations are taking precedence over efforts at the U.S.-Mexico border amid a historic drop in illegal crossings there.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered massive cuts to the White House National Security Council, dismissing dozens of policy experts. The overhaul aims to eliminate bureaucracy and duplication, with many parts of the operation shifting back to their home departments and agencies. After the cuts, the NSC will be approximately the same size it was at the end of Trump's first term. Trump has been relying more on cabinet members like Secretary of State Marco Rubio for foreign policy decisions, rather than recommendations coming up from the NSC.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States have evolved due to the prevalence of hummingbird feeders, changing the size and shape of their beaks. The beaks became longer and more slender to better access nectar, and males' beaks became pointier for fighting off competitors. The hummingbirds' range also expanded northward, influenced by both feeders and the abundance of eucalyptus forests. The study highlights how quickly evolution can occur in response to human influence.</p>
