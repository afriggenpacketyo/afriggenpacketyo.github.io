          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, UK wage growth slowed to 4.7% in the three months to August, while unemployment marginally rose to 4.8%. The data suggests a stabilizing jobs market, with job vacancies falling for the 39th consecutive period. Analysts note that while private sector earnings growth is at a four-year low, it remains above inflation. Some economists believe persistent wage growth may delay Bank of England interest rate cuts, though an eventual easing is anticipated as the labor market loosens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese chipmaker Wingtech saw its Shanghai-listed shares fall by 10% for a second consecutive session following the Dutch government's takeover of its subsidiary, Nexperia. The Netherlands' Minister of Economic Affairs stated the move was to ensure the availability of Nexperia's essential semiconductor products in an emergency. Nexperia is a key producer of chips for the automotive and electronics industries, making it crucial for European supply chains.

          <p>Beijing has imposed sanctions on five U.S.-based subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, causing the company's shares to drop over 8%. China's Commerce Ministry stated the action was a response to the subsidiaries' alleged assistance in a U.S. government investigation into China's maritime and shipbuilding industries. The sanctions prohibit Chinese entities from conducting business with the targeted companies. This move represents a significant escalation in the ongoing trade dispute between China and the United States, which has also seen retaliatory port fees.</p>

          <p>Following the signing of a historic peace deal to end two years of conflict in Gaza, former President Donald Trump declined to endorse a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians. When questioned, he stated, "We’ll have to see," emphasizing his immediate focus is on rebuilding Gaza. The comments were made after a global peace summit in Egypt where a broad framework for Gaza's future was outlined. While the U.S.-brokered ceasefire has led to the release of 20 hostages, critical issues like postwar governance and Hamas's disarmament remain unresolved, leaving the peace process fragile.</p>

          <p>A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) has found that two UK government home insulation schemes were severely mismanaged, leaving tens of thousands of homes needing remedial work. The watchdog discovered that 98% of homes fitted with external wall insulation under the ECO4 and Great British Insulation Scheme have problems that could lead to damp and mould. The NAO cited an under-skilled workforce and businesses cutting corners as key reasons for the failures. The government has acknowledged the "unacceptable, systemic failings" and promised that the affected homes will be repaired at no cost to consumers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented new tariffs on imported timber and furniture, a move expected to increase construction and home furnishing costs in the United States. As of Tuesday, softwood lumber imports face a 10% duty, while certain furniture and kitchen cabinets are subject to a 25% tariff. These rates are set to increase further next year, although some trade partners like the UK and EU have caps negotiated. Canada, the primary lumber supplier to the U.S., will be particularly affected, with combined duties reaching 45%, while Vietnam, Mexico, and China will feel the impact on furniture exports.</p>

          <p>The Welsh government is warning of significant cuts to public services if its £27bn budget fails to pass in the Senedd, where the ruling Labour party lacks a majority. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford is set to publish the spending plans, but will require support from opposition parties to secure approval. The political calculations are further complicated by a pending by-election that could weaken Labour's position. If a budget is not approved by the start of the financial year, government spending would be automatically restricted to 75% of the previous year's budget, potentially leading to mass redundancies.</p>

Norway's foreign ministry called the decision "regrettable" but emphasized its desire to maintain dialogue and noted the Nobel Prize is independent of the government.

          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is advocating for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to heart conditions. Cameron McGerr believes he might have been able to save his father, who died of a cardiac arrest, if he had been taught the life-saving skill earlier. He has already successfully persuaded his own school to introduce CPR lessons and has now taken his campaign, named Pulse of Life, to the Scottish Parliament. Health organizations support the initiative, noting that Scotland's low out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rate could be improved with wider CPR knowledge.</p>

The Blue Jays' offense has struggled, managing only four runs in two games, with star Vladimir Guerrero Jr. remaining hitless in the series. Meanwhile, in the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers won their NLCS opener against the Milwaukee Brewers with a close 2-1 victory. The Blue Jays now face a difficult challenge, as teams winning the first two road games in a best-of-seven series historically have a very high success rate.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the NLCS highlighted the significant advantage of their record-breaking $415-million payroll. Despite stranding 11 runners and a chaotic inning-ending double play, the Dodgers' talent prevailed. Key contributions came from highly-paid stars, including a go-ahead home run from Freddie Freeman and a dominant eight-inning performance from pitcher Blake Snell. The win demonstrates how the team's ability to acquire top-tier talent can overcome in-game adversity and the strategic efforts of a smaller-market opponent like the Brewers.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James received a standing ovation at a campaign rally in her first public appearance since being indicted by the Justice Department on bank fraud charges. Speaking at an event for mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, James remained defiant, stating she would not break or give in. The charges stem from a house purchase in Virginia, which she has dismissed as "baseless." James, a prominent political adversary of former President Trump, appeared to allude to their conflict in her remarks, and her campaign reports raising approximately $1 million since the indictment was announced.</p>

          <p>European politicians are increasingly concerned about a chaotic and unstable global order, drawing parallels to the "three-body problem" from Chinese science fiction. Officials describe a world where the U.S. is undermining the system it created, China is weaponizing its control over critical minerals, and Russia is waging war on the EU's border. This complex interplay of geopolitical forces creates an unpredictable environment that is difficult to solve, forcing Europe to focus on survival and adaptation. The term reflects a growing sense that traditional diplomacy and alliances are insufficient to manage current global challenges.</p>

          <p>A former RAF navigator and lawyer who lost much of her ability to speak after a traumatic brain injury has found a new voice by learning British Sign Language (BSL). Tina, 59, suffered a fall in 2018 that left her in a coma and with significant speech difficulties. Learning BSL has helped her communicate words she cannot say and has boosted her confidence. She and her husband participated in a BBC series with deaf actress Rose Ayling-Ellis, which explored how BSL could benefit older residents, and she has since earned a Level 1 qualification in the language.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts, though this was a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. The growth was driven by the construction and financial services sectors, while manufacturing output flattened. Despite the positive results, the Monetary Authority of Singapore held its policy settings steady, warning that GDP growth is expected to moderate in 2026 to a near-trend pace as global economic activity normalizes. The central bank also projects that core inflation will ease in the near term before gradually rising.</p>
