          <p>Hundreds of active-duty US marines are being deployed to Los Angeles to support law enforcement during protests against government immigration raids and deportations. The deployment, consisting of 700 marines from the Twentynine Palms base, follows President Trump's order to send 2,000 national guard troops to the city. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, has criticized the move as an overreach of federal power and an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism, announcing the state will file a lawsuit against the Trump administration for federalizing the state's national guard. The marines will be tasked with protecting federal property and facilities, operating under the same rules of force as the National Guard and will not be engaging crowds unless necessary.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), stating that the committee had become a rubber stamp for vaccines. Kennedy aims to restore public confidence in vaccine science through a clean sweep of the committee, which advises the CDC on immunization schedules. Medical groups have criticized the move, fearing it will undermine public health and endanger patients, while Senator Bill Cassidy expressed concern that the ACIP will be filled with individuals who are suspicious of vaccines. The HHS release noted that the next meeting for the committee will be June 25-27 in Atlanta, and the committee will have new people that are "currently under consideration."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is in recovery mode after a weekend of protests against President Trump's immigration policies and the deployment of the National Guard.

Meanwhile, city officials and union leaders gathered at Grand Park to protest the arrest of David Huerta, a union leader detained during an immigration raid.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, aiming to create 10,000 jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a landmark decision to kickstart economic growth and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband believes nuclear energy will deliver a golden age of clean energy. However, critics argue the project is a costly mistake and fear it will increase consumer bills, with Stop Sizewell C condemning the announcement. The final investment decision on the funding model is expected later this summer, while the government insists nuclear power is crucial for the UK's energy future.</p>

Fueled by state funding and technological advancements, brands like BYD, Nio, and Xpeng are becoming household names, prompting action from the US and EU due to concerns over fair competition and potential security risks. While consumers benefit from affordable options, experts warn about possible hacking and surveillance threats, as well as the impact on European manufacturers.

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the deployment of the state's National Guard to confront protesters in Los Angeles.

Governor Newsom has also criticized the deployment as unnecessary and counterproductive, claiming it only increases tension and creates unneeded provocation. The lawsuit argues that the governor is the commander in chief of the Guard and must consent to its federalization.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pursuing a maximalist approach to enforcing immigration laws, deploying the National Guard to quell protests in Los Angeles over his administration's immigration raids. This action goes beyond his response to Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 and reflects a determination to deliver on his promise of mass deportations. While Trump officials capitalize on images of unrest to bolster their law-and-order cause, California officials are suing the administration, arguing that the deployment infringes on the state's sovereignty. The deployment signals a potential escalation of federal intervention in state affairs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court for the authority to deport immigrants to countries where they may face torture, claiming a loophole in the Convention Against Torture. According to Trump's lawyers, the administration can wait until after an immigration judge has made a determination, and then announce that the immigrant will be deported to a previously unmentioned country, even if that immigrant fears torture in that nation. Critics argue that this would deny due process to people who might be tortured, while the Trump administration claims that existing legal provisions prevent judicial review. The Supreme Court's decision could have significant implications for immigration policy and human rights.</p>

          <p>The article reviews instances where U.S. presidents federalized a state's National Guard without the governor's cooperation, highlighting Lyndon B.

These historical examples provide context for President Trump's recent controversial move to federalize the California National Guard over Governor Newsom's objections, raising questions about the appropriate use of presidential power in response to civil unrest.</p>

Trump is citing emergency powers, claiming without evidence that LA has been invaded by migrants, despite local authorities stating conventional law enforcement is capable of restoring order.
