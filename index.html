          <p>Slovakia has amended its constitution to legally recognize only two biologically determined genders: male and female. This move, defended by nationalist Prime Minister Robert Fico as a response to "the collapse of Western societies," has drawn strong criticism from opposition parties and LGBTQ+ rights groups. The amendment also limits adoption to married couples, effectively preventing same-sex couples from adopting. This article highlights a significant conservative shift in Slovakia's social policy.</p>

Successful settlements typically range from 30% to 50% of the original debt, offering a quicker resolution than minimum payments, which could take decades and incur substantial interest.
