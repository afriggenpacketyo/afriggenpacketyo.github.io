        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that former President Trump employs a consistent three-pronged strategy for deal-making, evident in both domestic and international negotiations. The author highlights a recent deal with Pfizer to lower drug costs and a 21-point peace plan for the Gaza conflict as key examples. The strategy involves ignoring conventional wisdom, aligning the interests of opposing sides with U.S. interests, and tenaciously pursuing goals while remaining flexible. This approach, the article argues, has allowed Trump to achieve breakthroughs on issues where previous administrations and political opponents have failed, such as curbing pharmaceutical prices and advancing Middle East peace talks.</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend that the final quarter of the year is an opportune time for individuals to review their finances and prepare for the upcoming year. With actual income and spending data available, it's an ideal moment for impactful tax planning, especially considering recent tax law changes like the temporary increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. Experts also stress the importance of creating a holiday budget to avoid starting the new year with financial stress, as a significant percentage of Americans incurred holiday-related debt last year. Proactive financial assessment now can help set a stable course for the year ahead.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on a railway station in Shostka, a city in northeastern Ukraine, has injured at least 30 people, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The attack targeted two passenger trains in succession, one local and one bound for Kyiv, representing an escalation in Moscow's campaign against Ukraine's critical infrastructure. This incident is part of a broader Russian strategy to disrupt Ukraine's railway network and cripple its power grid ahead of winter. In recent days, Russia has intensified its aerial assaults, launching hundreds of drones and missiles at energy facilities across the country in what Ukrainian officials describe as an attempt to terrorize civilians.</p>

          <p>Israeli officials have announced a halt in offensive military operations in Gaza to create an opportunity for Hamas to organize the release of hostages. This move is not an official ceasefire but a tactical pause, with the Israel Defense Forces remaining vigilant to prevent Hamas from exploiting the situation. Indirect talks are scheduled to begin in Egypt to determine if Hamas will accept the ceasefire framework proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the developments, and Gaza's health ministry reported that the Palestinian death toll since the war began has now exceeded 67,000.</p>

          <p>UK Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch has announced that the Conservative Party will withdraw the United Kingdom from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if they win the next election. This policy shift follows a party-led legal review which concluded that remaining in the ECHR hinders migration reform and leads to the legal persecution of military veterans. The move, announced on the eve of the party's conference, is seen as a response to pressure from Reform UK and aims to make immigration a central theme of their campaign.

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, some university students of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community are expressing unease about his portrayal as a national hero. They point to his history of what they describe as hateful rhetoric and feel unfairly blamed for his death, especially as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) face racist threats. The aftermath has also sparked a debate on free speech, with several students facing disciplinary action or expulsion for mocking Kirk's death. This has led to concerns among students that the incident will be used to justify increased censorship and militarization on college campuses, stifling progressive and critical viewpoints.</p>

          <p>A recently ousted high-ranking official from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has raised alarms about the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's former chief medical officer, claims Kennedy has avoided meetings with top health experts, even during deadly outbreaks, and has pushed for significant changes to the childhood immunization schedule without scientific backing. Houry described the situation as a "hostile takeover" of the agency, noting she was never able to brief the secretary and only learned of major policy shifts, like restricting COVID vaccines, through social media. This account follows similar criticisms from other former officials, painting a picture of an agency where scientific leadership has been sidelined.</p>

Heinla claims the venture is already operating at a small profit, offering deliveries at a lower cost than human drivers, even in less dense areas like small towns. The six-wheeled robots are currently active in several UK cities, Finland, and Estonia, having completed over 8 million deliveries. While facing competition from other robotics and drone delivery companies, Starship's primary hurdle is inconsistent regulation, which has slowed its expansion in the UK compared to Finland. Heinla believes robotic delivery will soon become an essential, non-negotiable part of the retail landscape.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece celebrates a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge William Young, who condemned the Trump administration for violating the free speech rights of non-citizen residents. The judge's decision in a case involving the detention of pro-Palestinian foreign scholars asserted that the First Amendment protects all people within U.S. borders, not just citizens. The author praises Judge Young for going beyond typical legal language to personally rebuke the president for ignoring the Constitution and bullying dissenters. The article argues that this judicial stance is a crucial defense of American values, framing the threat to immigrants' rights as a threat to the constitutional principles that protect everyone.</p>

          <p>A new progressive party in the UK, co-led by MP Zarah Sultana and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, is already experiencing significant internal conflict, threatening its viability. The provisionally named 'Your Party,' formed by those disaffected with Keir Starmer's Labour, suffered a public meltdown when Corbyn disavowed a membership drive initiated by Sultana, leading to accusations of a "sexist boys' club" and legal threats. Beyond leadership disputes, the party faces historical challenges, as Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system makes it difficult for third parties to succeed. Analysts suggest its focus on single issues like Palestine and its activist-heavy base could hinder its ability to build a broad coalition, potentially splitting the left-wing vote and benefiting right-wing rivals.</p>

          <p>The creation of 'Tilly Norwood,' a hyperrealistic AI-generated actress, has triggered alarm and condemnation from actors and unions in Hollywood. Developed by UK-based AI production company Particle6, Norwood is being marketed as the first of a new wave of "synthetic talent" for film, television, and social media. In response, SAG-AFTRA issued a statement opposing the replacement of human performers, and major talent agencies have publicly stated they will not represent an AI client. While the immediate threat to A-list stars seems minimal, the controversy highlights the industry's deeper anxieties about AI, particularly its potential to replace background actors and voice performers through technologies like body scanning and digital dubbing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals holding a large number of credit cards, canceling some can be a sensible financial move despite the potential for a small, temporary dip in their credit score. Financial experts advise that closing cards may be justified if you are struggling with payments, paying high annual fees on unused cards, or dealing with steep interest rates. To minimize the impact on your credit score, it is recommended to first cancel newer cards or those with low credit limits, while keeping the oldest accounts open to preserve your credit history length. Strategically closing cards over time, rather than all at once, can help manage credit utilization and allow your score to recover more smoothly.</p>

Families of the detained, like that of Colombian humanitarian worker Manuel Tique, fear that escalating military tensions could either prolong the imprisonment or create further instability. Human rights groups report that at least 89 foreigners are being held, many of whom they claim are tourists and aid workers unjustly accused of plotting against the government. These groups suggest the detentions are a form of political extortion by the Maduro regime in response to international sanctions and political isolation.</p>

Police stated Daulby was accidentally shot by an officer during the response. Authorities are investigating whether Al-Shamie, who was out on bail for an alleged sexual assault, acted alone and may have been influenced by extremist ideology.

A win for ANO might align the Czech Republic more closely with Hungary and Slovakia in challenging EU policies, particularly regarding support for Kyiv.

While lauded for its courage in portraying a sensitive topic, the review notes that the film largely avoids the most traumatic later stages of the pandemic, such as the mass infections and deaths after the abrupt end of the "zero COVID" policy.

This article observes that in press briefings and Oval Office Q&A sessions, these individuals often ask fawning questions or make complimentary remarks, which can blunt the impact of critical inquiries from mainstream journalists. The White House now directly controls the selection of the press pool, frequently including fringe outlets while excluding traditional news agencies. Critics argue this strategy emulates authoritarian tactics by surrounding the president with sycophants to avoid accountability and disseminate propaganda.</p>

          <p>Michele Mulroney, the newly elected president of the Writers Guild of America West, is taking leadership at a critical time for the industry, marked by studio consolidation, job scarcity, and the rise of artificial intelligence. Mulroney plans to build on the guild's 2023 strike gains, particularly in securing AI protections and addressing the financial strain on the WGA's health plan caused by production cutbacks. She also emphasized the union's commitment to protecting free speech, a key issue in the recent successful protest against the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". As the guild prepares for contract negotiations next year, Mulroney states that members are prepared to fight for a fair contract if necessary.</p>

          <p>This opinion column refutes conservative criticism of the NFL's choice of Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl halftime show, labeling the backlash as un-American and geographically ignorant. The author points out that as a Puerto Rican, Bad Bunny is a U.S. citizen, and his Spanish-language music has achieved massive mainstream success on American charts. The piece highlights the NFL's long history of featuring non-American acts like The Rolling Stones and U2, making the focus on Bad Bunny's heritage and language appear discriminatory. The author argues that such reactions are counterproductive and reflect a fear of cultural diversity, rather than any legitimate concern about patriotism or inclusivity.</p>

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort for homeowners, is requesting an average rate increase of 35.8% after incurring an estimated $4 billion in losses from January's fire storms. The insurance pool, which has seen its policyholder numbers swell as private insurers retreat from high-risk areas, says the hike is necessary to cover anticipated claims and expenses. The proposed increase, which requires approval from the state insurance commissioner, is facing controversy amid accusations that the FAIR Plan has improperly handled smoke damage claims from recent fires. Consumer advocates are urging the commissioner to deny the rate hike until these claims handling disputes are resolved.</p>

          <p>Five teenage boys in Simi Valley, California, have been charged in connection with a violent assault on an 18-year-old Black man, Michael Robinson, during which they allegedly shouted racial slurs. Three of the suspects face special allegations of a hate crime for the attack, which was captured on video and left Robinson with a concussion and other injuries. The incident, which took place in a cinema parking lot, has sparked community outrage and calls for an independent investigation, particularly as one of the alleged attackers is the son of a Simi Valley police sergeant.

          <p>Veteran French tennis player Gaël Monfils, renowned for his extraordinary athleticism and showmanship, has announced he will retire after the 2026 season, concluding a 22-year professional career. At 39, Monfils was a prominent figure during the "golden age" of men's tennis, competing against legends like Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic. While he never won a Grand Slam title, he was a consistent contender, achieving a career-high ranking of No. 6 and winning nearly 600 matches. Known for his incredible agility and highlight-reel shots, Monfils is celebrated more for his unique style and entertainment value than his statistics, leaving a legacy as one of the sport's most dazzling performers.</p>

          <p>The Federal Election Commission (FEC), the U.S. agency responsible for regulating campaign finance, is now at a functional standstill after another commissioner's resignation left it with only two of its six seats filled. The agency has lacked the required four-member quorum for months, preventing it from voting on investigations, issuing penalties, or making policy decisions. This paralysis is exacerbated by the Trump administration's failure to nominate replacements and its firing of a Democratic commissioner, which critics call unprecedented. While the FEC staff can still process campaign finance disclosures, the lack of a functioning commission means there is effectively no enforcement of campaign finance laws.</p>

U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach shared a draft design showing Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him after his 2024 assassination attempt on the other, inscribed with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." The minting may be permissible under a 2020 law signed by Trump, though it could face legal challenges from existing statutes that prohibit living persons from appearing on U.S. currency. A Treasury spokesperson confirmed a final design has not been selected but stated the draft reflects the enduring spirit of the country.</p>

          <p>A new film, "The Smashing Machine," starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, is set to portray the turbulent life of pioneering MMA fighter Mark Kerr. The project, directed by Benny Safdie, is based on a 2002 documentary of the same name that captured Kerr's rise to the top of the sport in the late 1990s and his subsequent fall due to a severe addiction to opioids. After years of struggling with alcoholism and personal turmoil following the end of his fighting career, a now-sober Kerr has been closely involved with the film's production. Johnson's portrayal of the vulnerable yet formidable fighter has already garnered critical acclaim, offering Kerr a second chance at public recognition.</p>

          <p>This article explores the effects of the Trump administration's cuts to federal assistance programs on low-income residents in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a post-industrial area that has strongly supported the president. Despite Trump's promises of economic revival, residents are facing reduced food assistance (SNAP), loss of housing subsidies, and new work requirements for Medicaid, which provides healthcare to nearly a third of the county. While some residents express frustration, many continue to support Trump, often echoing the sentiment that welfare programs are abused and that people should be self-reliant. However, healthcare advocates and those directly affected warn that these cuts will have dire consequences, with one study estimating they could lead to thousands of preventable deaths.</p>
