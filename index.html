          <p>Despite recent military strikes by India on targets within Pakistani-controlled territory, Indian markets have shown remarkable resilience, fueled by optimism surrounding India's growth prospects and strong macro fundamentals. Investors appear to be focusing on structural reforms, resilient domestic demand, and progress in trade talks with major partners, including a free trade agreement with the U.K. Experts anticipate potential near-term volatility but expect a gradual recovery, contingent on whether the situation escalates into a full-fledged conflict or remains a limited defense strike. The article also references the Pulwama attack in 2019, noting a similar contained reaction from investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers to lower costs and offer a safer alternative to compounders.

          <p>Following India's airstrikes on alleged terrorist targets within Pakistan in retaliation for a recent attack in Kashmir, Pakistani officials claimed to have downed multiple Indian aircraft, with both sides presenting conflicting accounts of the situation. The Indian government asserted that its actions were measured and targeted, while Pakistan condemned the strikes as an unprovoked act of war, raising concerns about escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries. Reports indicate casualties on both sides, with residents in Kashmir reporting deaths and injuries from cross-border shelling. International calls for restraint have been issued, but analysts fear a significant retaliation from Pakistan is likely.</p>

          <p>A Republican state representative in Texas has introduced the Forbidden Unlawful Representation of Roleplaying in Educational Spaces (FURRIES) Act, aiming to ban students from acting like animals in schools. The bill follows claims, largely unsubstantiated, that schools are accommodating students who identify as animals, including providing litter boxes. Critics argue that the bill is a cynical attempt to attack public schools and justify defunding them, diverting attention from more pressing issues such as school shootings.</p>

          <p>Trust is fraying in modern society, but it is a necessary component in every relationship. Research shows that when deciding whether to trust someone, people generally make judgments about their competence, benevolence, and integrity. People are born inherently trustful, but distrust is a unique experience, shaped by past experiences throughout life, especially childhood. Three easy ways to foster trust, according to a psychologist, are to approach differences with curiosity, embrace a team mindset, and lean into transparency.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that a majority of California voters believe Governor Gavin Newsom is more focused on boosting his presidential prospects than addressing the state's challenges. The poll also reveals a mixed response to Newsom's performance as governor and his ability to effectively represent California's interests in dealing with the Trump administration. Voters are divided on Newsom's signature healthcare policy to expand eligibility for state-sponsored healthcare to all undocumented immigrants, with concerns about the program's rising costs.</p>

          <p>California's ambitious green energy policies are facing criticism for contributing to the state's high energy costs, with gasoline and electricity prices significantly exceeding national averages. Critics argue that the state's push towards renewable energy sources and disincentives for traditional energy production are disproportionately impacting lower-income residents and undermining the state's economic competitiveness. The Air Resources Board's projections suggest that the shift to renewable energy will lead to income declines for those earning less than $100,000 annually, further exacerbating income inequality.
