          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has claimed that FBI agents reviewing files on Jeffrey Epstein were instructed to "flag" any records mentioning President Donald Trump. Durbin sent letters to the Justice Department and FBI demanding an explanation for what he called "apparent discrepancies" in the handling of the case. The senator's letter alleges that a rushed, haphazard review of approximately 100,000 documents was conducted by personnel, some of whom lacked proper expertise. This development adds to the political pressure on the administration regarding transparency in the Epstein investigation.</p>

An FDA official indicated the agency is evaluating whether the treatment should remain on the market, and it will reportedly ask the company to voluntarily halt shipments. The increased scrutiny comes after the FDA began investigating two patient deaths linked to Elevidys, with the company also reporting a third death associated with a different experimental gene therapy.

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly demanding that a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% be imposed on all goods imported from the European Union. This escalation in trade demands comes after weeks of negotiations have seemingly stalled ahead of an August 1 deadline. The EU had hoped for a deal more aligned with the U.K.'s, which maintained a lower baseline tariff with some exceptions. The Trump administration has frequently cited the large trade surplus the EU holds with the U.S. as a key point of contention in the ongoing trade talks.</p>

          <p>The Mountain West Conference has addressed a controversy surrounding its investigation into alleged misconduct by a former San Jose State transgender volleyball player. The conference faced questions over hiring the same law firm to investigate the athlete that had previously defended the conference's policy allowing her to compete. In a statement, the conference denied any conflict of interest, claiming the two legal matters were unrelated. This article details the complex situation, which involves allegations of conspiring to harm a teammate and the legal arguments surrounding the player's eligibility and Title IX.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is embroiled in controversy following its removal of explicit anti-discrimination language from hospital bylaws, which protected patients based on marital status and political views. Seventy members of Congress expressed "profound alarm," fearing providers could now refuse treatment on these grounds. The VA has defended the change as a formality required by an anti-transgender executive order, while also paradoxically citing a separate Obama-era directive as still offering protection. This move is part of a broader push against diversity initiatives within the agency, creating confusion and concern among veterans and advocates.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from other major U.S. carriers, accounting for over 86% of the industry's profits last year. Analysts suggest their success stems from strong networks and a focus on premium and international travel, which provides a buffer against a competitive domestic market where airfares are falling. Both airlines have pointed to robust revenue from premium cabins and loyalty programs, even as they trim overall capacity plans. This strategy allows them to maintain stronger financial performance compared to competitors focused more on price-sensitive domestic travelers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly enacted "no tax on tips" provision is causing confusion regarding its application and who qualifies for the benefit. The measure is not a complete tax elimination but rather a deduction of up to $25,000, available from 2025 through 2028, which phases out for higher earners. Crucially, the IRS still needs to clarify which specific occupations are eligible, with guidance expected in October. Tax professionals note uncertainty also exists around how the deduction interacts with reporting requirements for cash tips and income from gig economy platforms, which have their own reporting thresholds.

          <p>The UK government's spending on hotels to house asylum seekers decreased by nearly a third in the last fiscal year, falling from £3 billion to £2.1 billion. According to Home Office accounts, the savings were primarily achieved by moving asylum seekers into cheaper accommodations, such as shared housing, and by renegotiating contracts. The average nightly cost per person dropped significantly due to these measures, including increased room sharing in the remaining hotels. However, an expert from the Migration Observatory warned that a recent surge in small boat crossings could increase reliance on hotels again in the near future.</p>

The author points to historically low approval ratings and the collapse of Barack Obama's winning coalition as evidence of this decline. The recent primary win of Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, in the New York City mayoral race is presented as a case study of the party's move toward radical politics that alienate mainstream voters.

          <p>Recent deadly violence in Syria's Sweida province highlights a fundamental policy disagreement between the United States and Israel regarding Syria's future. The U.S. has advocated for a strong, centralized government under new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, while Israel remains distrustful of his jihadist past and has supported regional autonomy for minority groups like the Druze. This divergence may have inadvertently fueled the conflict, as Sharaa's forces moved to assert control over the Druze stronghold, leading to sectarian clashes and a subsequent Israeli bombardment of Damascus, complicating diplomatic efforts in the volatile region.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation found that TikTok's platform made hundreds of videos promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery easily accessible to an account registered for a 15-year-old user. This occurred despite TikTok's own community guidelines that restrict such content for users under 18. The investigation revealed that after interacting with a few such videos, the platform's algorithm began recommending more content promoting restrictive diets, unhealthy body image, and elective surgeries. TikTok responded by stating the findings were based on a limited sample and do not reflect the experience of most users.</p>

          <p>Severe monsoon rains have caused deadly flooding in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, killing at least 63 people over two days. The country's meteorological department reports that rainfall this month has been 82% above average nationwide and 124% above average in Punjab, leading to flash floods and rising river levels. Authorities have issued warnings, advising against travel in affected areas due to the risk of landslides. With nearly 200 deaths reported across Pakistan since late June, the National Disaster Management Authority is forecasting more heavy rain spells in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old woman from Northamptonshire, England, discovered she had a brain tumor after a routine eye test at an optician. Elizabeth Craig had noticed declining vision in one eye, and the optician's referral led to an MRI scan that revealed a meningioma pressing on her optic nerve. During follow-up testing for the brain tumor just four months later, doctors discovered a suspicious nodule in her breast, which was diagnosed as breast cancer. Now recovering after successful treatment for both conditions, she is raising awareness about how routine health checks can lead to lifesaving discoveries.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish rap trio Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their recent Glastonbury performance. The investigation was launched over comments made on stage, which the band called an act of "political policing intimidation." After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police concluded there was "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any offence." The group has recently faced controversy for their pro-Palestinian stance and comments made regarding a band member's upcoming court case on an unrelated charge.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing 'Schedule G,' a new classification for federal employees in policy-related roles, making them at-will political appointees. These non-career employees will be expected to leave with changing administrations, a move the White House claims will streamline appointments and dismantle the "deep state." Critics, however, argue this is another attempt to politicize the nonpartisan civil service, similar to the controversial 'Schedule F' classification. The action aligns with conservative plans to reshape the federal workforce by replacing career officials with appointees more loyal to the president's agenda.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and be subject to a nighttime curfew. The restrictions were imposed over fears he might flee the country while standing trial for allegedly plotting a coup to stay in power after his 2022 election loss. The judge also banned him from social media and from communicating with his son and foreign diplomats. The decision follows police raids on his properties and comes amid heightened political tensions, with Bolsonaro's lawyers expressing outrage at what they call a baseless and persecutory case.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a bill, demanded by President Trump, that claws back approximately $9 billion in federal funding. The package, which passed on a near party-line vote, rescinds about $8 billion meant for foreign assistance programs and $1.1 billion budgeted for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The vote was briefly delayed by procedural maneuvers from Democrats attempting to force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The bill, already approved by the Senate, now goes to the president's desk to be signed into law.</p>

          <p>Ari Aster's new film "Eddington" is a neo-Western thriller set during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, exploring themes of misinformation, paranoia, and outrage fueled by online life. The movie portrays a small New Mexico town where residents, isolated and immersed in their screens, become consumed by conspiracy theories and digital personas, leading to real-world violence. The review praises the film's cynical but eerily accurate depiction of how the internet dominated and distorted reality during a period of social isolation. It captures the dread and confusion of a community that has lost its grip on logic.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is actively seeking to reshape the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the government's primary disaster-response body. The president has previously floated the idea of eliminating the agency entirely, aiming to shift more responsibility for disaster relief back to individual states. While plans to dismantle FEMA appear to be shelved for now, a special council is expected to release recommendations for overhauling the agency. Experts caution that reducing FEMA's role could heavily burden states, which often rely on federal resources and staff to manage the increasingly costly and frequent natural disasters.</p>

          <p>The election of a new judge to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court was recently derailed, reportedly due to a targeted social media campaign from far-right organizations. The candidate, respected law professor Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, faced resistance from conservative politicians after online platforms spread defamatory and false information about her, painting her as a radical extremist. An analysis by a political consultancy confirmed a coordinated campaign was launched to prevent her election. The incident has raised serious concerns about the influence of manipulative online media on Germany's core democratic and judicial processes.</p>
