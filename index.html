          <h2>Argentina Aims to Boost Copper Production Amid Global Demand Surge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 01:25:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentina's President Milei is pushing to increase copper production to capitalize on rising global demand fueled by electrification and renewable energy. Milei's administration introduced the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI) to attract large-scale investors with tax and trade benefits. Copper projects alone represent an estimated $16 billion of the $30 billion sought by 20 projects under RIGI. According to ICMM, Argentina is considered a very exciting new copper story with the potential significance of BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project being extraordinary, and comparable to Western Australia's impact on iron ore. This project represents a $47 billion opportunity for the Argentine economy through 2040 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys 24-20 in a season-opening game that included a 65-minute lightning delay. Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected early for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, leading to immediate consequences as the Cowboys scored on their first possession. Jalen Hurts rushed for two touchdowns, and Saquon Barkley added another, while Javonte Williams scored two touchdowns for the Cowboys. The Eagles raised their 2024 championship banner in the locker room before the game, per coach Nick Sirianni's wishes, and ultimately secured the win after a late defensive stop, showcasing resilience and discipline.</p>

          <p>Adm Sir Tony Radakin, the outgoing head of the British armed forces, stated that the UK's national security is secure for the next few years. He bases his optimism on the UK's status as a nuclear power and a NATO member, describing NATO as the "biggest and strongest gun club ever." Radakin praised former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his ministers for their response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He also urged skepticism against arguments that a new non-NATO "axis" was forming, emphasizing the lack of historical trust and mutual support for war fighting among those nations.</p>

Trump mentioned that Tim Cook would be in "pretty good shape" due to Apple's commitment to spend an additional $100 billion on domestic manufacturing. The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, with major companies like TSMC and Samsung Electronics committing billions to build plants in the U.S. Tech leaders praised Trump's pro-business and AI stances during a White House dinner.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow the president to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), after lower courts ruled he lacks the authority to remove members of independent agencies without cause. The Justice Department contends that the FTC and other executive branch agencies are under Trump’s control and that the president has the power to remove commissioners without cause. This case could lead the Supreme Court to reconsider a 1935 decision, Humphrey’s Executor, which stated presidents cannot fire independent board members without cause. The FTC is a regulator that enforces consumer protection measures and antitrust legislation.</p>

          <p>Bidders seeking to acquire a stake in Starbucks' China operations have submitted offers valuing the business at around US$5 billion. This potential deal would be one of the most significant China unit divestments by a global consumer company in recent years. The offers value Starbucks China at about 10 times its expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of US$400 million to US$500 million in 2025. The sale comes as Starbucks faces sluggish growth and increased competition from local brands in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Mark S Zuckerberg, a US lawyer with the same name as the Facebook founder, is suing Meta, Facebook's parent company, for repeatedly suspending his account. He claims the platform falsely accuses him of "impersonating a celebrity," leading to thousands of dollars in lost business. The Indiana bankruptcy attorney says his account has been disabled five times in eight years. Meta has since reinstated the lawyer's account, attributing the suspensions to an error, and is taking steps to prevent future occurrences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has reached an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history. Data analysis reveals that potential winnings vary significantly depending on the state due to differing tax laws. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to take home more after federal taxes. In contrast, states with higher taxes, such as New York and Minnesota, result in lower after-tax payouts. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>President Trump is planning to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War via an executive order. The change would revert the department to its historical name, which it held until after World War II. The White House says the name "Department of War" will serve as a "secondary title" for the Department of Defense. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared to acknowledge the change on social media. This decision would mark a significant shift in the department's branding.</p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* criticizes President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War, calling it an exercise in political performance art. The author argues that the change reflects a fascination with projecting toughness and a disregard for the historical reasons behind the current name. The Department of Defense was established in 1947 to reflect a broader understanding of national security beyond traditional warfare. The author notes that many other countries, including China and Russia, use the term "defense" for their military organizations.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck Afghanistan's remote south-eastern region on Thursday night, marking the third quake in six days. The death toll from Sunday's quake has risen to 1,368, with 2,180 others injured. The rough and mountainous terrain is hampering rescue efforts, with helicopters primarily used for access. The Taliban government has appealed for international assistance, and the UN and UK have pledged aid. Afghanistan is highly prone to earthquakes due to its location on several fault lines.</p>

He announced the US will designate two of Ecuador's largest criminal gangs, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations. His comments follow a recent US military strike on a boat in the Caribbean Sea, which reportedly killed 11 drug-traffickers. Rubio also announced that Washington would issue $13.5m in security aid and $6m in drone technology to help Ecuador combat drug trafficking.</p>
