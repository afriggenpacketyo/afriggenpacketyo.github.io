          <p>A federal judge dismissed the criminal corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The dismissal was "with prejudice," preventing the Department of Justice from refiling charges based on the same evidence.  Judge Dale Ho cited concerns that a dismissal without prejudice would create the perception of Adams being beholden to the federal government over his constituents. This decision concludes a case initiated during the Trump administration.</p>
