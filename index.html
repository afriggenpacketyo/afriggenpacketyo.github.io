          <p>Vice President JD Vance has solidified his position as a central figure in the Trump administration, recently playing a pivotal role in navigating a major tax and spending bill through Congress. By engaging with both conservative and moderate holdouts in the Senate and House, Vance helped secure the necessary votes, casting several tie-breakers himself. This involvement extends to foreign policy, where he has defended the administration's actions regarding Iran and Yemen. His active role across domestic and foreign policy highlights his influence and positions him as a potential successor to Trump.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists and hairstylists are warning against the common practice of going to bed with wet hair, citing several health and cosmetic reasons. When wet, hair is more fragile and susceptible to breakage from friction against a pillowcase. More importantly, a damp scalp creates a warm, humid environment that is an ideal breeding ground for fungi and bacteria. This can lead to scalp conditions like dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, or folliculitis, and the moisture transferred to the pillowcase can also contribute to facial acne or other skin irritations.</p>

          <p>A new appointee to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has a long history of arguing for a debunked link between vaccines and autism, raising concerns in the scientific community. Registered nurse Vicky Pebsworth, one of several new members chosen by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been a prominent figure in the anti-vaccine movement for decades. Her appointment comes after the previous committee was dismissed, and critics fear it signals a shift toward ideology over established science on a panel responsible for critical public health recommendations, as seen in a recent vote against thimerosal-containing flu shots.</p>

          <p>An author based in Tehran describes a significant shift in public sentiment within Iran following recent Israeli attacks. While Iranians hold diverse political views, the strikes on civilian areas have fostered a unifying sense of patriotism and resentment against foreign intervention. The author notes that the perceived double standards and tacit support from Western nations have shattered any remaining trust, even among those critical of the Iranian government. This has led to a growing anger and, for some, a newfound belief that developing a nuclear weapon is the only reliable deterrent against foreign aggression.</p>

          <p>Credit scoring giant FICO has announced that it will begin incorporating data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services into some of its credit scores this fall. This change reflects the growing popularity of installment payment plans offered by companies like Affirm and Klarna. For consumers, this means that on-time payments could help build their credit history, while missed payments could negatively impact their scores. Lenders have sought this data to gain a more complete financial picture of borrowers, potentially preventing them from offering more credit than a person can afford to repay.</p>

          <p>Democrats are framing President Trump's recently passed tax-and-spending legislation as a key issue for the 2026 midterm elections, focusing on its nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries labeled the bill an "all-out assault on the health care of the American people," a message Democrats hope will resonate with voters. While Republicans promote the bill as a catalyst for economic growth, polling indicates more public opposition than support. The tangible impact of Medicaid cuts could make health care a salient and potent issue for Democrats in their campaign to win back the House.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to host a UFC fight on the White House grounds is being analyzed as more than just entertainment, but as a form of "authoritarian theatre." This article argues the event represents the culmination of a long-standing partnership between Trump and the UFC, which has helped shape his strongman political image. The spectacle leverages the UFC's culture of machismo and defiance to reinforce a political brand that celebrates confrontational politics. Critics draw parallels to historical authoritarian regimes that used sports to project nationalist strength, viewing this as a concerning blend of entertainment and political power.</p>

The project spans approximately 60,000 square meters and features solar panels that rise and fall with the tide. This installation, combined with a similar project launched in May, is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. The proximity to the ocean water also naturally cools the panels, boosting their energy generation efficiency by up to 8 percent.</p>

          <h2>UK Pride Events, Including London's, Face Uncertain Future Amid Funding Shortfalls</h2>

          <p>Despite attracting over a million people, Pride in London and similar LGBTQ+ events across the UK are facing significant financial pressure due to a drop in corporate sponsorships and volunteer numbers. A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network revealed that a majority of Prides have seen reduced funding, forcing some to cancel, scale back, or charge for previously free events. Organizers attribute the decline to a pullback in corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, particularly from US-based companies. This financial instability threatens the future of these vital community celebrations and protests.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify "Genetic Switch" for Organ Regeneration in Mice</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by identifying a "genetic switch" that allowed for the complete restoration of damaged ear tissue in mice. The study, published in the journal Science, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating this disabled genetic pathway, the scientists were able to regrow lost tissues, including cartilage. While human application is still a distant goal, the discovery offers hope that similar mechanisms might be present for regenerating other organs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their most lopsided loss in Dodger Stadium history, falling 18-1 to the Houston Astros in a Fourth of July rout. Astros veterans Jose Altuve and Christian Walker, both longtime antagonists for Dodgers fans, led the offensive explosion. Altuve hit two home runs and had five RBIs, while Walker added a home run and four RBIs. The game spiraled out of control for the Dodgers in the sixth inning, when they surrendered ten runs, the most they have allowed in a single inning since 1999, stunning the sold-out home crowd.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Brazilian winger Estevão Willian gave Chelsea fans an exciting preview of his talent by scoring a brilliant goal for his current club, Palmeiras, against the Blues in a Club World Cup quarter-final. Although a late own goal secured a 2-1 victory for Chelsea, Estevão's performance was the main talking point. The highly-touted teenager, who will join Chelsea next season in a deal worth up to £52m, showcased the direct running and skill that made him a top transfer target. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca praised him as a "huge talent" who will be an important player for the club's future.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it issued a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire proposal mediated by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework, which reportedly includes a two-month truce. President Trump commented on the development with optimism, suggesting a deal could be reached within the next week. However, Hamas is reportedly still insisting on guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war, which remain significant hurdles in the ongoing diplomatic efforts to halt the conflict.</p>

          <p>A 78-year-old patient facing open-heart surgery used an AI-powered Google search to find a less invasive alternative, leading him to an innovative robotic procedure at Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center. The robotic surgery, which involves a small incision between the ribs, allowed for a much faster recovery compared to the traditional method. While the patient's experience was positive, his surgeon cautions that AI can be unreliable and should not replace professional medical advice. The case highlights the growing role of AI in healthcare, both as a tool for patients and as a technology being adopted by providers for diagnostics and administrative tasks.</p>

The award was presented during Modi's two-day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties with the region. The visit highlighted the deep historical connections between the two countries, rooted in the 19th-century migration of Indian indentured laborers. As part of the visit, Modi also announced that sixth-generation citizens of Indian origin in the nation would now be eligible for Overseas Citizen of India cards.</p>
