          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a prolonged "vote-a-rama" on a major legislative package central to President Trump's second-term agenda. The bill, which passed the House last month, combines tax cuts with increased spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. Democrats are using the session to force votes on controversial amendments, while Republican leadership works to secure enough support for final passage ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the legislation would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Iowa has become the first state to remove gender identity from its civil rights code, a law that took effect Tuesday. This change eliminates legal protections for transgender and nonbinary individuals against discrimination in areas like housing and employment. The new law also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and prevents changes to sex designations on birth certificates. This legislative move aligns with a broader trend in Republican-led states and has been met with protests and concern from LGBTQ+ advocates about increased vulnerability and discrimination.</p>

          <p>As the Senate vote on his signature legislative bill continues, President Trump issued a stark warning, claiming that failure to pass it would result in a massive tax increase. The bill includes what the CBO calculates as $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, increased border security funding, and $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. The president also publicly criticized Elon Musk for his opposition to the bill, highlighting a rift between the former allies. Republican leaders are navigating a narrow margin for passage, with at least two GOP senators indicating their opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new, highly remote immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, informally dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The White House is promoting the site's isolation and the presence of dangerous wildlife as a key deterrent for potential escapees and as a symbol of its harsh immigration policies. The facility, which can hold 5,000 detainees, has drawn criticism from immigrant advocates and Native American leaders over its location and the cruel message it sends. The administration hopes the inhospitable environment will underscore the severe repercussions for violating U.S. immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in 2022, has agreed to plead guilty to all charges in a deal to avoid the death penalty.

The plea deal comes just weeks before his trial was scheduled to begin. While prosecutors stated the agreement was made to ensure a conviction and spare families from decades of appeals, the family of victim Kaylee Goncalves expressed frustration with the deal.</p>

          <p>A gruesome surge of cartel violence in CuliacÃ¡n, the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state, has resulted in 20 deaths in less than 24 hours. Authorities reported finding four decapitated bodies hanging from a highway bridge, with their heads left in a nearby bag. Sixteen other bodies with gunshot wounds were discovered in a van on the same highway. The violence is attributed to an ongoing, bloody war for control between two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, Los Chapitos and La Mayiza. The conflict has turned the city into an epicenter of violence, with daily killings and a pervasive sense of fear.</p>

Another significant blaze, the Lake fire, is burning near Silverwood Lake in San Bernardino County.

          <p>Figuring out how much to save for retirement is a complex question with no single answer, posing a challenge for UK government pension policy. A recent analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown examined various adequacy measures, including fixed income targets and relative measures based on pre-retirement earnings. The research found that simple monetary benchmarks might not be suitable for higher earners, potentially giving them a false sense of security. Conversely, these high targets could discourage lower earners from saving at all, highlighting the difficulty in setting a one-size-fits-all national retirement savings strategy.

The parade will likely feature new fifth-generation fighter jets, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and advanced carrier-based aircraft, much of which was developed with a potential Taiwan conflict in mind.

This commentary highlights recent independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on Frantz Fanon that are finally beginning to address this historical blind spot. These films, however, still struggle for mainstream recognition and are often marginalized at major festivals like Cannes. The article argues that while French filmmakers and audiences are ready to confront this past, the industry itself has been slow to make space for these crucial narratives.</p>

According to Goldman Sachs, this trend is also driven by growing investor concerns over the sustainability of U.S. government debt and fading confidence in American exceptionalism.

          <p>Four employees of the Turkish satirical magazine LeMan have been arrested for publishing a cartoon that authorities allege depicts the Prophet Muhammad, an act forbidden in Islam. Turkey's interior minister condemned the drawing as "shameless," and the justice minister announced an investigation for "publicly insulting religious values." The magazine has denied that the cartoon depicts the prophet, stating it was misinterpreted and was intended to portray a Muslim killed by Israel. The editor-in-chief expressed concern over the backlash, drawing parallels to the 2015 attack on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo.</p>

Speaking at a conference, panelists noted that many prominent AI models are English-based, failing to capture linguistic and cultural nuances. They suggest that emerging economies, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, can leverage open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing to build their own systems. This approach would democratize AI, foster local talent, and ensure the technology's benefits are not concentrated in just a few countries.</p>

The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, contrasting with the official government PMI which showed a third consecutive month of contraction. Analysts attribute the divergence to the private survey's focus on smaller, export-focused firms and its timing, which may have captured a delayed positive response to a U.S.-China tariff reduction. However, new export orders continued to decline and employment remained weak, indicating potential headwinds for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspect, identified as 20-year-old Wess Roley, allegedly started a wildfire to lure the firefighters to a remote area before opening fire on them with a shotgun. Roley was later found dead at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The deceased have been identified as veteran firefighters Battalion Chief Frank Harwood and Battalion Chief John Morrison. The motive for the attack remains unknown, leaving the local community and fire department in shock and mourning.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is facing a significant internal rebellion over proposed changes to the welfare system, particularly the tightening of eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) disability benefit. Despite having a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is engaged in a major persuasion effort to win over dozens of his own MPs who are concerned about the reforms. Critics within the party argue the changes are being driven by fiscal targets rather than the needs of disabled people. The government maintains the reforms are essential for the long-term stability of the welfare state.</p>

          <p>A 56-year-old detention officer in Cherokee County, North Carolina, was shot and killed after a federal inmate he was escorting to a medical facility managed to seize his weapon. The inmate, identified as Kelvin Simmons, was being treated for foot pain when a scuffle broke out, leading to the fatal shooting of Officer Francisco Flattes. Simmons then allegedly carjacked a vehicle and fled but was later apprehended. The inmate, who was already facing bank robbery charges and a previous escape attempt, will now be charged with first-degree murder in the officer's death.</p>
