          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. unexpectedly rose by 2% in July, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. This increase, reported by the National Association of Realtors, coincides with a record-high housing inventory level since May 2020, which is helping to moderate price growth. The median home price saw a minimal 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point where affordability improves. The rise in all-cash buyers to 31% of transactions indicates that higher mortgage rates continue to influence market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

The company, part of Sanjeev Gupta's metals empire, faced a winding-up order from creditors over hundreds of millions in debt. To prevent immediate closure and mass layoffs, the government has stepped in to cover wages and operational costs. This intervention provides a temporary lifeline while officials and appointed managers from Teneo seek a viable buyer to secure the plant's long-term future.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that a recent massive Russian assault demonstrates that Vladimir Putin has no genuine interest in pursuing peace. The overnight attack involved over 600 missiles and drones, targeting energy infrastructure, civilian homes, and an American-owned electronics factory, resulting in at least one death and 15 injuries. Zelenskyy criticized the strike's timing, coming shortly after diplomatic efforts by President Trump to broker a ceasefire. He emphasized the need for continued international pressure, including strong sanctions and tariffs, to compel Moscow toward meaningful negotiations and end the conflict.</p>

This move aligns Apple with other major streaming platforms like Netflix and Peacock, which have also recently raised prices to fund new content and improve profitability.

          <p>Jeffrey Schmid, President of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, has signaled hesitation about a potential interest rate cut in September, challenging strong market expectations. Speaking from the Jackson Hole symposium, Schmid argued that more definitive data is needed to justify a policy change, as inflation remains a concern. He stated that the inflation rate is likely closer to 3% than the Fed's 2% target, suggesting that the central bank's work is not yet complete. His comments introduce uncertainty into the Federal Open Market Committee's upcoming decision amid pressure from the White House for lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

While the monetary disgorgement was thrown out, the court upheld the non-monetary injunctive relief designed to curb the Trump Organization's business practices. The original lawsuit, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, can be appealed to a higher court.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Dobson, a child psychologist who became a prominent and influential figure in conservative American politics, has passed away at the age of 89. He founded the Christian ministry Focus on the Family in 1977, using its platform and his popular radio show to advocate against abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Dobson was a key architect in mobilizing religious conservatives as a political force, advising White House panels and serving on President Trump's Evangelical Executive Advisory Board. His work significantly shaped the intersection of faith and politics in the United States for several decades.</p>

While the number of asylum applications reached a record high of 111,000 in the year to June, officials have made significant progress in reducing the massive backlog of claims. However, the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has risen slightly since the new government took power, and small boat arrivals are up 38% from the previous year.

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances challenges the long-held belief that hunting wolves effectively reduces livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers analyzed data from Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington and found that public wolf hunting had a negligible impact on livestock depredation. According to the findings, approximately 14 wolves would need to be killed to save a single cow, suggesting it is not an efficient management tool for this purpose. The study's authors hope the research will encourage a shift towards more effective non-lethal strategies to mitigate human-wildlife conflict, rather than fueling political debates over hunting.</p>

          <p>This article posits that President Trump's primary motivation in negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine war is his desire to win a Nobel Peace Prize. This ambition, the author argues, prevents him from simply "selling out" Ukraine to Russia, as any deal perceived as a capitulation would not receive the necessary international acclaim. To achieve his goal, Trump requires the willing cooperation of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders, giving them more leverage than is often assumed. The analysis concludes that this personal objective, rather than a coherent geopolitical strategy, dictates the administration's approach to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Frank Caprio, the former Providence Municipal Court judge who became an internet sensation for his empathetic and humorous approach to minor offenses, has passed away at 88 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. His television show, "Caught in Providence," and viral social media clips showcased his tendency to consider people's personal circumstances, earning him millions of admirers worldwide. Caprio attributed his deep empathy to his own upbringing in poverty, often stating his father taught him to imagine himself in the shoes of those appearing before him. He served on the bench from 1985 to 2023.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has renewed his call for the release of Tina Peters, a former Colorado election clerk imprisoned for her role in a 2020 election data breach. In a social media post, Trump referred to Peters as a "brave and innocent Patriot" and threatened to take "harsh measures" if she is not freed. Peters was convicted on seven counts, including felonies, for allowing an unauthorized person to access county voting equipment, which led to sensitive data being published online. The prosecuting district attorney noted that Peters cost taxpayers over a million dollars and was convicted by a jury of her peers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid high interest rates on other forms of debt, financial experts suggest that a home equity loan can be a strategic way for homeowners to save money. This type of loan is particularly effective for consolidating high-interest credit card debt, allowing borrowers to switch from high variable rates to a lower fixed rate. Another beneficial use is financing home improvements that increase the property's value, as the interest paid may be tax-deductible. Experts advise that these loans are best suited for those with stable income and significant equity, and caution against using them for luxury spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who are serving life sentences for the 1989 murders of their parents, are scheduled for parole hearings this week. Their case has gained renewed attention following a resentencing recommendation prompted by new evidence supporting their long-standing claims of severe sexual abuse by their father. Because they were under 26 at the time of the crime, they are eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. The parole board's decision, expected shortly after each hearing, will be subject to review by Governor Gavin Newsom, who has pledged to make a final determination by Labor Day.</p>

Founded in 2014 by a former teacher, the Rangatungi United Women's Football Academy has overcome social and financial barriers to develop top-tier talent. Several of its players were key members of the senior and under-20 national squads that recently qualified for their respective Asian Cups for the first time. The academy's success is helping to change conservative attitudes towards girls playing sports and is providing a pathway for young women to achieve national recognition.</p>

          <p>Tesco has raised the price of its well-known meal deal, reflecting the ongoing pressure of food price inflation in the UK. For customers with a Clubcard, the price of a main, snack, and drink has increased from £3.60 to £3.85, while the price for non-members has risen to £4.25. This follows a similar move by competitor Sainsbury's and highlights a broader trend where supermarkets are increasingly using loyalty programs to offer differentiated pricing. The meal deal, which had been priced at £3 for a decade until 2022, serves as a visible indicator of rising costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has given final approval for the construction of a settlement project in an area known as E1, a move long opposed by Palestinians and the international community. Critics argue that building in this location, east of Jerusalem, would effectively divide the occupied West Bank, severing the connection between its northern and southern regions and undermining the viability of a future Palestinian state. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich framed the decision as a direct response to countries that have recently moved to recognize Palestinian statehood.

          <p>Biographer and professor Walter Isaacson has criticized President Trump's recent dealings with tech giants Intel and Nvidia, describing the approach as a "scattershot method of crony capitalism." He argued that when state capitalism favors specific companies that "pay tribute to the leader," it can lead to a corrupt and messy economic environment that ultimately fails to achieve its goals, such as reviving American manufacturing. Isaacson's comments were made in response to the administration's push for a stake in Intel and recent agreements requiring Nvidia and AMD to pay the government a percentage of their China revenues.

Different groups of staff, including engineers, station staff, and train operators, will walk out at different times, causing significant disruption for commuters. Transport for London (TfL) has urged the union to accept its "fair, affordable pay offer" and continue negotiations, but the RMT claims management has been dismissive.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a five-year fixed mortgage in the UK has dropped to 4.99%, falling below the 5% threshold for the first time since May 2023. This marks a symbolic turning point in the borrowing market, signaling increased competition among lenders and offering some relief to homebuyers and those looking to remortgage. The average two-year fixed rate also continued its decline, reaching 4.97%. While the drop provides a modest boost to affordability, analysts suggest that persistent inflation may limit further significant rate cuts in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to financial experts, the single most crucial action Americans should take with their 401(k) is to contribute enough to receive the full employer match. Failing to do so is equivalent to leaving "free money" on the table, as the employer's contribution provides an immediate and risk-free return on investment. Despite this clear benefit, a recent Vanguard report found that nearly one in five eligible workers does not take full advantage of this feature, often due to tight personal budgets. Experts stress that capturing the full match should be the primary retirement savings goal. (not investment advice)</p>
