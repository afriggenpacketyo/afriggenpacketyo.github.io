            <p>Kenan Malik discusses Donald Trump's attempts to impose political authority over academic life, specifically his demands for Harvard to reorganize its governance and hire faculty to ensure 'viewpoint diversity.' The author argues that while viewpoint diversity is important, Trump's approach is a form of identity politics that could undermine scholarly objectivity and freedom of expression. He suggests that fostering genuine intellectual engagement requires a rethinking of social and political engagement, celebrating the capacity to consider different perspectives rather than institutionalizing political identities. The article highlights the complexities of achieving viewpoint diversity without sacrificing academic freedom and objectivity.</p>

            <p>Don Pettit, the oldest serving U.S. astronaut, returned to Earth on his 70th birthday along with Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner. The Soyuz MS-26 capsule landed in Kazakhstan after a 220-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS), during which they orbited Earth 3,520 times. Pettit has now spent a total of 590 days in space over his four missions, though the record for the oldest person to fly in orbit remains with John Glenn, who flew on a NASA mission at age 77.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba asserted that Japan will not include security issues in tariff talks with the United States, despite President Trump's calls for increased defense burden-sharing. Ishiba emphasized that security and trade should be addressed separately, pledging to review Japan's automobile regulations to advance negotiations. He also highlighted the importance of balancing affordable products with the protection of domestic producers, and reiterated Japan's commitment to free trade and cooperation with ASEAN and the EU amid concerns over the U.S.-China trade situation.</p>

            <p>A series of espionage cases involving individuals close to Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has raised concerns about vulnerabilities in the island's counter-intelligence systems. Investigations and detentions of aides to senior DPP politicians for allegedly leaking classified information to mainland Chinese intelligence have sparked alarm. These high-level breaches suggest that Beijing's efforts to cultivate spy networks in Taiwan are intensifying, potentially undermining the Lai Ching-te administration and raising questions about public trust.</p>
