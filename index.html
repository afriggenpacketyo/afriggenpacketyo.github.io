          <p>Elon Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), described his first 100 days in Washington as "very intense," acknowledging obstacles from "entrenched interests" hindering progress. While claiming a daily savings rate of $1.6 billion, Musk admitted that achieving the $1 trillion cost-cutting goal is proving difficult. He attributed the challenges to bureaucratic inertia and resistance to change within the federal government. Musk emphasized the need for political will in Congress to overcome these obstacles and achieve significant cost reductions. </p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board asserts that President Trump's first 100 days in his second term have inflicted significant damage on American democracy, potentially altering the character of American government. The board criticizes Trump's attempts to create a presidency unbound by Congress or the courts, warning of future presidents pursuing similarly autocratic approaches. It calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions while acknowledging the legitimacy of his presidency and the legality of some of his policies.

While OpenAI's quick action is commendable, the controversy highlights the importance of ensuring AI models provide accurate information rather than simply pleasing responses.

The potential need for public investment in infrastructure to support the event at Turnberry raises concerns about government involvement benefiting Trump's private business.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has predicted growth of just 0.5 percent, cutting its previous forecast in half, and decided against another hike in interest rates. The Bank of Japan said that it expects the Japanese economy to grow 0.5 percent in the fiscal year that started on April 1. This is a sharp downgrade from the 1.1 percent the central bank had forecast in January. Kazuo Ueda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, cited the imposition of an “unprecedented level” of tariffs by the United States as a factor.</p>

          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a historic pottery firm based in Burslem, has ceased trading after more than 100 years, resulting in the loss of 57 jobs. The company's directors announced the voluntary liquidation, citing rising costs and falling sales, with energy costs significantly impacting their financial stability. The closure marks another blow to Stoke-on-Trent's pottery industry, which has seen several firms collapse in recent years. Industry leaders are calling for government support to address challenges such as carbon taxes and competition from cheaper imports.</p>

After Charli XCX invited her to collaborate on a remix from her Brat album, Lorde was inspired by the positive response to their shared vulnerability. This encouraged her to refine her musical direction and reconnect with her younger self. Lorde's lead single, "What Was That," is a taste of the album, which aims to return to her core sound after experimenting with a different style in her previous album, Solar Power.</p>

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's acquittal of Democratic Party presidential frontrunner Lee Jae-myung on charges of election law violation, which casts doubt on his eligibility to run.</p>

          <p>China has passed a new private sector law aimed at curbing "profit-driven" enforcement that unfairly targets non-state businesses. The law seeks to address long-standing complaints about cross-regional enforcement and includes accountability measures for officials. Analysts believe the law's key focus is regulating administrative acts and limiting administrative powers, giving private businesses greater recourse to defend their interests. The enactment of the law is seen as a critical step in reassuring private entrepreneurs amidst increasing economic challenges.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) held its policy rate steady at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing concerns about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on the country's economic outlook. While inflation remains above the BOJ's 2% target, the central bank acknowledged that Japan's growth is likely to moderate due to a slowdown in other economies and declining domestic corporate profits. The BOJ indicated it would continue to raise rates if economic and price forecasts are realized, but cautioned that drastic changes to tariff policies could affect its monetary policy outlook.</p>

India accuses Pakistan of supporting militants behind the attack, which Islamabad denies. Amidst rising tensions, India has closed its airspace to Pakistani aircraft and suspended key agreements, while Pakistan has retaliated with similar measures.</p>

National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir suggested arson could be a cause, and police arrested an individual for allegedly attempting to start a fire.

          <p>Emma Brockes observes Britain's current relationship with the White House and President Trump and concludes that appeasement has been ineffective. Despite efforts to curry favor, the UK may be relegated in trade talks, behind South Korea and Japan. This prompts a reflection on Britain's diplomatic approach and whether its attempts to humor Trump are worthwhile. The article also suggests that belligerence may be more effective than appeasement in dealing with Trump, citing instances where businesses have successfully pushed back against his policies. The piece questions the value of Britain's exceptionalism in navigating the relationship.</p>
