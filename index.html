          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its Prime Invitee Program, which allowed members to share free shipping benefits with individuals outside their household. The company has started notifying users that the program will end on October 1, 2025, with invited guests being informed directly by September 5. This change directs users towards the Amazon Family program, which requires all members to share the same primary residential address. The move coincides with reports of U.S. Prime signups for Prime Day falling short of targets, though Amazon maintains that overall membership growth remains strong globally.</p>

          <p>A former correctional officer, an ex-inmate, and his brother have been charged in South Carolina for operating a drug smuggling scheme across 14 state prisons. The trio allegedly mailed books laced with synthetic cannabinoids and Suboxone to inmates between March and June 2025. The investigation utilized evidence from inmate statements, recorded prison calls, and surveillance footage from the post office. Officials emphasized their commitment to combating contraband, which they state poses a significant danger to both inmates and staff.</p>

          <p>Salesforce's stock has underperformed this year, dropping 25% as the company faces challenges with slowing growth in its core customer relationship management market. Investors are looking for a clear strategy to reignite expansion, particularly through its AI-powered products like Agentforce, as the company prepares to report its quarterly earnings. While rival Oracle has benefited significantly from the AI boom, Salesforce has yet to demonstrate that its AI initiatives can substantially boost revenue. The company is also navigating pressure from activist investors who are pushing for improved profitability and a more effective growth plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Macy's reported second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street estimates, causing its stock to jump more than 10% in pre-market trading. The department store raised its full-year guidance, citing positive sales trends driven by store renovations and strong performance in key categories like denim and women's apparel. CEO Tony Spring noted that despite the impact of tariffs, the company is well-positioned to gain market share due to a resilient consumer and healthy inventory levels. The positive results mark a notable turnaround from the previous quarter when the company had slashed its outlook amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet's shares climbed 7% following a U.S. District Court ruling that spared Google from the most severe penalties in a major antitrust case. The Department of Justice had proposed breaking up the company, including divesting its Chrome browser, but the judge's decision rejected this measure. While Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, it can continue its lucrative arrangement to be the default search engine on Apple devices, though exclusive contracts are now barred. Analysts view the ruling as a significant victory for Google, removing a major overhang on the stock and reinforcing the durability of its core search business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Houston Astros pitcher Framber Valdez has publicly denied that he deliberately hit his catcher, César Salazar, during a game against the New York Yankees. The incident occurred shortly after Valdez gave up a grand slam, leading to speculation that he was frustrated with his teammate. Valdez explained that the errant pitch was the result of a miscommunication, or a "crossed up" sign, and not an intentional act of aggression. He stated that he apologized to Salazar in the dugout and that the two have since resolved the issue, emphasizing that it was simply an unfortunate part of the game.</p>

The plan requires the agreement of the current owners, including the Chinese owners of British Steel, with whom the Business Secretary is set to negotiate.

Following a doubles quarter-final loss at the US Open, Williams reflected on her journey, stating that her focus remains on singles and her love for the game is what keeps her grinding. While her dominance has waned, her presence on the court is a celebrated bonus for fans who have followed her since the 1990s. Williams's enduring career stands in contrast to her sister Serena's retirement, offering a unique final chapter for one of the sport's trailblazers.</p>

          <p>Families of the 346 victims of the two Boeing 737 Max crashes are making a final appeal for the company to face criminal prosecution. They are urging a federal judge to reject a non-prosecution agreement reached between Boeing and the Department of Justice, which would dismiss a felony fraud charge. The families argue that the agreement, which involves financial penalties and safety reforms, denies justice and allows the company to evade meaningful accountability for deceiving regulators. They are advocating for a public trial and hope the judge will deny the government's request to drop the charge, potentially appointing a special prosecutor instead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The depiction of children in art has transformed significantly throughout history, reflecting societal shifts in values, class structure, and the very concept of childhood. In early modern Europe, portraits of royal children were often used as tools for marriage politics, presenting them as idealized assets. As the bourgeoisie rose, they emulated this practice, while depictions of peasant children evolved from ridicule to symbols of piety. The modern, unburdened concept of childhood only emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, a change captured in art and later democratized by photography, which allowed for more spontaneous and personal portrayals.</p>

To widen its applicant pool, DHS has lowered the minimum age to 18 and is offering student loan forgiveness.
