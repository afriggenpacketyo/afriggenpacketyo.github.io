          <p>Verizon has entered a definitive commercial agreement with AST SpaceMobile to provide direct-to-cell phone satellite connectivity across the continental United States, starting next year. The partnership aims to eliminate cellular dead zones by leveraging Verizon's low-band spectrum with AST's space-based network, ensuring coverage for Verizon customers in remote areas. Following the announcement, AST SpaceMobile's stock surged significantly, reflecting investor confidence in the company's technology, which it claims is the first of its kind to operate directly with standard mobile devices.</p>

          <p>Despite a slight drop in interest rates, overall mortgage demand in the U.S. has weakened again. However, a growing number of borrowers are opting for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure lower initial payments, with the ARM share of applications rising to 9.5%. This trend highlights the affordability challenges in the current housing market, as buyers seek any available savings even if it involves taking on riskier loan products. The report from the Mortgage Bankers Association indicates that while purchase applications fell slightly, they remain higher than the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry is gaining strength over the central Atlantic Ocean and is projected to intensify into a hurricane by Thursday. The storm, the tenth of the 2025 season, is currently moving west-northwest and is forecast to pass near or north of the northern Leeward Islands by late Thursday or Friday. While not a direct threat to Florida, the National Hurricane Center has issued tropical storm watches for several Caribbean islands, warning of potential flash flooding and life-threatening surf conditions.

          <p>In the second quarter of 2025, real estate investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the U.S., the highest proportion in five years. While the total number of homes bought by investors decreased compared to last year, their market share grew due to an overall slowdown in home sales. The data shows that small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, continue to dominate the market, while large institutional investors have been net sellers for six consecutive quarters. This trend indicates investors are providing crucial liquidity and inventory to a weakened housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tax strategy known as qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) is being described as a significant, yet underutilized, benefit for retirees. The move allows individuals aged 70½ or older to directly transfer up to $108,000 from a pretax IRA to a charity, satisfying their required minimum distributions (RMDs) without increasing their adjusted gross income. This exclusion from income is more beneficial than a standard deduction, as it can help retirees avoid higher Medicare premiums. Financial experts recommend this as an effective way for philanthropic retirees to maximize their giving and tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's strategy of reducing the federal civil service through shutdowns and buyouts is a flawed approach to cutting government spending, according to this analysis. The article contends that the U.S. federal workforce is already smaller than that of other developed nations and that salary costs are a minor part of the overall budget. These deep, often arbitrary cuts compromise essential services, as seen with staff shortages at the National Weather Service and the IRS, and lead to a loss of experienced personnel.

This testimony contradicts the core of the indictment, which accuses Comey of lying to Congress about authorizing such leaks. This revelation suggests the case may be weaker than publicly perceived and could face significant challenges in court.</p>

          <h2>Government Shutdown Worsens Air Traffic Controller Shortage, Causing Flight Delays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 07:23:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is exacerbating a pre-existing shortage of air traffic controllers, leading to flight delays at airports nationwide. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has had to limit the number of aircraft in its airspace to maintain safety. Although nearly 11,000 controllers are required to work, they will not receive pay until the shutdown ends, raising concerns about potential sick-outs. Furthermore, funding for the Essential Air Service program, which subsidizes flights to rural communities, is at risk of running out, potentially isolating nearly 170 areas.</p>

          <p>Championship club Watford has fired head coach Paulo Pezzolano after only 10 games and has brought back former manager Javi Gracia. Pezzolano was the club's 12th manager since Gracia's first tenure ended in 2019, reflecting a period of significant instability. Despite recent improvements in results, the club's board opted for a change, expressing confidence that Gracia's experience and leadership will bring stability and a stronger connection with supporters. Gracia was a popular figure during his first spell, leading the team to its best-ever Premier League finish and an FA Cup final.</p>

          <p>Shares of major European car manufacturers, including BMW and Volkswagen, declined significantly following the European Commission's announcement of new protective measures for its steel industry. The plan involves hiking tariffs to 50% and slashing tariff-free import quotas by 47%, a move intended to shield European steel producers from foreign competition. The automotive industry has warned that these measures will lead to inflationary pressure and higher input costs. The market reaction reflects fears that the tariffs will harm the competitiveness of the already struggling auto sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown continues as Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked over the extension of enhanced health insurance subsidies from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Democrats insist on permanently extending the credits before reopening the government, as millions of Americans face massive premium hikes with open enrollment starting November 1. Republicans argue the issue can be addressed later, before the subsidies expire on December 31. Insurance commissioners warn that waiting will cause chaos and lead to hundreds of thousands of people becoming uninsured as insurers set higher rates.</p>

          <p>The UK's top prosecutor has stated that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially designating China as a national security threat. The prosecution required this designation to meet the legal standard for espionage under the Official Secrets Act, a precedent set in a recent case. Despite months of requests, government witness statements did not meet this threshold, leading to the charges being dropped. The revelation has sparked criticism over whether diplomatic caution undermined a critical national security prosecution.</p>

He recounts his personal struggles but also highlights how autistic traits like persistence and pattern recognition have been strengths in his career. The author draws parallels to the historical eugenics movement and the deaf community's concept of "deaf gain," insisting that neurodivergence is a valuable part of human diversity. He concludes that the world benefits from different ways of thinking and that conversations about eliminating autism are a dangerous debate.</p>
