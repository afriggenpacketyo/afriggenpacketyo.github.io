        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A personal finance article details the experience of a borrower whose federal student loan servicer was changed to a new company, Central Research Inc., without clear prior notification. This sudden transfer caused confusion and concern, particularly when the loans were placed in an administrative forbearance, pausing payments but potentially accruing interest. The article advises borrowers in similar situations to be cautious about making payments during the transition to avoid them getting lost and to monitor their credit reports for any errors. It highlights a broader issue of communication gaps within the student loan system.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a significant surge after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his purchase of approximately $1 billion worth of company shares. This move is widely interpreted by the market as a strong signal of his confidence in the electric vehicle maker's future, especially amidst recent sales declines and increasing competition. The purchase comes as shareholders prepare to vote on a new compensation package for Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire if the company meets a series of ambitious performance targets. The article notes this action may help reassure investors concerned about the company's trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal investigators report that the suspect arrested for the fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appeared to have an obsession with him based on his digital footprint. The FBI is investigating whether anyone was aware of the suspect's intentions beforehand, citing online chats he allegedly had about Kirk. DNA evidence found on the firearm and a screwdriver at the scene has also linked Robinson to the crime. The suspect was apprehended after his own father recognized him in photos released by law enforcement and persuaded him to surrender.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from reporting their earnings every quarter to a semiannual basis, a change that would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He argued that this shift would save money and encourage corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The proposal has reignited a debate on corporate transparency, with supporters of the current system arguing that quarterly reports provide investors with timely and crucial information. Critics of the idea suggest that less frequent reporting could lead to more market volatility and less accountability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has suspended Army Colonel Scott Stephens from his official duties pending an investigation into social media posts that appeared to celebrate the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The posts reportedly expressed comfort in Kirk's death, describing him as someone who spread hate and bigotry. This action follows a "zero tolerance" policy announced by the Pentagon for any military personnel mocking the killing. Stephens' suspension is the second such disciplinary action taken by the military, as an Army Reserves Major was also suspended for similar celebratory comments last week.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board, is generating significant controversy ahead of his confirmation vote. Critics are alarmed by his plan to take an unpaid leave of absence from his role as a White House economic adviser rather than resigning, raising concerns about the central bank's political independence. Miran's previous writings, which advocate for shortening Fed board members' terms and making them serve at the president's will, have further fueled debate. Democrats and watchdog groups argue his appointment could give the president undue influence over monetary policy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the public and political reaction to Charlie Kirk's murder highlights a severe deterioration of democratic norms and shared grief in the United States. The author contrasts the current climate of immediate blame and political weaponization with the national mourning that followed assassinations in the 1960s. The article criticizes President Trump for sowing fear and division rather than reassuring the country, arguing that Kirk's death is being used as a pretext to undermine free speech and foster fear. It concludes with a lament for the potential loss of American democracy itself.</p>

Paying a bill late can trigger hefty fees and penalty APRs, while allowing even a small balance to carry over from month to month allows interest to compound daily, causing debt to spiral. The article also emphasizes the costly error of not utilizing strategies like 0% balance transfers or debt consolidation loans, which can substantially lower interest payments.

          <p>An analysis using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark indicates that renewable energy sources, particularly onshore wind and utility-scale solar, are the cheapest forms of energy to produce. This holds true even before accounting for government subsidies like those in the Inflation Reduction Act. In contrast, fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, along with nuclear power, are more expensive to generate due to ongoing fuel and operational costs. While renewables have higher upfront capital costs, their low maintenance and free fuel source make them more cost-competitive over the lifespan of a project.</p>

Machar's opposition party accuses Kiir of systematically obstructing the peace agreement by dismissing its appointed officials without consultation.

          <p>Data from the Federal Reserve shows that U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from its Standing Repo Facility, a tool that acts as a backstop for funding shortages in the banking system. The borrowing occurred on a deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments and coincided with a large Treasury security settlement, creating temporary tightness in liquidity. Rates for overnight borrowing, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), had risen above the interest the Fed pays on bank reserves, indicating heightened demand for cash.

          <p>A car buyer shared their frustrating experience of being told a vehicle would cost $1,000 more if paid for with cash instead of through dealership financing. This seemingly counterintuitive practice occurs because dealerships often earn significant kickbacks and profits from arranging loans and marking up interest rates. For many dealerships, the financing deal is more lucrative than the sale of the car itself, leading them to incentivize financing and penalize cash buyers. While some consumers attempt to game the system by financing and immediately repaying the loan, they are warned to check for prepayment penalties.</p>

The administrators cited the high cost of maintaining the stores amidst rising rents as a key factor in the retailer's collapse. While there has been interest from potential buyers for some of the remaining 85 stores, the administrators stated it was no longer viable to continue trading the full remaining portfolio due to stock shortages and operating costs.</p>
