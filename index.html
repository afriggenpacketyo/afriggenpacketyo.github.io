            <p>A migrant died while attempting to cross the English Channel, prompting a police investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the death. The RNLI and Border Force responded to a medical emergency on a small boat, but a man was pronounced dead at the scene. This incident occurred amid a surge in Channel crossings this year, with over 9,000 people making the journey, a significant increase compared to previous years, highlighting the ongoing challenges and government efforts to combat people-smuggling across the Channel.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has placed new restrictions on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, regarding access to sensitive personal information at the Social Security Administration (SSA). The judge's preliminary injunction addresses concerns that DOGE's broad data access could violate Americans' privacy rights. The ruling prevents DOGE staffers from accessing Social Security databases containing personally identifiable information and directs them to delete any non-anonymized data in their possession, citing insufficient justification for the agency's unfettered access. This decision follows previous legal challenges and underscores ongoing scrutiny of DOGE's data practices within federal agencies.</p>

            <p>Maine Democrats are seeking to amend the state constitution to codify the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), which allows transgender athletes to participate in girls' sports. This move comes amid ongoing conflict with the Trump administration over transgender policies, including a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. While Democrats defend their stance by citing the MHRA and Title IX, Republicans are pushing to remove "gender identity" from the MHRA. A survey indicates that a majority of Maine residents believe sports participation should be based on biological sex.</p>

            <p>A large study published in Frontiers in Oncology suggests medical cannabis has significant potential in treating cancer symptoms and possibly fighting the disease itself. The analysis, reviewing over 10,000 studies, found strong support for cannabis in reducing inflammation, appetite loss, and nausea associated with cancer. Surprisingly, the study also indicated that cannabis might help fight cancer cells by killing them and preventing their spread. While some experts remain skeptical about cannabis's cancer-fighting abilities, the study's authors hope it will encourage reclassification of cannabis to facilitate further clinical research.</p>

            <p>The IRS is reportedly considering revoking Harvard's tax-exempt status amid Donald Trump's attacks on higher education. The US president said in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’ Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!” Several international students who have had their visas revoked in recent weeks have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing the government denied them due process when it suddenly took away their permission to be in the US.</p>

            <p>A Japanese bus driver with 29 years of service lost his retirement package worth $84,000 after being fired for stealing $7 from passenger fares. Kyoto City sacked the man, who was not named, after he was filmed by the security camera of his bus pilfering 1,000 yen ($7) in 2022. After he was denied his retirement money of more than 12 million yen ($84,000), the driver sued the city but lost the case. The Supreme Court delivered a final ruling in the city's favor, reinstating the original penalty.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' ticket prices have significantly increased, raising concerns about affordability for average families. The team's popularity, fueled by superstar signings, has led to a surge in ticket demand and prices. While the Dodgers offer some free and discount tickets, the cost for a family of four to attend a game is among the highest in Major League Baseball. This trend highlights the debate over whether teams should prioritize revenue maximization or ensure accessibility for a broader fan base.</p>

            <p>Republicans in nearly half of state legislatures have proposed bills requiring documentary proof of citizenship to vote, raising concerns about voter suppression. Conservatives in California are pushing for a voter ID ballot measure that would require citizenship verification to register to vote and photo identification to get a ballot. A Republican lawmaker in Pennsylvania filed a bill to create a voter ID in the swing state, praising voters in Wisconsin that voted to approve a new ID law in the midwestern battleground state. Critics argue these measures are based on false claims of widespread voter fraud and could disproportionately affect eligible citizens. The bills represent a broader effort to restrict voter access and undermine confidence in elections.</p>

Critics argue that the decision demonstrates Musk's willingness to prioritize his own business interests while cutting other federal jobs.
