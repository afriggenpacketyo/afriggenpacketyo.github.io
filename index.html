        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street forecasts, driven by a significant jump in revenue from its markets and banking divisions. The bank's net income rose 25% year-over-year, leading to a more than 3% increase in its stock price after the report. Despite the positive results fueled by market volatility, the company also noted a 16% increase in the cost of credit, citing a deteriorating economic outlook. The results come as CEO Jane Fraser continues her strategic turnaround plan for the financial institution. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, largely due to better-than-anticipated revenue from fixed income trading and investment banking. The bank's trading operations benefited from market turbulence, with fixed income revenue climbing 14% and equities trading revenue rising 15%. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the results but reiterated warnings about persistent economic risks, including trade uncertainty and geopolitical conflicts. The bank also raised its guidance for net interest income, a key indicator of profitability, suggesting confidence in its future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Target is experiencing a significant downturn as it struggles with declining sales, inventory problems, and waning customer loyalty, leading its stock to fall dramatically since its 2021 peak. Customers and former employees report a decline in the unique merchandise, store standards, and customer service that once defined the brand's "chic" identity. The retailer is also navigating the impact of economic pressures, backlash from its changing stance on diversity initiatives, and increased competition from rivals like Walmart and Shein. These issues present a major challenge for the company as it prepares for an eventual leadership transition.</p>

          <p>Russia has responded with indifference to President Trump's announcement of new weapons for Ukraine and threats of severe tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached within 50 days. A Kremlin official stated that Russia "didn't care" about the "theatrical ultimatum," while bombardments on Ukraine continued overnight with hundreds of drones. The White House confirmed that President Trump had approved a new multi-billion dollar military aid package for Ukraine, including Patriot missile systems sourced from European allies. Ukrainian officials expressed cautious optimism, hoping the move signals a "maximum pressure" campaign against Moscow.</p>

In its annual report, the BBC also revealed that Gary Lineker was its highest-paid presenter for the eighth consecutive year. Director General Tim Davie insisted the 'MasterChef' program has a future, stating it is "much bigger than individuals."</p>

The move marks a significant break from tradition, as military leaders have historically participated in the bipartisan forum under both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Key steps include researching the mortgage process, improving credit scores by paying down debt, and understanding different loan features beyond just the interest rate.

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers can secure strong returns on Certificates of Deposit (CDs), with top rates surpassing the national average and inflation. To get the best rates, experts advise looking beyond traditional brick-and-mortar banks to online banks, which typically offer higher yields due to lower overhead costs. Currently, an inverted yield curve means that short-term CDs, such as those with one-year terms, often provide higher interest rates than long-term ones. Financial planners suggest a strategy of "laddering" CDs with various maturity dates to balance high short-term rates with long-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alibaba is reportedly planning to launch a new "Super Saturdays" promotional event as competition intensifies in China's on-demand delivery sector. This move follows aggressive marketing from rivals like Meituan, which has offered free milk tea, and JD.com, which is promoting nightly deals on crayfish. The price war between these tech giants is aimed at capturing a larger share of China's instant commerce market. This market is projected to exceed 2 trillion yuan (US$279 billion) in sales by 2030, highlighting the immense growth potential that is fueling the fierce competition. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent reports indicating a senior Pentagon official discouraged European allies from military involvement in the Indo-Pacific may signal a strategic shift by Washington. Analysts believe this could mean the U.S. will increasingly expect its Asian allies to take on more responsibility for countering China's influence in the region. This approach would have the U.S. focus on coordinating defense strategies with its regional partners like Japan, South Korea, and Australia for military deterrence. Meanwhile, European nations would be urged to apply pressure on China through other means, such as stricter export controls.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government has disclosed that a secret £400 million scheme was established to relocate thousands of Afghans to the U.K. after their personal data was inadvertently leaked by a Ministry of Defence official. The breach, which occurred in 2022, exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for resettlement, putting them at potential risk from the Taliban. The existence of the leak and the subsequent relocation program were concealed for over three years by a superinjunction, which a High Court judge has now lifted, citing serious free speech and accountability concerns.</p>

          <p>For retirees living on a fixed income from Social Security, managing debt can be a significant challenge, but effective strategies exist to regain financial control. Federal law generally protects Social Security benefits from being garnished for consumer debts like credit cards, providing a crucial safeguard. Experts recommend creating a strict budget, prioritizing essential payments, and then tackling high-interest debts. Additionally, retirees should proactively contact creditors to inquire about hardship programs, and consider seeking assistance from a reputable nonprofit credit counseling agency to create a manageable debt management plan.</p>

          <p>A recently enacted tax bill introduces major changes that will affect charitable giving and the taxation of university endowments. The legislation increases the tax rate on endowments for universities with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students, a move experts say will impact about 15 top research institutions. For individual donors, the bill limits deductions for the wealthiest taxpayers and requires itemizers to exempt the first half-percent of their income from charitable deductions. While aimed at encouraging more giving from average Americans, these changes could disincentivize large-scale philanthropy from high-income earners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has ruled on the country's role in U.S. drone strikes that utilize the Ramstein air base for technical support. In a case brought by relatives of individuals killed in a 2012 strike in Yemen, the court dismissed the specific lawsuit as unfounded. However, the ruling established that the German government has a duty to protect human rights abroad if there is a sufficient connection to German state authority and a serious risk of systematic international law violations. The court determined these conditions were not met in the Yemen case, granting the government leeway in its foreign and security policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently signed tax-and-spending bill is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to add at least $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. This increase comes as the national debt has already surpassed $36 trillion, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio to its highest sustained level since World War II. Economists warn that persistent deficit spending can lead to higher interest rates for consumers on mortgages and credit cards, alongside reduced government funds for public services. While markets have remained calm, the long-term fiscal pressure raises concerns about future economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>
