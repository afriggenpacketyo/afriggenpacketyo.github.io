          <p>Organizers of the US Open have requested that broadcasters avoid airing any booing or other negative crowd reactions to former President Donald Trump, who is expected to attend the men's final. An internal email specified that Trump will be shown on screen during the national anthem but asked networks to refrain from broadcasting disruptions related to his presence. The visit marks Trump's first appearance at the tournament since 2015 and has prompted heightened security measures at the venue in Flushing Meadows, New York.</p>

          <p>NFL announcer Rich Eisen is gaining widespread attention for a seemingly political joke made during a Kansas City Chiefs game.

          <p>Despite securing a 2-0 victory over Andorra in a World Cup qualifier, England's national football team is facing criticism for a lackluster and uninspired performance under manager Thomas Tuchel. The win, sealed by an own goal and a header from Declan Rice, maintains England's strong position in their qualifying group, but the team's play has been described as regressive and lacking identity. Thousands of fans left the stadium early, reflecting widespread disappointment with the team's inability to generate excitement or momentum against a much lower-ranked opponent.</p>

          <p>South Sudan's government has repatriated a Mexican citizen, Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez, who was deported from the United States to the East African nation in July. Munoz-Gutierrez was part of a group of eight men with serious criminal convictions in the U.S. who were sent to third-party countries, a controversial practice by the Trump administration. The repatriation was coordinated with the Mexican Embassy in Ethiopia, while rights groups continue to criticize the policy of deporting migrants to countries other than their own as a violation of international law.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report from Portugal's transport safety office indicates that the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon was caused by a snapped cable connecting the two carriages. The investigation found that the brakeman's attempt to engage emergency brakes was unsuccessful, leading the upper carriage to derail and crash into a building at approximately 37 mph, killing 16 people. While the report confirms the cable failure, it stresses that further investigation is needed to determine why the automatic braking systems may not have functioned as intended.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he knows "nothing" about a classified 2019 SEAL Team 6 mission in North Korea, as reported by The New York Times. The report alleged that Trump approved an operation to plant a surveillance device to intercept communications from Kim Jong-un, but the mission was aborted after the SEALs opened fire on a North Korean boat, killing unarmed civilians they mistook for a threat. When questioned, Trump claimed he was hearing about the incident for the first time, while the Pentagon has declined to comment.</p>

          <p>Approximately 300 people have been arrested in London during a demonstration against the UK government's decision to proscribe the campaign group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Protesters gathered in Parliament Square, with many holding signs expressing support for the group, leading to arrests for supporting a banned organization and assaulting police officers. The government banned Palestine Action in July, making membership or support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison, a move that critics argue infringes on free speech.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has ended its protective detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris following internal complaints that the assignment was diverting officers from their regular crime suppression duties. The LAPD had been assisting the California Highway Patrol after President Trump revoked Harris's Secret Service protection. The move was criticized by the police union, which argued that a multimillionaire former official should pay for her own security rather than using taxpayer-funded officers needed elsewhere in the city.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent deadly strike on a boat departing from Venezuela has escalated tensions between the two nations. The White House identified the deceased as "narco-terrorists" from the Tren de Aragua gang, a claim that some experts question. In response, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro condemned the "imperialist policies" of the U.S. and announced the activation of a national militia plan. This military action is part of a broader U.S. strategy to combat drug trafficking, which now includes designating several Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.</p>

The decision affirms Biden's deep political roots in Delaware, where he served as a senator for 36 years before his tenure as vice president and president, and launches the significant fundraising effort required for the legacy project.</p>

          <p>A large and complex fire has engulfed a restaurant located within the iconic former BBC Television Centre headquarters in West London. Over 100 firefighters and 15 fire engines were dispatched to tackle the blaze, which broke out in the early hours of the morning in the nine-storey building. The historic site, which now houses apartments, television studios, and restaurants, was partially evacuated as crews worked for over 12 hours to bring the fire under control.

          <p>A new conservation chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a landmark settlement resulted in the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The deal, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a massive five-year ecological restoration project aimed at reviving native grasslands and improving biodiversity. While the transition is painful for the multigenerational ranching families who are departing, the project aims to heal a landscape impacted by decades of agricultural use and create a resilient ecosystem for the future.</p>
