          <p>An Inspector General report reveals that staffing shortages at Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities have increased by 50% this fiscal year. Nearly all facilities report severe shortages of medical officers, with significant deficits in nursing and psychology staff as well. While the VA administration disputes the report's methodology, calling it subjective, critics argue the findings reflect policies that have undermined the VA workforce and hindered care for veterans. The report marks the eighth consecutive year severe shortages have been identified.</p>

          <p>The president announced he will ask Congress for a long-term extension of the federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, beyond the current 30-day limit. Citing a need to address crime, he expressed confidence that Republicans would unanimously approve the measure, which would require some Democratic support to pass the Senate. This move is part of a broader push for a new crime bill focused on the capital, despite local data showing a significant decline in violent crime over the past year and a half.</p>

          <p>President Trump held virtual talks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European NATO leaders to align strategies before his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Zelenskyy urged allies to maintain pressure and sanctions, stating that Putin is not genuinely seeking peace but aims to occupy Ukraine. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized that Ukraine's sovereignty must be respected and that any peace deal requires Ukrainian involvement, a position Trump reportedly acknowledged. The pre-summit coordination aims to present a united front for the high-stakes meeting.</p>

          <p>A record-breaking flood in Juneau, Alaska, caused by an outburst from the Mendenhall Glacier, has subsided without causing catastrophic damage thanks to newly installed temporary barriers. The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, but the 'Hesco' barriers successfully protected hundreds of homes that were damaged in similar events in previous years. This annual flooding event, driven by climate change melting a nearby glacier, has intensified recently. Officials expressed relief that a major disaster was avoided while noting the ongoing need for a permanent solution.</p>

          <p>On the second anniversary of the Maui wildfires that killed 102 people, the community is still grappling with the slow pace of rebuilding and widespread mental health challenges. Only 50 of the more than 2,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt, and a recent study found nearly half of Lahaina residents exhibit depressive symptoms. Survivors are finding motivation in family and community support to cope with the ongoing trauma. The anniversary serves as a somber reminder of what was lost and the long, arduous road to recovery that still lies ahead.</p>

          <p>A flight from Virginia to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Grand Junction, Colorado, after a passenger became disruptive and violent. The man allegedly yelled racial slurs and waved a skateboard, leading to a physical altercation with the crew and another passenger. According to the airline, he was placed in restraints but managed to break free on two separate occasions. Upon landing, the passenger was taken into custody by police at the direction of the FBI, marking another incident in a year with over 1,000 unruly passenger reports.</p>

          <p>As part of President Trump's initiative to address crime in Washington, D.C., National Guard troops were deployed along the National Mall. The deployment, intended as a visible show of military presence in a typically safe tourist area, is being run by a joint task force. While 800 troops have been activated, they will operate in smaller shifts, providing logistical support and maintaining a presence around monuments.

Researchers believe the medication's effect on reducing impulsivity and improving concentration contributes to these positive outcomes.

As he prepares to end his long-running show 'WTF,' Maron expressed that the proliferation of podcasts has lowered the bar, comparing it to a world of uninspired 'afternoon drive-time radio.' He specifically called out the trend of hosts pandering to certain political ideologies. The comments come as Maron concludes his influential show, which began in 2009 and featured in-depth interviews with a wide range of prominent guests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from UC Riverside reveals that land subsidence in California's San Joaquin Valley is depressing home property values, costing homeowners thousands of dollars. The study found that excessive pumping of groundwater for agriculture is causing the land to sink, which in turn has reduced home values by up to 5.4%, a collective loss of nearly $1.9 billion. This slow-moving disaster, exacerbated by drought and climate change, causes foundational damage to homes and infrastructure. The findings underscore the significant economic consequences of unsustainable water management.</p>

          <p>The landmark national security trial of Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy media tycoon and prominent critic of Beijing, is entering its final stages in Hong Kong. Lai, a British citizen, is accused of colluding with foreign forces and faces a potential life sentence if convicted. The case is seen by international observers and critics as a key indicator of the erosion of judicial independence and freedom of speech in Hong Kong under the national security law imposed by China in 2020. Lai, who founded the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper, has been detained since December 2020.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is facing a significant challenge from the Trump administration, which has frozen over $500 million in federal grants and is demanding a settlement of around $1 billion over various claims. This follows a similar situation at Harvard, which appears close to capitulating. California Governor Gavin Newsom has vowed that UCLA will not be 'complicit in this kind of attack on academic freedom,' positioning the state as a line of defense. The decision of whether to settle or fight a protracted legal battle carries high stakes for the university.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its decision to cancel billions of dollars in congressionally appropriated foreign aid. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the move but decided on procedural grounds that the nonprofit groups who brought the lawsuit were not eligible to do so. This decision allows the administration to continue withholding funds for global health initiatives, including HIV/AIDS prevention. The ruling is a significant blow to humanitarian groups and a victory for the administration's efforts to impound funds.</p>

          <p>A decade after being the NFL's least valuable team in St. Louis, the Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, second only to the Dallas Cowboys, according to new rankings.

This valuation, based on revenue and growth potential, places the Rams alongside the Lakers as one of L.A.'s two sports franchises valued at over $10 billion, reflecting the successful monetization of the venue.
