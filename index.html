          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, the recently fired director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is contesting her dismissal by the Trump administration. Her lawyers argue the termination is illegal, stating only the President can remove her, not White House officials. Dr. Monarez accused Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of "weaponizing public health" by pressuring her to approve "unscientific, reckless directives." The standoff has prompted several other senior CDC leaders to resign in protest, citing concerns over the agency's direction and the rise of misinformation regarding vaccines.</p>

          <p>Researchers in the UK are analyzing the DNA of the "Druids Oak," an 800-year-old tree, to understand its remarkable resilience to disease, climate change, and other environmental stressors. The project, led by The Woodland Trust, aims to identify specific genes responsible for the longevity and hardiness of ancient oaks. Scientists hope this genetic information will help them select the most robust trees for future planting, aiding in the restoration of Britain's woodlands and the diverse ecosystems they support. The study will encompass about 50 of the UK's most famous ancient oak trees.</p>

          <p>Bev Johnson is marking her 42nd year as a host at WDIA in Memphis, the first radio station in the United States to feature all-Black programming. Since its inception in 1947, WDIA has served as a vital community resource, providing news, music, and information often ignored by mainstream outlets, including stories on civil rights and police brutality. Johnson, known as "your girlfriend" to her listeners, continues this legacy by offering a platform for community leaders and experts to provide essential advice. The station also played a crucial role in preserving the Lorraine Motel, which is now the National Civil Rights Museum.</p>

          <p>Beginning in January 2026, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine through the National Health Service. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for older children. Previously, parents had to pay up to £200 for the vaccine privately. Officials hope the move will protect children from rare but severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work, estimated to cost the UK £24 million annually in lost productivity.</p>

          <p>The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has overruled a board-approved plan to display Israeli flags on all school campuses during Jewish American Heritage Month, citing student safety concerns. The Board of Education had narrowly passed the measure as part of a broader resolution to combat antisemitism. However, Superintendent Alex Cherniss invoked his executive authority to halt the display, stating that only the U.S. and California flags will be permitted until further notice.

          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own cost-benefit analysis for a major reorganization that merges local councils in 21 areas, the BBC has learned. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner claimed the plan would save "a significant amount of money," basing estimates on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its findings, now suggesting the mergers could result in no savings or even cost more in certain scenarios, particularly if multiple smaller councils are created. Critics have expressed astonishment that the government proceeded without independent analysis for the largest council restructuring in decades.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have expressed outrage after a Russian missile barrage on Kyiv killed at least 23 people, including four children, and damaged the EU's delegation office. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reported that two missiles struck within 50 meters of the diplomatic mission, calling it a deliberate act of terror. The attack, which involved nearly 600 drones and over 30 missiles, is the deadliest on the Ukrainian capital since July. The bombardment destroyed a residential building and has been widely condemned as an attempt by Russia to escalate the conflict and sabotage peace efforts.</p>

While officials defend the law as a national security measure, opponents, including Texas Representative Gene Wu, argue it is discriminatory and anti-immigrant, specifically targeting Chinese-Americans. The law exempts U.S. citizens and green card holders, but critics fear it will lead to unfair scrutiny of anyone perceived to be Chinese.

          <h2>Survey Indicates Tesla's Full Self-Driving Feature Deters More US Consumers Than It Attracts</h2>

          <p>A new survey from Slingshot Strategies suggests that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology may be a net negative for the brand's appeal among U.S. consumers. The poll found that 35% of respondents were less likely to buy a Tesla because of FSD, while only 14% said it made them more likely to purchase one. The results come as Tesla faces a sales slump and reputational challenges, with nearly half of those surveyed believing FSD technology should be illegal. The findings challenge the company's strategy, which heavily relies on the future success of its autonomous driving technology.</p>

          <p>Colin Smyth, a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), has had his parliamentary pass deactivated following reports that he is facing a police charge for allegedly placing a camera in a Holyrood toilet. Smyth was previously suspended by the Labour party after being charged earlier this month with possessing indecent images of children. The Scottish Parliament's chief executive informed members of the decision to deactivate the pass "given the ongoing criminal investigation." Smyth, who represents South Scotland, has stated that he is cooperating with the inquiries into the deeply concerning allegations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America (VOA), without the approval of a congressionally mandated advisory panel. U.S. Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated that Lake was breaking the law, as the panel designed to insulate the broadcaster from political pressure is currently without the members needed for a vote. The ruling is part of a larger legal battle over Lake's efforts to dismantle the international broadcaster, which has seen its staff and language services drastically cut. Lake has indicated the administration will appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>The complex "love-hate" relationship between China and Japan is currently highlighted by two contrasting trends. A Chinese film depicting Japanese wartime atrocities, "Dead to Rights," has become a massive box office success, reigniting historical trauma. Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan has surged, with nearly a million visitors in July alone, making China the top source of inbound tourists. This paradox illustrates the deep-seated dynamic between the two nations, which is shaped by historical grievances, economic interdependence, and a shared cultural affinity, all while navigating ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic compares President Donald Trump's behavior and rhetoric to that of Homelander, the narcissistic and omnipotent antagonist from the television series "The Boys." The author argues that both figures exhibit a childlike need for adoration, react with rage when contradicted, and believe they are unrestrained by any rules, citing Trump's recent claim that "I have the right to do anything I want." The piece suggests that while Homelander is a fictional superhuman, Trump is a mortal politician who can be constrained by the Constitution, the courts, and ultimately, the voters.</p>

A Somalian man named Abdi described an atmosphere of hostility from some locals since a series of anti-immigration protests began outside the hotel.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that as a major consumer of palm oil, China can play a crucial role in promoting sustainability within Indonesia's palm oil industry. The article contextualizes this by noting Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto's recent crackdown on illegal plantations that have led to widespread deforestation, with 3.7 million hectares confirmed as illegal. The author posits that global demand, particularly from markets like China, drives the industry's expansion. Therefore, by leveraging its market power to demand more sustainable and transparent sourcing, China could significantly influence Indonesia's efforts to balance economic growth with environmental preservation.</p>

          <p>A long-standing U.S. import tax exception known as "de minimis" is being suspended, a change that will impact consumers who buy cheap goods from foreign online retailers. The rule, which has existed since 1938 and most recently exempted packages valued under $800 from duties, has been heavily utilized by companies like Temu and Shein. Following a Trump executive order, all incoming shipments will now be subject to an import tax for the next six months. This will likely lead to price increases on many low-cost items, ending an era of duty-free access to a wide range of products for American shoppers.</p>

A federal grant program designed to help these stations upgrade their aging equipment has been stalled due to a dispute between the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and FEMA under the Trump administration. With the recent defunding of the CPB, tens of millions of dollars appropriated by Congress for these upgrades may not be disbursed, leaving remote communities reliant on fragile infrastructure as extreme weather risks grow.</p>

          <p>Gap Inc. saw its stock fall in extended trading after reporting mixed second-quarter results and warning that increased tariffs will negatively affect its future profits. The apparel retailer now expects tariffs to cost between $150 million and $175 million, up from previous estimates, which will lower its operating margin. While the company's overall comparable sales rose by 1%, this was below Wall Street expectations, largely due to a 9% decline in sales at its Athleta brand. The company reaffirmed its full-year sales growth outlook but is now focused on offsetting the financial impact of the new tariffs.</p>
