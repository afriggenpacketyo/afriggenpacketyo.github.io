            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to exchange 252 Venezuelan deportees held in El Salvador for an equal number of political prisoners in Venezuela. Bukele directed his proposal to President Nicolás Maduro, criticizing the imprisonment of opposition figures. Venezuela's prosecutor's office responded critically, calling Bukele a "neofascist" and demanding a list of the detained Venezuelans. This proposal follows international scrutiny of El Salvador's detention of Venezuelans and Salvadorans deported by the U.S., particularly in the CECOT mega-prison.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned nations against appeasing the United States in trade talks related to President Trump's tariffs, responding to reports that the U.S. is pressuring countries to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for tariff exemptions. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson stated that appeasement would not bring peace and that China would firmly oppose any deals made at its expense, vowing to take countermeasures. This warning comes amidst ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and various trading partners following the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>

            <p>Approximately 60,000 Americans are at risk of losing their rental assistance and facing eviction due to the Emergency Housing Vouchers program running out of funds. Launched in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan, the program provides rental assistance to families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development expects the funding to be depleted by the end of next year due to rising rent costs. The program's future hinges on Congress allocating additional funds, but prospects are uncertain amidst Republican efforts to cut federal spending.</p>

            <p>Ingrid Lindblad, the 25-year-old rookie golfer, won the JM Eagle LA Championship at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. Lindblad, who missed out on the top 10 in her first two starts, charged into the conversation Friday with a career-low nine-under 63 to tie the tournament scoring record. Fellow rookie Akie Iwai missed a 13-foot putt on the 18th hole that would have forced a playoff after tying the score at 21-under with a 16th-hole birdie. With the $562,500 in prize money now to her name, Lindblad may bump herself up to first class on her next flight.</p>

Among the recipients of the private messages was Hegseth's wife, Jennifer, a former Fox News producer who holds no official role at the Department of Defense. Several former and current officials have said sharing those operational details before a strike would have certainly been classified, and their release could have put pilots in danger.</p>

The season explores themes of fractured bonds and cyclical violence, but the show has become a punishing watch, without the first season’s elegant insights.

Trump this month raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, and in retaliation, China imposed a 125% tariff on US goods. The decision highlights the impact of trade tensions on international business and aviation.</p>
