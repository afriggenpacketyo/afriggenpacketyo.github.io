          <p>Hurricane Erin has been downgraded to a category three storm after briefly reaching category five intensity, but it is growing in size as it moves towards the Bahamas. The US National Hurricane Center warns of hazardous conditions, including flash floods and landslides, in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. While the storm is not expected to make landfall on the US mainland, it will generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the entire US east coast, with Florida and the mid-Atlantic states facing the most dangerous conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several Chinese universities are experiencing intense online criticism for hosting Darius Longarino, a research scholar from Yale Law School. The backlash stems from social media users highlighting Longarino's past posts on X criticizing Beijing's policies in the Xinjiang region. In response to the public pressure, at least three universities, including Central South University, have removed online posts related to lectures and events featuring Longarino. This incident highlights the growing sensitivity and nationalist sentiment online within China regarding academic exchanges and foreign scholars.</p>

          <p>A humanoid robot named Unitree R1 captured public attention by walking into a Hoka sneaker store on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The event was a promotional stunt for KraneShares' new artificial intelligence and robotics ETF, following the robot's appearance ringing the Nasdaq opening bell. Although remote-controlled for this outing, the R1 is fully programmable and signals a future where such robots could be integrated into daily life for retail and customer service tasks. The stunt illustrates the growing investment and public interest in advanced robotics and AI.</p>

          <p>A program organized by officials in Mexico's Zacatecas state has enabled a small number of elderly parents to obtain temporary U.S. visas, facilitating emotional reunions with their undocumented children after decades apart. The article follows José Antonio Rodríguez, who hadn't seen his parents in 24 years, highlighting the deep personal cost of long-term family separation due to immigration status. The program offers a rare opportunity for connection, though many visa applications were rejected, underscoring the persistent challenges families face across the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

          <p>The article examines the transformation of a former industrial area in Washington, D.C., once known as "Swampoodle," into the thriving neighborhood of NoMa (North of Massachusetts Avenue). This redevelopment, which began in the 1990s and 2000s, is presented as a prime example of "Yes In My Back Yard" (YIMBY) principles, where pro-housing policies have led to significant growth. The rebranding and development of NoMa showcase a successful strategy in urban revitalization, turning a neglected zone into a desirable location.</p>

This comes as Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region following a summit between Presidents Putin and Trump. Zelenskyy, who is preparing for a visit to the White House, has consistently rejected ceding territory without robust security guarantees. Meanwhile, Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukraine continue, with Ukraine's air force reporting dozens of overnight strikes across the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has suspended all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza, pending a comprehensive review of its procedures. This decision followed a social media campaign by far-right influencer Laura Loomer, who made unsubstantiated claims against a group of critically wounded Gazan children and their families brought to the U.S. for medical treatment by a charity. The move has been praised by some Republicans but condemned by humanitarian organizations like the Palestine Children's Relief Fund, which warns it will have a devastating impact on children needing lifesaving care.</p>

The probe centers on his close relationship with Sonserae Cicero-Hamlin, whose new nonprofit, SHEBA, received substantial grant money and consulting fees from another organization, the Blue Hills Civic Association. Internal concerns about a conflict of interest were raised at Blue Hills before it ceased operations, and subpoenas now seek records of communications and any personal relationship between McCrory and Cicero-Hamlin.</p>

          <p>The widespread use of first-person-view (FPV) drones by both sides has turned large areas near Ukraine's front line into deadly "kill zones," significantly complicating the evacuation of wounded soldiers. Medics report that the constant threat from these precise and powerful drones means it takes much longer to retrieve injured personnel, leading to a significant increase in mortality. This shift in warfare tactics has made survival more difficult, as even evacuation vehicles are now primary targets, forcing a reliance on dangerous self-evacuation on foot.</p>

          <p>The article reviews Celine Song's new film, "Materialists," which portrays modern romance through the lens of a pragmatic matchmaker who assesses clients' market value. The author argues that the film accurately captures how dating has become increasingly transactional, influenced by the consumerist logic of dating apps and exacerbated by economic pressures. Wealth inequality and the high cost of living now make a partner's financial stability a key consideration, blurring the lines between love and economic necessity. This reflects a broader cultural shift towards "emotional capitalism," where relationships are evaluated for their return on investment.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration agent discharged their firearm at a vehicle during a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino, California. The driver later contacted police, stating that unidentified masked men had shot at him. The Department of Homeland Security claims the driver refused to comply and drove his vehicle at officers, injuring two, prompting the agent to fire in self-defense. However, video from the scene shows agents smashing the car's windows before shots are fired, and local police, citing the California Values Act, did not assist with the immigration-related arrest.</p>
