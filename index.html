          <p>Snap's shares dropped by 15% after the company's second-quarter earnings report revealed that its global average revenue per user did not meet analyst expectations. While the company's daily active users slightly surpassed forecasts, its net loss widened to $262.6 million from $248.6 million in the same period last year. In response to the results, Snap announced a restructuring of its engineering teams to better support business functions, which will coincide with the departure of its senior vice president of engineering. The company did, however, provide a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of Wall Street estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a weeklong manhunt, authorities in Tennessee have captured Austin Robert Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect in the killing of four people and the kidnapping of a baby. The victims were identified as Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend. The capture was made possible by tips from community residents who spotted Drummond near a vacant building in Jackson. Law enforcement officials praised the cooperation between the police and the public, which led to the suspect's peaceful arrest. Drummond now faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping.</p>

          <p>Recent comments by President Donald Trump have influenced prediction markets regarding the next Federal Reserve chair, with Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh emerging as front-runners. In a CNBC interview, Trump praised both men, referring to them as "both Kevins," which caused their odds on the Kalshi prediction market to rise to 35% each. Both Hassett and Warsh are known to advocate for lower interest rates, a stance that contrasts with current Chair Jerome Powell's policies. The speculation is further fueled by the recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, opening a seat for a Trump appointee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account for a $10,000 deposit. While a high-yield savings account might currently offer a slightly higher return, the difference is minimal, and the CD provides a guaranteed fixed rate. This is a significant advantage in a climate where interest rate cuts are anticipated, which would lower the variable rates of savings accounts. The article suggests that savers should consider their financial goals and need for liquidity, as CDs penalize early withdrawals, unlike more flexible savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group has revised its full-year production forecast downward after reporting second-quarter financial results that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company now expects to produce 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles, down from a previous target of 20,000, causing its shares to fall over 9% in after-hours trading. Lucid reported a net loss of $855 million for the quarter and missed revenue projections, citing slower-than-expected demand for pure EVs. The company is focusing on disciplined cost management and the launch of its new Gravity SUV to navigate the challenging market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Delia Ramirez of Illinois is facing significant backlash after stating, "I’m a proud Guatemalan before I’m an American," during a conference in Mexico City. The comment, made in Spanish, triggered a wave of criticism on social media from political figures and commentators who questioned her allegiance to the United States. In response, Ramirez defended her statement, asserting that honoring her Guatemalan ancestry strengthens her commitment to America and that such pride is a truth many immigrants carry. Critics, however, argue that serving in Congress requires an undivided allegiance to the United States.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes political battle is unfolding in Texas, where Democratic lawmakers have left the state to block a Republican-led vote on redrawing congressional districts. The proposed map could create five new Republican-leaning seats, potentially impacting the narrow balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of the midterm elections. This move has national implications, as it could prompt Democratic-controlled states like California and New York to pursue their own redistricting efforts in response, creating a potential "arms race."

The author argues that the party is historically unpopular, and Harris embodies the discontent felt by both progressive and centrist wings. Her past electoral loss and perceived lack of authentic connection with a changing electorate are cited as significant hurdles. The piece suggests that to win, Democrats need a candidate who can appeal to a broader coalition, something the author claims Harris has struggled to do, making another nomination a risky proposition.</p>

With high home equity levels, HELOCs offer a lower-interest alternative to credit cards, but their variable rates pose risks. Homeowners should question if rate cuts are guaranteed, how potential cuts will impact their payments, and whether a fixed-rate home equity loan might be a safer alternative.

          <h2>Analysis Shows Trump's New Legislation Will Reduce Charitable Deduction for Top Earners</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's recently signed spending package includes changes that will reduce the tax benefits of charitable donations for high-income earners starting in 2026. The new law introduces a floor, allowing deductions only on amounts exceeding 0.5% of adjusted gross income, and also caps the benefit for those in the top 37% tax bracket. Financial planners advise that individuals affected by these changes may want to consider strategies like "bunching" multiple years of donations into 2025 to maximize their deductions before the new rules take effect. The legislation does, however, create a new, limited charitable deduction for non-itemizers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Great Barrier Reef Experiences Worst-Ever Annual Decline in Coral Cover, Report Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 15:38:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) reveals that parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered the largest annual decline in coral cover since record-keeping began nearly 40 years ago. The primary cause is identified as severe heat stress driven by climate change, which has led to the most widespread and severe coral bleaching event to date. While cyclones and starfish outbreaks have contributed, the report warns that the reef may be approaching a tipping point where it can no longer recover between catastrophic events. This poses a grave threat to the vital marine ecosystem.</p>

In a letter to the FBI Director, Cornyn alleged potential criminal acts, though leaving the state to break a quorum is not a criminal offense. This move follows a vote by Texas House Republicans to issue civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats. The conflict stems from a Republican plan, supported by Donald Trump, to redraw congressional maps to gain up to five more seats.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Open Network reveals that a cancer diagnosis significantly increases monthly out-of-pocket medical costs for privately insured patients, with expenses rising as the disease progresses. The research found that costs jumped by an average of $592 per month in the six months following a diagnosis. For patients with stage 4 cancer, the increase was even higher, at nearly $720 per month. The findings highlight the substantial financial burden that cancer places on individuals and families, even those with private health insurance, underscoring the need for policy reforms like paid sick leave.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is facing criticism and ridicule for his recent claim that he has cut drug prices by percentages as high as 1,500%.

This statement is part of Trump's repeated promise to pressure pharmaceutical companies into lowering costs for Americans. The incident has been cited by commentators as another example of reality eroding, highlighting the disconnect between the president's claims and mathematical or factual accuracy.</p>

The market's negative reaction was attributed to the results not meeting the extremely high expectations set by Wall Street for the industrial AI beneficiary. Eaton's adjusted earnings and revenue both beat consensus estimates, driven by strong performance in its Electrical Americas segment and high demand from data centers. Despite the stock dip, analysts noted the company's bright future, pointing to a strong backlog and strategic investments in capacity to meet growing demand. (not investment advice)</p>
