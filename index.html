          <p>Friedrich Merz, a centrist coalition candidate, failed to secure a majority in the first round of voting for German Chancellor in the Bundestag, receiving only 310 votes out of the needed 316. The secret ballot process, designed to ensure lawmakers' freedom, raised questions about potential dissent within his own coalition, comprised of the CDU, CSU, and SPD, which collectively hold 328 seats. Despite a mock ballot suggesting Merz's confirmation, the outcome underscores the unpredictability of secret votes, contrasting with the open voting on specific laws. The vote's outcome casts doubt on Merz's ability to lead Germany amid economic and security challenges, especially given the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.</p>

          <p>China is actively engaging in a charm offensive across Africa, seeking to position itself as a reliable ally in contrast to the United States, which it accuses of "bullying." Through various channels, Chinese diplomats are campaigning to rally opposition against President Trump's trade policies, framing them as a threat to developing economies. Experts suggest that the former Biden administration's handling of the Gaza war and Trump's "America first" agenda have created an opportunity for China to expand its influence in Africa. Chinese officials are promising to share opportunities for modernization with African nations, aiming to strengthen economic ties amid the ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>House Judiciary Committee Democrats have launched an investigation into the Trump administration's decision to freeze funding for nearly 400 nonprofit and crime victim assistance organizations. The probe seeks to determine if the cuts were influenced by Elon Musk's Department of Governmental Efficiency and to understand the criteria used to restore funding to some organizations. Democrats are questioning how the Justice Department plans to support crime victims after terminating grants that support critical initiatives, including safe housing guidance and referrals to victims' compensation programs. The Justice Department claims the programs did not align with its priorities, but impacted groups are protesting the cuts, highlighting the potential impact on public safety, especially amid budget crises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several major consumer companies, including Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands, are reporting a slowdown in sales from Hispanic shoppers in North America, attributed to economic concerns and stricter immigration policies. Constellation Brands, which relies heavily on Hispanic consumers for beer sales, provided a weaker-than-expected outlook, citing these concerns. Experts suggest that fear surrounding immigration policy is a contributing factor, leading to fewer social gatherings and reduced spending on both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Coca-Cola also reported weaker traffic from Hispanic shoppers, partly due to a boycott fueled by false rumors of reporting undocumented workers, and geopolitical tensions are affecting sales in the Mexican border region.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is being asked to rule on a case involving a Maine lawmaker, Laurel Libby, who was censured for criticizing a transgender athlete on Facebook. After Libby refused to remove the post, she was stripped of her ability to vote in the House, leading to a legal challenge arguing that this violates the First Amendment and punishes her constituents. While the Maine House has a right to express its views, the case raises concerns about lawmakers silencing dissent by stripping colleagues of their voting rights. The Supreme Court's decision in Bond v. Floyd supports the idea that legislators should have wide latitude to express their views, suggesting that the same rule should apply in Libby v. Fecteau.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a sharp decline after a historic surge, prompting officials to deny allegations of currency manipulation in trade talks with the U.S. The currency weakened by over 3% against the U.S. dollar following a 9% rally, driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging U.S. dollar debt. Despite the pullback, the Taiwan dollar remains significantly up for the year, and analysts are closely monitoring the central bank's actions amid speculation of a currency realignment. While officials deny intervention, some believe exchange rates might be part of broader U.S.-Taiwan trade discussions.</p>

          <p>A newly public memo from U.S. intelligence agencies indicates that Venezuelan President Maduro's regime does not directly control the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, challenging the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act to facilitate deportations. The report suggests that while Venezuela's environment allows TdA to operate, there is no evidence of a direct policy of cooperation or direction from the Maduro regime. However, FBI analysts agree that some Venezuelan government officials facilitate TdA members' migration to the U.S., potentially using them to destabilize governments, undercutting the argument that support for TdA is a direct policy from Maduro's regime.</p>

While supporters highlight his preparedness and thoughtful approach, critics point to a pattern of broken promises and a lack of long-term planning.

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States, China has reportedly made limited efforts to de-dollarise its economy, as indicated by an Oxford Economics report. The report suggests that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, making a rapid diversification away from the U.S. currency impractical. Instead of selling U.S. assets, China is more likely to weaken the yuan to support exporters, rendering a disruptive sale of U.S. Treasury holdings unlikely. This strategy allows exporters to purchase more of the Chinese currency with U.S. dollars earned from overseas sales.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan declared she will challenge the UK Labour government when its policies negatively impact Wales, emphasizing that her priority is the nation and its people over party loyalty. She called for a halt to planned disability benefit cuts and a reconsideration of winter fuel allowance reductions, advocating for Wales to benefit more from wind power revenues. Morgan insisted this stance does not signify a split but represents "grown up modern government," stressing that Wales will stand up against perceived unfairness. She emphasized the need to change the Barnett formula, which determines how Wales is funded, to better reflect the country's needs.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock index futures were lower on Tuesday after President Donald Trump's comments on potential pharma tariffs renewed worries of the impact of a trade war, while some downbeat corporate results also weighed on investor sentiment.

The automaker also flagged a hit of about $1.5 billion from the levies, sending its shares down 2.6% in premarket trading.

          <p>While inflation remains above target levels, some sectors of the U.S. economy have seen recent price declines, including airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. Experts attribute these deflations to idiosyncratic factors and supply-and-demand dynamics, but warn that tariffs threaten to reverse this trend. For example, gasoline prices are down almost 10% from a year ago, while television and smartphone prices have fallen significantly due to improved production efficiency. However, economists caution that these lower prices may not last, citing potential disruptions from tariffs and other economic factors.</p>

          <p>President Trump is once again targeting sanctuary cities, but unlike his first term, Democrats are not unified in their defense of these policies.

          <p>Darnall Dental Clinic in Sheffield, UK, is struggling to provide NHS services to its 13,500 patients after losing a key NHS subsidy, despite taking on an additional 4,000 patients since 2022.

The situation highlights the broader challenges in NHS dentistry, with a recent report indicating that only half of the English population can access an NHS dentist under current arrangements.
