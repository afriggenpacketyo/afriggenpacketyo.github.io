          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested restarting direct talks with Ukraine, aiming to achieve a durable peace and eliminate the root causes of the war, with negotiations possibly beginning on May 15 in Istanbul. Putin emphasized that those genuinely seeking peace should support the proposal, while not directly addressing Ukraine's request for a 30-day ceasefire without preconditions. The Russian leader also mentioned plans to discuss the details with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, indicating a potential mediation role for Turkey in the ongoing conflict. The proposal comes amid threats from European leaders to increase sanctions on Russia if it doesn't accept an unconditional ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received from her community and around the world, emphasizing her faith in the American system of justice. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated when she was detained by plainclothes ICE officers, with the Trump administration citing an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas as the reason for her visa revocation. Democratic leaders in Massachusetts celebrated the court order, asserting that Ozturk's detention was an attempt to silence dissent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration grew concerned about a potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan after Vice President JD Vance downplayed the issue. Tensions escalated following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, leading to serious dogfights and drone incursions. Concerns peaked when explosions hit the Nur Khan air base near Pakistan's nuclear command, prompting U.S. intervention. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio engaged directly with leaders in both countries, ultimately leading to a cease-fire agreement. While Pakistan credited Trump's leadership, India did not acknowledge U.S. involvement in de-escalating the situation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly fired Shira Perlmutter, the director of the U.S. Copyright Office, after her office released a report expressing concerns about the usage of copyrighted materials by AI technology. The report questioned how much data AI developers need and the marginal effect of more data on a model's capabilities. Democratic Representative Joe Morelle speculated that the firing was related to Perlmutter's refusal to support Elon Musk's efforts to use copyrighted works to train AI models. Musk had previously expressed support for the abolition of intellectual property laws and owns AI startup xAI.</p>

The arrest occurred while Baraka was with three members of Congress, who were participating in an oversight visit, as the mayor had previously been denied entry into the facility.

The talks, aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that initial discussions focused on "de-escalation, not about the big trade deal," given the unsustainable nature of the high tariffs imposed by both countries.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to discuss de-escalating trade tensions, marking the first high-level negotiations since President Trump significantly increased tariffs. Trump described the meeting as "very good" and said "great progress" was made, though no formal readout was provided. The meetings aim to address the economic fallout from the trade war, which has disrupted supply chains and raised costs for businesses and consumers, while expectations for a breakthrough remain low.</p>

Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said there had been repeated violations of the agreement and accused Pakistan of a "border intrusion," prompting retaliation from the Indian army. Pakistan denied violating the ceasefire, claiming India had committed violations in "some areas" and that its troops were exercising restraint.

Sims, who was an Army private at the time of the murder, had a previous conviction for assault to commit murder and robbery.
