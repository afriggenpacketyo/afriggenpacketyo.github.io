          <p>Salesforce reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and guidance, despite President Trump's sweeping tariffs. The company's revenue grew 7.6% year over year, and it announced plans to acquire data management company Informatica for $8 billion. Salesforce introduced the AgentExchange marketplace for AI agents and reassigned 500 customer support workers, leading to $50 million in savings. Management anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $2.76 to $2.78 on revenue of $10.11 billion to $10.16 billion for the fiscal second quarter, and bumped up its full-year forecast.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority with his reciprocal tariffs, a setback for his economic agenda. The court stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The ruling applies to trafficking tariffs and reciprocal tariffs imposed in April to correct trade imbalances, but does not impact tariffs on specific products like aluminum and steel. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, while Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield hailed the decision as a victory for working families and small businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

Japan hopes to arrange a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Trump during the G7 summit in June, with further ministerial-level talks anticipated beforehand.

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, but the attorney general of New York welcomed the decision.</p>

The family, who had been living illegally in the US for over a decade, sought asylum in Canada, citing fears for their safety under President Trump's immigration policies. Despite having relatives in Canada, they were initially denied entry due to a minor discrepancy on their birth certificates. Immigration experts note a rise in asylum seekers fleeing the US due to stricter border policies.</p>

          <p>As negotiations to end the war in Ukraine stall, the Trump administration is turning to the Middle East to showcase progress toward landmark deals. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff announced that a temporary truce in Gaza was within reach and could lead to a peaceful resolution. Trump has revealed that he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu it would be “inappropriate” to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. The administration is also increasingly bullish about the potential to broker a nuclear agreement with Iran.</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted of federal charges in 1997 and sentenced to six life terms for leading a criminal enterprise while in prison. Hoover's attorneys said he has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement. Ron Safer, the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial, expressed disappointment in the news of Hoover's sentence being commuted.</p>

          <p>Justice Department lawyers said that the government was taking steps to comply with a court order to facilitate the return of a man who had been deported to Mexico and was then sent to Guatemala. The Guatemalan man, known by the initials O.C.G., had been deported this year despite having told U.S. authorities that he had experienced violence in Mexico and was afraid to go back. The government’s agreement to take steps to return O.C.G. represents a substantial de-escalation in a case that is shaping up to be one of the key courtroom battles over President Trump’s attempts to conduct mass deportations.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his plans for manufacturing-led growth during a visit to the northern province of Henan. Xi told workers at a state-owned ball-bearing factory that self-reliance in advanced manufacturing is "the right path" for China and the "backbone" of its economy. This push to expand manufacturing capabilities could run counter to the Trump administration's core demands in the ongoing trade talks, experts warn. There is "little scope" for China to budge and scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, which is closely tied to Beijing's drive for self-reliance.</p>
