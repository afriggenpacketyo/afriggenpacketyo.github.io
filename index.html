        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government has issued new guidance requiring all schools to provide separate toilet facilities for boys and girls based on biological sex. This policy shift follows two significant court rulings, including a Supreme Court decision defining a woman by biological sex under equalities law. While single-sex facilities are now mandatory, the guidance still permits schools to offer additional gender-neutral toilets and advises supporting transgender pupils. The move has drawn criticism from some who find the guidance contradictory, while the government maintains it provides necessary clarity for educational authorities.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to impose a 100% tariff on all movies made outside of the United States, arguing that the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries. This proposal is part of a broader series of tariffs aimed at protecting domestic industries. Financial analysts have questioned the feasibility and definition of such a tariff, noting that many films have international funding, cast, and crew, making their origin difficult to define. The move could significantly increase production costs, potentially impacting streaming services and cinema operators, though market reaction has been muted so far. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts confirm that the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks even if the U.S. government shuts down on October 1. The program's funding is classified as mandatory spending and is not subject to annual congressional appropriations. However, a shutdown could disrupt other services provided by the Social Security Administration, such as benefit verifications, card replacements, and processing corrections. The agency's contingency plan indicates that while payments will proceed, nearly 10% of its workforce would be furloughed, potentially causing delays for administrative tasks.</p>

          <p>Federal and local authorities are investigating the motive behind a violent attack at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan. A 40-year-old gunman drove his truck into the building, opened fire on the congregation, and set the structure ablaze, killing at least four people and injuring eight. The suspect was later killed in a shootout with police. The FBI is leading the investigation, exploring potential connections between the attack and recent events, including the death of the church's president. Officials have not yet determined the suspect's connection, if any, to the church.</p>

          <p>With a potential federal government shutdown looming, financial experts are advising government workers to prepare for delayed or lost income. The situation is intensified by threats of mass firings, a departure from typical furloughs where back pay is guaranteed. Financial planners recommend that employees meticulously track their cash flow, reduce discretionary spending, and contact lenders about potential hardship assistance. Given the unprecedented threat of permanent layoffs, workers are also encouraged to research unemployment benefits and health insurance options like COBRA or ACA marketplace plans. This uncertainty adds significant stress for hundreds of thousands of federal employees and their families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has announced a new Labour policy that would require legal migrants to prove their contribution to society to gain permanent settlement. Under the proposal, individuals would need to learn English to a high standard, maintain a clean criminal record, and engage in community volunteering to qualify for indefinite leave to remain. The policy aims to reform the current system and is positioned as a clear alternative to the stricter approaches of rival parties. Mahmood emphasized that the changes are designed to ensure that integration and contribution are conditions for permanently living in the UK.</p>

          <p>A protestor at an Illinois immigration facility has been charged by federal authorities after allegedly threatening to kill a U.S. Border Patrol agent. During a demonstration outside the facility in Broadview, Paul Ivery allegedly told an agent, "l'll f***ing kill you right now," according to court documents. Ivery is one of several individuals facing federal criminal charges related to the recent protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities in the Chicago area. The incident underscores the heightened tensions surrounding U.S. immigration policies and the enforcement actions taken against protestors.</p>

          <p>Several West African nationals, deported from the United States under a new agreement with Ghana, claim they were subsequently driven to the border and left in neighboring Togo without passports or documents. This action followed a deal where Ghana agreed to accept deportees from the region on behalf of the U.S. The individuals, some of whom had legal protections against deportation to their home countries due to safety concerns, are now in hiding and financially dependent on their families. The UN human rights office has called on Ghana to cease these "third country" deportations.</p>

This data blackout would leave investors, policymakers, and the Federal Reserve without key indicators of the economy's health.

          <p>A new partnership allowing rental car company Hertz to sell its used vehicles directly to consumers through Amazon's platform poses a potential threat to traditional auto dealerships. This deal provides Hertz with another major channel to offload its large fleet, a key part of its business strategy, while expanding Amazon's presence in vehicle sales. Analysts suggest this could cut into a profitable market for dealerships, which have historically sold former rental cars. The partnership leverages Amazon's e-commerce infrastructure for financing and paperwork, though customers must still pick up the cars from a physical location.</p>

The meeting comes as Trump has shown increasing frustration with the prolonged conflict and its humanitarian toll. The proposal represents a significant diplomatic effort by the U.S. to resolve the conflict, though its acceptance by either side remains uncertain.</p>

Key challenges for England include their batting performance against spin, inconsistent fielding, and ability to handle high-pressure moments.

The inquiry noted that fire safety regulations required the doors to remain unlocked as they were designated fire exits. The attack, which occurred during a children's dance workshop, resulted in the murder of three young girls and injuries to ten other people, including eight children.</p>
