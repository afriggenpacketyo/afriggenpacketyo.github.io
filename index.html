          <p>A Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, was placed on indefinite paid leave after facing criticism for his handling of a case involving a Maryland man deported to El Salvador. Reuveni, acting deputy director for the Office of Immigration Litigation, was cited for a "failure to zealously advocate" for the government's interests. During a hearing, Reuveni struggled to provide Judge Paula Xinis with details about the deportation and the administration's justification for preventing the man's return. Reuveni expressed his own frustration at not having the necessary answers to the judge's questions.</p>

          <p>As U.S. consumers rush to purchase goods before tariffs take full effect, experts caution against accumulating debt to beat the price increases. Economists anticipate that tariffs will raise prices for everyday items and potentially lead to a recession. While some consumers are stocking up on goods, analysts advise a measured approach, emphasizing the importance of long-term financial stability. They suggest consumers should avoid panic buying and consider delaying large purchases if necessary, given that average American households already carry significant debt.</p>

Yates' departure is a blow to USC's backcourt plans, as he was expected to play a significant role alongside other key players.

It critiques the modern definition of masculinity often promoted online, contrasting it with traditional values of responsibility and care for others. The author argues that Gen X men, who benefited from liberated sexuality and dual-income households, should share their insights with younger men to counter the negative messages propagated by misogynistic online figures.

          <p>The article explores the trend of highly optimized morning routines promoted by fitness influencers, particularly the viral routine of Ashton Hall. It questions whether these routines, while seemingly benign, promote regressive ideas about masculinity and contribute to a new wave of conservatism among Gen-Z men. The author argues that such content can reinforce a male-centric worldview where women are secondary and submissive, subtly pushing a patriarchal narrative. It is important to understand the implications of these types of routines.</p>

          <p>Economists are questioning the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions and inflates the rates. The formula, which involves dividing a country's trade deficit with the U.S. by its exports and then dividing by two, is criticized for using an inaccurate elasticity rate. Economists say that if the elasticity assumptions are adjusted, the tariff rates would be significantly lower than those imposed by the Trump administration.</p>
