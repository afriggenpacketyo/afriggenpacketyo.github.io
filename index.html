          <p>Deutsche Bank announced a 39% year-on-year jump in first-quarter profit, exceeding analyst expectations, driven by strong investment banking performance amidst market turbulence. Net profit attributable to shareholders reached 1.775 billion euros, with revenues up 10% to 8.524 billion euros. CEO Christian Sewing stated these results put the bank on track to meet its 2025 targets, marking the best quarterly profit in fourteen years. The bank's investment banking division saw a 10% increase in net revenues, and asset management revenues rose by 18%, bolstered by expectations of increased regional investment following German political developments (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely Holding, is implementing a $1.9 billion cost-cutting plan after experiencing a sharp decline in first-quarter operating profit, which fell to 1.9 billion krona from 4.7 billion krona year-over-year. The company attributes this downturn to reduced wholesales, adverse currency effects, and broader automotive industry challenges. The cost and cash action plan includes reductions in investments and potential redundancies across its global operations, with further details to be released later. Due to current market uncertainties, Volvo Cars has also withdrawn its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026.</p>

          <p>HSBC, Europe's largest lender, reported first-quarter results that surpassed estimates, driven by strong performance in its wealth business and corporate and institutional banking segments. The bank announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion, expected to be completed before the 2025 interim results. While pre-tax profit decreased by 25% year-on-year and revenue fell 15%, profit before tax increased by 317% from the previous quarter. CEO Georges Elhedery cited the strong results as evidence of momentum in earnings and confidence in achieving targets, while also warning of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and the adverse effects of protectionist trade policies.</p>

After enduring immense physical and emotional pain, she found solace in Christianity and established The Kim Foundation International to support child victims of war.

          <p>A massive power outage impacted large portions of Spain and Portugal, causing widespread disruptions including halted transportation, communication outages, and business closures. Spanish power distributor Red Eléctrica reported that 99% of power capacity had been restored by early Tuesday morning. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez attributed the outage to a problem in the European grid, describing it as a "strong oscillation," and stated that the cause was under investigation. The outage, which is considered unprecedented, affected millions of people and prompted emergency meetings and international assistance to restore power.</p>

          <p>The influence of Pep Guardiola's 'juego de posicion,' or positional football, is evident in the Champions League semi-finals, with three of his disciples – Luis Enrique, Mikel Arteta, and Hansi Flick – coaching teams in the competition. This model, which builds on the work of Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal, is shaping the present and future of the game. While some critics argue that it stifles spontaneity, the prevalence of positional football among elite clubs suggests it is a winning model that is becoming a cultural force in the sport.</p>

          <p>An analysis examines the unprecedented use of executive orders by President Donald Trump in his second term, particularly in the first 100 days. These orders, including those targeting immigration and transgender rights, reflect a reshaping of US governance. The analysis explores how Trump's policies align with Project 2025, a conservative manifesto, and the legal challenges to these orders. While executive orders can be stopped or overturned by Congress, the courts, or future presidents, the administration's reliance on them raises questions about their long-term impact and legality.</p>

Pakistan denies involvement and calls for an international investigation. The article explores the historical roots of the Kashmir conflict, Pakistan's past support for militancy, and the evidence India has presented in previous attacks, noting that India has yet to provide similar evidence for this recent attack.</p>

The Liberals did not secure a majority, leading in 161 districts compared to the Conservatives' 150. Trump's remarks about Canada becoming the 51st state, which he repeated on election day, played a significant role in the campaign, galvanizing support for the Liberals.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party won Canada's federal election, marking their fourth mandate. The election focused on the candidates' responses to US President Donald Trump's threats of tariffs and calls to make Canada the 51st state. It is not yet clear if the Liberals have secured a majority government. Carney will continue as Prime Minister and is expected to prioritize navigating the relationship with Trump and securing Canada's economy.</p>

While Trump's base remains committed, his overall approval rating is the lowest of any president in the past 80 years. The article highlights potential scenarios that could derail Trump's agenda, including economic recession caused by tariffs, a constitutional crisis over immigration, and instability stemming from his relationship with Elon Musk. The success of Trump's administration hinges on balancing ambitions to reset the global trading order with the impact on average American consumers.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals are projected to have won Canada's federal election, fueled by a backlash against US President Donald Trump. The win marks a turnaround for a party considered unlikely to succeed months ago. Trump's tariff threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty became defining issues, allowing Carney to run against Trump as much as his Conservative rival. The Conservatives made gains but fell short, and the left-wing New Democrats collapsed.</p>
