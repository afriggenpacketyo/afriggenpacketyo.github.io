          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly stated he will seek a primary challenger against Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina. This threat comes after Tillis announced his opposition to Trump's major spending bill, citing concerns over significant cuts to Medicaid that would negatively impact his state. Tillis, along with Senator Rand Paul, voted against advancing the legislation, highlighting a notable division within the Republican party over the bill's fiscal impact. Despite the opposition, the bill narrowly cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate, continuing its path forward amidst the internal party disagreements.</p>

          <p>The Northern Irish rap group Kneecap delivered a politically charged performance at the Glastonbury Festival, defying criticism from British politicians and legal challenges faced by one of its members. Rapper Mo Chara, who is facing a terrorism-related charge, appeared on stage with the group, which is known for its pro-Palestinian stance and republican symbolism. During their set, they led chants of "Free Palestine" and criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had questioned the appropriateness of their inclusion in the festival lineup. The performance highlights the ongoing intersection of music, political activism, and free speech debates.</p>

          <p>The head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has warned that Iran retains the capacity to restart enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels within a few months. This assessment follows recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi stated caused severe but not total damage, contradicting claims that the program was fully destroyed. Despite Iran's parliament voting to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, Grossi emphasized the need for a diplomatic solution to the ongoing nuclear standoff. The situation remains tense, with the US indicating it would consider further military action if necessary.</p>

          <p>Social media influencer turned boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Chavez Jr. appeared passive and reluctant to engage, drawing boos from the crowd and visible frustration from his father, boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. While Paul showcased improved boxing skills, the victory against an uninspired, aging opponent raises continued questions about the legitimacy of his professional boxing career. Following the win, Paul called out current world champions, signaling his ambition for a future title shot.</p>

One of the deadliest incidents occurred near a stadium in Gaza City, which was being used as a shelter for displaced families, resulting in at least 11 fatalities, including children. The Israeli military stated it was targeting a "suspicious individual" and was unaware of other injuries.

Blaze, a 19-year-old gay, Jewish university student, was killed in a hate crime, and his parents have since worked to create a legacy of tolerance and love.

The prosecution successfully argued that Woodward, who had ties to a neo-Nazi group, was motivated by hate, while the defense claimed the killing was an impulsive act of rage.

          <p>The French government is leading a â‚¬1.35 billion investment into satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move, which makes the French state Eutelsat's largest shareholder, is part of a broader European push for technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, industry experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, citing the massive disparity in scale, as Eutelsat's LEO constellation has 650 satellites compared to Starlink's 7,600. The company is seen as better positioned to serve security-sensitive and enterprise markets rather than the mass consumer market. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end.

          <p>A lay preacher for the Church of England in Leicester, Venessa Pinto, has been convicted of stalking after a prolonged campaign of harassment against a volunteer at her church, Jay Hulme. The ordeal began after Hulme, who is gay, declined her romantic advances. Hulme reported the escalating online abuse to both the police and the church, but initially felt unprotected, with the Bishop of Leicester at one point dismissing his complaint and accusing him of witchcraft. After a 21-month campaign of abuse, police took action, leading to Pinto's conviction and a community order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, temperatures in cities are often significantly higher than in surrounding rural areas due to a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. This occurs because dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, slowly releasing it as heat, which raises urban temperatures, especially at night. In contrast, rural landscapes with more vegetation and water sources provide natural cooling through evaporation. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, the world's growing urban populations are expected to bear the brunt of this effect.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program. The rocket, which lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deployed a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases and climate change. The H2A series, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, has been a reliable workhorse for Japan's space exploration, achieving a 98% success rate over its career. It is now being replaced by the newer, more cost-effective H3 rocket, as Japan aims to remain competitive in the global satellite-launch market.</p>
