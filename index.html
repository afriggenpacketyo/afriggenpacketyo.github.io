          <p>Bradley Murdoch, the man convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio in the Australian outback in 2001, has died from throat cancer at age 67. Murdoch was serving a life sentence and passed away in a hospital's palliative care unit. Authorities and the victim's family expressed deep regret that he died without ever revealing the location of Falconio's remains, denying the family closure for over two decades. A significant reward remains for information leading to the discovery of the body.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma farmer, Bradley McMichael, was tragically killed by two water buffaloes after he became trapped in their enclosure. The incident occurred just one day after he had purchased the animals at a livestock auction. First responders were initially unable to reach the victim due to the animals' aggressive behavior and had to dispatch both water buffaloes to secure the scene. An investigation confirmed that McMichael's fatal injuries were caused by the animals he was tending to.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signaled a significant shift in its Ukraine policy, announcing that European NATO allies will now purchase U.S. weapons on Ukraine's behalf, allowing for a continued flow of military aid. Alongside this, President Trump has threatened Russia with severe tariffs if it does not agree to end the war within 50 days. This new approach appears to be a tougher stance against Vladimir Putin, but its effectiveness remains uncertain as the details are still vague and Putin may not view the threats as credible.</p>

          <p>The UK's defence secretary has apologized for a major data breach that mistakenly leaked the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for resettlement after supporting British forces. The government learned of the leak in August 2023 but kept it from public knowledge with a super-injunction, which has now been lifted. While stating it is "highly unlikely" to increase risk now, the defence secretary admitted he was "unable to say for sure" if anyone had been killed as a result of the breach.</p>

          <p>A wave of American investment has reshaped Scottish soccer, with six of the 12 top-division clubs now under U.S. ownership following the San Francisco 49ers' takeover of Rangers. The trend is driven by the relatively low cost of entry compared to England's Premier League, access to European competitions, and the rise of multi-club ownership models. While this influx of capital brings hope for a league long dominated by Celtic and Rangers, it also raises concerns among fans about their clubs becoming feeders for larger teams.</p>

          <p>The persistent problem of slow over-rates in Test cricket has again become a major topic of discussion, particularly during the recent England-India series where significant playing time was lost each day. Factors contributing to the delays include frequent ball changes, unscheduled drinks breaks, and player tactics. Experts and commentators are debating potential solutions, ranging from stricter enforcement of the stop-clock to in-game penalties like awarding penalty runs, to ensure fans receive the full value of a day's play.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing among Germany's states over the nation's staggered school holiday schedule, with several states pushing to end what they see as an unfair advantage for Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. These two southern states always begin their summer break last, a tradition linked to Pentecost holidays, which critics say forces families in other states to travel during peak, high-cost periods. However, leaders in the south are resisting calls for change, citing their established cultural and academic rhythm.</p>
