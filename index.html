          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first former French president to be incarcerated, starting a five-year sentence for conspiring to illegally finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libya's late dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. Despite protesting his innocence and filing an appeal, the 70-year-old was taken to La Santé prison in Paris, where he will be held in an isolation wing for his safety. His imprisonment marks a significant moment in French political history, as no former leader has been jailed since World War II collaborator Philippe Pétain. The case has drawn both public support for Sarkozy and widespread condemnation, highlighting deep divisions within the country.</p>

          <p>West Yorkshire Police have arrested two additional men, aged 23 and 39, on suspicion of conspiracy to murder in connection with the death of former Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins. Watkins, who was serving a lengthy sentence for child sex offenses, was killed in an attack at HMP Wakefield on October 11. These arrests follow the previous charging of two other inmates with murder, with a trial scheduled for May 2026. The investigation remains ongoing as authorities continue to probe the circumstances of his death within the high-security prison.</p>

          <p>A group of former tenants, organized by the Debt Collective, is launching a novel "back rent debt strike" to combat what they describe as predatory practices by large corporate landlords like Equity Residential. The campaign provides tenants with a tool to document grievances and generate formal dispute letters, aiming to make debt collection economically unviable for landlords. This new form of activism draws inspiration from successful student loan debt strikes, seeking to transform individual financial struggles into a collective resistance movement. The effort highlights a growing crisis of rental debt that has trapped millions in housing insecurity, particularly after pandemic-era protections expired.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 06:02:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists report that the population of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale has increased for the fourth year in a row, now estimated at 384 individuals. This slight recovery follows a significant 25% decline between 2010 and 2020, offering a sign of cautious optimism for one of the world's rarest marine mammals. Researchers credit new conservation measures, particularly in Canadian waters, for helping to protect the whales from ship collisions and fishing gear entanglement. While the growth is slow and threats remain, an increase in new mother whales and shorter calving intervals suggest the species may be turning a corner.</p>

          <p>The UK government's borrowing in September reached £20.2 billion, the highest level for that month in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase was driven primarily by rising debt interest payments, which offset higher income from taxes and national insurance. The figures present a significant challenge for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is preparing for the upcoming November Budget and is expected to raise taxes to adhere to fiscal rules. Overall public sector debt now stands at 95.3% of GDP, a level not seen since the early 1960s. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent theft of priceless crown jewels from the Louvre Museum in Paris is the latest in a series of high-profile art and artifact robberies that have stunned the world. This incident recalls the audacious 1911 theft of the "Mona Lisa" from the very same museum, a crime that remained unsolved for two years before the masterpiece was recovered. It also brings to mind the still-unsolved 1990 heist at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, where 13 works of art worth half a billion dollars were stolen. The pattern of such brazen breaches has put cultural institutions worldwide on high alert, forcing reviews of security protocols to protect irreplaceable treasures.</p>

          <p>Instagram is implementing new safety measures by automatically placing all users under 18 into a more restrictive content setting, likened to a PG-13 movie rating. However, this move is viewed with skepticism by critics and safety advocates, who point to the platform's history of failed promises to protect young users. Recent research has shown that many of Meta's existing teen safety tools are ineffective, with a high percentage of teens still encountering harmful content and unwanted sexual messages. This article argues that without systemic changes that prioritize safety over engagement, such measures amount to hollow gestures from the social media giant.</p>

Moynihan was previously convicted for his role in the January 6 attack, where he was among the rioters who breached the Senate floor.

          <p>On the coast of southwest Madagascar, a region facing ecological collapse from overfishing and climate change, a small organization is pioneering a new conservation strategy by building artificial coral reefs. The goal is not to restrict fishing, which is a vital source of food and income for the impoverished local population, but to create new habitats to increase fish populations. This people-centric approach acknowledges that traditional conservation methods, like creating protected areas, often fail when they conflict with the basic survival needs of local communities. The project represents a shift toward viewing environmental interventions as public health solutions in one of the world's poorest nations.</p>

Despite the recent moisture, meteorologists caution that this does not change the long-term forecast for a dry winter due to the return of La Niña conditions.

          <p>Pizza Hut's UK restaurant operator has fallen into administration, leading to the closure of 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations across the country and resulting in 1,210 redundancies. The company, DC London Pie Limited, was hit by challenging trading conditions and rising costs, less than a year after it had acquired the restaurants from a previous insolvency. The global brand owner, Yum! Brands, has stepped in to save the remaining 64 UK restaurants and preserve 1,276 jobs. The closures affect numerous cities, including Brighton, Leeds, and Edinburgh, marking a significant downsizing for the well-known dining chain.</p>

          <p>Two abuse survivors, Fiona Goddard and Ellie-Ann Reynolds, have resigned from the advisory panel for the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs, expressing a lack of confidence in the process. In their resignation letters, both women cited a "disturbing conflict of interest" over the shortlisted candidates to chair the inquiry, who reportedly have backgrounds in policing and social services. They also raised concerns that officials were attempting to dilute the inquiry's focus by broadening its scope beyond the specific issue of organized grooming gangs. The government has denied these claims, insisting it is committed to a "laser-focused" investigation.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "Independent," former White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reflects on her time in the Biden administration and explains her decision to leave the Democratic party. She attributes the party's 2024 election loss in part to internal disunity and an inability to rally behind its candidate, a failure she contrasts with the Republican party's solidarity. Jean-Pierre also discusses the unique pressures she faced as the first Black and openly gay person in her role, arguing that some criticism reflected deeper biases. Her move to identify as an independent is intended to spark a conversation about the current state of American politics.</p>

Organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the event brought together people from diverse political backgrounds, such as a three-time Trump voter and a committed Democrat, who set aside their differences for a common cause. Their unified message to lawmakers highlights that support for medical research and health care access remains a rare area of broad bipartisan agreement among the American public.

          <p>The race for New Jersey's next governor is becoming increasingly competitive, with polls showing a narrow gap between Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli. In a state that typically leans Democratic, the close contest has drawn national attention, with prominent figures like Barack Obama and Donald Trump endorsing their respective party's candidates. The campaign has grown more personal, with attacks focusing on Sherrill's military record and Ciattarelli's past business dealings. However, experts believe the election will ultimately be decided by voter concerns over affordability and the high cost of living in the Garden State.</p>

The agreement is designed to bolster supply chains for key materials used in defense and energy, reducing reliance on China. While some smaller miners held onto their gains, major players like Lynas Rare Earths saw their early rally reverse by the end of the trading day. The deal includes direct U.S. investment in projects and aims to create a pricing framework to stabilize volatile global markets for these strategic resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive, day-long outage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that disrupted thousands of online platforms worldwide was resolved on Monday evening. The disruption affected a wide array of services, including social media, gaming, banking, and food delivery, highlighting modern society's heavy reliance on a few major cloud computing providers. Amazon attributed the problem to an issue with its Domain Name System (DNS), which is responsible for translating web addresses into the IP addresses that allow services to load. The incident caused significant frustration for users and businesses, serving as a stark reminder of the internet's underlying vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>Monday's extensive internet outage, which affected numerous major online services, was caused by a fundamental problem at Amazon Web Services (AWS) known as a Domain Name System (DNS) error. DNS acts as the internet's address book, directing traffic to the correct websites and apps; when it failed at a key AWS data center, it effectively lost the map. This article explains that while the cause was technical, the impact was widespread because AWS provides the underlying cloud infrastructure for about a third of the internet. The incident serves as a powerful illustration of the risks associated with the centralization of the internet's core functions among a few tech giants.</p>

          <p>The remains of Tal Haimi, an Israeli non-commissioned officer killed during the October 7, 2023 attack, have been returned to Israel from Gaza. The handover, facilitated by the Red Cross, is part of a U.S.-brokered peace plan that requires Hamas to return all hostages, both living and deceased. Haimi was killed while defending his kibbutz against dozens of terrorists, and his body was subsequently taken into Gaza. The return of his remains is a somber step in the ongoing efforts to fulfill the terms of the peace agreement and bring closure to the families of the victims.</p>
