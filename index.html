          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the location of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred at Devastating Pyrotechnics, left seven individuals unaccounted for. Investigations revealed the facility, located on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, lacked local licenses for fireworks storage. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is assisting Cal Fire in the investigation into the cause of the blast, which also destroyed a home and caused widespread power outages.</p>

          <p>Prominent LA Galaxy supporter groups, including the Angel City Brigade, staged a protest during the team's July 4th match to express frustration over the club's silence regarding recent ICE raids affecting the local Latino community. The fans displayed banners with messages like "Stop the Raids" and walked out of the stadium at the 12th minute. This action follows a pattern of fan activism, as they previously boycotted to successfully demand changes in team management. The groups also organized a fundraiser for immigrant support organizations, highlighting a deep disappointment with the team's lack of public support for its largely Latino fanbase.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite attracting over a million attendees, Pride in London and similar LGBTQ+ events across the UK are facing a precarious future due to significant funding challenges. A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network revealed that over 85 organizations have seen a drop in corporate sponsorships, with some attributing this to a pullback from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives by US-based global companies. Consequently, some Pride events have been canceled or forced to introduce admission fees for the first time to cover rising operational costs for safety and infrastructure. Organizers remain resilient, asserting the movement will adapt and continue despite these financial pressures.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged ear tissue in mice. Their research, published in the journal *Science*, identified a "genetic switch" that reactivates organ regeneration, a capability that appears to have been lost during evolution. The team found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. By reactivating this pathway, they achieved complete restoration of cartilage and other tissues, offering hope that similar mechanisms could one day be applied to human organ repair.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the media and political uproar over a chant led by the punk band Bob Vylan at Glastonbury serves as a diversion from the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The band's "Death to the IDF" chant was widely misreported as "Death to Israelis," fueling accusations of antisemitism and calls for prosecution, which the author contends is a deliberate misframing. The piece suggests this focus on cultural controversies masks the reality of the conflict, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed. It concludes that the public is increasingly aware of this diversionary tactic and is growing more critical of the official narrative surrounding the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran has not complied with demands to allow nuclear inspections or cease its uranium enrichment activities. Speaking to reporters, he claimed that Tehran's nuclear program has been permanently set back, though he acknowledged the possibility of it restarting at a new location. The comments come as the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has withdrawn its last inspectors from Iran following recent US and Israeli military strikes on its nuclear facilities. Trump indicated he would discuss the matter with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his upcoming visit to the White House.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai's administration is facing a dilemma over its portrayal of the island's World War II history, drawing criticism for potentially revisionist policies. The controversy centers on the administration's approach to the Republic of China's (ROC) legacy, which originated on the mainland before the Kuomintang's (KMT) retreat to Taiwan in 1949. Critics argue that by emphasizing a distinct Taiwanese identity, the current government is honoring the ROC's wartime victory as an Allied power while simultaneously downplaying its pre-1949 mainland Chinese roots. This highlights ongoing political tensions over national identity and historical interpretation on the island.</p>

The legislation makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, boosts defense and border security funding, and enacts significant spending cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid. While the administration touts the bill as a win for the country, it passed with narrow Republican support and faced unified opposition from Democrats. Critics warn the law will primarily benefit the wealthy while increasing the national debt by an estimated $3 trillion over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check: Does Trump's New Law Eliminate Federal Taxes on Social Security?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 20:17:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to claims from the Social Security Administration and the White House, President Trump's newly signed "big, beautiful bill" does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts clarify that this provides some relief but is not a repeal of the tax on benefits. The deduction, which applies to all income, will not benefit many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax, and it is set to expire in 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Ruling Allows Trump Administration to Proceed with Deportation of Migrants to South Sudan</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the path for the Trump administration to deport a group of eight migrants with criminal records to South Sudan. The ruling clarified an earlier order, stating a lower court's injunction preventing the removals was no longer enforceable. The case involves migrants from various Asian and Latin American countries who have been held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti. In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressed concern for the deportees' safety, noting they could face torture or death in war-torn South Sudan, a country the State Department advises against traveling to.</p>

          <h2>A Detailed Breakdown of Key Provisions in Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:59:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly passed Republican tax and spending bill contains a wide range of significant policy changes. Key provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increasing the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for five years, and allocating over $46 billion for border wall construction. The legislation also introduces new work requirements for Medicaid and shifts some costs of the SNAP food assistance program to states. Furthermore, it repeals numerous green energy tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and raises the national debt ceiling by $5 trillion to avert a default. (not investment advice)</p>
