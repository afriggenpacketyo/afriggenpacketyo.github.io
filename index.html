          <p>A group of 43 prominent UK peers, including ten distinguished lawyers, has formally warned the government that recognizing a Palestinian state could breach international law. In a letter to the attorney general, they argue that Palestine does not currently meet the statehood criteria outlined in the 1933 Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single effective government. The government has defended its position, noting that the UK is not a signatory to the convention and that 147 other UN members already recognize Palestine. This intervention adds significant legal and political pressure to the Prime Minister's diplomatic strategy.</p>

          <p>An Israeli settler suspected in the fatal shooting of a Palestinian activist had previously been sanctioned by the Biden administration for violence, but these sanctions were lifted by the Trump administration. Yinon Levi was sanctioned last year for alleged attacks on Palestinian civilians, a measure he denied. After taking office, President Trump reversed the sanctions, removing Levi from the Specially Designated Nationals list. The victim, Awdah Hathaleen, was an activist featured in the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land." The incident has drawn criticism from US lawmakers who argue that lifting such sanctions emboldens violent actors.</p>

          <p>Qatar has threatened to stop liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries to Europe, including a key deal with Germany, over a new EU directive on corporate sustainability. The regulation requires companies to address human rights and environmental issues in their supply chains, with potential fines up to 5% of global turnover. Qatar argues the climate rules are overly burdensome and conflict with its national energy strategy, which views LNG as a transition fuel. This dispute puts Germany's energy security at risk, as any disruption could tighten supply and cause prices to surge, especially during winter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cambodia is appealing for the immediate release of 20 of its soldiers who were captured by Thailand hours after a ceasefire was declared between the two nations. The truce, which followed five days of border clashes that killed 43 people, appears to be holding despite the tensions. The Thai government stated the soldiers are being treated humanely and will be returned once the border situation stabilizes. This conflict is the latest in a long-running dispute over temples along their shared border. The ceasefire was reportedly brokered after US President Donald Trump threatened both countries with tariffs if the fighting continued.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump is successfully defeating the "liberal media" and achieving significant policy goals during his second term. The author points to the defunding of NPR and PBS, staff departures at The Washington Post, and legal settlements with news outlets as evidence of Trump's triumph over his media adversaries. The piece also credits his administration with securing the border, strengthening the economy through strategic tariffs, and decisively supporting Israel. The author contends that these successes, particularly in challenging established media narratives, represent a major victory for conservative principles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US federal appeals court is set to hear arguments challenging the legality of President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs, a case that could derail his trade strategy. The lawsuit, led by a wine importer and 12 states, argues that the President overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose tariffs without congressional approval. No previous president has used this act to justify tariffs. The legal challenge also targets fentanyl-related tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada, creating a significant test for the administration's expansive use of executive power in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a federal agency distributing over $12 billion annually to community health programs, has lost about a quarter of its workforce due to Trump administration purges. Former leaders warn these cuts threaten the agency's ability to fund essential services like addiction treatment, maternal care, and rural hospitals nationwide. The reduction of over 700 employees has already halted at least one scholarship program for disadvantaged health students. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the firings jeopardize the nation's health care safety net, while the administration cites the need for organizational changes.</p>

Jaouad suggests reading passages from other writers' diaries to gain new perspectives and overcome writer's block. For those new to journaling, she recommends setting a consistent time, integrating it into an existing routine like a morning coffee, and keeping the barrier to entry low by using any available medium, including a phone's notes app.</p>

This marks a shift from the administration's first term, which sometimes offered support for Christian refugees.

In contrast, jobs requiring physical work, such as painters, nursing assistants, massage therapists, and automotive repairers, had the lowest interaction with and potential impact from AI.

The incident involved 44 teenagers being removed from a Vueling flight in Valencia, with the airline citing safety risks due to alleged misbehavior. The French government also criticized the use of force by Spanish police against one of the group's counselors during the event.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent trade deal between the European Union and the United States represents a moment of capitulation for the EU, akin to Britain's Suez crisis in 1956. The author contends that the one-sided agreement, in which the EU accepted 15% tariffs and committed to massive US investments and energy purchases in exchange for avoiding a trade war, exposes its subservience to Washington. The article contrasts the EU's approach with China's, which retaliated against US tariffs, forcing a more measured response. The author concludes that the deal demonstrates Europe's diminished economic and geopolitical influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are expressing interest in China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet as an alternative to Boeing and Airbus aircraft. According to Malaysia's Transport Minister, the growing demand for air travel in Southeast Asia, combined with long delivery wait times from the two dominant manufacturers, is driving this interest. China is actively promoting its C919, manufactured by Comac, as a more readily available and cheaper option for narrowbody airliners. This potential diversification of aircraft procurement could mark a significant shift in the regional aviation market if deals are confirmed.</p>

U.S. officials accused the judge of suppressing free expression and authorizing arbitrary detentions. Concurrently, President Donald Trump signed an executive order raising tariffs on many Brazilian goods to 50%, linking the move to what he called the "politically motivated persecution" of Bolsonaro. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the actions as an "unacceptable" interference in the country's sovereignty but affirmed a willingness to negotiate on trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canada and Malta have announced they will formally recognize the state of Palestine in September, joining a growing number of Western nations applying diplomatic pressure to advance a two-state solution. The announcements from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Malta's Foreign Ministry came during a UN General Assembly meeting on the issue. This follows similar pledges from France and the United Kingdom, marking a significant shift among G7 and European countries. Israel has condemned the moves, arguing they legitimize terrorism and undermine efforts to release hostages, while proponents insist recognition is a crucial step toward achieving a just and lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Australia's pioneering national ban on social media for youths, intended to combat a perceived mental health crisis, faces significant challenges regarding its effectiveness and enforcement. While the policy enjoys strong public support, some experts question the causal link between social media use and poor mental health, suggesting other factors like social inequity and climate anxiety are also at play. Critics argue that a ban could push young people to less regulated corners of the internet and that education is a better approach. The government is currently trialing age-assurance technologies to police the ban, which is set to take effect in December.</p>

The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the relics and will now place them on permanent public display in India.

          <p>As the August 1st deadline for President Trump's global tariffs looms, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of U.S. trade agreements. The U.S. has secured framework deals with eight partners, including the EU, UK, and Japan, which generally set baseline tariffs of 10-20% but involve significant concessions. However, major trading partners like Canada, Mexico, and India still face the threat of much higher tariffs amid stalled negotiations rooted in political and economic disputes. Meanwhile, talks with China remain ongoing, and a federal court is set to rule on the legality of the tariffs themselves. (not investment advice)</p>
