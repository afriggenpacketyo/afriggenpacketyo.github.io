          <p>The Social Security Administration has reversed its decision to eliminate paper checks for beneficiaries, following concerns raised by lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren. The agency will continue issuing checks to approximately 600,000 recipients who lack bank accounts or rely on physical payments, a group that includes many elderly and low-income individuals. While the SSA will still promote the security and efficiency of electronic transfers, it has committed to ensuring no one is left behind by the digital transition. This policy shift also comes amid broader scrutiny of the agency's customer service and staffing levels.</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, the legendary professional wrestler known worldwide as Hulk Hogan, has passed away at the age of 71. He was pronounced dead after being transported to a hospital for a cardiac arrest, with authorities reporting no signs of foul play. Hogan was a transformative figure in entertainment, popularizing professional wrestling in the 1980s with his "Hulkamania" persona and helping establish WWE as a global brand. Beyond the ring, he was a mainstream celebrity with numerous film and television appearances and a recent supporter of Donald Trump's political career.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News critically examines the announcement of President Joe Biden's $10 million memoir deal, questioning his ability to write the book himself given his age and perceived cognitive state. The author suggests the book will likely be ghostwritten by his inner circle, serving as an attempt to shape his legacy and settle political scores rather than offer a genuine personal account. The piece speculates the memoir will be a defensive "official version" of his presidency, potentially reflecting the more aggressive style recently displayed by his son, Hunter Biden. The author argues that a truthful account would be more valuable.</p>

          <p>The power of the U.S. passport has continued to decline, now ranking 10th globally in the Henley Passport Index, a significant drop from its top position in 2014. The ranking, which measures the number of destinations a holder can enter without a visa, places the U.S. (182 destinations) well behind top-ranked Singapore (193 destinations). The report suggests that restrictive entry policies in the U.S. and U.K. are contributing to their fall in the rankings. Despite the drop, the State Department maintains confidence in the passport's strength, while the index highlights the importance of proactive diplomacy in maintaining travel freedom.</p>

          <p>England established a dominant position in the fourth Test against India, driven by a powerful performance from both its batters and bowlers at Old Trafford. Captain Ben Stokes secured his first five-wicket haul in eight years, helping to dismiss India for 358 despite a courageous half-century from an injured Rishabh Pant. In response, England's openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett launched an aggressive assault, putting on a 166-run partnership. By the close of play, England reached 225-2, significantly reducing their deficit and strengthening their chances of winning the series.</p>

          <p>England's resident doctors are set to begin a five-day strike over a long-running pay dispute, prompting the Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, to express deep regret over the situation.

Evers' tenure was marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively, and his push for redrawn electoral maps that have made the state more competitive for Democrats.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve headquarters, escalating his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. The visit follows Trump's recent suggestion that cost overruns on a Fed building renovation, estimated at $2.5 billion, could be grounds for firing Powell. For months, the president has criticized the Fed for not cutting interest rates, a move he believes would stimulate the economy and reduce government borrowing costs. Any attempt to fire the Fed chair would challenge the central bank's long-held independence and likely cause significant instability in financial markets.</p>

This development suggests a broadening of the administration's efforts to challenge and potentially reshape policies and curricula at a wider range of public and private academic institutions across the country.

          <h2>Analysis Shows Long Repayment Period for Significant Credit Card Debt</h2>

          <p>An analysis of credit card debt reveals the immense challenge of paying off a large balance, such as $40,000, especially with current high interest rates. At an average APR of nearly 22%, making only the minimum monthly payments could take approximately 41 years and accrue over $76,000 in interest. The article explores more aggressive repayment strategies, showing that increasing monthly payments to $1,500 could clear the debt in about three years. It also outlines alternative debt relief options for those with substantial balances, including debt settlement, consolidation loans, and debt management programs, as viable paths to becoming debt-free faster.

          <p>American Airlines shares fell 9% after the carrier issued a third-quarter profit forecast that missed analyst expectations and reinstated its 2025 financial outlook at a level far below its initial predictions. The airline now forecasts a 2025 adjusted per-share result ranging from a 20-cent loss to an 80-cent profit, citing consumer weakness, flat corporate travel, and operational issues from storms. CEO Robert Isom described July as a "tough month" but noted that demand appears to be improving for the coming months. The disappointing forecast follows similar downward revisions from competitors Delta and United. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following widespread protests and condemnation from the European Union, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced he will submit a new anti-corruption bill to parliament. An earlier version of the legislation, which gave the government more control over anti-corruption bodies, sparked the country's largest unrest since the 2022 Russian invasion. The new bill is intended to guarantee the independence of these watchdog agencies, a key demand from both Ukrainian citizens and international partners. Tackling corruption is a crucial requirement for Ukraine's ambitions to join the EU and secure continued Western aid for its war effort.</p>

This development comes amid growing pressure on the Trump administration to be more transparent about the Epstein case, particularly after the DOJ concluded there was no "client list."

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has established a "strike force" to investigate allegations that the Obama administration manipulated intelligence to suggest Russia interfered in the 2016 election. The move follows the declassification of documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who claims there was a "treasonous conspiracy" against Donald Trump. While Trump has embraced the claims, Obama's office has called them "outrageous." This investigation targets former high-ranking officials, though any potential prosecution of a former president faces hurdles from a recent Supreme Court immunity ruling.</p>

BT, which owns EE, apologized for the disruption and stated it was working urgently to resolve the problem.

The premiere directly referenced recent controversies, including Paramount's lawsuit settlement with Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," framing the events as a capitulation to presidential pressure.

The phenomenon is caused by a persistent high-pressure system trapping hot air over a large region. In the Midwest's Corn Belt, the heat has been exacerbated by "corn sweat," a process where vast amounts of water vapor are released from cornfields, significantly increasing humidity and the heat index.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended a new trade deal with Japan that sets a lower tariff on imported Japanese cars than on vehicles U.S. companies build in Canada and Mexico. Lutnick dismissed criticism from an auto industry group representing GM, Ford, and Stellantis, claiming he had spoken to the company CEOs and that they were "cool with" the arrangement. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on cars from Japan, while American automakers face a 25% tariff on their North American imports.

Since the checks began, Polish border guards have reportedly refused entry to over 100 people attempting to cross irregularly.
