          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. and China have reached a trade deal framework, pending final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping.

The deal also includes provisions for Chinese students to attend U.S. colleges and universities. This announcement follows recent trade talks in London aimed at easing tensions between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The WTA Tour will now offer ranking protection for female tennis players who freeze their eggs or embryos, allowing them to start a family later without jeopardizing their careers. This offer is available to players ranked in the top 750 who spend more than 10 weeks away from competition. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, shared that she has previously frozen her eggs and emphasized the importance of this rule in reducing pressure on players to return to the court prematurely.

This spending review is not a budget where taxes are changed or new policies are announced, but it has an impact on finances, jobs, and the cost of living.

          <p>According to the New York Times, China is navigating a delicate balance in trade talks with the U.S., carefully considering how to leverage its control over rare earth supplies without damaging its reputation as a reliable supplier. China's ability to limit access to these critical materials provides a strategic advantage, but it must weigh this against the potential long-term consequences of being perceived as an unreliable trading partner. The analysis suggests that China is keen to avoid actions that could undermine its credibility on the global stage. The New York Times article provides insight into the complex considerations shaping China's approach to trade negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising costs and market uncertainty impacting retirees, experts are weighing in on the safety of annuities as a retirement income solution. An annuity is a contract with an insurance company where an individual provides a lump sum or multiple payments in exchange for guaranteed income over a set term or for life. Fixed annuities are generally considered the safest option during market downturns, offering a set interest rate and payment term, while variable annuities carry more risk due to market exposure. Fixed indexed annuities offer a balance between the two, with potential for higher returns linked to a market index while preserving the principal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old Austrian man shot and killed nine students and a teacher at a secondary school in Graz before taking his own life. The incident marks the deadliest mass shooting in Austria's recent history, prompting the country to declare three days of mourning. Police are investigating the motive of the gunman, a former student who did not graduate from the school. Authorities found a "farewell letter", "farewell video", and a non-functional pipe bomb at the suspect's home.</p>

Financial advisors emphasize the importance of staying calm during market fluctuations and maintaining a long-term perspective. Investors have seen bigger returns in the early days of previous presidencies, but the market's resilience underscores the risk of impulsive exits during turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>
