          <p>A New Jersey federal judge refused the government's request to transfer Mahmoud Khalil's case to Louisiana.  The judge cited Khalil's presence in New Jersey when the petition was filed, maintaining jurisdiction. This decision allows the judge to address the core issue of Khalil's detention, closer to his wife who is expecting a child.  The government argued for Louisiana jurisdiction due to Khalil's current location in a detention center there.</p>
