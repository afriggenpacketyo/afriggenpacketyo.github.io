          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole. The brothers, who previously faced life without parole, claim they acted in self-defense due to years of abuse. The resentencing hearing included testimony from family members who believe they have been rehabilitated and should be released. Prosecutors maintain the brothers meticulously planned the killings for financial gain and have not taken full responsibility. The California Board of Parole Hearings will now review their case before it potentially reaches the governor's office, with separate hearings scheduled for Erik and Lyle in June.</p>

In other news, Japan and the WTO have agreed to strengthen the multilateral trade system amid rising concerns over protectionism.

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams's use of at least seven different cellphone numbers during a federal corruption investigation has raised eyebrows. Adams explained that he used multiple phones for different purposes, including office, personal, and campaign use, and obtained additional phones after federal authorities seized his devices. The FBI tracked his location using cellphone data as part of an investigation that initially led to his indictment on bribery and other charges, which were later dismissed. Adams criticized the tactics used by federal authorities, attributing his inability to remember his phone password to dyslexia and suggesting the seizure of his devices at the marathon was intended to humiliate him.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to debate the Trump administration's restrictions on birthright citizenship, focusing on the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. The court will consider whether to narrow the scope of injunctions that have blocked President Trump's executive order ending automatic citizenship for children of people in the U.S. illegally. Conservative justices have expressed concerns about universal injunctions, arguing they disrupt the federal court system. The debate is expected to expose ideological divides within the court's conservative majority, particularly regarding challenges to Trump policies.</p>

          <p>A rock climber survived a 400-foot fall in Washington's North Cascades mountains that killed his three companions. The surviving climber, despite suffering internal bleeding and head trauma, hiked to his car and drove to a payphone to call for help. The group was descending the Early Winters Spires when the anchor securing their ropes failed, causing the fall. Responders found an old piton still clipped to the ropes, suggesting it may have been the failed anchor. The route was moderately difficult, requiring movement between ice, snow, and rock, and conditions can change rapidly with the weather.</p>

          <p>Federal judges across the U.S. are facing a disturbing trend of "pizza doxxing," where unsolicited pizzas are sent to their homes, often with the recipient listed as Daniel Anderl, the deceased son of Judge Esther Salas. Salas views these incidents as attempts at "psychological warfare" against judges. The U.S. Marshals Service is investigating these incidents, which appear designed to send a threatening message. Security analysts warn that such hoax deliveries could be used to confirm a judge's address for a potential attack, as threats against judges have been on the rise in recent years.</p>

          <p>Netflix has acquired the documentary film "Selena y Los Dinos," which explores the life of Tejano music icon Selena Quintanilla, and is scheduled to begin streaming in winter 2025. Directed by Isabel Castro, the film features original VHS footage taken by Selena's sister, Suzette, and includes interviews with family and friends. The documentary surfaces footage from performances in which Selena subverts the idea of the well-manicured image that the Quintanilla family has constantly put out of the singer in the 30 years since her death. It also captures, in real time, the evolution of a bold new identity growing among Latino youth in the 1980s, encapsulated in Los Dinosâ€™ cultural hybridity.</p>
