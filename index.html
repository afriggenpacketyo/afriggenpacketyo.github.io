        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is determined to proceed with welfare reforms aimed at cutting the benefits bill by Â£5 billion by 2033. These reforms include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) for disabled individuals. Dozens of Labour MPs have voiced concerns, but the Prime Minister insists the current system is not working for those needing support or taxpayers. The proposed changes involve scrapping the work capability assessment in 2028 and focusing on a single assessment based on the Pip system, which could affect up to 1.3 million people in England and Wales. </p>

He has directed ICE officers to do all in their power to achieve the "single largest Mass Deportation Program in History," focusing on the removal of immigrants and preventing the entry of anyone who undermines domestic tranquility.</p>

He recalls the U.S.'s defense of Israel against unbalanced resolutions and criticizes some council members for undermining negotiations. Wood emphasizes the need for Hamas to disarm for peace to be achieved and calls for an end to the politicization of the conflict. He notes that the hesitancy of many countries to condemn Hamas has only prolonged the suffering in Gaza.</p>

He suggests that the U.S. is transitioning away from discourse, with violence becoming a more settled means of politics. Trump's military parade is seen as a demonstration of his mastery of violence, but it also reveals weakness in both Trump and the American people. The article portrays a grim picture of American politics, with the spectacle of the parade serving as a distraction from deeper issues of destabilization and violence.</p>

          <p>The increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and data storage is projected to drive up electricity consumption, potentially leading to higher electricity bills for consumers.

Experts estimate that data centers will require substantial additional power capacity in the coming years. This surge in demand, combined with other factors, could compromise grid reliability and raise electricity prices for households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amid increasing tensions with Beijing. The two leading Chinese chip firms are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to them. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and aims to tighten potential loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches. This decision highlights Taiwan's commitment to restricting the flow of advanced technology to Chinese companies involved in activities that raise national security concerns.</p>

          <p>The US island chain strategy, conceived in 1951, aimed to contain the Soviet Union and China using American-aligned island bases in the Western Pacific. Taiwan was central to this strategy, described as an "unsinkable aircraft carrier." The first island chain stretches from the Kuril Islands to Borneo, while the second extends further east to include Guam. China's recent naval exercises, with aircraft carriers operating beyond the second island chain, highlight its growing blue-water naval ambitions and challenge the US's strategic boundaries.</p>

          <p>Scotland is set to export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England following the implementation of a landfill ban on biodegradable municipal waste. The ban, aimed at reducing methane emissions, faces challenges due to insufficient incinerator capacity in Scotland. While temporarily transporting waste is deemed environmentally preferable to landfilling, concerns arise regarding increased emissions from transportation and the impact on recycling efforts. Environmental groups worry that incineration contracts may discourage investment in recycling initiatives, hindering the development of a circular economy.</p>
