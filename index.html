          <p>The man arrested for killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk appeared to confess on the chat platform Discord just hours before his arrest. In messages to a group of friends, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson allegedly wrote, "It was me at UVU yesterday," taking responsibility for the shooting at Utah Valley University. While the FBI is investigating the chat, Discord stated its internal review found no evidence that the suspect planned the attack or promoted violence on its platform. Robinson was later taken into custody on multiple charges, including aggravated murder.</p>

          <p>A 71-year-old man, George Zinn, has been charged with obstruction of justice after allegedly faking a confession to the murder of Charlie Kirk. Authorities state Zinn admitted he "yelled that he was the shooter to allow the actual suspect to flee," causing a temporary distraction for law enforcement at the scene. An investigation found no evidence of collusion between Zinn and the primary suspect, Tyler Robinson. Zinn is also facing separate charges for possession of child sex abuse material found during the investigation.</p>

With a current valuation around $850 billion, JPMorgan's stock has seen significant gains this year, fueled by strong sector performance and an expansion of its price-to-earnings multiple as investors show renewed confidence in financial institutions.

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, several of its journalists, and a book publisher. The suit alleges that articles published in 2024 were malicious and intended to undermine his presidential campaign. The New York Times responded by calling the lawsuit an attempt to stifle independent reporting that lacks legitimate legal claims. Legal experts note that defamation suits from public figures face a very high legal standard, known as "actual malice," making them difficult to win.</p>

          <p>Strong winds in Washington state have stirred up volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, creating hazy conditions and lowering air quality. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs when dry conditions and high winds lift the loose, decades-old ash back into the atmosphere. The U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have both confirmed that this is not due to any new volcanic activity. However, they have warned that the resuspended ash can be hazardous to aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic examines the irony of Charlie Kirk's allies using his murder to call for crackdowns on dissent and "hate speech." The article notes that Kirk built his career on defending free speech, even for controversial or abrasive ideas, as a tool to spread his conservative message in hostile environments. Now that his political allies are in power, some are advocating for the suppression of speech they dislike, a stance that contradicts the principles Kirk often championed. This highlights a significant tension within the modern conservative movement regarding the limits of free expression.</p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was hospitalized on Tuesday after feeling unwell while under house arrest. His son reported that the 70-year-old experienced severe hiccups, vomiting, and low blood pressure. Bolsonaro was recently convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for plotting a coup to overthrow the current government after his 2022 election loss, a verdict his lawyers plan to appeal. He has been hospitalized multiple times since being stabbed during his 2018 presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell sharply to 6.13%, its lowest point since late 2022.

The arrangement would require existing American users to migrate to a new application. This extension prevents the Department of Justice from enforcing a law that would effectively ban the popular social media app in the United States while the final details are resolved.</p>
