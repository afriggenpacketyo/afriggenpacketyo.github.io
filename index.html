          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of Democratic State Representative Gene Wu, labeling him the 'ringleader' of lawmakers who fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting vote. The emergency petition to the Texas Supreme Court claims Wu and others abandoned their duties, justifying their removal from office. In response, Wu asserted that denying a quorum was a fulfillment of his constitutional oath to prevent a 'racist gerrymandered map' and not an abandonment of his constituents. The lawsuit escalates the political standoff over a plan that would create five new Republican-favoring congressional districts.</p>

          <p>During a nine-hour interview with the Department of Justice, convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell stated that former President Trump never engaged in any concerning behavior in her presence, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Trump administration is reportedly considering the public release of the interview transcripts and audio recordings. Maxwell, who recently requested the interview, is currently appealing her 20-year prison sentence to the Supreme Court and has not been ruled out for a potential presidential pardon. The meeting occurred as Maxwell was transferred to a more relaxed prison facility in Texas.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may be significantly overstating its cost-cutting achievements. The review focused on three large contract cancellations with the Department of Health and Human Services, which DOGE claimed saved $6.4 billion. However, the analysis found the actual savings were closer to $165 million, less than 3% of the claimed amount, as the larger figure represented a potential value that was unlikely to be spent. Critics label the agency's 'Wall of Receipts' as 'transparency theater,' noting that its total claimed savings of $199 billion are poorly documented.</p>

          <p>Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is publicly urging former President Trump to commute the seven-year prison sentence of former Congressman George Santos. In a letter to the DOJ's pardon attorney, Greene called the sentence for wire fraud and identity theft a 'grave injustice' and an 'abusive overreach,' arguing that other members of Congress have committed worse offenses without facing charges. Santos, who pleaded guilty to fabricating donor reports and stealing from campaign contributors, began serving his sentence in late July. Greene contends that Santos has shown remorse and accepted responsibility for his actions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was 'preventable' and resulted from OceanGate's use of 'intimidation tactics' to evade regulatory oversight. The 300-page report details how the company operated outside established deep-sea protocols, ignored warnings about hull damage, and fostered a 'toxic' safety culture where employee concerns were suppressed. Investigators faulted the company's late co-founder, Stockton Rush, for overconfidence and negligence that contributed to the deaths of all five people aboard. The report states that had Rush survived, a criminal investigation would have been recommended.</p>

The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% decline in property crime compared to the previous year. Notably, murders fell by 14.9% and motor vehicle thefts saw a record 18.6% one-year drop. While hate crimes saw a slight overall decrease, the report does not provide a detailed breakdown of targets.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire is spreading rapidly through the Corbieres hills in southwestern France, fueled by strong winds and dry conditions. The blaze has burned over 9,200 hectares, injured two people, and forced the partial evacuation of camping grounds and a village. Authorities have closed a section of the A9 motorway, a key route connecting France and Spain, to manage the emergency. Over 1,200 firefighters, supported by water-bombing aircraft, are battling the flames in what is described as one of the driest areas in the region.</p>

Both men, who have pleaded not guilty to extensive drug trafficking charges, are among Mexico's most infamous narcos. Caro Quintero is also charged with the 1985 murder of a DEA agent. The decision, directed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, removes capital punishment as a possibility but it remains unclear if it signals potential plea negotiations.

It explains that the atmosphere is a 'chaotic system,' where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, a concept known as the Butterfly Effect. Communicating complex meteorological data in a simple format also presents a major challenge. The piece discusses the future of forecasting, including the transformative potential of AI models like Cambridge University's Aardvark Weather, which can predict weather with greater accuracy and speed. Ultimately, forecasters aim to provide more impact-based predictions, explaining what the weather will mean for people's daily lives.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from the fashion retailer Zara, ruling they were 'irresponsible' for featuring models who appeared 'unhealthily thin.' The watchdog noted that lighting and posing made one model look 'gaunt,' while another image emphasized 'protruding' collarbones. Zara, which has since removed the ads, stated that both models had medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers like Marks & Spencer and Next, reflecting a growing regulatory focus on promoting healthy body images in advertising.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. While the company's revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed estimates, its adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents missed the 49-cent forecast. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, noted that AI business revenue declined due to U.S. export restrictions on sales to China. Despite this, the company saw strong growth in its data center and client computing segments and remains a key competitor to Nvidia in the growing market for AI chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Escalating trade tensions between the United States and India are creating uncertainty around a potential visit by President Trump this fall and casting doubt on the future of the Quad security alliance. The White House has been pushing for significant 'deliverables,' such as a comprehensive trade agreement, to coincide with the visit, but a breakthrough appears unlikely. Trump's recent threats of new tariffs and criticism of India's oil purchases from Russia have reportedly left New Delhi feeling 'bitter.' The growing rift tests the relationship between the two democracies and could weaken the strategic bloc, which also includes Japan and Australia.</p>

          <p>Shares of Snap Inc. fell over 15% after the company reported disappointing second-quarter financial results, particularly a key metric for user monetization. While the company's daily active users grew to 469 million, its global average revenue per user (ARPU) of $2.87 missed expectations. CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weak topline growth to a bungled advertising platform update, the timing of Ramadan, and changes in trade policy. The company provided a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of estimates, but the weak ARPU figure concerned investors about its ability to generate advertising revenue.

          <p>The United States is making a significant push to reduce its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for everything from electronics to military technology. A key part of this strategy is the revival of California's Mountain Pass mine, a site that once dominated global production but has faced shutdowns and bankruptcy. The Department of Defense is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to re-establish a domestic supply chain, an urgent priority for the Trump administration. This effort reflects a broader geopolitical struggle as the U.S. works to secure its own sources of these critical minerals.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group has lowered its full-year production forecast after reporting second-quarter financial results that missed Wall Street expectations. The company now expects to produce 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles, down from a previous target of 20,000, citing supply chain constraints and a slower-than-expected ramp-up of its Gravity SUV. Lucid's revenue and earnings per share both fell short of analyst projections, causing its stock to drop in after-hours trading. The news comes as the EV industry faces slowing demand and prepares for changes to federal tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations aimed at making it easier for companies to use drones for commercial purposes, such as deliveries and inspections. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the proposal, which would streamline the approval process for businesses to operate drones beyond the pilot's line of sight. Under the new rules, commercial drones would need to meet specific safety standards, including having collision avoidance technology, and would be restricted from flying over large crowds. The move is intended to spur innovation and help the U.S. catch up with other countries in the deployment of commercial drone technology.</p>

          <p>During an earnings call, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson criticized AI companies for the 'blatant theft' of intellectual property, using an unexpected example to make his point. He noted the irony that even President Trump, whose books like 'The Art of the Deal' are being consumed by AI engines without compensation, is a victim of this practice, turning 'The Art of the Deal' into 'The Art of the Steal.' Thomson affirmed that News Corp will continue its 'woo-and-sue' strategy, seeking both partnerships and legal action to protect the intellectual property of its journalists and authors from being used to train AI models without payment.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is warning hunters after wild pigs in Monterey County were discovered with bright blue muscle and fat tissue. Officials believe the coloration is caused by the pigs consuming diphacinone, an anticoagulant rodenticide used by agricultural operations to control squirrels and other pests. The poison, which is dyed blue, can remain in an animal's tissue and cause 'secondary exposure' to predators or humans who consume the meat. Authorities are urging the public not to eat meat from any animal showing signs of blue pigmentation and to report such findings.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from redirecting funds from the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 Democratic-led states, which argued that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) could not cancel the multibillion-dollar grant program without congressional approval. The BRIC program helps communities protect critical infrastructure against natural disasters. The judge ruled that the states showed a realistic chance of irreparable harm if the program, designed to save lives, were to be ended.</p>
