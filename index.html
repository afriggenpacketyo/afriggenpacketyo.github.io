          <p>An aerial bombing targeted a Doctors Without Borders (MSF) facility in Old Fangak, South Sudan, resulting in at least seven deaths, including a 9-month-old child, and 25 injuries. The attack destroyed the hospital's pharmacy and medical supplies, severely impacting the only source of medical care for 40,000 residents, many displaced by flooding. MSF condemned the attack as a violation of international humanitarian law, and eyewitnesses reported additional strikes near the Old Fangak market, causing panic and displacement. The hospital is located in an ethnically Nuer part of the country historically associated with the opposition party, and the attack is seen as an escalation in a government-led assault on opposition groups.</p>

          <p>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has laid off most of its remaining staff, severely impacting worker safety programs, including those related to firefighter health and the World Trade Center Health Program. These layoffs, following an initial round on April 1 ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have stalled new safety equipment approvals and halted investigations into workplace hazards. While HHS claims essential services will remain intact, laid-off employees argue that the cuts compromise worker safety across various sectors, including healthcare and emergency services, and have halted efforts to combat counterfeit protective equipment.</p>

          <p>Kelly Stafford, wife of Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, discussed the relationship between Bill Belichick and his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, on her podcast, noting that Hudson's social media presence makes their personal life "fair game" for public scrutiny. This comes after Hudson interrupted an interview with Belichick to shut down a question about how the couple met, leading to accusations from Belichick that CBS created a "false narrative" with selectively edited clips. CBS responded by stating there were no preconditions or limitations to the interview, and the company disagreed with Belichickâ€™s version of events. Hudson has posted numerous photos of Belichick on her social media accounts.</p>

Roberts enjoys the sense of safety, access to good food, and accessibility in Germany, noting that she structures her days differently, has healthier eating habits, and overthinks things less.

He has also rolled back policies related to diversity and race, facing pushback from students who believe these changes prioritize optics over values. Garber's actions aim to preserve the integrity of the university and restore trust in academia amid growing skepticism about higher education.</p>

The company estimates $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027, stemming from expense savings and network benefits, with debit card volume expected to fully transition to the Discover network, providing a regulatory advantage by exempting it from swipe fee caps.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that domestication has led to cats and dogs evolving similar skull shapes, driven by human selection. Despite millions of years of evolutionary separation, selective breeding has caused some breeds to develop similar facial features, such as flat faces. This convergence, while appealing to human preferences for infant-like traits, often results in health problems for the animals, including breathing difficulties and neurological conditions. The findings highlight the powerful role humans play in shaping the evolution of domesticated species and the importance of considering animal welfare in breeding practices.</p>

          <p>Following a Guardian investigation, Zinc Nacional, a factory in Mexico that processes hazardous waste imported from the U.S., has committed to relocating its most polluting operations. The investigation revealed evidence of heavy-metals pollution in surrounding neighborhoods. The company will move its "intensive" operations outside the Monterrey metropolitan area within two years and construct a large enclosure to contain materials at the existing site. Neighbors express skepticism, citing years of exposure to dust and smoke from the plant, with some suspecting the pollution is causing illnesses.</p>

          <p>Financial markets are increasingly serving as a check on populist excesses, reacting swiftly to policies that threaten economic stability and global trade. Fund managers and pension funds have demonstrated their sensitivity to leaders' attempts at radical change, as seen with Donald Trump's tariffs and Liz Truss's borrowing spree. While these market reactions can temper extreme policies, they also leave behind a sense of anger and disillusionment among those who feel left behind by the existing system, potentially fueling social unrest.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that grizzly bears could potentially return to California, where they were eradicated by the mid-1920s. The study identifies three regions in the state that could support a robust grizzly population and highlights the ecological benefits of reintroducing the species. While the prospect has garnered support, concerns remain about potential conflicts with humans. Any reintroduction effort would be a slow, deliberate process, starting with a small number of wild-born female bears in remote areas.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to raise prices and potentially lower the quality of Halloween and Christmas novelties for American consumers. With nearly 90% of these festive products imported from China, retailers are struggling to absorb the additional costs or find alternative sources.

The activist investor sees opportunities to accelerate growth by focusing on the core business, improve margins through tighter management, and optimize the balance sheet by leveraging up for investments and stock buybacks. Fivespan also appreciates businesses with potential for strategic transactions, and an unsolicited offer for Qiagen is not out of the realm of possibility.</p>

Experts found that people who have had a stroke are more likely to develop depression or dementia, and vice versa, and the study details the top three practices that experts found have the greatest effect on your chances of staving off these brain conditions.</p>
