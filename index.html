          <p>Former Congressman George Santos has been sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft. The sentencing marks the culmination of Santos's downfall, triggered by allegations of fabricating his background and misusing campaign funds for personal expenses. Santos apologized in court, but the judge remained unconvinced, highlighting his election through deceit. He will report to prison in July and is ordered to pay over $374,000 in restitution for misusing campaign funds and illegally claiming unemployment benefits, after an investigation revealed he lied about his education, employment history, and even fabricated stories about his family's past. </p>

          <p>New research suggests that creatine, a popular weightlifting supplement, may be effective in treating depression. Studies have shown that creatine aids brain function by improving energy metabolism, potentially alleviating symptoms of depression. A recent study in India indicated that creatine, when combined with talk therapy, led to significant improvements in depression symptoms compared to therapy alone. While researchers emphasize the preliminary nature of these findings, creatine's affordability and accessibility make it a promising avenue for mental health treatment, especially in resource-limited settings.

          <p>Amazon sellers are raising prices on numerous goods due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, with average price hikes nearing 30%. This affects a wide range of products, including tech accessories and clothing, as importers pass on additional costs to consumers. Other e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu are also increasing prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that allowed duty-free entry for goods under $800. While Trump claims negotiations are ongoing, Chinese officials deny active talks, leaving uncertainty about future tariff rates. </p>

          <p>Democrats are divided on how to address President Trump's deportation of undocumented immigrants to El Salvador, particularly the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Some Democrats advocate for highlighting the due process violations, while others fear it plays into Trump's strengths on immigration. Strategists worry that focusing on immigration could overshadow economic concerns and reinforce the narrative that Democrats prioritize foreigners over American citizens. However, others argue that standing up for due process is a moral imperative and that the political costs are negligible if messaging remains disciplined. </p>

London's implementation of low emission zones has shown promise in reducing pollution and improving health-related economic factors. These zones have led to reductions in nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, resulting in fewer sick days and respiratory problems among Londoners. </p>

          <p>Pope Francis's funeral presents a rare opportunity for world leaders to conduct impromptu diplomacy. While formal meetings are unlikely due to the solemn nature of the event, leaders may engage in brief conversations on the sidelines. All eyes will be on whether Presidents Trump and Zelensky use the opportunity to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine. The funeral Mass itself could present unpredictable moments, such as leaders unexpectedly shaking hands with adversaries. </p>

          <h2>AI's Role in Cancer Cures: Beyond the Hype</h2>

          <p>While Silicon Valley touts AI's potential to cure cancer, scientists offer a more nuanced perspective. Generative AI can contribute to scientific discovery by summarizing research, generating hypotheses, and analyzing biological data. AI systems can help scientists more efficiently balance molecular traits and identify promising drug targets. However, limitations include the tendency to "hallucinate" and the need for high-quality training data. Ultimately, AI's role may be to drastically improve scientific efficiency, not to replace human scientists. </p>

          <h2>California Sees Sharp Increase in Valley Fever Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 14:38:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is experiencing a sharp rise in Valley fever cases, with reported cases in the first three months of the year doubling the 10-year average. This increase is linked to cycles of drought and precipitation, with experts predicting a record year for the disease. Construction workers, firefighters, and archaeologists working in dry regions are at increased risk. There are concerns that the disease may be increasing in severity and acquiring resistance to common antifungal medicines. </p>
