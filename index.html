            <p>An Israeli air strike reportedly hit a hospital in Gaza City, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Witnesses claim the strike heavily damaged the intensive care and surgery departments of Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, a key medical facility. While Israel is investigating the reports, footage shows flames and smoke engulfing the hospital, forcing patients and staff to evacuate. The Hamas government condemned the attack, especially in light of a previous incident at the same hospital in October 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

The DPP's frustration stems from the opposition's majority, which has led to legislative gridlock and accusations of undermining the island's security.

            <p>Dive teams are continuing to search the Hudson River for remaining wreckage from Thursday's helicopter crash that killed all six people on board. The NTSB is focusing on recovering the main rotor, main gear box, and tail rotor, as these parts could provide crucial insights into the cause of the crash. Preliminary investigations suggest a rotor may have broken off, leading to the accident. The helicopter was conducting sightseeing tours and did not have flight recorders. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from its new tariffs, including the 125% levies imposed on Chinese imports. This decision comes after concerns that the tariffs would significantly increase consumer prices for electronics. The move is seen as a major reprieve for big tech companies like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, as well as for countries in Southeast Asia that rely on tech exports to the US. Trump has said his import taxes will address unfairness in the global trading system, as well as bring jobs and factories back to the US. (not investment advice)</p>

The obesity crisis in India is ballooning - and the seemingly harmless pot belly may be a far bigger villain than we think. India had the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults in 2021, with 180 million affected - behind only China. A new Lancet study warns this number could soar to 450 million by 2050, nearly a third of the country's projected population. (not investment advice)</p>
