            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. aims to secure fair and beneficial trade agreements with all countries amid ongoing tariff disputes. He indicated that the Trump administration is open to negotiations and believes it currently holds significant leverage, adding the U.S. is receiving offers to negotiate trade deals. Bessent also mentioned that the U.S. could collect substantial tariffs while incentivizing the return of manufacturing to the country, ultimately aiming for a balanced economic outcome. The Secretary’s remarks have injected optimism into markets previously roiled by trade war anxieties.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has canceled a hearing to review the Trump administration's use of a 1798 wartime law for immediate deportations of Venezuelan nationals, following a Supreme Court ruling. The Supreme Court's decision established due process protections for migrants, including the right to appear in court before deportation proceedings. The judge ordered plaintiffs to indicate by April 16 if they still have grounds to proceed with their motion for a preliminary injunction in the D.C.

            <p>Emirates President Tim Clark warns that the aviation industry faces "uncharted territory" due to the impact of U.S. President Trump's tariffs and trade disputes on global growth. He points to growing pressures on carriers and the ripple effect across the aviation supply chain, similar to the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Clark notes that despite the tariffs, Emirates and the industry can weather the storm, particularly business models with international scope.</p>

            <p>While opioid settlements with pharmaceutical companies have resulted in multibillion-dollar payouts, most of the funds are flowing to state and local governments, not directly to individual victims. People affected by the opioid crisis are receiving relatively small compensation amounts, often just a few hundred dollars, while governments receive millions. This disparity has caused frustration among victims and advocates, who argue that governments should prioritize addiction treatment, recovery, and prevention programs. Some jurisdictions have created modest funds directed at individuals, but widespread cash payments are rare.</p>
