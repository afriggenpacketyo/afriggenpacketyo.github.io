          <p>Manchester United has identified Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as primary targets to bolster their striking options. However, the club acknowledges that any new acquisitions are contingent on selling current players to raise funds, a process that may extend until the transfer deadline. Both potential transfers present challenges, as Newcastle is also interested in Sesko, and Aston Villa is reluctant to sell Watkins, reportedly valuing him at a steep £60 million.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays reported second-quarter pre-tax profits of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, driven by a 10% year-on-year increase in investment banking income. The strong performance, fueled by market volatility, prompted the announcement of a £1 billion share buyback program. The bank's CET1 capital ratio improved to 14%, and its investment banking division continues to be a focus for cost reduction under CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan amid a competitive landscape.

          <p>Experts in China are urging Beijing to adopt a more proactive strategy in shaping its global image by leveraging new cultural symbols and engaging with scholars across Asia. The goal is to counterbalance what they perceive as a long-standing dominance of Western discourse and to align China's soft power with its economic growth. They suggest that as global power dynamics shift, China should take a leading role in defining international norms, particularly in emerging fields, based on Asian values of "harmony and diversity."</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the Trump administration over a new policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants in the U.S. illegally while they await deportation hearings. This policy reverses the long-standing practice of granting bond to individuals not considered a flight or safety risk. Immigrant advocacy groups argue the policy is a misinterpretation of the law, violates due process rights, and causes "catastrophic" harm by separating families and detaining people with deep community ties for extended periods.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that his government will work with Jordan to establish an airlift for delivering humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a masterful performance in a 5-2 win against the Cincinnati Reds, signaling a strong return to form. The right-hander pitched seven superb innings, allowing only one run on four hits while striking out nine batters. After a shaky period mid-season, Yamamoto has shown Cy Young-caliber pitching in his recent starts, improving his record to 9-7 with a 2.48 ERA. His dominance on the mound, supported by key hits from Mookie Betts and Shohei Ohtani, was crucial for the Dodgers' victory.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate a possible change in travel plans for Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te, who was expected to make a stopover in the United States. Initial reports suggested a stop in New York was denied, while later information indicated the trip was delayed, with potential stopovers in Texas and another U.S. city later in the year. Taiwan's Presidential Office cited domestic typhoon recovery efforts and regional developments as reasons for the decision not to travel at this time. Such diplomatic stopovers are highly sensitive and closely watched by Beijing.</p>

          <p>Following international condemnation, Israel has begun allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza, including truck convoys and airdrops, to address the severe hunger crisis. However, the United Nations warns that the current volume is a fraction of what is needed to prevent widespread starvation, with one in five children in Gaza City reportedly malnourished. The U.N. is calling for at least 500-600 trucks daily to avert a deeper catastrophe. Desperation is so high that some residents are taking supplies directly from aid convoys.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued new guidance affirming the right of federal employees to engage in religious expression in the workplace, including discussing their faith and attempting to persuade colleagues. The memo from the Office of Personnel Management states that workers can display religious items and have polite faith-based discussions, but must stop if a colleague requests it. This move has drawn criticism from groups who argue it unconstitutionally encourages proselytizing in a government setting.</p>
