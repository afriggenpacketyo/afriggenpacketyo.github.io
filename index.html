          <p>This article details the Senate GOP's version of a major spending bill, which aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. It includes increased spending for border security and defense, offset by new restrictions and funding changes for Medicaid and the SNAP food assistance program. The legislation also addresses the debt ceiling, child tax credits, and state and local tax deductions, with some provisions altered by the Senate parliamentarian to comply with budget reconciliation rules. The bill faces a marathon amendment process as leaders push for a vote.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new, controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials. The center, located at a remote airport, is designed to house up to 5,000 individuals for processing and deportation, funded in part by FEMA. Governor Ron DeSantis highlighted the site's isolation and surrounding dangerous wildlife as a security feature, while environmental groups have sued to block its opening pending an environmental review. The facility is part of a broader effort to increase deportations.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra pending a review of a petition seeking her removal from office. The suspension follows public outrage over a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader regarding a border dispute, which critics claim undermined national interests. This development continues a pattern of judicial and political turmoil in Thailand, where the court previously removed Paetongtarn's predecessor and disbanded the progressive Move Forward party.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students in 2022, is reportedly expected to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. According to media reports citing a letter sent to victims' families, the deal would result in a sentence of life in prison without parole. The move has drawn mixed reactions from the families, with some expressing anger while others see it as a way to avoid a prolonged and painful trial. Kohberger, a criminology graduate student, was linked to the crime by DNA evidence found at the scene.</p>

          <p>New research from the University of Cambridge indicates that certain species of human gut bacteria can absorb and store toxic PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals." In a study on mice, scientists found these microbes could effectively remove the harmful substances, potentially protecting the body from their long-term toxic effects. Researchers are now exploring the development of probiotic supplements to enhance this natural defense mechanism. The findings offer a potential new avenue for mitigating the health risks associated with widespread PFAS exposure from food and water.</p>

As the first group fled, an associate of the initial target then shot the 16-year-old in the head, leaving her in critical condition.

          <p>European analysts express concern that escalating conflict in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran, could destabilize volatile regions in Africa. The Horn of Africa is seen as particularly vulnerable due to interconnected alliances, such as Iran's support for Houthi rebels who cooperate with Somalia's Al-Shabab militia. While direct military and economic footprints of Israel and Iran in Africa are limited, the indirect effects could include trade disruptions and the emergence of security gaps. The conflict could also weaken the mediating roles of other Middle Eastern players like Qatar in African disputes.</p>

          <p>While U.S. consumer spending on most luxury goods fell in the first five months of the year, the jewelry category has proven to be a resilient bright spot. According to a Citigroup report, spending on luxury jewelry surged over 10% in May compared to the previous year, and it was the only category to see an increase in the number of individual customers. Analysts suggest this outperformance is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment and its sentimental value. In contrast, categories like handbags have seen significant price hikes without a corresponding increase in value. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite joint military drills and diplomatic statements, neither Beijing nor Moscow offered tangible support, leaving Tehran isolated and unable to effectively deter or retaliate against Israeli strikes. This perceived unreliability of great-power protection could lead other nations in the region to conclude that developing their own nuclear deterrent is the only viable security guarantee.

          <p>Ryland Headley, 92, has been sentenced to life in prison for the 1967 sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old widow Louisa Dunne in Bristol, England. The conviction, which solves what is believed to be the UK's longest-running cold case, was secured after modern forensic testing found Headley's DNA on the victim's skirt. Headley, who was 34 at the time of the crime, was told by the judge he would die in prison. The victim's granddaughter praised the police for their persistence, stating it brings a measure of justice after 58 years.</p>

          <p>As temperatures rise, it is crucial to distinguish between heat exhaustion and the more dangerous heat stroke. Heat exhaustion involves symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and dizziness, and is treated by moving to a cool place and rehydrating. However, if not managed, it can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening emergency where the body's temperature regulation system fails and core temperature can rise rapidly. Signs of heat stroke include confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness, requiring immediate emergency medical attention and rapid cooling efforts.</p>

          <p>A forgotten novel written in 1932 by a young Sebastian Haffner, who would later become a renowned historian of the Nazi era, has posthumously topped Germany's bestseller list. Titled "Parting," the autobiographical love story was discovered by the author's son after his death in 1999 but was only published this year. Written as the Weimar Republic was collapsing, the book captures a final moment of hope and youthful freedom against the backdrop of rising fascism. The manuscript was found alongside Haffner's famous memoir, "Defying Hitler," offering a lighter glimpse into his early life.</p>

Individuals relying on Medicaid and SNAP food assistance express anxiety over proposed funding restrictions and new work requirements that could jeopardize their health and financial stability. Conversely, firefighters and others anticipate significant savings from a provision that would make overtime pay and tips tax-free. The bill's rollback of green energy incentives also worries small business owners in the solar industry, who fear they may have to lay off employees.</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that the political climate under President Donald Trump is fueling a new form of Canadian nationalism, driven by practical concerns about U.S. authoritarianism and economic threats. Historically reliant on a stable, rules-based international order anchored by the U.S., Canada is now being forced to reconsider its economic, military, and political independence. This has led to increased defense spending and efforts to diversify trade away from the U.S. The shift marks a departure from past nationalist movements, focusing less on cultural identity and more on national survival.</p>

The feud highlights a deep rift between the two former allies over government spending and national debt. Musk responded by reiterating his call to cut all government subsidies, escalating the public dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis explains that a key, often overlooked, function of political protest is to combat the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where people mistakenly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. Research shows that people often inaccurately estimate public opinion on major issues like climate change and abortion rights. Public demonstrations, like those following the Dobbs Supreme Court decision, serve as a powerful signal that can correct these misperceptions and build "common knowledge" about what a society truly believes.

          <p>A major, early-season heatwave is gripping Europe, with cities like Barcelona recording their hottest June on record and Paris forecasting temperatures of 40Â°C (104Â°F). Health warnings have been issued in numerous countries as the extreme heat strains public services and heightens the risk of wildfires in drought-stricken areas. Climate experts link the event's intensity and early arrival to global warming, warning that such punishing summers are becoming the new norm.

          <h2>Denmark Extends Military Conscription to Women Amid Heightened European Security Concerns</h2>

          <p>Denmark has officially changed its laws to include women in its military conscription system, requiring them to register for service upon turning 18. Women will now be part of the same lottery system as men that could call them up for an extended 11-month period of service. The move, which follows the lead of neighbors Norway and Sweden, is part of a broader effort to bolster Denmark's defense capabilities. The policy change comes in response to heightened security concerns in Europe and aims to increase military personnel.</p>
