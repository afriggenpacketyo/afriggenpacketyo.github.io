            <p>President Trump's new tariffs, including a 104% levy on Chinese goods, have come into effect, escalating global trade war fears. These tariffs, designed to force trade negotiations, have already shaken global markets and increased recession concerns. China has vowed countermeasures, while the White House insists deals will only benefit American workers. The tariffs aim to revive American manufacturing, but experts warn of higher inflation.

            <p>The UK government is considering nationalizing British Steel to secure raw materials for its Scunthorpe plant, which faces potential job losses. British Steel, owned by Jingye, claims significant financial losses despite investments. The government has offered financial support for a transition to electric arc furnaces, but the offer was rejected. With negotiations reaching a critical point, nationalization is being considered as a temporary measure to ensure the future of steel production in the UK.</p>

            <p>In Gainesville, Florida, opinions on Trump's sweeping tariffs are divided, with some supporting the move and others expressing concerns about rising prices and economic recession. Supporters believe the tariffs will bring back jobs and keep money in the American economy, while critics worry about increased costs for essential goods and the impact on small businesses. The tariffs are expected to increase prices on household goods, clothing, electronics, and groceries, potentially costing the average US household $3,800.</p>

            <p>A bipartisan group of senators has introduced legislation to require congressional approval for presidential tariffs, aiming to rein in President Trump's trade policies. The bill would require the president to notify Congress of impending tariffs, with Congress having 60 days to approve the action. Sen. Maria Cantwell argues that Congress has the constitutional right to regulate trade and that the president has misused this authority, costing consumers money and disrupting the economy. The president has threatened to veto the bill.</p>

            <p>The word "tariff," like most words in English, has a history of being imported from other languages. It can be traced back to Latin and Arabic, and originally referred to a list of prices in shipping. Tariffs have been central to U.S. trade policy since the country's founding, with their goals shifting from revenue to restriction over time. Today, the meaning of "tariff" may be widening beyond a simple rate of tax, becoming a political buzzword.</p>

            <p>President Trump's new sweeping tariffs against America's trading partners have taken effect. The tariffs, ranging from 20% to 104% for Chinese products, aim to boost the US economy and protect jobs. However, economists warn that the move could harm the world economy and push up prices for consumers. The tariffs are expected to impact a range of imported goods, from clothing to electronics, and could potentially lead to a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Federal prosecutors allege that Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump, also sought to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to shoot down Trump's plane. Routh allegedly contacted an associate to obtain an RPG or Stinger missile. He also sought to purchase a .50 caliber rifle. Routh is suspected of hiding with a gun near Trump International, about 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee, while he was playing golf in West Palm Beach in September 2024.</p>

            <p>India's central bank has cut its policy rate to 6% to boost slowing growth amid concerns over the impact of US tariffs. The rate cut aligns with expectations and comes as the US implements tariffs on goods from India. The Reserve Bank of India acknowledged that tariffs have increased uncertainties in the global economic outlook. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said the central bank will shift its stance to accommodate growth through softer interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A full-scale trade war between China and the US is in prospect after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of more than 100% on Chinese goods imports. China has said it will "fight to the end" rather than capitulate to what it sees as US coercion, and had already raised its own trade barriers against the US. The trade in goods between the two economic powers added up to around $585bn (£429bn) last year. A large proportion of these smartphones are made in China for Apple, a US-based multinational.

            <p>Gold prices have decreased amid market volatility caused by the trade war between the US and China. Despite this, analysts maintain that gold remains a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty. The spot price of gold had previously climbed to an all-time high before President Trump's tariff announcement triggered a downturn. Analysts attribute the price drop to short-term sell-offs by traders covering losses in other asset classes. (not investment advice)</p>
