          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in the death of one man and injuries to two other adults. The incident occurred during a wedding reception, where witnesses reported that the suspect was subdued after being hit with a chair before being taken into custody. Authorities have arrested 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau and charged him with second-degree murder, stating there is no known connection between him and the victims. The investigation is ongoing, but police have assured the public there is no further danger.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has completely divested its highly profitable investment in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD. The initial $230 million purchase in 2008, famously championed by Charlie Munger, grew in value by approximately 3,900% during the holding period. While Buffett has praised BYD as an "extraordinary company," the sale aligns with Berkshire's recent moves to reduce exposure to geopolitical risks associated with China, similar to its quick sale of a stake in Taiwan Semiconductor. The firm indicated it will find other investments for the capital.</p>

          <p>Renowned British television presenter John Stapleton has passed away at the age of 79 following complications from Parkinson's disease. A familiar face on UK screens for decades, he was best known for his work on the BBC's consumer rights show "Watchdog," which he co-hosted with his late wife Lynn Faulds Wood, and ITV's breakfast program GMTV. Colleagues remembered him as a versatile and brilliant broadcaster with an unmatched ability to handle breaking news. Stapleton began his career in local newspapers before moving into television, where he also reported for flagship programs like "Newsnight."</p>

          <p>In response to fracturing national health guidelines, seven U.S. states and New York City have formed the Northeast Public Health Collaborative to strengthen regional health policy. This alliance aims to create more consistent recommendations on issues like vaccinations as federal agencies such as the CDC and FDA revisit their guidance. The move reflects a growing trend of state-level efforts to ensure public health stability, creating a potential patchwork of regulations across the country similar to what has been seen with other major policy issues. A similar alliance also exists among West Coast states.</p>

          <p>The United States recently held a significant multi-domain military exercise, named Freedom Edge, with allies Japan and South Korea, notably without the presence of a U.S. aircraft carrier. This departure from past practice has prompted analysis regarding its strategic implications for relations with China and North Korea. Some experts suggest the move could be an attempt to de-escalate regional tensions and facilitate diplomatic engagement. Others interpret it as a reflection of the Trump administration's strategy to encourage greater military contributions from its Asian allies for regional security.</p>

          <p>Apple has taken full control of the core chips in its new iPhone Air, introducing the custom A19 Pro processor, N1 wireless chip, and C1X modem. This strategic shift is centered on prioritizing on-device artificial intelligence, with the A19 Pro featuring a new architecture that adds neural accelerators to its GPU cores for more efficient AI workload processing. By designing its own silicon, Apple aims to enhance performance, improve battery life, and maintain user privacy by handling more AI tasks directly on the device rather than in the cloud.</p>

          <p>In an era dominated by streaming services and declining multiplex attendance, Los Angeles's repertory cinemas are experiencing a resurgence. Theaters such as Vidiots, the New Beverly, and the Egyptian Theatre are drawing sell-out crowds by offering curated cinematic experiences that cannot be replicated at home, including screenings of rare 35-millimeter prints and in-person events with filmmakers. This success highlights a growing audience desire for communal and tangible cultural experiences, providing a vital space for a new generation of film lovers.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: AI Tools May Be Diminishing Critical Thinking and Cognitive Abilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT is fostering a dependency that may be detrimental to human cognition. Citing recent academic studies, the author contends that by "offloading" cognitive tasks to machines, users are engaging less in deep, reflective thinking, which can lead to an atrophy of critical thinking skills. The piece draws a parallel to how the internet has been argued to have fragmented our attention, suggesting AI could further diminish our capacity for complex, independent thought.</p>

          <p>The indefinite suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" has sparked concerns about the economic and cultural impact on its Hollywood Boulevard neighborhood. For nearly two decades, the show has been an anchor for local tourism and business, and its host has been a vocal champion for the area's revitalization. Local vendors, workers, and former city officials worry that the show's absence will mean a significant loss of foot traffic and jobs, dealing another blow to a community still recovering from the pandemic and recent entertainment industry strikes.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a significant diplomatic move that would diverge from the policy of its close ally, the United States. The decision comes after the expiration of a deadline set by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, which required Israel to meet several conditions related to the war in Gaza, including a ceasefire and allowing unimpeded aid. The UK's recognition, which is opposed by both the U.S. and Israel, is intended to increase pressure for a long-term peace and preserve the viability of a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of supporters and prominent Republican leaders, including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, are expected to attend a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona. Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, was assassinated earlier this month, sending shockwaves through the MAGA movement. His death has intensified a national debate over political violence, with his allies blaming rhetoric from the left, while his critics point to his own controversial and divisive stances.</p>

Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup, is proposing changes that would also extend presidential terms from five to seven years. The vote is widely expected to pass, as the main opposition parties have called for a boycott, raising concerns among international observers about the transparency and inclusiveness of the process and the potential for the military to further entrench its power.</p>

          <p>Andrew Kolvet, the executive producer of Charlie Kirk's podcast, has shared a claim that he attributes to a surgeon who treated the late conservative activist. According to Kolvet, the surgeon called it an "absolute miracle" that the bullet did not exit Kirk's body, stating that the victim's bone density was so impressive that it stopped the high-velocity round from potentially killing others standing behind him. This narrative emerges as tens of thousands prepare for a memorial service for Kirk in Arizona, to be attended by President Trump.</p>
