          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant downturn following the announcement of tariffs by US President Trump, triggering fears of a global trade war and potential recession. Major indexes in Shanghai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong plummeted, reflecting investor anxiety over the impact of tariffs on Asian economies, which heavily rely on exports. Concerns about rising inflation and a potential economic slowdown in the US, a key export market for Asia, further exacerbated the market turmoil. Investment firms are revising their recession forecasts upward, signaling increased uncertainty in the global economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the World Health Organization reveals a stark reality: a woman dies every two minutes due to failures in maternal healthcare, totaling 260,000 deaths in 2023. The majority of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting significant inequalities in access to quality maternal care. The WHO warns that the global target to reduce maternal deaths by 2030 will be missed, with progress stagnating. Cuts to international aid by the US and UK are expected to exacerbate the crisis, potentially reversing progress made in reducing maternal mortality rates.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in New York aims to prohibit police from conducting traffic stops for minor violations, such as a broken taillight or expired registration, to address racial disparities in arrests and traffic stops. Supporters argue that the measure will promote racial equity and public safety by reducing unnecessary interactions between law enforcement and minority communities. Critics, including law enforcement officials, contend that restricting traffic stops will compromise public safety and potentially embolden criminals. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between addressing racial bias in policing and maintaining law enforcement effectiveness.</p>

          <p>China's central bank is opting for stability over devaluation as tariff tremors give the yuan a jolt. While the People’s Bank of China has set the yuan’s daily reference rate to a four-month low against the US dollar, the metric has not yet breached the all-important 7.2 benchmark. Analysts view this as a sign of stabilization efforts rather than the sharp devaluation some expected to offset the impact of US tariffs.

Retaliation could be popular domestically and align Britain with other G7 nations, but it could also harm EU relations and increase costs for UK consumers. Restraint, on the other hand, could allow Britain to focus on supporting businesses and potentially secure a trade deal with the US.

It highlights the financial nature of the attacks, where universities that support dissenting views are penalized.

          <p>The venture capital industry has been facing a great deal of churn at the senior level, with reports of many top-level executives leaving legacy firms. Reasons for these departures include a perception by some investors that decision-making at many large firms is slow, and funds are focused on increasing the pools of money they manage rather than working with promising founders. Some investors in that camp also say they are capitalizing on big changes in the industry, leaving the drawbacks of big firms for the benefits of smaller ones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge wrote in a legal opinion explaining why she had ordered the Trump administration to bring him back to the United States. There is little to no evidence to support a vague, uncorroborated allegation that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was once in the MS-13 street gang, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis wrote. And in any case, she said, an immigration judge had expressly barred the U.S. in 2019 from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where he faced likely persecution by local gangs.</p>
