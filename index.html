          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's next chancellor at a time of significant challenges, including rising inequality, crumbling infrastructure, and the threat of war. Germany needs a unifier who can rally a divided nation with vision and purpose, however Merz's instincts are to divide. He has a history of divisive rhetoric and actions, which may empower a more radical political shift. Optimism score: 30</p>
          <p>30/100</p>

          <p>Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit fighting Donald Trumpâ€™s order to dismantle Voice of America, has called for the media to resist attacks. She argues that the Trump administration is attempting to unlawfully dismantle VOA because they deem it contrary to the governmentâ€™s agenda. Her lawsuit, backed by Reporters Without Borders and four unions, argues the Trump administration is violating press freedom, the first amendment, and laws to prevent executive overreach.
