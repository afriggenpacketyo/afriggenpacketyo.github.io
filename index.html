          <p>Germany is currently engaged in a heated debate among politicians regarding calls to ban the Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party. Simultaneously, rail services between Cologne and Berlin are experiencing disruptions due to planned upgrades at Cologne railway station, with high-speed trains canceled for two weeks. Deutsche Bahn, the network operator, is installing a new electronic signal box, impacting several regional and suburban lines but not affecting services connecting Hamburg, Bremen, and Cologne. Cologne Central Station, a major European transport hub, serves approximately 180,000 passengers daily and this disruption will impact travel to other European nations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease, specifically metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The trial involved 800 participants across 37 countries who received weekly injections of semaglutide or a placebo between 2021 and 2023. After 72 weeks, 62.9% of the semaglutide group experienced reduced inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers, while 36.8% saw improvements in liver fibrosis, suggesting semaglutide could be an effective tool in treating advanced liver disease. Adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were more common in the semaglutide group.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the growing threat to global press freedom as several countries adopt laws that restrict independent media and NGOs. These laws, often disguised as measures to protect national security, mandate organizations receiving foreign funding to register as "acting in the interest of a foreign power." The vague wording of these laws allows them to be weaponized against journalists, leading to legal penalties, social stigma, and the closure of media outlets. The article highlights Russia's "foreign agent" law as an example and emphasizes the need for democracies to carefully consider the details of such legislation to prevent authoritarian leaders from suppressing dissent.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the decline of Catholicism in Latin America and the rise of evangelical churches, particularly in Peru. Despite Pope Francis's popularity, the Catholic Church has been losing ground to evangelical movements that offer a more direct and engaging message. The article explores the reasons for this shift, including changing social attitudes, child sex abuse scandals, and a lack of ordained priests. The article also highlights the Catholic Church's efforts to adapt, such as translating the liturgy into local languages and embracing charismatic Catholicism.</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is taking legal action against Ofsted over proposed changes to school inspections in England. The NAHT is seeking a judicial review of plans for new school report cards, arguing that they amount to "another crude grading system." The decision follows concerns raised by the sister of Ruth Perry, a head teacher who took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, who called for a delay in implementing the new system. Ofsted maintains that supporting mental health is an important part of the proposals and that the union's legal claims are "plainly untenable."</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration has imposed a 25% tariff on key auto parts, including engines, in a move that further impacts Japan's car industry. The tariff is part of President Trump's effort to protect the American automobile industry and address trade deficits. To ease the impact, the administration is helping manufacturers relocate supply chains for car parts used in the United States. However, automakers argue that it will take time to procure domestically all the parts necessary to manufacture vehicles in the United States.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious plan for a national cathedral, designed by architect David Adjaye, has become mired in controversy and stalled due to corruption allegations and the country's economic struggles. Former President Nana Akufo-Addo spent around $58 million of public money on the $400 million project, which has been criticized as a misuse of funds during a time of economic distress. The unbuilt cathedral has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and a political battleground, with the new government halting funding and launching an anticorruption initiative. While Africa has a large Christian population, the project failed to garner widespread support, and many Ghanaians now view it as an unnecessary expense.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that despite a recent minerals deal with the U.S., Ukraine will struggle to compete with China as a primary source of critical minerals for hi-tech and green energy production. Many of Ukraine's mineral reserves are located in areas occupied by Russia, and the country lacks the necessary processing capacity. China controls about 60% of the worldâ€™s rare earth element reserves and roughly 90% of refining, making it difficult for Ukraine to become a significant competitor in the near future.</p>

          <p>A new impact assessment suggests that assisted dying cases in England and Wales could surpass 4,000 annually within 10 years of legalization, representing less than 1% of all deaths. The report, designed to inform MPs debating the issue, estimates initial NHS savings from reduced care costs but also anticipates significant expenses for staffing and training. While proponents emphasize the compassionate aspect of providing choice at the end of life, opponents raise concerns about potential risks to vulnerable individuals. The bill returns to the House of Commons later this month for a crucial vote.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species. The new antivenom cocktail, tested on mice, showed unprecedented breadth of protection, covering many elapid snakes for which no current antivenom exists. This research offers hope for a universal antivenom that could save lives and prevent disabilities caused by snakebites.</p>
