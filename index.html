The deal, announced by the General Services Administration (GSA), is designed to accelerate the government's migration to the cloud and adoption of artificial intelligence tools. The discounts cover a range of offerings, including cloud infrastructure credits, modernization programs, and training services. This arrangement follows a similar agreement the GSA made with Oracle and another with OpenAI, signaling a broad public-private push to enhance the nation's technological capabilities.</p>

Sources indicate that Driscoll and Steve Jensen, the assistant director in charge of the Washington field office, must vacate their roles by Friday. Another agent, Walter Giardina, who was involved in previous investigations related to President Trump, is also said to be among those ousted. The reasons for the terminations have not been made clear, and the news suggests a significant leadership shake-up within the nation's top federal law enforcement agency.</p>

In a wide-ranging interview, Huckabee emphasized that the U.S. would not dictate Israel's actions but would offer counsel if asked. His comments come as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated plans to control Gaza without governing it, and as negotiations for a ceasefire with Hamas have completely broken down. Huckabee also addressed the deaths of American citizens in the West Bank, promising thorough investigations into the incidents allegedly involving Israeli settlers.</p>

His economic approval is also underwater at 45% approve and 53% disapprove, a reversal from his first term when economic sentiment was a political strength. The survey shows public disapproval on his handling of inflation, taxes, and federal spending.

The article compares this action to President Richard Nixon's 1971 pressure campaign against the BLS, which was driven by anti-Semitic paranoia over jobs numbers. While Nixon's motives were darker, he ultimately stopped short of firing the commissioner, constrained by political norms and a staff that sought to control his impulses. In contrast, Trump's public dismissal of the BLS chief for producing inconvenient data demonstrates a greater willingness to violate institutional norms and abuse presidential authority.</p>

On average, consumers can reduce their balances by 30% to 50% before fees, though results vary based on financial hardship and negotiation.

          <p>Several Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, are questioning Google about its settlement discussions with President Trump regarding a censorship lawsuit he filed against YouTube. In a letter to the CEOs of Google and YouTube, the senators raised concerns about a potential "quid-pro-quo" arrangement where Google might settle the suit to gain favorable treatment from the administration on other legal matters. The letter notes that Google is facing major government antitrust and labor lawsuits. It highlights a recent court filing indicating "productive discussions" between Trump's lawyers and YouTube, asking for transparency about the negotiations.</p>

          <h2>Oil Market Appears Skeptical of Trump's Tariff Threats on Russian Crude Buyers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 12:24:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global oil market seems to be discounting President Trump's threat to impose severe secondary tariffs on countries that purchase Russian energy exports. Despite a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, oil prices have remained stable, suggesting traders believe the administration will not follow through with measures that could cause a price spike. The administration's initial 25% tariff on India for buying Russian crude was much lower than the 100% threatened, reinforcing market skepticism. Analysts suggest that a serious disruption to Russia's oil exports would be counterproductive to Trump's goal of lowering energy prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its 2025 Atlantic hurricane season forecast, slightly lowering its storm prediction but still anticipating above-normal activity. The new outlook projects 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine becoming hurricanes and two to five of those strengthening into major hurricanes. This adjustment reflects four named storms that have already formed. Forecasters attribute the active season to factors like warmer ocean temperatures and a neutral El Niño phase, which create favorable conditions for storm development, urging coastal communities to remain prepared.</p>

As a condition of his bail, Partey must not contact the complainants and must notify police of any international travel. Villarreal stated it is aware of the legal proceedings, respects the presumption of innocence, and will await the outcome of the judicial process.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, claiming he is "highly conflicted" due to his alleged business ties to China. The unusual callout follows a letter from Republican Senator Tom Cotton questioning Tan's associations with Chinese companies, some reportedly linked to the country's military. Tan, a venture capitalist and semiconductor expert, was appointed in March to lead a turnaround at the U.S. chipmaker. Intel, a recipient of significant government funding, recently announced it would be scaling back some manufacturing investments to align with customer demand.</p>

          <p>A group of congressional Democrats is raising alarms about employees from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) moving into permanent career positions within the federal government. In a letter, lawmakers including Sen. Elizabeth Warren expressed concern that these appointees, who worked under Elon Musk's cost-cutting initiative, could "sabotage key functions from within." They are requesting information on how many DOGE employees have been embedded in federal agencies, arguing their conversion to career roles could violate civil service laws prohibiting political patronage. The Office of Personnel Management has refuted the claims, stating all hires comply with the law.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while the Trump administration's goals of energy abundance and AI leadership are promising, its attacks on independent data agencies are destructive. The author contends that firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner and disbanding an advisory committee undermines the credibility of essential economic data. While acknowledging that agencies like the BLS and CBO have flaws and need reform, the piece asserts that political retaliation is the wrong approach. True economic dynamism requires trustworthy institutions, and restoring confidence in them should be a priority over silencing inconvenient truths.</p>

          <p>This essay posits that the decline of politeness, particularly in online interactions, is detrimental to personal well-being and a sign of cultural decay. The author argues that being rude, even to AI bots, can increase one's own anger and depression, while practicing courtesy elevates happiness. The piece suggests that individuals can protect their well-being by consciously making courtesy a habit in all interactions, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with dignity rather than retaliation. In an era of widespread incivility, choosing politeness is presented as a powerful, countercultural act of personal freedom.</p>

The dispute has escalated, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordering state law enforcement to find and arrest the legislators. President Trump had previously suggested federal involvement might be necessary, and the FBI's assistance now adds a federal dimension to the contentious state-level political battle.</p>
