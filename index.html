          <p>The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery has successfully raised £3.8 million, including significant public and grant contributions, to acquire Dame Barbara Hepworth's "Sculpture With Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue And Red." This achievement ensures the 1943 wooden carving, previously in private ownership, will remain in the UK and go on permanent public display in Hepworth's home city. The work, one of few wooden carvings with strings made by the artist during World War Two, was considered too important to leave the country. The gallery intends to lend this rare and significant piece to other museums, opening up access for people across the UK.</p>

          <p>Sweden has commenced the two-day relocation of the 113-year-old Kiruna Church, moving the 672-ton wooden structure five kilometers to a new city center. This monumental engineering feat is necessary due to ground weakening caused by the expansion of the world's largest underground iron ore mine, operated by LKAB, which is financing the 45 million euro move. While celebrated as an engineering marvel, the relocation sparks concern among the indigenous Sami community, who fear the mine's expansion threatens traditional reindeer migration routes and their livelihood. The church, often voted Sweden's most beautiful building, is a significant cultural landmark for the town of 18,000 residents.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during his recent visit to Delhi, emphasized that China and India should view each other as partners rather than adversaries, fostering mutual respect and joint development. This diplomatic overture signals a significant improvement in ties, which had reached a historic low following a deadly border clash in 2020 in the disputed Himalayan border region. Discussions with Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar encompassed a broad range of bilateral issues, including economic cooperation, border trade, and the sharing of river data. This move towards rapprochement is also set against the backdrop of India's strained relationship with the United States, adding a complex geopolitical dimension to the ongoing efforts to normalize relations between the two Asian giants.</p>

          <p>China's urban youth unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group, excluding students, rose to 17.8% in July, marking its highest level in 11 months. This increase comes as a record number of university graduates enter an already challenging labor market, ending a four-month period of decline in the metric. In response, Beijing has initiated various programs, such as career guidance, job referrals, and training opportunities, to support jobless youth and recent graduates. The article highlights the significant difficulties young people face in securing suitable employment in the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Mike Tyson's return to boxing after his prison sentence, a mere 89-second bout against Peter McNeeley, shattered pay-per-view records. Promoted as "He's Back," the fight, despite its farcical ending, cemented Tyson's enduring appeal and established a new paradigm for boxing as a spectacle rather than purely a competitive contest. The article highlights the immense celebrity draw and financial success of the event, earning a then-record $96 million in TV income. This historical moment paved the way for modern-era boxing and influencer-led fights, demonstrating that public fascination with a personality can transcend the sport's competitive integrity.</p>

          <p>An individual recounts their complex journey of recovering from anorexia, only to face a new challenge with a diagnosis of very high cholesterol, necessitating dietary changes. The article critically examines society's often contradictory and reductive health messaging, which frequently equates thinness with health, overlooking nutritional quality or individual histories. The author highlights how the pressure to lose weight can inadvertently trigger past disordered eating patterns, even when pursuing physical health. This personal narrative underscores the need for more sensitive and holistic approaches to health, rather than solely focusing on weight or external appearances.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proposed India's most significant tax reform in eight years, aiming to lower consumption levies on everyday goods and small cars starting October. This reform seeks to simplify the Goods and Services Tax (GST) by abolishing the 28% slab and shifting many 12% taxed products to the 5% bracket, potentially boosting consumption and dampening inflation. While expected to reduce government collections by $20 billion, the move could benefit sectors like personal care and construction, and manufacturers like Samsung and LG. The proposal requires approval from the GST Council, indicating potential challenges ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

Most victims were national staff serving their own communities, often attacked at work or in their homes.

The deal, which returns the company to private ownership, aims to stabilize its future amid a challenging hospitality market.

While this alleviates overtourism in popular areas, it poses economic challenges for tourism-reliant southern European countries. The article suggests that by the late 2020s, the Mediterranean's peak travel season may shift, turning July-August into a "climate risk zone" for mass tourism.</p>

          <p>Air Canada and the union representing 10,000 striking flight attendants have resumed talks in Toronto, marking their first meeting since the weekend walkout. The strike, now in its fourth day, has led to the cancellation of 700 daily flights, stranding approximately 130,000 travelers during peak season. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) demands pay for ground duties, such as boarding passengers, for which flight attendants are currently unpaid, alongside wage increases. The dispute has escalated into a three-way standoff involving the airline, workers, and the government, with calls for a swift resolution to minimize travel disruption.</p>

          <p>Fatigued by virtual interactions, Generation Z workers are increasingly turning to in-person networking events, like dumpling-making classes and pub quizzes, to build real-life friendships and community. Many Gen Z individuals entered the workforce during the pandemic, leading to a "loneliness epidemic" and underdeveloped social skills. Employers and social apps are responding by organizing structured activity-focused events, such as London's Wharf Connect program, to fill this social void. This trend signifies a rejection of overwhelming online culture, as young people seek more authentic and reliable in-person connections.</p>

          <p>Following a summit with President Zelenskyy and European leaders, President Trump announced he has begun arrangements for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with a trilateral meeting involving himself to follow. While Zelenskyy expressed readiness for such a meeting, a date remains unset, and the Kremlin's readout of Trump's call with Putin only mentioned increasing the level of representatives for existing negotiations, not a direct leader-to-leader encounter. This development marks a potential, albeit uncertain, step towards direct high-level talks in the nearly four-year-long conflict.</p>

Instances of police brutality, including alleged threats of sexual assault, and mass arrests of non-protesters have been documented, evoking wartime imagery. President Vucic has vowed a "harsh response" while denying a state of emergency, accusing protesters of trying to destroy the state.

          <p>Sean Gardner, a former coach at the renowned Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute, has been arrested by the FBI on a federal child pornography charge, years after sexual abuse allegations surfaced. Gardner was accused of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts at Chow’s and secretly recording others undressing at a previous job. Despite reports to SafeSport and police in 2022, his disciplinary case remained unresolved, and he was able to secure a job in healthcare. This case highlights concerns about the slow and opaque nature of SafeSport investigations and the limits of its authority in protecting the public outside of sports.</p>

          <p>While commercial honeybee colonies in the United States have experienced their largest recorded collapse, China's bee population has reached a historic high, maintaining its position as the world's largest producer of apiary goods. Researchers attribute this stark contrast primarily to differing "management practices." The US model relies on large-scale, clustered operations with minimal intervention until harvest, whereas China's approach appears to foster better bee health. This article highlights the critical importance of bee populations for agriculture and ecosystems, prompting a closer look at sustainable apiculture methods.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union's perceived political and moral paralysis regarding the conflict in Gaza stems from structural racism and an enduring colonial mentality. The author criticizes the EU's failure to impose sanctions on Israel or suspend its association agreement, despite human rights breaches, contrasting this with the swift and severe sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. This disparity, the article contends, reflects a dehumanizing logic applied to racialized Europeans and refugees, treating Palestinian lives as expendable. The author calls for a comprehensive self-examination and action to dismantle these biases, emphasizing the need for an immediate ceasefire and aid.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has effectively blocked USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield and UCLA wide receiver Kaedin Robinson from playing this season, denying their request for a preliminary injunction against the NCAA's Five-Year Rule. The players argued the rule, which limits athletes to four seasons in five years, violated antitrust laws by restricting their eligibility and Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) earning potential. The judge, however, ruled that the Five-Year Rule is an "eligibility rule," not a commercial restraint, thus not subject to antitrust scrutiny. This decision deals a significant blow to both players and their respective teams.</p>
