          <h2>Oil Prices Increase Following Trump's Threat Against Iran</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 13:12:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a surge after President Trump issued a stern warning to Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, demanding unconditional surrender and threatening retaliation for any attacks on civilians or American soldiers. The price of U.S. crude oil rose by 2.88% to $73.84 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent increased by 2.98% to $75.41. Trump's remarks came amidst heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, with the president asserting that Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons and urging the evacuation of Tehran. These developments follow reports of Iran seeking a ceasefire with Israel, which were quickly overshadowed by Trump's hawkish stance. Optimism around a potential ceasefire has waned with the president's remarks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents while escorting a defendant out of immigration court. The incident occurred at 26 Federal Plaza, where Lander was observing immigration hearings, his wife stated. The reason for his detention remains unclear, but video footage shows Lander questioning the agents' authority and requesting to see a judicial warrant. This event follows a similar incident involving Senator Alex Padilla, who was handcuffed after being removed from a press conference held by the Department of Homeland Security Secretary. The detention of Lander has sparked outrage and concern among fellow politicians and supporters. </p>

The man had previously given Raducanu a letter and requested a photo in a coffee shop. Authorities circulated his name among tennis organizations following the issuance of the restraining order.</p>

          <p>The U.S. men's national soccer team is under immense pressure as the 2026 FIFA World Cup approaches, with the majority of the games to be hosted on U.S. soil. Recent disappointing losses and a conflict between star player Christian Pulisic and coach Mauricio Pochettino have dampened excitement. The team suffered an embarrassing group stage elimination in the Copa America tournament last year, leading to the firing of the coach. Despite the challenges, the upcoming Gold Cup presents an opportunity for younger players to prove themselves and potentially shift the narrative surrounding the team. The U.S. won their opening game of the Gold Cup against Trinidad and Tobago.</p>

This action has resonated with many Chinese social media users, who now view her as consistently supporting Palestine and opposing Israel.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Trump's approach to Iran, following criticism from figures like Tucker Carlson and members of the MAGA base who oppose U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Vance emphasized Trump's consistent stance that Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons and his efforts to reach a deal to prevent uranium enrichment. He acknowledged concerns about foreign entanglement but asserted that Trump is focused on using the military to achieve American goals. This defense comes as prominent Trump allies, including Steve Bannon and Carlson, voice opposition to U.S. involvement, warning of potential damage to Trump's coalition and agenda. </p>

          <p>The annual financial disclosures for Supreme Court justices reveal details of their income, gifts, and positions held outside the court in 2024. Three justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Neil Gorsuch, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, reported income from book royalties. Clarence Thomas reported no gifts or outside income, despite scrutiny over past travels with Harlan Crow. Several justices disclosed teaching positions at various law schools, while Kavanaugh continues to coach girls' basketball. These disclosures have received increased attention following reports of luxury trips accepted by Justice Thomas from a GOP donor, leading to calls for a code of conduct for the Supreme Court. The high court adopted formal ethics rules in November 2023, though they lack an enforcement mechanism.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan police officer has been arrested for shooting an unarmed civilian during a protest in Nairobi against the death of blogger Albert Ojwang, who died in police custody. The incident, captured on video, shows two officers repeatedly striking the man before one shot him in the head. The protests were also met with violence from whip-wielding motorcyclists, allegedly siding with the police, who attacked the protesters. This reflects broader public concerns about police brutality and lack of accountability, particularly following the deaths of over 60 people during demonstrations last year. President Ruto has acknowledged Ojwang's death was at the hands of the police, with investigations ongoing.</p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making it unlikely for the carrier to achieve break-even operating margins this year. The airline will reduce off-peak flights, trim unprofitable routes, and pause plans to retrofit older Airbus A320 jets. CEO Joanna Geraghty stated that the recovery to profitability will take longer than anticipated and that the airline is relying on borrowed cash to sustain operations. JetBlue is also reassessing its hiring plans and considering combining leadership roles to manage expenses. The company hopes that demand and bookings will rebound in the future.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, buried deep within a mountain, is a primary concern for international monitors due to its potential for clandestine nuclear weapons development. While U.S. intelligence agencies previously stated they didn't believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon, Israel claims to have evidence suggesting otherwise. The IAEA has declared Iran non-compliant with monitoring efforts, raising concerns about transparency at Fordo.

The Trump administration projects that the number of student loan borrowers in default could rise significantly in the coming months.

Video footage shows Lander questioning the agents' authority and requesting a judicial warrant before being handcuffed. The incident has sparked outrage among fellow politicians, with some calling it fascism and demanding Lander's immediate release. Lander was at the court to observe hearings involving individuals facing potential deportation.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not call Minnesota Governor Tim Walz after the recent shootings of two state lawmakers, calling Walz "whacked out" and "grossly incompetent." Walz's team responded that the tragedy is not about Trump or Walz, but about the families affected and the state of Minnesota. Authorities say a masked gunman, Vance Luther Boelter, allegedly shot and killed Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounded a state senator and his wife. Walz called the shootings an "act of targeted political violence." Former President Joe Biden called Walz to offer condolences.</p>

The production team uses the castle estate for elaborate missions designed to test contestants and provide opportunities to win money and immunity. Cumming's wardrobe has evolved from "nice little tartan suits" to "insane capes and weird dresses," with stylist Sam Spector creating intricate, "creepy glam" looks inspired by each episode's mission.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he wants "a real end" to Iran's nuclear program, with Tehran "giving up entirely" its enrichment activities, rather than just a ceasefire in the conflict with Israel. He claimed that the U.S. now has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran." Trump also criticized French President Macron for suggesting he left the G7 summit to work on a ceasefire, stating that the situation is "much bigger than that." He predicted that Israel would not slow its assault on Iran and warned that all of Tehran's inhabitants should evacuate. Trump suggested he might send Steve Witkoff or JD Vance to meet with Iranian negotiators, but expressed that he was "not too much in the mood to negotiate."</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out assassinating Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whom he views as an "existential" threat to Israel. Netanyahu has expressed a desire for regime change in Iran, urging the Iranian people to stand up for their freedom. President Trump stated that the U.S. knows Khamenei's location but is not planning to "take him out (kill!), at least not for now." Israeli strikes have killed several top Iranian generals and security advisors, but experts note that Iran's regime has a process in place to maintain stability even if Khamenei is killed.

          <p>President Trump's social media posts and actions are designed to stoke tension, confuse, and apply intense pressure on Iran, according to reports. Trump's messaging is intentionally ambiguous, using a strategy of "maximum pressure diplomacy." The president's warning for "everyone in Tehran to evacuate" and his decision to leave the G7 early to gather his teams in the White House Situation Room contribute to this strategy. This approach is described as a game of smoke, mirrors, brinkmanship, and potential bluff. The leadership in Tehran is closely monitoring these developments as they consider their next steps.</p>

Baroness Casey said she changed her mind on the need for a national inquiry after being "unimpressed" that more local councils did not volunteer to set up their own inquiries and some organizations were reluctant to talk to her investigators.
