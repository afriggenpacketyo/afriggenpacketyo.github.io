          <p>Police in Atlanta are investigating the theft of unreleased music and tour materials belonging to superstar Beyoncé. The items, stored on five hard drives, were stolen from a rental vehicle used by her choreographer, Christopher Grant. The theft occurred in a parking deck and also included laptops, headphones, and other personal valuables. Authorities have secured an arrest warrant for a suspect, but no arrests have been made as of the report. The incident happened while Beyoncé was in the city for her Cowboy Carter Tour.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a significant policy shift, threatening to impose 100% tariffs on any country conducting business with Russia if a peace deal in Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. The move, described as implementing secondary sanctions, reflects growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions. Additionally, the U.S. will sell weapons to NATO allies, who will then transfer them to Ukraine to bolster its defense, with European nations funding the purchases. This strategy aims to increase pressure on Moscow to negotiate an end to the conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, have been intermittently suspended due to new flooding threats. Heavy weekend rains have caused rivers to rise again, prompting officials to warn volunteers to seek higher ground for safety. The initial flooding event killed at least 130 people, and around 160 individuals remain missing in the region. Authorities are monitoring rising water levels along the Guadalupe and San Saba rivers, with forecasters predicting dangerous conditions to persist.</p>

          <p>Paraguayan President Santiago Peña has declared his country's unwavering commitment to its 68-year diplomatic relationship with Taiwan. Speaking at a business forum, Peña framed the alliance as a strategic partnership based on shared democratic values, not merely economic interests. He asserted that Paraguay would defend its sovereign foreign policy and its ties with the self-ruled island "with all its strength." This statement follows a past incident where a Beijing envoy was accused of attempting to persuade Paraguayan lawmakers to switch diplomatic recognition to China.</p>

          <p>A recent shift in President Trump's stance on the Ukraine war, including authorizing new weapons shipments and threatening tariffs, is reportedly rooted in personal frustration rather than a strategic change. According to White House sources, Trump feels that Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ignored his calls to end the conflict, making him appear weak and humiliated. Having entered office believing he could broker a quick peace deal, Trump has grown increasingly angry with Putin's escalations. This analysis suggests the policy change is a direct reaction to being personally slighted and defied by the Russian leader.</p>

          <p>Andrew Cuomo, who resigned as New York's governor amid sexual harassment allegations, has announced he will run for mayor of New York City as an independent candidate. This decision follows his loss in the Democratic primary to progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo's entry into the race adds another high-profile name to the ballot, which also includes the incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The move sets up a complex general election, with some observers suggesting the independent candidates could split the moderate vote.</p>

          <p>The city of San Francisco is rolling out generative artificial intelligence for its 30,000 government workers, making it one of the largest local governments to adopt such technology. Employees will use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o, to assist with administrative tasks like data analysis, report drafting, and language translation. A six-month pilot program involving over 2,000 workers showed productivity gains of up to five hours per week. Officials believe the tool will improve the efficiency of city services and allow employees more time to respond to residents' needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters through a mutualization model. This initiative is part of a "fresh vision" for the service, aimed at rebuilding trust and transforming its culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of postmasters. While the government does not plan to reduce branch numbers, it is exploring long-term structural changes, including mutual or charter models. Any significant change in ownership is not expected until 2030 at the earliest.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can move forward with its plan to terminate more than half of the employees at the Department of Education. The decision, issued via the court's "shadow docket" without a full hearing, allows the firings to proceed while a lawsuit challenging them continues. Critics and dissenting justices argue that these mass firings effectively dismantle federal programs mandated by Congress, raising constitutional questions about the president's power to unilaterally defund or shut down government functions. The move is a significant victory for the administration's goals.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles restaurant scene is facing a wave of closures, including the renowned Michelin-starred izakaya, Shibumi, which will shut down after nine years. Chef-owner David Schlosser cited a significant drop in business as a primary reason. Other notable closures include Cabra, a Peruvian restaurant from "Top Chef" winner Stephanie Izard, and the original L.A. location of Verve Coffee Roasters. These shutdowns reflect broader challenges facing the hospitality industry in the city, with owners pointing to dwindling foot traffic and persistent urban issues that impact their ability to operate successfully.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi as she faces intense criticism from some of his most ardent supporters over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The backlash erupted after the DOJ announced it found no evidence of a "client list" and that no further charges were expected, a conclusion many in the MAGA base reject. Despite Trump's intervention, prominent conservative voices have continued to target Bondi, warning that the perceived lack of transparency could have political consequences.

          <p>Tesla is defending its Autopilot system in a federal court in Miami in a wrongful death lawsuit stemming from a 2019 crash. The lawsuit alleges that a defect in the Autopilot system of a 2019 Model S was responsible for the death of Naibel Benavides Leon, who was killed when the vehicle failed to brake and crashed into a parked truck. The plaintiffs argue the system failed to detect the obstacle, while Tesla contends the crash was caused by a distracted driver who was overriding the car's system. The trial represents a significant legal test for the company's driver-assistance technology.</p>
