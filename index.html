            <p>With market volatility potentially increasing due to tariff policies, financial experts suggest strategies to protect retirement savings. Rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance, building cash reserves, and considering a 'bond ladder' are recommended. Avoiding selling investments during market downturns and maintaining two years of income in cash can help mitigate sequence of returns risk. These strategies aim to provide retirees with confidence and protect their nest egg during uncertain economic times. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is set to present its case for breaking up Google in the final phase of a landmark antitrust trial. The DOJ argues that Google illegally stifled competition by paying to be the default search engine on web browsers and phones, and is calling for the company to stop these payments, spin off its Chrome web browser, and potentially sell its Android smartphone operating system. Google contends that these remedies would harm consumers and innovation, while antitrust experts believe the case will define how digital markets are regulated. </p>

            <p>This article analyzes the potential consequences of a U.S. defeat in the trade war with China, arguing that the Trump administration's policies are strengthening China's geopolitical position and weakening the U.S. The author suggests that China's economic advantages and meticulous preparation give it "escalation dominance," and that a trade-war victory would embolden Beijing in noneconomic matters. The article also highlights the importance of alliances and the potential for voters to sour on tariffs due to rising prices and economic distress.</p>

Trump's administration plans to freeze grants to Harvard after the university refused demands to appoint a White House-approved body to audit viewpoint diversity and shutter DEI programs. Experts argue this is an attempt to undermine and control higher education, echoing authoritarian tactics. This move is seen as part of a broader effort to overhaul US democracy.</p>

            <p>This article examines Adolf Hitler's early economic policies, particularly his use of tariffs, as a means to consolidate power and prepare for war. From the beginning of his chancellorship, Hitler prioritized tariffs to protect German farmers and industry, despite warnings from economic experts about potential trade wars. The author draws parallels between Hitler's economic strategies and his broader vision of national self-reliance and rearmament, suggesting that the trade war was a prelude to a larger conflict.</p>
