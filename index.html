          <p>Deutsche Bank exceeded second-quarter profit expectations, reporting a net profit of €1.485 billion, driven by a significant uptick in its investment banking division. The unit's revenue increased by 3% year-on-year, helping to offset weaker performance in its corporate operations. The German lender is navigating a complex European economic landscape, marked by lower interest rates and trade uncertainty with the United States, but sees new opportunities in advising on defense-related ventures. The results provide a positive signal for the bank amid broader economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced a new policy to provide monthly subsidy vouchers to its senior citizens, a rare form of direct fiscal support aimed at easing the financial burden of its aging population. The electronic coupons, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, are intended for disabled seniors to purchase services like meal assistance and day care. This initiative seeks to unlock household savings and stimulate domestic consumption in the elder care sector, addressing demographic pressures from a population where over 22% are now aged 60 or older.</p>

          <p>The private credit industry is rapidly expanding its focus to the Asia-Pacific region, filling a funding gap left by the pullback of traditional banks. Private credit assets under management in Asia have surged to over $62 billion, as global firms are drawn to the region's economic growth and the needs of mid-market companies. While Western markets are more saturated, countries like India, Indonesia, and Vietnam are becoming key targets for investment, particularly in sectors such as infrastructure, technology, and renewable energy.

          <p>At a summit in Beijing celebrating 50 years of diplomatic ties, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that EU-China relations have reached an "inflection point." She stressed the urgent need to address growing imbalances, particularly the EU's historic €306 billion trade deficit with China. Von der Leyen called for real solutions to rebalance the economic relationship, citing concerns over market access for European firms and China's industrial policies, setting a tense tone for the high-level talks.</p>

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, was recently discovered on a beach in La Jolla, San Diego, a species not typically found in the area. These pelagic snails, known for their striking purple shells and bubble rafts, usually inhabit warmer tropical seas. An oceanography student who found the specimens noted the unusually warm water temperatures, leading researchers to speculate that their appearance could be linked to changing ocean currents and potentially be an indicator of broader climate change effects on marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>As part of the Online Safety Act, new regulations have taken effect in the UK requiring websites with pornographic content to implement robust age-verification systems. Platforms must now use methods like photo ID matching, credit card checks, or facial age estimation to ensure users are over 18, with non-compliant sites facing fines up to £18 million. While the goal is to protect children, the new rules have sparked a debate over user data privacy and the potential for circumvention using tools like VPNs.</p>

Despite the positive headline figure, economists remain cautious, pointing to weak domestic demand and the likelihood that the export-driven boost will not be sustained amid global trade uncertainties.
