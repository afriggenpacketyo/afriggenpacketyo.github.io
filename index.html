          <p>Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced that travelers without a Real ID, passport, or other federally recognized document will face additional screening at U.S. airports starting Wednesday, but will still be allowed to fly. This measure enforces the Real ID law passed in 2005 in response to the 9/11 attacks, with the Biden administration setting May 7, 2025, as the enforcement deadline after multiple extensions. According to Ms. Noem, 81% of travelers already have compliant identification, but travelers with standard state-issued driverâ€™s licenses should allow extra time for security. The TSA assures that alternative verification methods exist, but the process may take longer.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick's new book, "The Art of Winning," features a comparison of Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes, arguing that both quarterbacks are "really good" and excel at handling success. Belichick highlighted Mahomes' focus on missed opportunities after a narrow victory as an example of elite leadership, similar to Brady's constant pursuit of perfection. He also praised Brady's preparation and dependability, noting the challenges and rewards of coaching him. The article also mentions Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson, referred to as his "creative muse" in the book's acknowledgments.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, plans to shut down the direct communications channel between U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem working on Palestinian issues and agencies in Washington. This move will effectively end the special status of the Office of Palestinian Affairs, which had been sending cables to Washington without prior approval from embassy leaders. The decision came after consultations with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with the State Department asserting that the change does not reflect a reduction in outreach to the West Bank or Gaza. This office is responsible for maintaining contact with senior Palestinian officials and reporting on Palestinian issues.</p>

          <p>India reported conducting strikes on nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, responding to a terrorist attack that killed over two dozen civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir two weeks prior. The Indian government stated that the strikes targeted no Pakistani military facilities, focusing on areas with "cross-border linkages" to terrorism. Pakistan countered that five places were hit and vowed retaliation, with President Trump calling the escalation "a shame" and the U.N. urging restraint. The precise nature of the strikes remains unclear, but they mark an intensification of the long-standing conflict between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump, aiming to assert Canada's independence while avoiding conflict, especially after campaigning on an anti-Trump platform. Despite Trump's pre-meeting criticisms of Canada, the meeting was cordial, with Trump praising Carney's electoral victory. Carney emphasized that Canada is "not for sale" in response to Trump's suggestions of annexation, but Trump responded with "never say never." The leaders discussed trade and foreign affairs, including tariffs and the Russia-Ukraine situation, but no major breakthroughs were achieved, though both sides expressed cautious optimism for future relations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston is considering whether non-citizens in the United States have the same free speech protections as U.S. citizens amid court battles over the Trump administration's revocation of foreign student visas. Judge William Young suggested that it is "not clear" that non-citizens have the "full rights to free speech" as citizens have, as the Trump administration attempts to use the speech of some international students to justify their deportations. The case, brought by academic organizations, accuses the administration of creating a climate of repression on university campuses by terrorizing students and faculty for exercising First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is seeking a $7.5 billion federal tax incentive to keep film and television productions in the U.S., aiming to counter the impact of tariffs on overseas productions.

A federal tax incentive could help the entertainment industry recover from recent setbacks, including the pandemic and strikes, and maintain its position as a global leader.

          <p>Mattel is considering raising prices on U.S. toys in response to tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, according to CEO Ynon Kreiz. This comes after President Trump suggested children could have fewer toys. The company is taking strategic actions to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including diversifying its manufacturing locations. Mattel estimates that the tariffs could cost it $270 million this year, but it plans to reduce its reliance on China in the coming years. The U.S. Toy Assn. is advocating for zero tariffs on toys.</p>

          <p>Oil prices are falling due to economic uncertainty caused by tariffs and increased production from OPEC+, leading to lower gasoline prices for consumers. While this benefits consumers and lowers shipping costs, it negatively impacts U.S. oil producers, who may cut spending and hiring. The U.S. is the largest oil producer, and the combination of tariffs and OPEC+ production hikes is hampering domestic production. This situation contradicts President Trump's vision of an expanding U.S. oil industry.</p>
