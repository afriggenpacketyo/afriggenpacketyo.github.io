          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit to remove Democratic State Representative Gene Wu from office, labeling him the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout. Dozens of Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a contentious redistricting map favored by former President Trump. Abbott's legal action argues that the lawmakers abandoned their duties, a claim disputed by Democrats who call the move a fulfillment of their oath to oppose a "racist gerrymandered map." The case highlights a significant political and constitutional showdown over legislative power and electoral boundaries in the state.</p>

          <p>Ten years after their debut appearance, K-pop group Monsta X returned to the KCON festival in Los Angeles as headliners, showcasing their enduring appeal and strong group dynamic. The performance marked their first U.S. appearance as a reunited group following a two-year hiatus for South Korea's mandatory military service, a milestone that has often been a breaking point for other bands. Despite the absence of one member due to injury, the group delivered a powerful show, reaffirming their connection with a loyal fanbase. Their return signals a new era for the veteran group, which is preparing to release a new album.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows notable drops in violent crimes like murder, which fell by 14.9%, and property crimes, including a significant 18.6% decrease in motor vehicle thefts. While experts credit various factors for the decline, the report also notes a slight decrease in hate crime incidents, though some groups have seen increases in targeted offenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To protect tenants from extreme heat, Los Angeles County has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees. The measure, which passed with a 4-0 vote from the Board of Supervisors, addresses the rising public health risk of heat-related deaths amid climate change. While the law takes effect next month, enforcement will not begin until 2027, giving property owners time to comply, potentially through passive cooling methods like blackout curtains or reflective roofing. The ordinance reflects a growing trend of municipal governments enacting climate adaptation policies to safeguard vulnerable residents.</p>

          <p>A partnership between a Los Angeles charter school and the nonprofit Trust for Public Land is demonstrating how replacing asphalt playgrounds with green spaces can have significant benefits. The new grass and plants at Camino Nuevo Charter Academy have cooled the playground's surface temperature by 40 degrees, creating a safer and more inviting environment for students. This initiative addresses the "concrete jungle" effect in many urban communities and tackles the issue of children staying indoors due to a lack of safe outdoor areas. The project highlights a nature-based solution to mitigate urban heat and improve children's well-being and development.</p>

Kennedy Jr., has announced the cancellation of $500 million in funding for 22 projects developing mRNA vaccines for viruses like influenza and bird flu. Citing claims that the technology "poses more risks than benefits," the department is redirecting funds to what it calls "safer, broader vaccine platforms." This decision, impacting major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna, has drawn sharp criticism from health experts. Critics argue the move is based on debunked views and will undermine the nation's ability to respond to future pandemics, given the rapid development cycle of mRNA technology.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of California is reportedly the subject of a federal criminal investigation into potential mortgage fraud, according to a source from the Trump administration. The investigation, said to be conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland, follows a criminal referral from the Federal Housing Finance Agency last month. The referral alleged that Schiff falsified documents to secure more favorable loan terms by claiming a Maryland property as his primary residence. Schiff has also claimed a condominium in Burbank, California, as his primary residence, raising questions about the conflicting declarations.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court ruling, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The court found that while the policy could pause access to the asylum system, it could not override laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face torture or persecution. This decision effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims for those entering the U.S. illegally, a significant shift from the administration's policy, which had been credited with a sharp drop in border apprehensions. The move halts swift deportations and requires officials to process migrants under established immigration law.</p>

          <p>A CBS News review indicates that the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to significantly overstate its savings from cutting federal contracts. An analysis of three large canceled contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services shows the actual savings are around $165 million, less than 3% of the $6.4 billion claimed by DOGE. The agency reports savings based on the total potential value of contracts, a figure that experts note is rarely reached, rather than the amount of obligated funds left unspent. This practice of "transparency theater" has led to criticism that the reported $199 billion in total savings is largely fictional. (not investment advice)</p>

A key issue is communicating complex, probability-based data in a simple format for TV or apps.

          <p>Shares of real estate technology company Opendoor fell over 20% in after-hours trading following an earnings report that projected a significant revenue decline for the upcoming quarter. The drop occurred despite a recent surge in the stock's value, fueled by speculative interest from investors. CEO Carrie Wheeler acknowledged the newfound "enthusiasm" but faced a challenging reality, as the company's forecast for home acquisitions and revenue pointed to continued struggles in a housing market suppressed by high mortgage rates. The company is now pivoting its strategy toward a less capital-intensive referrals business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from fashion retailer Zara, ruling that they were irresponsible for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog determined that specific poses, lighting, and styling made the models look "gaunt" and emphasized "protruding" collarbones. Zara, which has since removed the ads, stated that both models had medical certificates confirming their good health. The ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers, reflecting a continued regulatory focus on promoting responsible body image in advertising.</p>

          <p>One of the UK's largest debt advisory services, Money Wellness, is calling for the government to introduce a statutory school clothing grant for low-income families in England. Unlike in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland where support is standardized, only about a fifth of English councils offer any help, creating a "postcode lottery." With uniform costs averaging over £340 for primary school children, many families face significant financial strain. The charity argues that a consistent, national approach is needed to ensure no child is disadvantaged by their family's inability to afford required school attire.</p>

Despite investor fears over economic data and potential tariffs, Cramer pointed to the strong profits being reported by many companies. He suggested that Wall Street is overly bearish on major companies like Apple and Amazon and that many businesses are successfully mitigating the impact of tariffs. He concluded that the underlying performance of companies is strong, despite what he sees as perceived, rather than actual, negatives. (not investment advice)</p>

The call for a federal probe comes after the county agreed to a $4 billion settlement for thousands of abuse cases, yet no criminal charges have been filed against the perpetrators. Attorney John Manly, whose firm is not part of the settlement, argues that the county supervised facilities that became "dens of sexual predation" and that a lack of criminal accountability suggests political corruption or indifference.
