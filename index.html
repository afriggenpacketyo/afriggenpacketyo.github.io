          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but quickly accused both sides of violating the agreement, expressing frustration that they couldn't control their forces. Israel accused Iran of launching missiles shortly before the ceasefire was to take effect, resulting in casualties in Beersheba, and responded with strikes on Tehran. Despite the violations, Trump maintained the ceasefire was holding after a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, where he was reportedly "exceptionally firm and direct." Israel stated it had ceased attacks after a limited strike, while Trump likened the conflict to "two kids in a schoolyard." The situation highlights the complexities of enforcing peace in the region. Optimism is cautious given the initial violations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons, joining NATO's airborne nuclear mission in what Downing Street calls "the biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation." These dual-capability jets can also carry conventional weapons, offering flexibility in defense strategies. While the US would control the release and use of nuclear weapons, the UK will retain the right to participate or not, based on governance arrangements. This decision follows a Strategic Defence Review, which highlighted increasing nuclear risks from other states. The move is seen as a victory for the RAF, supporting 20,000 jobs across the UK supply chain.</p>

          <p>Louisiana is investing heavily to attract Meta's massive $10 billion data center, offering a 20-year sales tax exemption and providing a vast 2,250-acre site. The data center, which will be the largest in the Western Hemisphere, is expected to transform Louisiana's economy, creating 500 permanent jobs and 5,000 construction jobs. The state had previously purchased the land in hopes of attracting an automotive plant, and Entergy, a local utility, is planning to build three gas-fired power plants to meet the data center's energy demands. While the project promises economic growth, it also raises concerns about energy consumption and the long-term benefits for the state.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are stuck in a holding pattern due to economic uncertainty and military conflicts, with little movement despite significant global events. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased slightly to 6.88%, but has remained in a narrow range around 7% since early April. Applications for a mortgage to buy a home dropped 0.4% last week, remaining historically low despite being 11% higher than the same week last year. This lack of incentive for homebuyers is compounded by inflated house prices and low supply, with the average loan size for purchase applications declining to $436,300, the lowest level since January 2025.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Europe fell for the fifth consecutive month in May, with a 27.9% year-on-year decrease, as customers increasingly switch to cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. The company's European market share also dropped from 1.8% to 1.2% during the same period, reinforcing a downward regional trend. While Tesla faces rising competition from traditional automakers and Chinese players like BYD, the revamped Model Y compact SUV was thought to help deliver a turnaround.

          <p>Caitlin Clark struggled with her shooting, scoring only six points as the Indiana Fever relied on Aliyah Boston's career-high 31 points to secure a 94-86 victory over the Seattle Storm.

Despite Clark's struggles, teammates expressed confidence in her abilities, emphasizing that every great player experiences such phases. Boston's performance, along with Kelsey Mitchell's 26 points, helped the Fever improve to a 7-7 record, halting the Storm's three-game winning streak.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted the "total obliteration" of Iran's nuclear program, contradicting an early Pentagon report suggesting limited damage from U.S.-Israeli strikes. The report indicated Iran might have relocated enriched uranium stocks before the strikes, setting back the program by months, not decades, as Trump claimed. Defense Secretary Hegseth and Secretary of State Rubio supported Trump's position, alleging the initial report was leaked for political reasons. Democratic Senators Shaheen and Coons called for answers, suggesting the conflict could have been avoided if Trump hadn't withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal, with Shaheen suggesting the attacks may lead Iran to accelerate its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Wraps, once a popular food trend in the 1990s, are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, driven by renewed interest in low-calorie and high-protein options. McDonald's is bringing back its chicken Snack Wrap after a Change.org petition, and Popeyes has introduced new chicken wraps. This revival coincides with a shift back towards thinness and dieting, with low-carb and high-protein diets gaining traction, and the use of weight-loss drugs on the rise. Once seen as a sensible and tidy alternative to traditional sandwiches, wraps are now being embraced by fitness enthusiasts and those seeking functional, low-calorie meal options.</p>

          <p>Assessments of the damage to Iran's nuclear program are ongoing, with initial reports suggesting the strikes only set back Iran's efforts by months rather than years. A leaked Defence Intelligence Agency assessment indicates that the core components of Iran's nuclear program have not been destroyed. Intelligence agencies are employing various methods, including satellite imagery, seismic detectors, radiation sniffers, and intercepted communications, to develop a clearer picture of the damage. There are indications that Tehran moved its stock of highly enriched uranium to another location before the attack. The conflict is likely to resume if signs indicate Tehran is secretly reconstituting the program or racing for a bomb.</p>

While the pound has surged 8.7% against the US dollar this year, it has depreciated against the euro by 2.9%. Some analysts attribute the pound's strength to underlying dollar weakness, while others believe it's a recovery from the aftermath of Liz Truss's mini budget.

          <p>Japanese pop group Tokio, formerly part of Johnny & Associates Inc., has decided to disband following member Taichi Kokubun's hiatus due to a misconduct scandal. The all-male group, known for its support of Fukushima Prefecture after the 2011 nuclear crisis, left the talent agency after allegations of sexual abuse against the agency's late founder. The group stated that it would be difficult to regain trust and continue receiving support. Kokubun's hiatus follows a recent sexual scandal involving former TV host Masahiro Nakai, and another former Tokio member left in 2018 after a sexual assault incident.</p>

          <p>German police have conducted searches of over 65 properties and questioned numerous suspects in an operation to combat online hate speech. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) supervised the operation, which is connected with more than 140 investigations. Approximately two-thirds of the online statements under criminal investigation originate from radical right-wing sources. The suspects are accused of inciting hatred, insulting politicians, and using symbols of terrorist groups or unconstitutional organizations. The police operation, the 12th of its kind, indicates a surge in such offenses in recent years.</p>

This visit marks Trump's second state visit to the UK, with the previous one hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II in 2019.

The rise of homophobic language and challenges to transgender rights, including rescinding rights at state and federal levels, have created a climate of fear and uncertainty.

          <p>A Republican budget bill in Congress proposes significant Medicaid cuts, potentially leading to millions of Americans losing health insurance and thousands of additional deaths annually. The bill, which would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, could result in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled in the program by 2034. A Harvard-affiliated research analysis estimates that these coverage losses could lead to 8,200 to 24,600 additional annual deaths. The proposed work requirements and limits on state financing tools are expected to worsen Americans' health, impacting access to preventive care and increasing financial burdens for low-income individuals.</p>
