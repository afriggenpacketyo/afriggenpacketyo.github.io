          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, initially feared lost at sea, was successfully rescued after spending a night alone on an uninhabited island. The teenager, Darcy Deefholts, had gone surfing off the coast of Wooli in New South Wales and failed to return, prompting a large-scale search. He was discovered the following day on North Solitary Island, approximately seven miles offshore, in what his father described as a "one in a million miracle." Marine Rescue crews expressed their joy at the positive outcome, and the surfer was taken for medical evaluation after his ordeal.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has provided a summer travel outlook that surpassed Wall Street expectations, even as it adjusted its full-year profit forecast downward. The carrier anticipates strong third-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by robust demand for premium seating and its lucrative partnership with American Express. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while overall booking patterns have shifted, high-end consumer demand remains resilient. The airline is strategically trimming flight capacity for periods outside of the peak summer travel season to align with current, more cautious consumer behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's postal service regulator, Ofcom, has approved Royal Mail's plan to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as a cost-saving measure. This change, effective in late July, means second-class mail will be delivered on alternating weekdays, while first-class deliveries will continue six days a week. The move is a response to the declining volume of letter mail, which has fallen from 20 billion items in 2004 to 6.6 billion in 2023-24. While Royal Mail welcomed the reform to ensure financial sustainability, the decision has drawn criticism from consumer groups and some businesses.</p>

          <p>South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial legal victory at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ruled that her right to a fair hearing was violated by a Swiss court. The case stems from her challenge to World Athletics regulations that require athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) to lower their testosterone levels to compete in certain female events. While the ECHR found a procedural violation by Switzerland, it deemed her discrimination complaints inadmissible. The ruling does not immediately overturn the current athletics regulations but represents a significant step in her long-running legal battle.</p>

          <p>A recent Republican spending bill has allocated a massive $75 billion funding increase to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), signaling a significant escalation of the Trump administration's immigration policies. This infusion of cash will allow the agency to more than double its detention capacity and provides a blank check for enforcement and deportation activities. Critics and civil liberties advocates express deep concern that the increased resources will lead to more indiscriminate arrests, undermine due process, and worsen conditions in detention centers. The bill also incentivizes state and local governments to collaborate with federal immigration authorities, potentially eroding sanctuary policies nationwide.</p>

The attack, which occurred in the Valdivia region, was attributed to the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group. According to officials, the explosive-laden animal was directed towards a platoon of soldiers, highlighting the escalating violence in the country despite government efforts to achieve "total peace." This incident comes after peace talks with the ELN were suspended earlier in the year following deadly raids by the group.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a stark warning that the nation faces a rising and unpredictable threat from Iran, urging the government to adopt a more robust, long-term strategy. The intelligence and security committee's report highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings of UK-based individuals, primarily regime opponents, since early 2022. The report accuses the government of being too focused on crisis management and the nuclear issue, thereby underestimating the broad spectrum of threats Iran poses, from espionage to cyber attacks, on UK soil.</p>

          <p>Significant cuts in U.S. foreign aid under the Trump administration are severely impacting South Africa's fight against HIV/AIDS, threatening to reverse decades of progress.

Health experts and researchers worry that this will lead to a resurgence in HIV infections and other diseases, and has already set back vital research for an HIV vaccine.

The specific segments for the barriers were chosen after noise analyses and a vote by the affected property owners and residents.

          <p>This opinion article explores the potential impact of implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) in California, drawing comparisons to its use in New York City. Proponents argue that RCV could reduce election costs by eliminating runoffs, increase voter turnout, and encourage less negative campaigning. In California's top-two primary system, RCV might not prevent one-party general elections but could give underrepresented parties a better chance in competitive races. The author suggests the system could lead to more centrist outcomes through strategic crossover voting or, conversely, push candidates to more extreme positions, fundamentally altering campaign strategies and political alignments within the state.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department is conducting investigations into more than 80 complaints of officer misconduct stemming from protests last month, with over half of the allegations involving excessive force. The department's Professional Standards Bureau is examining hours of body-camera footage and interviewing witnesses, with some investigations initiated internally after media reports. The LAPD's response to the demonstrations has been heavily criticized as indiscriminate, prompting lawsuits from protesters and press advocacy groups. This scrutiny is seen as a major test of the department's commitment to accountability and reform following past criticisms of its crowd control tactics.</p>

          <p>A new poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies indicates that a vast majority of California voters feel American democracy is in peril. The survey found that 64% of voters believe democracy is under attack, with an additional 26% feeling it is being tested, a sentiment that cuts across partisan, demographic, and geographic lines. While Democrats were the most fearful, a significant number of Republicans also expressed unease. Political scientists suggest these concerns are rooted in recent political turmoil, including baseless election fraud claims and the perceived weaponization of government agencies.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece praises the expansion of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) as a rare example of good, bipartisan policy within the recently signed "Big Beautiful Bill." The author argues that HSAs promote individual responsibility and help reduce healthcare costs by allowing for triple tax-advantaged savings. The new legislation includes several positive reforms, such as allowing individuals in certain Affordable Care Act plans to contribute to HSAs and permitting HSA funds to pay for direct primary care memberships. While acknowledging more work is needed, the article views these changes as a significant and popular step toward greater healthcare freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that while President Trump is not directly to blame for the deadly Texas floods, his administration's actions warrant scrutiny and accountability. The author criticizes the administration for gutting federal agencies responsible for weather forecasting and disaster recovery, such as the National Weather Service, even as climate change intensifies storms. The piece contends that questioning the impact of these budget cuts and staffing shortages is not politicizing a tragedy but is a necessary act of holding the government accountable. The author dismisses the White House's complaints about such questions and urges a focus on ensuring federal agencies are equipped to protect Americans.</p>

          <p>In a successful rescue operation, all 31 workers trapped after a tunnel collapse at an industrial complex in Los Angeles were brought to safety. The collapse occurred at an 18-foot diameter tunnel being built for wastewater management, trapping the workers behind a large pile of soil. The workers were able to move over the debris to meet colleagues and were then shuttled out in groups through the five-mile-long tunnel. Over 100 LAFD responders, including specialized Urban Search and Rescue teams, were at the scene, with officials calling the outcome a blessing with no injuries reported.</p>

          <p>Germany's federal police commissioner has highlighted poor working conditions and a massive accumulation of overtime hours, largely due to the implementation of stricter border controls. A new report details the strain on officers, with resources being diverted from other duties and creating personnel gaps elsewhere. The commissioner, Uli Grötsch, described some infrastructure at checkpoints as "alarming," citing a lack of proper facilities for officers. The report also addresses the legal ambiguity officers face when ordered to turn back asylum seekers, a practice a court has ruled illegal, and calls for more sensitivity to avoid racial profiling.</p>

The attack, which killed a rally attendee, prompted the resignation of the agency's director and led to intense scrutiny and critical reports from Congress.

          <p>Years before the recent deadly floods, Kerr County, Texas, struggled to fund a crucial flood warning system, a problem now intensified by the Trump administration's cuts to disaster preparedness programs. The county's applications for FEMA grants were denied, and a state fund would have required the locality to cover 95% of the cost, making the project unfeasible. The article highlights a nationwide issue where at-risk communities cannot afford preventative infrastructure. The administration's move to cancel billions in federal aid and shift responsibility to states creates a significant funding gap for communities facing increasing threats from climate-related disasters.</p>

          <p>The UK government has decided against implementing a zonal pricing system for electricity, which would have set bills based on a consumer's geographic location. Instead, it will focus on reforming the current national pricing system. Proponents of zonal pricing, like Octopus Energy's CEO, argued it could lower bills in energy-generating regions like Scotland and encourage industry to relocate. However, some major energy firms like SSE warned the change could deter investment. The decision provides policy clarity for the industry but, according to some analysts, fails to resolve the deep-rooted issues in Great Britain's electricity market. (not investment advice)</p>
