Since its direct listing in 2021, Coinbase has become a significant part of the U.S. financial system, boosted by the rising value of Bitcoin and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Despite its volatility, Coinbase reported net income of $65.6 million in the last quarter and plans to acquire Dubai-based Deribit for $2.9 billion to expand its global presence. The addition to the S&P 500 is expected to increase the stock's value as funds tracking the index add it to their portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Many millennials and Gen Zers are finding financial security elusive despite increases in their net worth, leading some to believe that 'weâ€™re living in two separate economies'. Rising costs of housing, healthcare, and insurance, combined with the increased responsibility for retirement funding, contribute to this struggle. Experts argue that the problem is structural rather than behavioral, making it harder for young people to achieve traditional markers of success. As a result, many are adapting by living with parents longer, sharing childcare, and finding new ways to build community, highlighting the challenges of achieving financial stability in the modern economy.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have proposed cutting an estimated $715 billion from Medicaid, potentially leaving 8.6 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade. Republicans argue that these cuts are necessary to eliminate waste and offset the costs of President Trump's tax bill. The plan includes stricter eligibility verification, work requirements, and changes to federal funding for states. Experts warn that increasing administrative burdens could cause eligible individuals to lose coverage, and some Republicans have expressed concerns about the cuts.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing legislation that would require many Medicaid recipients to demonstrate they are working, volunteering, or attending school for at least 80 hours a month to maintain coverage. The proposal aims to cut costs and ensure the program serves those who need it most, but critics warn it could harm vulnerable Americans and risk hospital finances. Medicaid recipients would also need to verify their community engagement eligibility twice a year, and the bill includes more rigorous income verification processes for Affordable Care Act coverage. The requirements, if passed, would take effect on January 1, 2029.</p>

          <p>Rents are surging across the U.S., requiring renters to earn at least $80,000 annually to afford a typical apartment, up from $60,000 in 2020.

The average rent in New York City is $2,950, significantly higher than the national average, highlighting the growing housing affordability crisis. The lack of adequate housing supply and lagging wage growth contribute to the problem, prompting calls for Congress to expand programs that support affordable housing.</p>

Despite this, the CBO confirmed that the recommendations would meet the target of $880 billion in savings over the next decade. President Trump urged Republicans to unify around the bill, highlighting the potential for savings through drug and pharmaceutical cuts. However, some Republicans are already signaling a brewing battle, with concerns about increasing the national debt.</p>

          <p>A temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, marked by reduced tariffs, highlights the contradictions in President Trump's approach, according to a Vox article. While large tariffs risk economic damage, modest ones may not achieve the desired rebalancing of the global trading order. The author suggests that the Trump administration is seeking a 'Goldilocks tariff level' that is difficult to achieve, as modest tariffs may only increase costs without causing significant economic shifts. This shift suggests a move away from grand ambitions of reorganizing global trade and towards seeking a deal that can be claimed as a win.</p>
