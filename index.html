          <p>Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne will depart after 10 years with the club, and manager Pep Guardiola has praised him as the second-best passer he has ever worked with, behind only Lionel Messi. Guardiola expressed that it would be difficult to find another player with De Bruyne's passing ability, citing his unique talent and contributions to the team, particularly in the final third. He emphasized De Bruyne's exceptional stats, goals, and assists, solidifying his place as one of the best players in the club's history. Guardiola previously managed other pass-masters such as Andres Iniesta and Xavi at Barcelona, and former City midfielder David Silva.</p>

          <p>Recent clashes between India and Pakistan, which resulted in a fragile ceasefire brokered by the U.S. President Donald Trump, underscore the escalating dangers posed by new military technologies. The conflict dynamics were significantly shaped by the use of missiles, drones, and loitering munitions, marking the first instance of Chinese, American, Russian, and French weapons systems being deployed in such a conflict. The deployment of these advanced weapons incentivized limited actions, leading to tit-for-tat responses and a prolonged crisis, while both sides alluded to constraints in their military responses. This conflict exemplifies the restraint-escalation paradox, where emerging technologies facilitate both kinetic action and restraint simultaneously.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Ritchie, convicted of fatally shooting Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney in 2000, is scheduled to be executed in Indiana, marking the state's second execution since 2009. Ritchie's attorneys argued that he suffered brain damage from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder and mistreatment as a toddler, impairing his decision-making abilities at the time of the shooting. The Indiana Parole Board rejected his clemency plea, and Governor Mike Braun allowed the execution to proceed, prompting challenges in federal court. Officer Toney's widow urged officials to move forward with the execution, seeking closure for their family after 25 years.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful, declaring DOGE's actions "null and void." The decision orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose, and criticizes the administration's use of force and threats to seize the USIP headquarters, despite the agency's independence from the executive branch. Judge Beryl Howell emphasized that Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional. The USIP expressed its readiness to resume its programs following the ruling.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating a brief radio system outage at the Philadelphia air traffic control center, which handles flights at Newark Liberty International Airport. This incident marks the fourth such occurrence at Newark Airport since April 28, raising concerns about equipment and staffing issues. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy mentioned that upgrades to the nation's air traffic control system are underway, involving new software and equipment, but the existing system relies on decades-old technology, with replacement parts sometimes sourced from eBay or 3D printers. The problems highlight the severe shortage of air traffic controllers across the U.S.</p>

This decision signifies a notable shift for the largest U.S. bank, given Dimon's history of criticizing bitcoin and the broader crypto market, and reflects the growing mainstream acceptance of bitcoin as an investment.</p>

The ship, carrying 277 people including 175 naval cadets, was on a good-will tour. Investigations are underway by the Mexican Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and National Transportation Safety Board to determine the cause, considering mechanical failure, tugboat involvement, or human error. The ship was en route to Reykjavik, Iceland, after departing New York, and the incident occurred during a traditional farewell ritual where cadets stand on the masts.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to remove protections from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, pending appeal. This decision reverses a lower court's block on the administration's plan, potentially leading to deportations. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, and the court suggested some Venezuelans might sue to challenge their deportations if they had legal documentation before the program's termination. The ruling affects Venezuelans living legally in the U.S. under a Biden-era program, and follows criticism of the administration for seeking to deport a separate group of Venezuelan immigrants with minimal warning under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt, citing the bill's potential to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields initially rose after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating, with the 30-year Treasury yield briefly surpassing 5%. Moody's cited the increasing burden of financing the government's budget deficit and high debt rollover costs for the downgrade. Investors later shook off the downgrade, driving yields lower from their highs. The downgrade aligns Moody's with other major credit rating agencies that had already given the U.S. their second-highest rating. The 10-year yield moved above 4.5% and the 30-year rate hit 5%, causing the Trump administration to back off the stiffest tariffs on fears they was causing a financial panic and would raise rates for consumers.

The policy push has created odd bedfellows, with the National Restaurant Association supporting it and labor economists, budget hawks, and some restaurant interest groups opposing it. The analysis suggests that the tax benefits may not extend as far for lower-income workers as many may think, potentially favoring middle-income individuals more.</p>
