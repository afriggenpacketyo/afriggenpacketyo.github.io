          <h2>Chinese Robotics Founder Predicts Humanoid Robot Breakthrough Within Three Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 03:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wang Xingxing, founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, predicts that the industry's "ChatGPT moment" could occur within the next two to three years. He defines this breakthrough as a robot's ability to perform a novel task, like fetching a water bottle, in a completely unfamiliar environment. While current hardware is sufficient, Wang believes the key missing element is more advanced AI for embodied intelligence, expressing doubts about the capabilities of current models. He suggests that generative world models, like Google's Genie 3, which create interactive simulations for robots to follow, represent a more promising path toward achieving this milestone.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are pleading with residents of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to cease all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets, following a major service disruption. A broken water control valve has left approximately 9,200 households without reliable water service for several days during a heatwave, prompting a boil water advisory. Efforts to restore service by repressurizing a 10-million-gallon tank are being hampered by continued residential consumption, which caused pressure to drop overnight. A subsequent failure of a temporary bypass pipe has further delayed repairs, which are complex due to the valve's location 20 feet underground.</p>

          <p>Northern China is experiencing its traditional rainy season with significant impact, marking the fifth major flood disaster in the region since 2012. The recent deadly floods in Beijing are considered unusual because they primarily affected the northern parts of the capital. This contrasts with previous severe flooding events in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the city's southern areas. The recurring nature of these extreme weather events highlights ongoing challenges for the region in managing heavy rainfall and its devastating consequences.</p>

          <p>South Korean star Son Heung-min made an effective debut for Los Angeles FC, quickly making his presence felt in a 2-2 draw against the Chicago Fire. Entering the match as a substitute in the 61st minute, the 33-year-old forward was instrumental in securing a point for his new team. In the 81st minute, Son drew a foul in the penalty area, which was confirmed by VAR and subsequently converted by Denis Bouanga for the equalizing goal. The result leaves LAFC in fifth place in the Western Conference, with Son's arrival signaling a significant reinforcement for the team's title aspirations.</p>

          <p>New Barcelona signing Marcus Rashford is scheduled to make his home debut in a friendly, though the club faces significant off-field challenges. His official league debut was nearly delayed by financial issues, which required the club to temporarily de-register injured captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen to comply with La Liga's salary rules. The club is also racing against time to complete renovations on its Camp Nou stadium, forcing the friendly to be held at a small training ground. Despite the chaos, Rashford has impressed in pre-season, scoring his first goal and positioning himself for a key role.</p>

The author points to Russia's withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and Vladimir Putin's repeated nuclear threats as major escalations. The piece also criticizes the corresponding buildup of NATO's nuclear-capable forces in Europe and a global arms race among the nine nuclear states. The author warns that this trend, combined with the collapse of arms control agreements, is making the planet a potential killing field.</p>

          <p>Numerous publicly funded projects and nonprofit organizations in Germany are working to help female refugees find employment, addressing a significant integration gap. Studies show that while 68% of all refugees find work within eight years, two-thirds of refugee women remain unemployed, facing disadvantages as women, immigrants, and refugees. Key barriers include a lack of childcare, difficulty in getting foreign qualifications recognized, and language hurdles. Organizations like "Work for Refugees" and ReDi School of Digital Integration offer counseling, skills training, and mentoring, often staffed by women with their own refugee experiences, creating a supportive network to empower others.</p>

The series focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who suppressed a separatist state in Xinjiang, framing his actions as a defense of Chinese sovereignty. This production is part of a broader effort by Beijing to reinforce its official history and governance of border regions, promoting a unified "Chinese nation" identity. The documentary portrays the separatist leader Yaqub Beg as a foreign-backed jihadist, a view that contrasts sharply with his veneration by some modern Islamic fundamentalist groups.</p>

While ultra-luxe brands have weathered the downturn, others are shifting strategy to regain relevance after significant price hikes were not met with product innovation.

This article details a sentiment among staff that the attack is a physical manifestation of years of escalating hostility and verbal attacks from politicians against public health workers. Employees expressed that threats have become commonplace since the pandemic, fueled by misinformation and anti-vaccine rhetoric from figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The slow response from leadership and ongoing budget cuts have left staff feeling abandoned and that danger has now arrived on their home front.</p>

          <p>The Colorado Department of Corrections evacuated 179 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center as a large wildfire, known as the Lee Fire, continues to spread. The inmates from the minimum-security facility were safely transferred to other secure locations outside the fire-affected area. As of Saturday evening, the Lee Fire had burned over 92,000 acres, making it one of the largest wildfires in the state's recent history, with only 6% containment. Shifting winds on Friday caused the fire to advance rapidly, prompting new evacuation orders in Rio Blanco and Garfield counties.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance participated in high-stakes diplomatic talks in the United Kingdom with European allies and Ukrainian officials. The meeting occurred just a day after President Donald Trump announced a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The talks, held at Chevening House, reportedly produced "significant progress" toward a peaceful resolution. Ukrainian officials have insisted that any negotiations must include them, a concern echoed by European leaders, especially after Trump suggested the possibility of "swapping of territories" as part of a potential deal.</p>
