          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, securing their first title since relocating from Seattle. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 29 points and 12 assists, while Jalen Williams contributed 20 points. The Thunder outscored the Pacers 34-20 in the third quarter, building a lead they would not relinquish. This victory marks the second championship for the franchise, with the Seattle SuperSonics winning in 1979; the team moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, and the team has tied the 1996-97 Chicago Bulls for third-most wins in any season with 84 games won between the regular season and the playoffs. The Pacers, despite a strong effort from Bennedict Mathurin, could not overcome the Thunder's dominance. The final score was 103-91.</p>

          <p>French police are investigating a staged wedding at Disneyland Paris involving a 9-year-old Ukrainian girl. A man reportedly hired the park for €130,000, bringing in hundreds of extras to act as guests. The park's staff became suspicious when they saw the young girl, who could barely stand in high heels, and alerted the authorities, suspecting it was an illegal child marriage. The girl's mother claimed she wanted her daughter to feel like a Disney princess for a day, according to investigators, and a medical examination showed the girl had not been harmed. Four people, including the supposed groom, the mother, and two Latvian nationals, have been taken into custody.</p>

          <p>Okinawa marked the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War II ground battle between Japan and the United States, which resulted in over 200,000 deaths. A service was held at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman, attended by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki. The Battle of Okinawa, from March through June 1945, heavily impacted the local population, with one in four residents killed. The island was under U.S. administration until 1972 and continues to host a large portion of U.S. forces in Japan, and anti-base sentiment remains strong due to noise, pollution, and crimes committed by American service members.</p>

          <p>Oil markets are bracing for increased volatility after the U.S. entered the war between Iran and Israel, with some experts predicting oil prices could reach $100 a barrel. Investors are closely monitoring Iran's potential reactions following U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. Threats of blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global oil trade, have further heightened market jitters. Experts suggest that a prolonged closure or even harassment of passage through the Strait could lead to a significant spike in oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senior FBI and Homeland Security officials held conference calls with governors and top law enforcement officials to discuss the impact of U.S. missile strikes in Iran on the U.S. threat environment. While there is no specific intelligence of a direct, credible threat against the U.S. homeland, the FBI is enhancing its posture and monitoring intelligence. Federal officials urged vigilance for an increase in cyber activity and encouraged outreach to state agencies, infrastructure partners, and potentially at-risk groups, including Jewish institutions. The Secure Community Network warned that Jewish institutions and leaders should be considered at an elevated risk for retaliatory violence, citing a surge in violent social media posts directed at the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department initially posted condolences on social media for the "tragic" U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, before amending and eventually deleting the post. The original post stated that the department was closely monitoring the situation alongside local, state, and federal partners. The amended post deleted the sentence referencing the U.S. strikes, and it was later removed entirely. The U.S. military carried out strikes targeting nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan in Operation Midnight Hammer, and the Trump administration has described the operation as a success that has degraded Tehran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Judge Barbara Holmes stated that the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, but acknowledged he would likely be taken into ICE custody instead. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who was deported despite a 2019 court order, recently returned to the U.S. to face these federal charges. Prosecutors argue he conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status across the U.S. between 2016-2025, while the defense claims the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in his case.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials provided details about the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer." The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew from Missouri to Iran, with others acting as decoys. The strikes targeted nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with Tomahawk cruise missiles launched at Isfahan prior to the bombers' arrival. The U.S. deployed deception tactics and fighter jets to clear the airspace, and initial assessments indicate severe damage and destruction to all three sites.

          <p>President Trump addressed the issue of regime change in Iran after authorizing strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. In a post on Truth Social, Trump questioned why there wouldn't be a regime change if the current Iranian regime is unable to "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." He deemed the bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites as “a spectacular military success” and stated that Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been “completely and totally obliterated.” Trump's remarks suggest a potential shift towards a more aggressive stance regarding Iran's leadership.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is drawing renewed attention as Japan's first zero giant panda moment in over half a century approaches. With Sino-U.S. rivalry intensifying, China may seek to stabilize relations with Tokyo through panda loans. Foreign affairs experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan. While pandas have been a symbol of friendship, some analysts are skeptical that a new loan will significantly impact Japanese diplomatic posture or public opinion.</p>

          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence increases, potentially harmful responses are being uncovered, including hate speech, copyright infringements, or sexual content. Researchers say that a lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models compound the emergence of these undesirable behaviors. Red teaming, a practice involving testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, is one way to evaluate risks in AI. Standardized 'AI flaw' reports and incentives are some of the recommendations put forth to ensure a better understanding of the risks posed by AI tools and users.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia will likely be placed in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody despite a Tennessee judge ordering his release in his criminal case. Judge Barbara Holmes denied the government's motion to detain Abrego Garcia but acknowledged that if released, he would be detained by ICE pending further removal proceedings. Abrego Garcia faces criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S., with prosecutors claiming a conspiracy involving the transport of thousands of noncitizens. Holmes said the government failed to prove there is a "serious risk" that Abrego Garcia will flee or obstruct justice.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert suggests using alternative phrases to encourage cooperation in children, avoiding threats, bribes, and harsh consequences. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries fosters cooperation. Examples include explaining decisions instead of saying "Because I said so," and focusing on readiness rather than issuing threats. Dismissing a child's emotions can lead to disconnection, and reframing frustrated questions can invite problem-solving.</p>

Iran controls the northern side of the strait, making it one of the most vital oil "chokepoints" in the world.
