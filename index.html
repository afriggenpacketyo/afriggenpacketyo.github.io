          <p>A rare 3,000-year-old golden bracelet belonging to King Amenemope has been irreversibly lost after being stolen from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. A restoration specialist at the museum confessed to the theft, having sold the priceless artifact to a shop owner for less than $4,000. The bracelet was subsequently melted down by another gold workshop owner before authorities could recover it. Four suspects have been arrested in connection with the crime, which has sparked public outrage over the security breach and the tragic loss of a significant piece of cultural heritage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron defended his plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state, asserting it is a necessary step to combat Hamas and advance a peace plan. Responding to criticism from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called the move "reckless," Macron stated that Hamas's objective is the destruction of Israel, not the creation of a Palestinian state. He argued that recognizing statehood is a precondition for isolating the militant group and stopping the war. France's position places it at odds with the United States but aligns with other allies like the U.K. and Canada who are considering similar recognition.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Suggests Pessimistic Forecasts of China's Population Decline Warrant Skepticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article challenges the validity of drastic projections suggesting a severe decline in China's population by the end of the century. The author argues that such forecasts often lack clear justification, especially when contrasted with projections of population growth in countries like the United States. The piece points to alternative data from Chinese researchers at Renmin and Peking Universities, which present a more moderate scenario with China's population potentially reaching around 1.12 billion. It suggests that geopolitical trends and declining fertility rates are complex factors that may not lead to the gloomy outcomes some predict.</p>

          <p>Yevgeny Savin, a former Russian professional footballer and popular YouTuber, has successfully guided his football club, Krasava ENY Ypsonas, to Cyprus's top division. After condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Savin fled his home country, where he was later sentenced in absentia for "discrediting" the army. He re-established his club in Cyprus, investing his own money and creating a team that unites immigrants from various post-Soviet nations, including Russians and Ukrainians.

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated what it calls a "historic" reform of the U.S. organ procurement system to improve accountability and patient safety. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the first-ever mid-cycle decertification of an organ procurement organization (OPO), targeting the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency in Miami for a history of deficiencies linked to patient harm. Officials highlighted that thousands of donated organs are discarded annually and over 100,000 people are on waiting lists. The reforms include a new direct reporting channel for misconduct and a $25 million investment to support living donors.</p>

Despite the Democratic party's own challenges, polls show Trump's approval ratings are underwater with these key groups.

          <p>A joint operation by the IDF and Shin Bet in Ramallah resulted in the arrest of three members of a terrorist cell operating a weapons manufacturing workshop. Inside, security forces discovered dozens of rockets, including two that were ready to be launched, along with explosives and other materials. The cell is suspected of attempting a rocket launch from the West Bank into Israel last week. The operation is part of a broader crackdown in the region, with Israeli forces announcing they have arrested over 75 wanted individuals in the West Bank over the past week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts are advising consumers on when it might be beneficial to refinance existing debts like mortgages, auto loans, and student loans. While the cut may provide some relief, borrowing costs tend to fall slowly, and a series of cuts may be needed for a refinance to be worthwhile. Generally, a refinance makes sense if there is at least a one-percentage-point difference between the current rate and a new one. Experts also caution against refinancing too frequently due to closing costs and recommend focusing on the Annual Percentage Rate (APR). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A high-ranking official in Xinjiang has publicly acknowledged for the first time that U.S. sanctions have had a negative impact on the region's economy and employment. Chen Weijun, vice-chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, stated that some local enterprises are facing difficulties with exports, leading to reduced production and fewer job opportunities for workers of all ethnic groups, including Uygurs. While expressing confidence in the region's long-term development, this admission marks a rare official confirmation of the economic consequences of international sanctions imposed over human rights concerns.</p>

Critics are concerned that such interpretations could lead to people being erroneously labeled as gang members, with severe consequences like deportation.

          <p>This article critiques the AI doomsaying movement, particularly the arguments presented in Eliezer Yudkowsky's new book, "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies." The author contends that the fear of a world-ending superintelligence is based on flawed logic, shaky analogies, and a fundamental misunderstanding of both human and artificial intelligence. The piece argues that doomers and AI accelerationists are two sides of the same coin, both believing in the transformative power of a hypothetical superintelligence. Ultimately, these extreme narratives serve the interests of tech oligarchs by distracting from the real, immediate harms of current AI technology.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new, 19th package of sanctions against Russia in an effort to increase pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine. The details are forthcoming but are expected to target Russia's fossil fuel imports, banks, and cryptocurrency sector. This development comes as Russia launched nearly 90 strike drones at Ukraine overnight, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to call for more "decisive action" from allies. Meanwhile, EU finance ministers are discussing the use of frozen Russian assets to provide financial support for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that the military should be used to stop asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advocated for military intervention to tackle illegal migration. However, UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the country's military is focused on national defense, while the UK Border Force is responsible for policing borders. The comments were made as hundreds of migrants attempted the crossing and the UK government deported a second person under its new "one in, one out" deal with France.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's push to rapidly expand its third-party online marketplace involved loosening its seller vetting processes, leading to significant problems with counterfeit goods and fraud. Shoppers have received fake products, including potentially dangerous health supplements, from sellers who used the stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create their accounts. Current and former employees stated that the company prioritized growth over stringent oversight, creating a "Wild West" environment in contrast to Amazon's stricter policies. In response to the findings, Walmart has recently tightened vetting for some health and beauty product sellers.</p>

          <p>The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show by ABC has intensified a national debate on free speech following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, with President Trump suggesting broadcasters who criticize him could lose their licenses. In health news, a CDC advisory committee has voted to change its recommendation for the MMRV combination vaccine for young children, advising separate shots for measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox instead. Additionally, President Trump has announced his intention to designate antifa as a major terrorist organization, a move that raises First Amendment concerns as antifa is not a centralized foreign entity.</p>

          <p>Neo-fascist fight clubs, known as "active clubs," are capitalizing on the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk to recruit new members. These groups, which are a growing domestic terrorism concern, are using Kirk's death as a rallying cry, framing it as evidence of an "anti-White" campaign by the left. Online posts urge white men to join their movement for vengeance and camaraderie. Despite ideological differences with Kirk, these extremist groups see his murder as an opportunity to spread their radical message to a more receptive mainstream audience, as seen in a recent commemorative march in Huntington Beach, California.</p>

The hearing highlighted the growing use of AI for social interaction among teens and the potential for psychological harm.
