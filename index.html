          <p>Reddit announced first-quarter revenue that surpassed Wall Street's forecasts and provided better-than-expected guidance, causing the stock to initially surge in after-hours trading. Revenue increased by 61% compared to the previous year, and the company reported a net income of $26.2 million, a significant turnaround from the net loss recorded a year prior due to IPO-related costs. Reddit's CEO, Steve Huffman, acknowledged the uncertain macroeconomic environment but emphasized the company's ability to thrive through challenging times, highlighting the importance of connection and information. The article also notes that Reddit has benefited from Google search changes and site improvements, leading to a substantial increase in daily active users.</p>

          <p>Apple reported second fiscal-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates, although the Services division fell slightly short of expectations, leading to a drop in share value. CEO Tim Cook mentioned the limited impact of tariffs on the March quarter due to supply chain optimization, but cautioned about predicting beyond June due to tariff uncertainties. Apple anticipates tariffs to increase costs by $900 million for the current quarter, assuming no major changes occur. Cook also noted that Apple is already sourcing a significant portion of iPhones from India and other products from Vietnam to mitigate tariff impacts.</p>

While Amazon beat earnings expectations, its operating income forecast for the current period was lower than anticipated, with the company citing tariff and trade policies as potential factors. CFO Brian Olsavsky acknowledged the ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs, which prompted a wider guidance range.</p>

Trump thanked Waltz for his service and appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as his temporary replacement.

          <p>Bill Belichick's CBS interview promoting his new book took an unexpected turn when his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, interrupted a question about how they met, sparking debate about her involvement in his professional life. Hudson's interruption was unexpected given Belichick's history of controlling interviews, raising questions about whether the question touched a nerve or if he now requires assistance in managing media interactions. Belichick later issued a statement suggesting the interview was selectively edited and focused on unrelated topics, while CBS maintained the agreement was for a wide-ranging conversation with no preconditions.</p>

          <p>Michael Kulikoff, the mayor pro tem of California City, is facing federal charges for allegedly arranging to have an SUV contaminated with mercury moved without proper precautions. The charges stem from a mercury exposure incident at a car wash Kulikoff owned, where an individual spilled mercury inside an SUV. The indictment alleges that Kulikoff conspired with another person to move the contaminated vehicle outside of the city to avoid cleanup and safety protocols, potentially endangering others. If convicted, Kulikoff faces significant prison time and fines.</p>

CEO Chris Kempczinski specifically cited "heightened anxiety" about the economy, largely driven by tariffs, as weighing on lower-income Americans. The 3.6% decline marks the biggest U.S. sales drop for the company since the COVID-19 pandemic.

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), plans to require placebo testing for all new vaccines, a move the administration calls a "radical departure" aimed at increasing transparency. However, experts argue that new vaccines already undergo placebo-controlled trials, and the new requirement could limit vaccine availability and raise ethical concerns. There is particular concern that updated COVID-19 shots may be included, which could slow down access to these vaccines. Kennedy's tenure has already coincided with a measles outbreak, and his past statements on vaccine safety have been widely criticized.</p>

          <p>New York lawmakers are considering a measure that would significantly weaken state oversight of religious schools, potentially benefiting the Hasidic Jewish community. The proposal, under discussion as part of the state budget deal, has raised concerns among education experts, including the state education commissioner, who fears it would compromise the future of children attending schools that do not offer a basic secular education. The potential changes would apply to all private schools but are primarily relevant to Hasidic schools, which largely conduct religious lessons in Yiddish and Hebrew. The move is seen as a result of lobbying by Hasidic leaders and their political representatives.</p>
