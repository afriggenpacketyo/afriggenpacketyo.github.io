          <p>Carla Hayden, former Librarian of Congress, speaks out about her unexpected dismissal by the Trump administration via email, stating she received no prior notification or explanation. Hayden believes her firing is part of a larger effort to diminish public access to information, as libraries serve as bastions of democracy. The White House press secretary claimed Hayden did not fit the needs of the American people, citing concerns over DEI initiatives and inappropriate books for children. Hayden refutes these claims, emphasizing the Library of Congress's primary function is to fulfill research requests from members of Congress, and that inclusion should not be viewed as a negative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to ongoing immigration protests and clashes between demonstrators and federal agents. The decision follows a series of immigration enforcement actions that have led to numerous arrests and escalating tensions. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to deploy U.S. Marines if the violence continues. The situation underscores the growing divide between the federal government and California over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Guard, a component of the U.S. Armed Forces Reserve, is commonly deployed for disaster relief and ensuring internal security. However, President Trump recently deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles to address protests against ICE immigration raids, overriding the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom. The National Guard has a wide range of duties, including providing disaster relief, ensuring internal security, and supporting military operations abroad. While typically commanded by the state governor, the U.S. president can assume command during nationwide deployments, a decision that has sparked controversy in this instance.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Americans have mixed views on the Trump administration's deportation program, with a slight majority supporting the program if it prioritizes deporting dangerous criminals. However, support decreases if the program is perceived to target non-criminals or deport more people than expected. The poll also reveals partisan divides, with Republicans showing strong support while independents are less supportive than before. Additionally, more Americans believe the program will weaken the economy, and there are concerns about legal residents being mistakenly deported.</p>

          <p>The article critiques America's fascination with narratives centered on powerful men and their rise to success, using examples like Adam Neumann of WeWork and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. It argues that this obsession with "boy geniuses" and "Great Men" has contributed to an unjust societal status quo, where wealth and power are concentrated in the hands of a few. The author contends that these romanticized stories often overshadow the negative consequences of these figures' actions, perpetuating a cycle of admiration for brute power and self-serving ambition, and that this ideology endangers human lives and the future of civilization.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has presented the country's "four core principles" as a framework for resolving disputes in the South China Sea. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing external interference. China's expansive claims over the resource-rich waters are contested by several Asean member states, and face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels have become more frequent in recent years. The report blames regional tensions on external actors who fuel rival claimants’ actions and weaken the “willingness for maritime cooperation”.</p>

However, the U.S. has shifted away from nation-building efforts, and China has emerged as a global power, leading to a reduced emphasis on the threat of "peaceful evolution."</p>

The advice emphasizes the importance of emotional security, addressing relationship insecurities, and ensuring that both partners feel respected and valued. Ultimately, the decision to pursue ethical non-monogamy should be based on genuine interest and readiness, not coercion or self-sacrifice.</p>

          <p>An economist from Allianz Trade predicts a potentially upward inflation trajectory under President Trump's second term, citing policies like tariffs and tax cuts. The report suggests that demand-boosting policies or supply-hurting policies could re-ignite inflation faster and push up interest rates. Trump's protectionist policies, such as tariff increases on imports and Chinese goods, could further exacerbate inflation, depending on the extent of implementation. The economist emphasizes the need for careful economic planning to avoid overheating the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The book also contains score-settling with establishment figures like George H.W. Bush and Mitt Romney. Gingrich claims Trump sided with the legacies of Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and himself, while also reminiscing about bipartisan reforms with Bill Clinton before the Monica Lewinsky scandal.</p>

          <p>The public feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk over Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" reveals a deeper problem with the American political system. While both billionaires criticize the bill, their opposition stems from self-interest rather than concern for the middle class and poor. The bill would cut food assistance and healthcare while offering tax cuts to the wealthiest, highlighting the ability of a few wealthy individuals to manipulate the system for their own benefit. Despite their differences, both Trump and Musk agree on taking from those who have little and giving to those who have much.</p>
