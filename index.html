          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced gains, mirroring Wall Street's performance, driven by increasing anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Investors are also analyzing China's August inflation data, which revealed a 0.4% year-over-year drop in consumer prices, slightly below expectations. Shares of Asian tech firms linked to Apple's supply chain saw increases following the launch of new iPhones, watches, and AirPods. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices rose, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also showed positive movement, indicating a broad positive trend across the region. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong reached its highest level since late 2021, fueled by gains in tech stocks. The optimism score is 80.</p>

The Times reports that Israel views Hamas leaders in Doha as an ongoing target, while The Guardian quotes criticism of the strikes as an attack on diplomacy. Other outlets detail Lord Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, revealing Epstein brokered a deal after his conviction.

          <p>A judge has blocked President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, pending the outcome of a lawsuit challenging her removal. The judge stated that the public interest in Federal Reserve independence favors Cook's reinstatement, noting that her removal appeared to violate the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision. The judge's decision referenced allegations of mortgage fraud cited by Trump as the reason for Cook's firing, which Cook denies. This ruling ensures Cook will participate in the Fed's upcoming meeting, as the case proceeds towards a potential Supreme Court decision. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly called on the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India in an effort to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. This proposal emerged during a meeting between US and EU officials discussing ways to increase economic pressure on Russia. Trump also mentioned ongoing trade negotiations with India, expressing optimism for a successful resolution, while China and India remain major buyers of Russian oil, supporting the Russian economy. The potential EU tariffs could signify a shift from sanctions to trade levies in isolating Russia. The optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>A new UNICEF report reveals that obesity has surpassed undernourishment as the leading form of malnutrition among school-aged children worldwide. Since 2000, obesity rates have nearly tripled, affecting approximately 391 million children aged 5 to 19. The report attributes this rise to unhealthy food environments dominated by ultra-processed foods high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. UNICEF urges improved food labeling, marketing restrictions, and social protection programs to address income poverty and promote access to nutritious diets, emphasizing the impact of obesity on children's health and development.

The announcement followed a meeting between Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi. Grossi called the deal "a step in the right direction," emphasizing the importance of resuming inspections. Iran warned that any hostile act, including reimposing UN sanctions, would terminate the agreement. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>The White House has stated it would support a forensic analysis of the signature on a letter purportedly given by Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has denied giving Epstein the letter, which appears in a birthday book and includes a sketch of a woman's body. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that signature analysts have deemed the signature inauthentic. The White House maintains that Trump did not write or sign the letter, and his legal team is pursuing litigation against The Wall Street Journal. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests the Greater Bay Area (GBA) should host the 2036 Olympics, highlighting the region's existing sports facilities and robust transport network. Shenzhen, Macau, and Guangzhou already possess venues ready to host major events. Hong Kong's harbor could serve as a backdrop for temporary venues, eliminating the need for permanent facilities. The GBA's transport network meets the requirement of housing athletes within 45 minutes of their competition venue. The piece argues that the GBA is uniquely positioned to host the Olympics in a cost-effective manner. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs, setting up a major test of his economic agenda. The court will review lower court decisions that found Trump lacked the authority to issue many of his global tariffs under an emergency powers law. The Justice Department argued that upholding the lower court ruling would disadvantage the U.S. and expose it to retaliatory trade policies. Arguments in the tariffs case are scheduled for the first week of November. (not investment advice) The optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>Analysts expressed shock and excitement over Oracle's revenue projections, particularly for its cloud infrastructure business, leading to a significant after-hours rally in the company's stock. Oracle forecasts a 77% jump in cloud infrastructure revenue this fiscal year, reaching $18 billion, with further growth to $73 billion and $144 billion in subsequent years. The company signed multibillion-dollar contracts, including one with OpenAI, contributing to a surge in remaining performance obligations to $455 billion.
