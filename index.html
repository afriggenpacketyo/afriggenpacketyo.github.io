          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has provided the clearest image yet of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will pass closest to the sun in late October. Observations have refined the size of its icy core to no more than 3.5 miles in diameter, revealing a teardrop-shaped dust plume. The object is notably dark and reddish, similar to previous interstellar visitors, and is expected to be observable again in December after passing the sun.</p>

          <p>A critique of Mark Zuckerberg's stated goal for AI, which is to create a "personal superintelligence" for everyone, primarily through devices like smart glasses. The article argues this vision is disappointingly mundane, likening it to "selling sugar water" compared to the world-changing potential of superintelligence. Despite Meta's massive spending and aggressive hiring in the AI sector, the focus appears to be on enhancing ad targeting and user engagement on platforms like Instagram, rather than tackling more profound societal challenges. This perceived lack of a compelling, optimistic vision may hinder Meta's ability to attract and retain top talent.</p>

The crew was actually attempting to row from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. After the mistake was clarified, Mr. Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowers, one of whom is a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious."</p>

          <p>The takeover battle for Assura, a major landlord for NHS properties, has escalated as the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigates a £1.79 billion deal with Primary Health Properties (PHP).

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new "Standard Repayment Plan" for federal student loans, part of a bill signed by President Trump, is raising concerns among experts. The plan adjusts repayment terms based on loan balance, extending them up to 25 years for those with over $100,000 in debt. While this may lower monthly payments for some, analyses show it could significantly increase the total amount paid over the life of the loan due to prolonged interest accumulation. Critics warn this "cliff effect" will keep borrowers in debt longer, potentially impacting their ability to save for retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis examines President Trump's attempts to distance himself from the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, particularly his recent claim that he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago for poaching an employee, Virginia Giuffre. The article argues this story is contradicted by the timeline of their relationship, which reportedly continued for years after the alleged incident. It details their long association, mutual interests in modeling agencies, and connections to figures like Jean-Luc Brunel. The piece concludes that Trump's shifting narrative has failed to quell scrutiny, especially as his administration keeps Ghislaine Maxwell's recent deposition secret.</p>

Friedman presents President Trump's diplomatic model as a coherent, if abrasive, attempt to deconstruct an obsolete post-WWII global system. He predicts that while Russia's invasion of Ukraine will ultimately fail, the U.S. is in a normal, cyclical crisis that will eventually lead to calm and reinvention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores a macabre quirk in federal budgeting dubbed the "Grim Reaper effect," where policies that increase longevity can negatively impact the budget. Because the U.S. runs a deficit and provides generous benefits to seniors, people living longer collect more Social Security and Medicare, potentially offsetting savings from public health initiatives like smoking cessation or hepatitis C treatment. This creates a disincentive for life-saving policies if viewed purely through a fiscal lens. The author argues for embracing such policies for their inherent good and suggests better budgetary scoring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At California's Mono Lake, guided tours highlight the stark environmental consequences of water diversions to Los Angeles, which began in the 1940s. The lake has shrunk dramatically, losing half its volume and doubling in salinity, which threatens the unique ecosystem of brine shrimp and alkali flies that support millions of migratory birds. While a 1994 state order required L.A. to reduce water diversions to help raise the lake level, it remains significantly below the target. Guides and environmental groups are now looking toward an upcoming state hearing to implement stronger protections for the ancient saline lake.</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old man, Jeffery Ying, has been federally charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, some over 600 years old, from a UCLA library. According to the Justice Department, Ying used aliases to access the works, valued at $216,000, and then returned convincing forgeries in their place. An investigation began after the library noticed several manuscripts were missing, and a raid on Ying's hotel room uncovered materials for creating "dummy" books. If convicted of theft of a major artwork, he faces a potential 10-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old Iranian man has been arrested in Birmingham on suspicion of conspiring to facilitate illegal immigration across the English Channel. The arrest by the National Crime Agency (NCA) followed a months-long undercover investigation by the BBC, which exposed the operations of a violent smuggling gang. An undercover reporter met a man in Birmingham who appeared to be taking money on behalf of the gang. The NCA stated that their investigation is ongoing and that people smugglers operate for profit without regard for human safety.</p>

European universities, facing underfunding, see international student fees as a key income source but remain underrepresented in the region. To compete with East Asian institutions, which are growing in popularity, European countries are beginning to adjust policies like language requirements and visa procedures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The share price for Crocs plummeted after the company revealed a 6.5% drop in North American sales, attributing the decline to a consumer shift towards athletic trainers. CEO Andrew Rees noted a "clear athletic trend" ahead of major sporting events like the World Cup and Olympics. He also warned that lower-income consumers are being "super cautious" due to the high cost of living and potential impacts from tariffs, leading to reduced store traffic. In contrast, the company is seeing strong growth in China, driven by targeted marketing campaigns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel’s security cabinet has approved a plan for a significant military escalation aimed at taking full control of Gaza City, a move that signals a new phase in the ongoing conflict. The plan's stated objectives include disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, and establishing an alternative civil administration. The decision has drawn widespread international condemnation, including from the UK and the UN, over fears of a deepening humanitarian catastrophe and massive forced displacement. It also faces opposition within Israel, particularly from hostage families who fear for the safety of their loved ones.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reported a dramatic increase in "imposter" scams targeting older Americans, with losses reaching $700 million in 2024, a fivefold increase since 2020. In these scams, criminals pose as trustworthy figures from banks, tech companies, or government agencies to trick victims into transferring money from their retirement and savings accounts. The number of older adults reporting losses of at least $10,000 has surged by 362% since 2020. The FBI notes that actual losses are likely much higher, as many incidents of elder fraud go unreported.

          <p>A growing number of U.S. states, including Virginia, Arkansas, and Utah, are enacting laws to protect "kidfluencers" from financial exploitation and privacy violations. In the absence of federal regulations, these state-level measures often mirror "Coogan Laws" for child actors, requiring parents to set aside a portion of the child's earnings in a trust. Some new laws go further, granting child influencers the right to have their content deleted upon reaching adulthood and addressing non-financial harms. The legislation aims to create safeguards in a burgeoning industry where children's lives are often monetized.</p>

          <p>The United States has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million, doubling the previous amount. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new reward, accusing Maduro of collaborating with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine. Maduro was indicted in the U.S. in 2020 on charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy. Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the increased reward as a "pathetic" and "crude political propaganda operation," accusing the U.S. of creating a distraction.</p>

The league now intends to launch its own, separate inclusion campaign during LGBTQ+ History Month in February. Stonewall acknowledged the "natural ebb and flow" of partnerships and noted the campaign's success in reaching diverse audiences through other sporting bodies.</p>
