          <p>Tensions flared between Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark and Atlanta Dream's Rhyne Howard during their recent game, leading to a brief scuffle and exchange of words.

The game was closely contested, with the Fever ultimately winning by a single point, ending on a 10-1 run. The incident follows a recent flagrant foul committed by Clark on Angel Reese, which prompted an investigation into alleged hateful comments directed at Reese by fans.</p>

Brown is accused of illegally collecting over $600,000 in workers’ compensation, including her full salary and medical expenses, while claiming physical limitations.

Xiang Zhang, a professor at the University of Cincinnati, testified against the bill, fearing he would have to sell his home solely because of his nationality.

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for the top investors in his personal cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, promising to promote the crypto industry from the White House. Protesters gathered outside, condemning the event as a corruption of the presidency, while attendees admitted their intent to influence U.S. financial regulations. The dinner, organized by Trump's business partners, was framed as a contest where top buyers of the memecoin would dine with Trump. Critics argue the event is a direct enrichment of the Trump family, as a corporate entity tied to them collects fees from the coin's transactions.</p>

          <p>International students at Harvard University are facing uncertainty after the Trump administration revoked the university’s permission to enroll them, citing concerns over violence and antisemitism. This decision has triggered fear and confusion among the 6,800 international students, who make up more than a quarter of Harvard's enrollment. Students are worried about their visas, their ability to complete their degrees, and their future employment prospects in the United States. The university is facing rapid-fire aggressions from the administration, including the freezing of over $2 billion in grants.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Move to Block Harvard's International Students Explained</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to block Harvard University from enrolling international students by leveraging the Department of Homeland Security's Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). By revoking Harvard's certification to access SEVIS, the government can effectively prevent the university from logging international students into the database, potentially rendering their visas invalid. The move is seen as an escalation in the administration’s efforts to pressure Harvard to align with its agenda. The university may challenge the SEVIS termination in court, arguing that it violates the law and infringes on its ability to recruit students globally.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the U.S., linked to a surge in China. Cases have been detected in international travelers at airports in California, Washington, Virginia, and the New York City area. Health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island, and Hawaii, have also reported cases. Preliminary data suggests the NB.1.8.1 variant has a greater ability to bind to human cells, potentially making it more transmissible, but is not better at evading the immune system.</p>

Headline inflation climbed 3.6% from a year ago, staying above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. The core inflation is expected to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>
