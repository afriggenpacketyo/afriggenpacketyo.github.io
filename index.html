          <p>A DeKalb County police officer was fatally shot during an incident near the CDC headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta. The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was also found deceased from what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The slain officer, David Rose, leaves behind a pregnant wife and two children. The event prompted a temporary lockdown and shelter-in-place order, and while no civilians were shot, four were hospitalized for stress-related reasons. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is leading the inquiry into the complex and tragic event.</p>

          <p>A shooting in New York City's Times Square left three people injured early Saturday morning. The incident reportedly began with a fight inside a restaurant that spilled onto the street, where a gunman opened fire. The victims, two teenagers and a 65-year-old man, were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Police have taken a 17-year-old suspect into custody and recovered a firearm from the scene.

          <p>Metropolitan Police arrested more than 150 demonstrators in London for expressing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw many participants display signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action." The government banned the group in July, making any show of support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Police had warned they would enforce the ban, and officers moved through the crowd making arrests as the demonstration continued.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only individual to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Appointed to the FBI by President Carter in 1978, he was credited with restoring the agency's reputation after a period of scandal. President Reagan later chose him to lead the CIA in 1987 to bring stability following the Iran-Contra affair. Known for his integrity and non-partisan approach, Webster was a respected public servant who guided the nation's top law enforcement and intelligence agencies through turbulent times.</p>

          <p>Scammers are increasingly targeting older Americans by purchasing their personal data from unregulated data brokers to create highly personalized and convincing retirement scams. These fraudulent communications, often disguised as "pre-approved" 401(k) rollovers or annuity upgrades, use specific details like age, net worth, and homeownership to appear legitimate. The goal is to trick individuals into transferring funds or revealing sensitive financial information. This article outlines the warning signs of such scams, including pressure tactics and unsolicited offers, and provides steps for protection, such as using data removal services and verifying all financial communications directly.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin briefed Chinese President Xi Jinping on his communications with the Trump administration regarding a planned summit. According to a Chinese official statement, Xi endorsed the dialogue between the U.S. and Russia, expressing hope for progress in resolving the Ukraine crisis. However, sources cited in the article remain cautious, suggesting that while the meeting could result in a temporary détente, it is unlikely to produce a lasting peace agreement or significantly alter the strategic balance. The call highlights the ongoing coordination between Moscow and Beijing on major geopolitical developments.</p>

The plan has drawn widespread condemnation from humanitarian agencies and world leaders, who fear it will cause immense suffering.

While BNPL can offer interest-free payment options, experts caution that some plans have hidden fees and may not offer the same consumer protections as credit cards if an event is canceled.

While the idea is currently speculative and faces the major hurdle of commercial fusion not yet being a reality, it represents an innovative approach to making the technology economically viable.

          <p>Twenty years after California passed a landmark law to protect outdoor workers from heat, farmworkers are still dying from preventable heat-related illnesses. Advocates and lawmakers attribute the ongoing tragedies to a lack of enforcement by the state's occupational safety agency, Cal/OSHA. A recent state audit and news investigations found that the agency is understaffed and often fails to take proper action or issue penalties even in fatal cases. With climate change bringing more intense heat waves, vulnerable and often undocumented farmworkers face increasing risks in the fields.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a former CIA officer instrumental in unmasking notorious Soviet mole Aldrich Ames, has died at 79. In 1991, Grimes agreed to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were disappearing, leading to the discovery that they were being executed. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs was crucial in identifying Ames, the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, as the spy. Ames was arrested in 1994, and Grimes's work is remembered as a pivotal contribution to U.S. national security during the Cold War.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is pushing satellite company Viasat to separate its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) business. In a letter to the board, Carronade argues that Viasat is "materially misunderstood" and undervalued by the market, which wrongly views it as a dying legacy satellite company threatened by competitors like Starlink. The firm contends that the fast-growing and high-margin DAT business is a "hidden gem" and that spinning it off could unlock significant shareholder value, potentially increasing the company's valuation by 76% to 304% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the economic policies of the Trump administration effectively amount to a "degrowth" strategy that will make Americans worse off. The author contends that actions like prosecuting a global trade war, imposing high tariffs, and cutting subsidies for energy and education are raising prices, suppressing consumption, and weakening the economy. While degrowth is typically associated with left-wing environmentalism, the article asserts that the administration's policies are leading to a smaller economy and a lower standard of living, contrary to its promises of prosperity.</p>

          <p>Tesla is discontinuing its ambitious in-house AI supercomputer project, known as Dojo, which was designed to train the software for its driver-assistance systems. The head of the project is leaving, and the team has lost numerous employees to a competitor, reflecting intense competition for AI talent. CEO Elon Musk stated it no longer makes sense to divide resources between two different AI chip designs. The company will now increase its reliance on external partners like Nvidia for AI hardware, a significant pivot for a project once hyped as a key to its technological dominance.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's newly launched GPT-5 model is drawing a mixed reaction from experts in China, a key market in the global AI race. While OpenAI promoted its latest model as its smartest and fastest yet, some Chinese analysts described it as an incremental improvement rather than a revolutionary breakthrough. The new model features a built-in "thinking" function and improved performance in areas like coding and math. The lukewarm reception highlights the heightened expectations and intense competition within the AI industry, where Chinese companies are also rapidly developing their own advanced models.</p>

          <p>A controversial makeshift immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is facing lawsuits and condemnation over reports of inhumane conditions. Family members of detainees describe vermin infestations, extreme heat from power outages, and insufficient water. The facility, run by the state of Florida to house what officials call "the worst scumbags," is holding many immigrants with no criminal convictions. While the Trump administration denies the allegations and praises the facility, advocates and health professionals warn it is a human rights disaster waiting to happen.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, a popular summer astronomical event, is expected to be less spectacular this year. According to NASA, the shower's peak on the night of August 12-13 will coincide with a full moon, whose bright light will likely wash out the view of most meteors. While a few bright fireballs might still be visible in the predawn hours, viewing conditions are not ideal. The Perseids meteors originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet and are best observed in the Northern Hemisphere away from city lights.</p>
