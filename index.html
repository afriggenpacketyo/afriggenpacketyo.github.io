          <p>Columbia University has reached a deal with the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions in federal research funding that was frozen over allegations of on-campus antisemitism. The university will pay the administration over $221 million and make concessions regarding its diversity programs and international student admissions. This settlement follows a period of intense pressure on the university, which included the high-profile arrest of a student activist. The agreement is part of a broader trend of the administration targeting higher education institutions, with similar actions taken against Harvard, Princeton, and others, raising concerns about institutional independence.</p>

          <p>A vehicle dramatically exploded in a parking lot in Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., with the event captured on camera. The Arlington Fire & EMS department confirmed the incident was a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) originating from the car's fuel tank. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished by firefighters and caused damage to at least three other nearby vehicles. Fortunately, no injuries were reported among the public or emergency responders. Officials have deemed the incident non-suspicious and are currently investigating the precise cause of the malfunction that led to the explosion.</p>

          <p>Kristin Cabot, the chief people officer at tech company Astronomer, has resigned following a viral video incident at a Coldplay concert. The clip, which circulated widely on social media, appeared to show her and then-CEO Andy Byron in an intimate embrace on the venue's large screen before they quickly hid from the camera. Byron resigned last week after the company placed him on leave and announced an investigation into the matter. The incident brought unexpected and intense media attention to the data and AI startup, which has now appointed an interim CEO to navigate the aftermath.</p>

The new drinks, including cold brews and fruity refreshers, are inspired by the company's recently closed spinoff chain, CosMc's. This move represents a strategic shift to integrate the popular beverage concepts from the standalone stores directly into the main McDonald's menu. The initiative is part of a broader effort to boost sales and appeal to Gen Z customers, following a recent drop in same-store sales for the fast-food giant.</p>

He bases his optimism on historical trends where the president's party often loses seats, demographic shifts favoring Republicans, and the number of Democratic-held districts that President Trump won in 2024. Johnson also defended the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," arguing that its tax cuts and other provisions will act as "jet fuel" for the economy, despite current public disapproval. He believes voters will feel the law's benefits and reward the GOP accordingly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at addressing the national homelessness crisis by encouraging local governments to clear street encampments and enforce public order. The directive seeks to reverse legal precedents that limit cities' ability to compel individuals into mental health or addiction treatment, redirecting funds toward rehabilitation programs. This move comes as homelessness reaches record highs, driven by a housing shortage. Critics, including the National Homelessness Law Center, argue the punitive approach will worsen the crisis and infringe on basic rights, while supporters believe it will make cities safer and provide necessary help.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi strongly criticized the judges' intervention, and the Justice Department has backed Habba.

The players had been accused of assaulting the woman after a Hockey Canada gala. The defense argued the encounter was consensual, while the prosecution contended the woman was intoxicated and fearful.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has reiterated that Nvidia remains the premier company for investing in the artificial intelligence boom, which he terms the "Fourth Industrial Revolution." Ives projects that spending on AI by businesses and governments will reach $2 trillion over the next three years, with Nvidia poised to capture a significant portion due to its dominance in the AI chip market. The recent U.S. policy change allowing Nvidia to resume selling its H20 chips to China is seen as a key strategic positive. The analyst suggests that for every dollar invested in Nvidia, a ripple effect generates $8 to $10 in the broader IT ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that investors own 19% of all homes in California, highlighting the state's deepening housing affordability crisis. While the rate is just below the national average, it underscores the challenges for individual homebuyers in a state with soaring prices and a severe housing shortage. The data shows that smaller investors, owning between one and ten properties, account for the vast majority of this trend. While some argue investors provide necessary market liquidity, policy experts express concern that this activity puts upward pressure on prices, making it even harder for families to purchase homes.

          <p>A discussion on CNN's "NewsNight with Abby Phillip" grew heated when conservative commentator Scott Jennings insulted fellow panelist Keith Boykin. During a segment about Columbia University's settlement with the Trump administration, Boykin called out Jennings for repeatedly interrupting, to which Jennings responded by calling him a "whiny [inaudible]." The exchange escalated as Boykin challenged Jennings to repeat the insult, leading to a tense on-air moment. The incident drew criticism on social media and was analyzed by a therapist who described the name-calling as a dismissive tactic intended to undermine the other person's position and disrupt civil discourse.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is undergoing a major reorganization that will force thousands of employees to relocate from the Washington D.C. area and accept salary cuts. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins stated the move aims to reduce the department's financial footprint and move resources closer to farmers. However, critics and experts warn that the restructuring will weaken support for farmers, complicate wildfire response by affecting the U.S. Forest Service, and result in a mass loss of experienced staff. The plan is part of a broader, chaotic effort by the Trump administration to dismantle federal agencies and cut staff.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has made a direct appeal to resident doctors to halt their planned five-day strike over pay, warning it would cause "huge loss for the NHS and the country." The strike is set to begin Friday after negotiations between the government and the British Medical Association (BMA) broke down. The BMA states the action is necessary because doctors' real-term wages have been eroded by about 20% since 2008, despite recent pay rises. While the government says it cannot afford to go further on pay, it remains open to negotiating on working conditions and career progression.</p>

          <p>California's state water board has released a controversial water plan for the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta that gives water agencies more flexibility in meeting quality standards. Backed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the plan offers an alternative path where agencies can negotiate "voluntary agreements" to provide funding for habitat restoration in lieu of adhering to stricter river flow requirements. While the administration touts this as a collaborative solution, environmental and fishing groups have condemned it as a backroom deal. They argue it will harm the fragile ecosystem and endangered fish species by allowing excessive water diversions from the Delta.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order designed to make it easier for cities and states to clear homeless encampments and place individuals into treatment, including through involuntary civil commitment. The order shifts federal priorities away from "Housing First" policies, instead favoring programs that require sobriety and cities that enforce camping bans. This reflects a conservative backlash against previous approaches as homelessness reaches record levels. Critics argue the order criminalizes homelessness and mental illness, while supporters like the Cicero Institute contend it provides a crucial safety net for those dying on the streets.</p>
