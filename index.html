          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles following federal immigration sweeps, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom as inflammatory and a breach of state sovereignty. Demonstrators blocked highways and confronted federal agents, resulting in arrests and the use of tear gas and flash-bang grenades. Local officials have urged peaceful demonstrations, while the Department of Homeland Security defended the ICE operations as targeting individuals with criminal histories. </p>

          <p>During the Emergency in the mid-1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government considered reimagining India as a centralized state governed by command and control. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, top bureaucrats and party loyalists pushed for a presidential system to centralize executive power and sideline the judiciary. The ideas never fully materialized, but the Forty-second Amendment Act in 1976 expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. This period reflects a clear ambition to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy.</p>
