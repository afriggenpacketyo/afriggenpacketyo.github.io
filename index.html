          <p>President Trump and California Governor Newsom are in conflict over protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles, with Trump deploying the National Guard and Newsom suing the administration. Trump criticized Newsom's handling of the situation, while Newsom accused the White House of exploiting the situation for political gain. The White House spokeswoman criticized Newsom's leadership. The conflict is tied to Newsom's current work as governor and puts him back in the national spotlight, standing up to Trump, amid speculation that he could run for president in 2028. The political tension and legal challenges add complexity to the situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees are increasingly considering home equity products to manage rising costs, with HELOCs and reverse mortgages being popular options. A HELOC functions as a revolving line of credit, suitable for temporary cash needs and one-time expenses, requiring repayment within a specific period. Conversely, a reverse mortgage is a longer-term solution, allowing retirees to borrow money without repayment until they sell the home or pass away, making it ideal for covering monthly bills. Experts advise carefully considering individual financial circumstances, the intended use of funds, and long-term financial goals before deciding between a HELOC and a reverse mortgage.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reported that more than 100 people were arrested during late-night protests in the city. The mayor stated that the majority of people attending the protests earlier in the day were peaceful, but the violence and vandalism occurred later and were assumed to be led by "fringe groups." Those arrested will be evaluated, including checks for active warrants, and the mayor emphasized that the arrests were separate from the earlier protests advocating for immigrant rights and an end to immigration raids.

Thunberg was among 12 passengers on the ship, which aimed to protest Israel's ongoing war and highlight the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israeli naval forces seized the boat about 125 miles off the coast, leading to condemnation from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and rights groups, who claimed it violated international law. Israel defended its actions, asserting the ship intended to breach its lawful naval blockade, while Amnesty International called for the immediate release of the activists.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way to save money and earn returns that outpace inflation, with FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000 providing a safe investment option. Current national average CD yields vary by term, with 1-year CDs at 2.00% APY, 3-year CDs at 1.70% APY, and 5-year CDs at 1.72% APY, though top CDs offer higher rates. Strategies for securing better CD rates include considering online banks, which typically offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and exploring short-term CDs, which currently have higher interest rates due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs, by purchasing CDs with varying terms, is a practical approach to take advantage of high short-term rates while also saving for the long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount Global is set to reduce its workforce by 3.5% due to economic challenges and shifts in the linear television business, as revealed in a memo from the company's three co-CEOs. This marks the latest in a series of layoffs for the media giant, which owns CBS, MTV, and Nickelodeon, as it prepares to merge with Skydance Media. The company is focusing on its streaming service, Paramount+, and anticipates the merger with Skydance will aid in revitalizing its business amidst declining traditional TV viewership. The cuts follow a previous reduction of 15% of the workforce last year, aimed at cost savings of $500 million and a return to profitability.</p>

          <p>Saving money is a wise strategy, especially with savings accounts offering interest to potentially boost balances, but the interest earned depends on current rates. The national average savings account interest rate is 0.42%, but high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher rates, between 4.10% and 4.40%. To secure a good savings account rate, it is recommended to choose a high-yield savings account, explore online banks, and compare different accounts, considering interest rates and potential fees. Maximizing savings through high-yield accounts can help individuals better prepare for financial emergencies and weather any financial storms.</p>

The post featured a photograph of a man with a rifle on a rooftop, which the photographer said was used out of context and without permission.

Siewe has captured over 600 pythons, each taking an average of 12 hours to catch, and processes the dead snakes for their skins.

          <p>China's film distributors have pledged to import more and better titles from overseas to diversify the country's cinematic offerings, as domestic productions have recently dominated the market. At a work conference held by the China Film Group Corporation and Huaxia Film Distribution, companies committed to improving the number, quality, and market share of foreign films. The goal is to leverage imported films to diversify and expand the market, as foreign films have faced a challenging situation this year with lagging box office returns.

          <p>Birthright citizenship, or jus solis, is a prevalent ideal in the Americas, with nearly every country in the Western Hemisphere granting citizenship to children born within its territory, irrespective of their parents' nationality. This contrasts with jus sanguinis, which assigns citizenship based on the national identity of parents. Mexico was the first to constitutionally embrace jus solis in 1814, aiming to include everyone regardless of skin color.

          <p>With homes increasingly at risk from floods due to climate change, home elevation is emerging as a key adaptation strategy, particularly in coastal areas like New Jersey. Superstorm Sandy highlighted the effectiveness of elevation, as lifted homes survived while others were devastated. While expensive, elevation can protect homes from flooding, allowing residents to remain in their communities, but it requires significant investment and community-wide infrastructure improvements. The challenge lies in making elevation affordable and accessible, especially for working-class families, and ensuring that it's part of a broader strategy for community resilience.</p>
