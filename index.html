            <p>Despite efforts to revitalize chip manufacturing in the US, the nation faces significant challenges in competing with Asia's established semiconductor industry. Trump's tariff policies and potential immigration restrictions could hinder the attraction of skilled labor and increase costs. While initiatives like the US Chips and Science Act aim to incentivize domestic production, companies like TSMC and Samsung face hurdles such as construction delays and labor shortages. Experts suggest that international collaboration and a more open immigration policy are crucial for the US to succeed in the long term.</p>

A rupture extending to the Whittier fault would amplify the energy directed into the basin, potentially causing widespread damage.

            <p>US ports are facing disruption and uncertainty as a result of President Trump's tariff policies, particularly those affecting trade with China. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which handle a significant portion of US containerized cargo, are experiencing operational challenges. Supply-chain analysts warn of potential trade slowdowns and job losses, highlighting the far-reaching consequences of the tariff policies on the maritime industry and related businesses.

            <p>President Trump signed a healthcare executive order directing the Health Department to work with Congress on revamping Medicare's drug price negotiation process, a move favored by pharmaceutical companies. The order seeks to align Medicare payments for drugs with hospital costs and standardize patient payment rates across locations. While the administration claims the changes will yield more savings, critics argue that the order benefits the pharmaceutical industry at the expense of consumers.</p>

While China is preparing for confrontation, it does not seek it, and will not yield to the US on issues of core interest. China seeks to not confront, but prepares for it.</p>
