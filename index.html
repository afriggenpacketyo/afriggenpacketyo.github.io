          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in London to continue trade talks, following a phone call between President Trump and President Xi. The U.S. delegation, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, aimed to address export controls on rare earth minerals. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed optimism for a swift resolution involving a "big, strong handshake" and the easing of U.S. export controls in exchange for China releasing rare earths in volume. China's Foreign Ministry asserted that the aircraft carrier's activities are consistent with international law and practices. Optimism surrounded the potential for a positive outcome, with expectations of eased export controls and increased rare earth mineral availability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Victims of the January 6th Capitol riot and Democratic lawmakers are criticizing the Trump administration's response to protests in Los Angeles, citing hypocrisy in its treatment of those involved compared to the Capitol attack. Officials like FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino issued strong statements against those accused of assaulting police in Los Angeles, contrasting with the defense of individuals who attacked police on January 6th. Critics point to Trump's pardons of Capitol riot defendants and his characterization of the January 6th events as a "day of love" as evidence of a double standard. The deployment of the National Guard to California, while delayed during the Capitol attack, further highlights the perceived hypocrisy, raising concerns about fairness and consistency in the application of justice.</p>

The FBI initially offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and is now executing a search warrant on his house. Bondi emphasized that federal authorities will pursue those who assault police officers or commit other crimes, invoking President Trump's stance against such actions.

          <p>A report by the Women and Equalities Committee in the UK has deemed the statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world," citing fundamental flaws and outdated gender stereotypes. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks, emphasizing the need for significant investment. Currently, statutory paternity leave allows new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving Â£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The committee's findings highlight the disparity between the UK's parental leave policies and those of other developed nations, sparking calls for reform.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of troops to suppress protests in Los Angeles has raised legal questions. This action follows Trump's history of musing about using the military to quell protests in blue-state cities.

          <p>The North Korean frigate that partially sunk during a launch ceremony attended by Kim Jong Un is now in a dry dock with visible damage. Satellite images reveal mangled metal and bent lines on the ship's superstructure. The vessel, the second of its class, was towed to Rajin for repairs after the incident. It is possible that North Koreans are getting help from China or Russia, something we had initially speculated. The location of the ship near the Russian border in an economic zone dominated by cross-border trade also points to the possibility that Moscow is lending a hand.</p>

The sludge may be contaminated with cancer-linked chemicals, microplastics, and other industrial pollutants.
