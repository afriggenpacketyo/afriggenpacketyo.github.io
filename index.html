          <p>Elon Musk announced that Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with intentions to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco thereafter. The service will initially begin with approximately 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with the upcoming FSD Unsupervised software. This rollout follows Musk's prior promises of fully self-driving cars, though Tesla currently lacks vehicles safe for unsupervised use. Musk emphasized a cautious approach, starting small to ensure safety and success before scaling up the operation significantly, marking a step towards autonomous transportation.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have issued strong condemnations of Israel's plans to escalate the war in Gaza and its blockade of humanitarian aid, describing the actions as "disproportionate" and "egregious." Britain suspended free-trade agreement talks with Israel, and the three nations jointly demanded an end to the renewed military offensive. The article highlights the growing international criticism of Israel's conduct in Gaza, particularly regarding the high Palestinian death toll and the dire humanitarian situation, with warnings from the U.N. about potential famine.

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily restored the right to vote in the Maine House of Representatives for Laurel Libby, a state lawmaker who was censured for a Facebook post identifying a transgender student athlete. Libby's post criticized the state's policy allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports, leading to her censure and suspension from voting. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, while Libby argued her constituents were being denied equal representation. The case raises questions about legislative immunity and the power of legislative bodies to discipline their members, as well as the Supreme Court's intervention in state matters.</p>

          <p>With market volatility and economic uncertainty impacting retirement savings, seniors should evaluate their long-term care insurance needs.

The article advises seniors to weigh the costs of insurance plans against out-of-pocket expenses, considering the potential future increase in care costs. Delaying long-term care insurance may not be cost-effective, making it crucial to research plans, prices, and companies to determine the best value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home electricity bills are expected to reach an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high due to rising electricity costs and high temperatures, according to a new analysis from NEADA. The increased expense follows a cold winter that already strained many Americans' budgets, with low-income households spending a disproportionately large share of their income on energy costs. The article warns that some families may be forced to forgo air conditioning, posing health risks, and calls for modernization of state and federal assistance programs to address the evolving climate. Adding insulation can also help households save money.</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials for wider use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials before the FDA approves future applications for all healthy persons between 6 months and 64 years old. The FDA's new leadership, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., criticized the U.S. for adopting a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework for past boosters.</p>
