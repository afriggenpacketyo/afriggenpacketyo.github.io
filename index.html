        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the recent ceasefire agreement in Kashmir, brokered with significant US involvement, experts express doubts about its long-term sustainability due to deep-seated distrust between India and Pakistan. The article highlights that while the ceasefire ended the worst military confrontation in 25 years, enduring peace requires addressing underlying issues like terrorism and water security. Analysts suggest the US leveraged IMF conditionalities to hasten the end of hostilities, with both sides using the escalation to test each other's resolve. While the ceasefire is expected to hold in the short term due to international pressure and the recognition of the costs of escalation, various challenges, including the Indus Waters Treaty and economic constraints, will keep relations strained, ultimately impacting the fragile peace in the region.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, requiring spouses and adult dependents of foreign workers to pass an English language test, while care homes will be restricted from recruiting staff from abroad. The article notes that the Labour Party is also emphasizing the need for immigrants to earn the right to stay, reflecting a broader effort to address public concerns and counter challenges from parties like Reform UK. The Conservatives criticize the proposals as insufficient, particularly regarding the absence of a cap on migration numbers. Additionally, the government plans to tighten legislation related to asylum claims under the European Convention on Human Rights, signaling a comprehensive approach to migration control.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its third system outage in less than two weeks, leading to significant flight delays and cancellations. The latest outage involved a momentary failure of a backup air traffic control system, prompting a 45-minute ground stop. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to temporarily cut the number of flights to address the airport's ongoing issues, which include air traffic control staffing shortages. Passengers express frustration as they face repeated disruptions, while officials assure travelers that flights remain safe, despite the recent problems. A new line that goes directly from Newark to the Philly TRACON, which controls the New York airspace, is being built.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" aimed at limiting federal payments to abortion providers is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans. The provision, which seeks to make large groups providing abortion services ineligible for federal Medicaid funds, is raising concerns among GOP lawmakers representing districts that Trump lost in 2024. Critics argue that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal dollars from funding abortion services and that the new measure could spark unnecessary conflict. Moderate Republicans have reportedly communicated their potential opposition to House GOP leaders, highlighting the risk of dissent within the party.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, an L.A.-based company, has voluntarily recalled several premade food items after federal regulators discovered a strain of listeria on its equipment. The recalled products, including sandwiches and protein snacks, were distributed in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington. The recall was prompted by a routine inspection that found the listeria strain matching one linked to an outbreak first identified in 2024. While no illnesses have been directly linked to the recalled food, the company is taking precautionary measures to ensure consumer safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order that would require the U.S. to pay the same price for some drugs as other nations, a policy he calls a "most favored nation's policy." The order aims to lower medication costs by tying what Medicare pays for drugs administered in a doctor's office to the lowest price paid by other countries. Trump claims this will lead to significant healthcare cost reductions, but the proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry and potential legal challenges.</p>
