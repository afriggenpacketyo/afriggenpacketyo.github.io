          <h2>Russia Unmoved by US Threats of Tariffs and New Weapons for Ukraine</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 06:56:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia has dismissed threats from the Trump administration regarding new tariffs and the supply of additional weapons to Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, a top Russian official, stated the Kremlin "didn't care" about what he termed a "theatrical ultimatum." This response came as President Trump announced a new multi-billion dollar arms package for Ukraine, including Patriot missile systems, and threatened 100% secondary tariffs on nations trading with Russia if a ceasefire isn't reached in 50 days. Ukrainian officials expressed cautious optimism, hoping this signals a "maximum pressure" campaign, but also concern that the deadline might encourage a Russian offensive escalation.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by stronger-than-anticipated performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank posted earnings of $5.24 per share on revenue of $45.68 billion. In the announcement, CEO Jamie Dimon noted the U.S. economy's resilience but also highlighted significant persistent risks, including tariffs, trade uncertainty, geopolitical conditions, and high fiscal deficits. The report precedes earnings announcements from other major banks like Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ocean exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki, which was sunk by U.S. torpedo boats during World War II. The vessel was found over 2,600 feet below the surface near the Solomon Islands, more than 80 years after its sinking in December 1942. The discovery, made by the Exploration Vessel Nautilus, is significant as there are no known historical images of the Teruzuki. The remotely operated vehicle found the ship's hull and stern separated, with its munitions, including sensitive depth charges, still intact, providing new insights into its final moments.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to encourage savers to move money from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares. Under the proposals, banks will be prompted to send customers details about investment opportunities, supported by a government advertising campaign. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is championing these "Leeds Reforms" to boost the UK economy and help savers achieve better returns, though this involves greater risk. The plans also include a review of risk warnings on investment products and making a low-deposit mortgage scheme for first-time buyers permanent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, according to official data, keeping it on track to meet the government's annual target of around 5%. This growth was slightly below the first quarter's 5.4% but was supported by state stimulus and a temporary pause in US-China trade war escalations. However, analysts warn this growth may not be sustainable due to persistent issues like weak consumer confidence, falling prices, and a deepening property crisis. The data comes amid ongoing trade tensions with the US, which could impact future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following England's driest start to the year since 1976, the Environment Agency has officially declared a drought in the East and West Midlands. This region joins the North West and Yorkshire, which are already under drought status, as a result of prolonged hot and dry conditions that have left rivers at extremely low levels. The declaration serves as a public signal that water companies may need to introduce restrictions, such as hosepipe bans, if they haven't already. While natural weather patterns are the primary driver, officials note that climate change is increasing the risk of future water shortages.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially launched in India, opening its first showroom in Mumbai and beginning sales of its Model Y SUV at a starting price of approximately $70,000. This price is significantly higher than in other markets, largely due to India's steep 70% tariff on EV imports and a 30% luxury tax. Analysts suggest this positions Tesla in the premium market against brands like BMW rather than mass-market EV competitors. Experts believe this initial move is more about "testing the waters" than generating large sales volumes, as Tesla has not yet committed to local manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2018, the total distance driven by cars in Germany has increased, according to data from the Federal Motor Transport Authority. In 2024, cars traveled a total of 594 billion kilometers, which is 3 billion more than the previous year. This increase in total mileage is attributed to a higher number of registered vehicles on the road. However, the average distance driven per individual car continued its decade-long decline, falling slightly to 12,309 kilometers. The vast majority of the distance was covered by vehicles with gasoline and diesel combustion engines.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing new guidance for relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) that will require schools in England to teach children how to recognize and act against misogyny. The updated curriculum will also focus on identifying positive male role models and proactively engaging parents about what is being taught. The guidance moves away from strict age limits for topics, instead outlining what should be covered by the end of primary and secondary school. Additions to the secondary curriculum include lessons on incel ideology, AI-generated sexual imagery, and sexual ethics beyond consent.</p>

          <p>A Biden-era plan to help fund a transition to a cleaner, hydrogen-powered blast furnace at a steel mill in Middletown, Ohio, has been put on hold by the Trump administration. The project, supported by a $500 million federal grant, would have eliminated one million tons of greenhouse gases annually and created over a thousand jobs. The company, Cleveland-Cliffs, cited the administration's freezing of clean energy grant programs and tax credits as the reason for halting the project. Local residents and environmental advocates expressed concern, as the move is a setback for both the local economy and public health.</p>

          <p>An Irish tech worker was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for approximately 100 days after overstaying his 90-day visa waiver by just three days due to a medical issue. The 35-year-old father of three, identified as Thomas, was arrested after a minor incident and, despite immediately agreeing to deportation, was held in three different facilities, including a federal prison. His ordeal highlights a broader crackdown under the Trump administration, where tourists and visitors with valid reasons for minor overstays are facing severe consequences.

Scans at Children's Minnesota hospital revealed the arrow had passed through the middle of his brain, an injury that doctors considered would normally be fatal.

          <p>The recently signed Republican tax-and-spending bill introduces significant changes that will affect charitable deductions and university endowments. The law raises the tax rate on endowments for universities with over $750,000 per student, potentially impacting about 15 top research schools. For charitable giving, the bill aims to encourage donations from average Americans but limits deductions for the wealthiest individuals by making the first 0.5% of their adjusted gross income non-deductible. Critics, including the Congressional Budget Office, estimate these and other provisions in the bill will add over $3 trillion to the national deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

The author presents data showing that undocumented immigrants use ERs at a lower rate than native-born citizens and that their children constitute a small percentage of the school population, whose funding is based on attendance. The column argues that Miller's narrative is a "fantasy" used to scapegoat immigrants for long-standing systemic problems and that his ideology is based on malevolent white privilege rather than facts.</p>

Voters expressed low levels of trust in Governor Gavin Newsom and the state legislature, as well as in the federal government. A significant and troubling finding is that nearly two-thirds of Californians feel that "American democracy is under attack," a concern that has escalated in the Trump era.
