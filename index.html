          <p>Shares of Sweden's Volvo Cars experienced their best-ever trading day, jumping by as much as 41% after the company reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profits. The automaker posted an operating income of 6.4 billion Swedish kronor, significantly exceeding analyst expectations, driven by a major cost-saving program. CEO Håkan Samuelsson expressed confidence in the company's performance and the upcoming launch of the electric EX60 model. However, Volvo Cars acknowledged that the short-term outlook remains challenging due to macroeconomic pressures and U.S. import tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has given Thames Water its lowest possible one-star rating for poor environmental performance in 2024, citing repeated sewage spills. This is part of a broader negative assessment of England's water companies, with eight out of nine "requiring improvement" or worse amid a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents. The industry's collective performance marks its worst since assessments began in 2011, attributed to weather, underinvestment, and increased monitoring. Thames Water stated that its transformation program will require at least a decade to complete.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed direct sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's two largest oil companies, in a significant move to pressure Moscow over the war in Ukraine. This action, targeting nearly half of Russia's crude-oil exports, is seen as both economically and symbolically important, marking a shift from President Trump's previous reluctance to sanction the energy sector. Analysts suggest that while the sanctions will hurt Russia's economy, they may not immediately alter the military situation without sustained pressure. The measures also create potential ripple effects for major buyers like China and India. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Biopic Explores Post-War Life and Ideology of Nazi War Criminal Josef Mengele</h2>

          <p>A new film, "The Disappearance of Josef Mengele," details the decades-long evasion of justice by the infamous Nazi physician known as the "Angel of Death." Directed by Kirill Serebrennikov, the movie portrays Mengele's life in exile across South America after escaping Germany post-World War II, where he was aided by a network of sympathizers. The film, starring August Diehl, aims to explore the nature of ideological extremism and the "banality of evil" by showing how a war criminal rationalizes his horrific actions. It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of dogma in an era of resurgent far-right ideology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has expanded its campaign against alleged drug trafficking by conducting its first-ever strikes on boats in the Pacific Ocean off South America, killing five people. These attacks follow at least seven similar strikes in the Caribbean that have raised tensions with Colombia and Venezuela. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth justified the action by equating drug cartels to terrorist organizations, a legal theory questioned by experts. The strikes, reportedly guided by CIA intelligence, have drawn condemnation from South American leaders and civil liberties groups over concerns they violate international law.</p>

The promotion follows an investigation into former vice-chairman He Weidong for "serious crimes," leading to his expulsion from the party and military, signaling a continued focus on discipline within the armed forces.</p>

          <p>The International Chess Federation (FIDE) is considering disciplinary action against former world champion Vladimir Kramnik following the death of American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky. For over a year, Kramnik had persistently accused Naroditsky, 29, of cheating in online chess without providing substantial evidence, allegations Naroditsky denied. Naroditsky's death has prompted calls from fellow grandmasters to address Kramnik's conduct, which they described as harassment. FIDE's president stated the organization will review Kramnik's public statements and take appropriate action against bullying, highlighting the growing toxicity in online chess.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced its 19th package of sanctions against Russia, for the first time targeting the country's lucrative gas sector. The new measures include a ban on imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and aim to weaken Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine by hitting its oil-dependent economy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, attending a summit in Brussels, called the sanctions "very important" for pressuring Russia to end the conflict.

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service has indicated that the date on a postmark may no longer definitively reflect the day mail was dropped off, creating potential issues for time-sensitive items like ballots and legal documents. This is due to a nationwide reorganization plan that reduces mail pickup frequency in areas far from new regional processing centers, meaning mail may not be processed until the following day. In response, officials in California are urging voters to mail their ballots well before Election Day. For a guaranteed same-day postmark, the USPS advises customers to request one in person at a post office counter.</p>

Republican Curtis Sliwa criticized both for their conduct, though the debate offered few new policy insights.

          <p>The ongoing civil trial concerning the 2019 overdose death of Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs places a spotlight on baseball's 136-year history with substance use. From the 19th-century "monkey elixir" to post-war amphetamines, cocaine in the 1980s, and the steroid era, players have consistently sought chemical aids to manage pain and prolong careers in a grueling sport. Skaggs's death from a fentanyl-laced pill illustrates a grim continuity, where the pressure to stay on the field drives players to substances that can have fatal consequences. The article argues this is not an aberration but a deep-rooted part of the game's culture of endurance.</p>

The team's disastrous start has been fueled by a relentless wave of injuries to key players, including quarterback Lamar Jackson and defensive lineman Nnamdi Madubuike, who is out for the season. While Jackson is expected to return, which would significantly boost their struggling offense, the defense remains a major concern with deep structural flaws.

The sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft are intended to pressure Russia to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a potential 2028 presidential contender, is scheduled to campaign in Virginia for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger. Shapiro's appearance is intended to bolster Spanberger's campaign in its final days against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Both Shapiro and Spanberger are considered moderate Democrats, and his support aims to highlight executive leadership at a time of voter fatigue with national politics. The visit comes as Spanberger navigates backlash from a controversy involving the Democratic nominee for Attorney General, making the race in the battleground state increasingly competitive.</p>

          <p>Four survivors have withdrawn from the UK's national inquiry into child sexual exploitation by grooming gangs, stating they will only rejoin if Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips resigns. The women cited concerns about the inquiry's direction and felt publicly dismissed by Phillips after she described their accounts as "misinformation." Their departure follows turmoil within the inquiry, including the withdrawal of two potential chairs. The survivors' letter to the home secretary claims the minister's response was a betrayal that destroyed their trust, while other panel members have expressed support for continuing with the inquiry.</p>

          <p>Despite a persistent and deepening slump in China's real estate sector, analysts believe Beijing is unlikely to introduce significant new support measures. Instead, policymakers are prioritizing technological development as a more urgent national goal, especially given the current geopolitical climate. While real estate investment continued to fall sharply in the third quarter, high-tech manufacturing has shown robust growth. This indicates a strategic shift in economic focus, with leaders appearing to accept the property market's drag on growth as they pivot toward building strength in advanced industries.

          <p>Manchester City defender Josko Gvardiol, who became the second-most expensive defender in history with his £77m transfer, has revealed he considered quitting football as a teenager. At age 16, while struggling for playing time in Dinamo Zagreb's youth system, Gvardiol contemplated pursuing basketball, a sport played by many of his friends. He ultimately persevered, breaking into Zagreb's senior team before successful stints at RB Leipzig and now Manchester City. The 23-year-old Croatian international has become a key player for manager Pep Guardiola, reflecting on his improbable journey to the top of professional football.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to multiple sources, France is backing away from a commitment to more aggressively intercept small boats carrying migrants across the English Channel. A promised new "maritime doctrine" to turn back vessels is now reportedly stalled, partly due to political turmoil within the French government. This development is a setback for the UK's strategy to stop the crossings, which continue on a near-daily basis. French maritime security sources and police unions cite the extreme danger of at-sea interventions and legal fears of being prosecuted for potential deaths as major obstacles to implementing a tougher approach.</p>

          <p>The long-standing alliance between the United States and Colombia is under severe strain due to escalating disputes between their leaders. President Trump recently suspended aid to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of encouraging drug production. This followed Petro's condemnation of U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, which he labeled as murder and a violation of sovereignty. For decades, the two nations cooperated closely on counter-narcotics efforts, but their opposing political ideologies and forceful styles have led to a breakdown in relations, potentially benefiting organized crime groups in the region.</p>

          <p>Europe's automotive industry is facing significant supply chain threats linked to China, compounding a year of falling profits. Chip supplier Nexperia has warned of potential disruptions due to a dispute between its Dutch base and its Chinese owners, while China's new export controls on rare-earth minerals threaten the supply of materials essential for electric motors. These issues highlight the continent's heavy reliance on foreign suppliers for critical EV components like chips, magnets, and batteries. The situation poses a major risk to Europe's industrial base, particularly in Germany, where the auto sector is a cornerstone of the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new U.S. sanctions targeting Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil are expected to disrupt energy supplies to their largest customers, China and India. While the measures provide a one-month wind-down period to avoid an immediate market shock, they will force Asian refiners to find new ways to transport and pay for Russian crude or seek alternative suppliers. The sanctions represent a significant escalation from the previous G7 price cap, effectively creating a blanket ban on dealing with the two companies. This will likely increase demand for oil from OPEC and the U.S., potentially leading to higher global prices. (not investment advice)</p>
