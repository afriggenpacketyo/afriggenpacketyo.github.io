          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, granted President Trump's request to remove the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, affirming the president's executive power over these agencies. The court's conservative majority stated that the president has the authority to remove executive officers who exercise power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, arguing that the decision favored the president over established precedent. The ruling also addressed concerns about the Federal Reserve, clarifying that the case does not implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent tour to the Middle East, including stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, has led to significant policy announcements, potentially altering US relations in the region. Trump declared the lifting of all US sanctions on Syria, a decision that reportedly surprised senior American officials. In Doha, Trump claimed the United States was close to securing a deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons program, indicating a willingness from Tehran to give up its stockpile of enriched uranium if certain conditions are met. This tour has triggered controversy, including discussions over Qatar's offer to provide Trump with a luxury plane.</p>

Harvard called the action unlawful and said it is committed to maintaining its ability to host international students and scholars.

This is 50 cents lower than the previous year, with some states like Mississippi seeing prices as low as $2.64 per gallon. Factors contributing to the lower prices include uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies and increased oil production by OPEC+ countries.

          <p>New research indicates that blood and urine tests can now detect the amount of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) a person consumes. Using machine learning, scientists at the National Institutes of Health identified hundreds of metabolites that correlate with processed food intake and developed a "biomarker score" to predict UPF intake. A clinical trial involving 20 adults confirmed these findings, showing distinct metabolite changes during periods of high and zero UPF consumption. Researchers hope this method will help reduce errors in large-scale studies investigating the health risks of ultraprocessed foods.</p>

The event is a reward for winners of Trump's meme coin competition, where the 220 crypto wallets with the largest holdings of $Trump tokens were invited to a private dinner. However, an analysis reveals that 43% of the winners have experienced a net loss, totaling $8.95 million, since the coin's launch. Experts have raised ethical concerns about pay-to-play policymaking, given that some attendees are individuals with strategic policy incentives.</p>

          <p>In his New York Times opinion piece, David Brooks critiques the populist narrative that blames globalization and neoliberalism for the economic struggles of American workers. Brooks contends that this narrative is historically inaccurate, arguing that wages stagnated primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, not during the era of neoliberal globalism. He also notes that median wages have grown since NAFTA and the WTO, and that the decline in manufacturing jobs is largely due to increased productivity, not solely foreign competition. Brooks suggests that the crucial divide in American politics is defined more by educational attainment and cultural values than income levels.</p>

The study, which compared GLP-1 users to those on DDP-4 inhibitors, found a 7% lower risk of developing obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause. The study also noted that women treated with GLP-1s had an 8% lower risk of obesity-related cancer and a 20% lower risk of all causes of death compared to those treated with DDP-4 inhibitors.

          <h2>Trump Administration Moves to End Court Settlement Protecting Migrant Children</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to terminate the Flores Agreement, a longstanding court settlement that mandates basic rights and services for migrant children in U.S. custody. The Justice Department argued that the agreement has hindered the executive branch's ability to set immigration policy and incentivized illegal border crossings. Attorneys representing migrant children contend that eliminating the settlement's protections would allow the government to detain children indefinitely in substandard conditions. The first Trump administration also tried to terminate the Flores agreement, making similar legal and political arguments against the settlement, but its efforts were blocked by Gee, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2009, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

          <p>Citizens JMP initiated coverage on CoreWeave Inc. with a Market Perform rating, citing both positive and negative factors. The analyst highlighted CoreWeave's low-cost, high-density infrastructure, initially used for bitcoin mining, as a potential asset for data center expansion. However, the analyst also expressed concerns about the company's high funding needs and business model, believing that the current level of risk and uncertainty makes the stock fairly valued at its current levels. CoreWeave stock has surged around 170% this year, mainly due to Nvidia Corp.'s backing and the robust long-term growth potential in the AI infrastructure market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected by UN teams inside the Gaza Strip, three days after Israel eased an 11-week-long blockade. The aid included flour, baby food, and medical equipment, and was picked up from the Kerem Shalom crossing on Wednesday night. The UN said the delays were due to a lack of security along the single access route approved by Israel's military.

These accounts, managed by banks or investment firms, would operate like traditional investment accounts and be used for expenses such as a down payment on a home, education, or starting a small business. While the government would contribute the initial $1,000, families and third parties could also contribute up to $5,000 annually.

          <p>A small plane crashed into a military housing neighborhood in San Diego, resulting in at least two fatalities and injuring eight others. The crash, involving a Cessna 550, occurred near Sculpin Street and Santo Road, close to the 15 Freeway, in a Navy-owned housing area. The plane struck power lines two miles southeast of the airport, then collided with a house, with jet fuel igniting fires on parked cars.

          <p>The UK government's decision to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius is driven by legal and practical considerations. Without ceding sovereignty, the operation of the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia would become unworkable due to potential legal challenges from UN bodies. The agreement also aims to prevent China from establishing a military presence on the islands, as the UK can now effectively veto such a move. The government's broader diplomatic argument is that resolving the Chagos row improves the UK's reputation and strengthens its alliances.</p>
