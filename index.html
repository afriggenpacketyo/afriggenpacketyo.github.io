          <p>Powerful winds in Washington state are stirring up volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, leading to hazy skies and diminished air quality. The U.S. Geological Survey has clarified that this phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, is due to severe drought conditions and is not indicative of new volcanic activity. Officials have confirmed the volcano's alert level remains at "Normal." However, the resuspended ash poses a potential hazard to aircraft and human health, prompting warnings for pilots and residents in the affected areas.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay sustained a torn plantar fascia during his team's 33-19 victory against the Tennessee Titans. McVay, known for his energetic sideline presence, confirmed the injury but downplayed its severity, joking that it might add a "cool limp" to his swag. The injury is not expected to significantly impact his coaching duties as the now 2-0 Rams prepare for their upcoming game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The team's strong second-half performance secured their undefeated start to the season.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has been charged with aggravated murder, with prosecutors intending to seek the death penalty. According to charging documents, Robinson confessed to his parents, stating he committed the act because Kirk "spreads too much hate" and that "there is too much evil." The suspect also allegedly detailed his plans in a note to his roommate and sent messages on Discord admitting to the shooting. Investigators are continuing to examine his digital footprint for further evidence and potential co-conspirators.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the global competition for AI dominance will ultimately be decided by a nation's commitment to education and reskilling its workforce. The author suggests that countries must move beyond simply producing machine-learning engineers and focus on democratizing AI knowledge across all sectors. By embedding AI principles into national education strategies, citizens can be trained to transition from low-value tasks to higher-level roles augmented by artificial intelligence. This approach is presented as essential for boosting national productivity and competitiveness in fields from healthcare to manufacturing.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Economist critiques President Trump's recent deployment of National Guard troops to patrol landmarks in Washington, D.C., and other cities, labeling the move a "political stunt." While officially intended to combat crime, the troops are not making arrests and are instead performing tasks like collecting trash in relatively safe areas. The article argues that this use of the military for what amounts to a public presence patrol places the armed forces in an awkward position. It raises concerns about the politicization of the military for domestic purposes.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump arrived in the UK for a state visit, London Mayor Sadiq Khan issued a sharp rebuke, accusing the president of fanning the flames of divisive, far-right politics globally. In an article, Khan described some of Trump's actions as being "straight out of the autocrat's playbook" and urged the British government to act as a "critical friend" by speaking out against the politics of fear. This public criticism highlights the political tensions surrounding the visit and echoes a similar clash between the two leaders during Trump's 2019 trip.</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have announced a surprising reversal in the sun's behavior, with solar activity increasing steadily since 2008 after decades of decline. This uptick, which was unexpected, could lead to more frequent space weather events like solar storms and flares. Such events have the potential to disrupt satellite operations, power grids, and communication systems on Earth. The new findings challenge previous predictions that the sun was entering a prolonged period of historic inactivity, prompting a renewed focus on monitoring and predicting space weather.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, California Governor Gavin Newsom praised the late conservative activist's effectiveness in engaging with young men and boys. Speaking at an event to launch a mentorship initiative, Newsom suggested that Democrats have failed to invest similar energy in reaching this demographic. He framed the issue as part of a broader "epidemic of loneliness" and recalled his own son's admiration for Kirk. Newsom's comments offer a nuanced political reflection in the wake of the tragedy, highlighting a perceived gap in his own party's outreach.</p>

          <p>TV weather forecasters are facing a rising tide of online hate and threats, often fueled by climate change misinformation and conspiracy theories. One meteorologist in Iowa resigned after receiving a death threat, a symptom of a broader trend where the scientific communication of climate change is politicized. Experts explain that as visible messengers of climate science, meteorologists become targets for those who view climate action as a political agenda. The harassment highlights the complex and dangerous intersection of science denial, online radicalization, and threats against public figures.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second state visit to the U.K. comes at a politically sensitive time for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is grappling with growing domestic polarization and right-wing movements. The visit's timing is further complicated by Starmer's recent firing of the British ambassador to the U.S. over his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, a topic that could create awkward questions for both leaders. While the visit offers the spectacle of royal pageantry, it forces Starmer to navigate a delicate diplomatic relationship amid significant political headwinds at home.</p>
