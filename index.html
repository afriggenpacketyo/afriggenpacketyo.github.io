          <p>Thousands of British military personnel are initiating legal action against the US industrial giant 3M, alleging that faulty combat earplugs supplied between 2003 and 2015 caused life-changing injuries such as tinnitus and deafness. The company, which settled similar claims with 240,000 US servicemen and women for $6 billion, maintains its product was effective if used properly and denies liability, preparing to defend itself in English courts. This legal battle in the UK seeks justice for veterans like Dave Watson, who experienced hearing loss after serving in Afghanistan, and Carol Timone, a former lance bombardier. The article highlights the significant health issues affecting military personnel and the ongoing fight for corporate accountability, drawing parallels with the larger US settlement.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, has been convicted in the UK for her central role in a massive cryptocurrency scam, leading to the world's single largest bitcoin seizure valued over £5 billion ($6.7 billion). Qian defrauded over 128,000 victims in China between 2014 and 2017, subsequently fleeing to the UK using false documents to launder the stolen funds by purchasing property. Her guilty plea concludes a seven-year international investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, with the Crown Prosecution Service now working to recover the assets for victims.

The cubs received specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center, with human interaction minimized to foster natural hunting behaviors and habitat familiarity, ensuring they would not form human attachments. This successful release is crucial for the "near-threatened" mountain lion population in California, which faces declining numbers due to various threats like vehicles, wildfires, and habitat encroachment.

The article contends that Trump underestimates the limits of presidential power, as opponents wield their own economic influence. This analysis highlights the unintended consequences of his political tactics and the challenges of consolidating power, as his strategy of turning a countercultural rebellion into state-sponsored submission looks beyond his grasp.</p>
