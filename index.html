          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the administration's new domestic policy bill, asserting it represents a historic tax cut that will stimulate 3% economic growth. He contested projections from the CBO and other groups that the bill would add trillions to the national debt, arguing their models have been historically inaccurate and fail to account for growth-induced revenue. Hassett also dismissed concerns that the bill's work requirements for Medicaid would cause millions to lose coverage, stating the best path to insurance is employment, which the bill promotes. He maintained the legislation is a prudent reform that will create jobs and ultimately benefit the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, Texas, to provide federal resources for flood response and took a victory lap for his recently signed megabill during a rally. In other updates, he spoke with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy about defense industry projects, days after pausing weapons shipments to the country. At his Iowa rally, Trump also previewed plans for the nation's 250th anniversary celebration, called "America 250," which will include a state fair, a UFC fight on the White House lawn, and a new National Garden of American Heroes funded by the new legislation.</p>

          <h2>Critics Blame Trump Administration Policies for Deadly Texas Flooding, White House Condemns Politicization</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the aftermath of catastrophic flooding in Texas that killed at least 59 people, critics are blaming the Trump administration's policies, including alleged funding cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) and its approach to climate change. Opponents argue that reduced forecasting capabilities contributed to the tragedy, a claim the White House has labeled "shameful and disgusting." A White House spokesperson asserted that the NWS issued timely warnings and that the administration is actively helping Texas recover. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acknowledged the nation's flood notification technology is "ancient" and currently being upgraded by the administration.</p>

          <p>On the 50th anniversary of the film "Jaws," cast and crew members, including Richard Dreyfuss and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, reflect on its notoriously difficult production on Martha's Vineyard. The article recounts challenges such as the constantly malfunctioning mechanical shark and shooting on the open ocean, which director Steven Spielberg skillfully turned into suspense-building opportunities. Despite initial fears that the film would be a failure, it became a cultural phenomenon that ushered in the era of the summer blockbuster. The piece explores the on-set dynamics, ad-libbed humor, and the movie's lasting impact on Hollywood and audiences.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won his first home victory at a chaotic, rain-affected British Grand Prix, capitalizing on a penalty given to his teammate Oscar Piastri. Piastri, who had been leading, received a 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety car restart, which allowed Norris to pass him after his final pit stop. The race also saw veteran Nico Hulkenberg achieve his first-ever podium finish for Sauber after 239 attempts, a new Formula 1 record. The dramatic race unfolded in front of a record Silverstone crowd, further intensifying the F1 championship battle.</p>

          <p>The United States has deported eight men, who were convicted of serious crimes like murder and sexual assault, to South Sudan after a prolonged legal fight. Only one of the men is a South Sudanese national, with the others being from countries that refused to accept them, highlighting the Trump administration's expanding use of third-country deportations. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had required due process hearings for such removals.

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico in Peru's northern Barranca province, which is believed to have been a crucial trading hub for early American civilizations. The site, founded between 1,800 and 1,500 BC, likely connected communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. Researchers suggest the discovery provides important insight into the fate of the Caral, the oldest known civilization in the Americas, after it was impacted by climate change. The excavation at Peñico has uncovered 18 structures, including ceremonial temples and residential buildings, along with various cultural artifacts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is handing over previously unreleased audio recordings of the 1985 torture and murder of DEA agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena to the defense team of Mexican kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero, a founder of the Guadalajara cartel, is facing federal prosecution for his alleged role in the killing, which marked a turning point in the U.S. war on drugs. The tapes have been a subject of controversy for decades, with speculation that they may contain evidence of a former CIA officer's involvement in Camarena's interrogation, an allegation the CIA has consistently denied.</p>

          <p>The Statue of Liberty, originally a gift from France to celebrate the end of slavery, was not initially associated with immigration. The article traces its transformation into a symbol of welcome for immigrants, largely due to Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus" and the opening of Ellis Island. It explores the history of U.S. immigration policy, from the open doors of the early 20th century to the restrictive ethnic quotas of 1924. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, championed by figures like John F. Kennedy, finally ended the quota system and reshaped the nation's demographics, solidifying Lady Liberty's modern identity.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas, police officer was shot in the neck outside an ICE detention facility late on the Fourth of July, and several armed suspects are now in custody. The incident began when officers responded to a report of a suspicious person and were met with gunfire from an unknown number of assailants. A federal source indicated that over a dozen masked individuals had vandalized the facility and launched fireworks, possibly to lure law enforcement to the scene. The injured officer was treated at a hospital and has since been released, as an investigation into the motive continues.</p>

          <p>This analytical article argues that the international system, built on the rule of law since World War II, is collapsing due to the world's failure to hold Israel accountable for its actions in Gaza. It contends that this erosion of norms is visible domestically in Western nations, where pro-Palestinian speech is increasingly repressed on university campuses and beyond. The author posits that Israel's actions, enabled by Western complicity, are shifting the boundaries of acceptable state behavior, potentially normalizing policies like mass starvation as a weapon of war. The piece connects the struggle for Palestinian rights to the broader fight to preserve legal and political standards globally.</p>

According to the chairman of a regional Chinese chamber of commerce, American city leaders are receptive to Chinese-funded projects, particularly in manufacturing, to stimulate their local economies. This creates a dichotomy for potential Chinese investors, who see economic opportunity in the U.S. market but are concerned about the political risks posed by the strained national relationship. The article notes that President Trump's tariffs have also increased the incentive for Chinese firms to produce goods within the U.S.</p>

          <p>This short story by Nicole Krauss explores the complex, lifelong relationship between the narrator and his brilliant, confident friend, Harold, an archaeologist who recently died under mysterious circumstances in a cave. The narrator travels to Israel for the funeral, reflecting on a friendship defined by admiration, deep-seated envy, and a sense of being overshadowed. He grapples with the belief that Harold's death was a deliberate act of self-erasure, not an accident. The story delves into themes of memory, resentment, and the ways in which people use others to define their own lives, culminating in a late-night journey and a revelation about a long-buried act of kindness.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its political influence in the Western Balkans through a strategy described as "infrastructure imperialism," which combines religious, economic, and political power. The funding of large mosques, such as the Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania, is a key element of this soft power projection, often accompanied by economic and military agreements. This approach, driven by President Erdogan, positions Turkey as the heir to the Ottoman Empire and a major regional power. Turkish investors and construction firms are heavily involved in major projects across the region, from railways to hotels, solidifying the country's geopolitical footprint.</p>

He argued for a "polluter pays approach," questioning why event organizers requiring a police presence do not pay for it, thus diverting resources from local communities. The suggestion comes as Sir Mark calls for radical police reforms, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into 12 to 15 larger bodies.

The article compares its adoption to gold, noting that its utility may come from scarcity rather than ubiquity.
