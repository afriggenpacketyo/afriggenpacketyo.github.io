          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting has announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC affiliate stations, ending a preemptive ban. The suspension was a response to remarks made by host Jimmy Kimmel regarding the death of a conservative activist. While Disney's ABC network had already reinstated the show, major affiliate owners like Sinclair and Nexstar had continued to block it. Sinclair stated its decision aims to ensure programming serves community interests while honoring network obligations, noting the show's return would begin immediately. This move comes after the program drew significantly higher viewership on the stations where it did air.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent member of the Black Liberation Army, has died in Cuba at an advanced age. Also known as Joanne Chesimard, she was convicted in 1977 for the 1973 murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster during a shootout. In 1979, she escaped from a New Jersey prison and was later granted political asylum in Cuba, where she lived for decades. Despite being the first woman on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list with a $2 million reward for her capture, she was never extradited. New Jersey officials expressed regret that she passed away without facing full accountability for her crimes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-standing conflict between Donald Trump and former FBI Director James Comey has culminated in Comey's federal indictment. The feud began in 2016 over the handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, which Trump initially praised but later used to justify firing Comey in 2017. This dismissal occurred while Comey was leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The relationship further soured with Comey's critical book and testimony about Trump's conduct, and Trump's persistent attacks. The indictment for making a false statement and obstruction, which career prosecutors reportedly opposed, marks a significant escalation in this protracted political battle.</p>

          <p>A shopper in upstate New York discovered an extremely rare, live orange lobster in a supermarket tank and purchased it to ensure its survival. The odds of finding such a lobster are estimated at one in 30 million. The shopper, Kyle Brancato, temporarily housed the crustacean, nicknamed Jean-Clawed Van Damme, in a home aquarium. He then coordinated with the wildlife rescue group Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium.

          <p>The UK Labour Party has readmitted former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum after they were suspended for a year. Their suspension resulted from voting against the government's two-child benefit cap, a policy Labour has recently softened its stance on. This move follows the reinstatement of four other MPs suspended for the same rebellion. Upon her return, Begum criticized the party for suspending MPs who vote with their conscience. The issue of the two-child cap, which limits benefits for larger families, is expected to be a major topic at the upcoming Labour conference amid growing internal pressure to abolish it.</p>

          <p>Prominent money manager Howard Rubin has been arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women for commercial sex acts over a decade. The indictment alleges that Rubin, with the help of his former assistant, operated a trafficking network and engaged in non-consensual and brutalizing acts in a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse. Prosecutors claim Rubin spent at least $1 million on the network and used non-disclosure agreements to threaten victims. Rubin, who has extraordinary wealth, is being held without bail due to being considered a flight risk. This criminal indictment follows a 2022 civil verdict where a jury found him liable for sex trafficking six women.</p>

          <p>After securing their 12th division title in 13 years, members of the Los Angeles Dodgers acknowledged the difficulties of their season, attributing some struggles to a "World Series hangover." Players and management noted the physical and mental toll of attempting to be the first team to win consecutive championships in over two decades. The season was marked by bullpen regression, lineup slumps, and injuries, which some team members linked to the short offseason and the pressure of being defending champions. Despite these challenges, the team believes the adversity has made them more battle-tested and better prepared for the upcoming postseason.</p>

Following the indictment, Trump hinted that others, potentially including former CIA Director John Brennan, could also face charges. This move coincides with a new DOJ directive for federal prosecutors to investigate Open Society Foundations, a group funded by Democratic donor George Soros, for potential crimes.

The administration accuses congressional Democrats of being willing to let benefits lapse by not accepting a Republican-proposed continuing resolution.

          <p>This article suggests that early October may be an opportune time for savers to open a certificate of deposit (CD) despite recent declines in interest rates. The first reason is to start earning compound interest immediately, as the rate will be fixed and predictable. Secondly, with the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut rates again at the end of the month, locking in a current rate now could be advantageous. Finally, banks may preemptively lower their CD rates before the official Fed announcement, meaning waiting could result in a lower return. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As credit card delinquencies rise, it's crucial for consumers to understand the timeline of consequences for late payments. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most issuers offer an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major threshold is 30 days past due, at which point the late payment can be reported to credit bureaus, damaging your credit score. After 60 days, issuers may impose a high penalty APR, and after 90 days, more aggressive collection efforts can begin. Proactive communication with the card issuer before missing a payment is the best strategy to mitigate damage.</p>

It contends that this tactic, used by both the right to defend the Trump administration and some on the left, avoids engaging with the principles of liberal norms. The author points out that the charge of hypocrisy is only useful for judging people, not ideas, and that not all progressives participated in "cancel culture." The essay concludes that presuming all opponents are hypocrites allows one to avoid making a principled case for or against free speech, ultimately revealing a lack of principle in oneself.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a former Black Liberation Army member and a significant figure in the Black liberation movement, has died in Havana, Cuba, at the age of 78. Born JoAnne Byron, she became a prominent activist in the 1960s and 70s, joining the Black Panther Party before the BLA. After being convicted for the murder of a New Jersey state trooper in 1977, she escaped from prison two years later and was granted political asylum in Cuba by Fidel Castro's government. She remained a symbol of resistance against systemic racism and government oppression for many while living in exile for decades.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will now permit Boeing to issue its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. This authority had been revoked in 2019 and 2022, respectively, following fatal crashes and production defects, with the FAA taking over all certifications. The agency stated the decision follows a thorough review of Boeing's production quality and will allow FAA inspectors to focus on other areas of surveillance. This move is seen as a sign of returning confidence in the manufacturer, though the FAA's cap on MAX production remains in place following a midair incident earlier this year.</p>

Critics and fellow comedians like Marc Maron and Zach Woods have denounced the event as an attempt by the Saudi government to "whitewash" its poor human rights record. Human Rights Watch noted the festival coincides with the anniversary of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder and urged performers to speak out against the regime's repression. The festival is part of Saudi Arabia's broader effort to use entertainment to enhance its global image and diversify its economy.</p>

However, the initial American momentum quickly faded as Team Europe mounted a formidable comeback. Europe dominated the morning foursome session, winning three of the four matches and quieting the boisterous home crowd at Bethpage Black. Stars like Jon Rahm and Rory McIlroy secured decisive victories, leaving the U.S. trailing 3-1. The early European dominance has put the American team on the defensive as they seek to reclaim the cup on home soil.</p>

Benjamin called 911 immediately after the incident, claiming he thought he was dreaming and had been sleepwalking. His defense team presented evidence of a personal and family history of sleepwalking, supported by a sleep disorder expert who concluded the act was unintentional. Prosecutors, however, remained skeptical, questioning his demeanor and the nature of the wounds, ultimately charging him with murder. The trial will determine whether he is held criminally responsible for a tragedy no one can explain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a new home equity loan has slightly decreased. For a $150,000 loan, current average rates would result in a monthly payment of approximately $1,847 for a 10-year term or $1,452 for a 15-year term. These payments are modestly lower than they were earlier in the year, saving borrowers around $16 per month. While the savings are not dramatic, the potential for further rate cuts later this year could make exploring home equity financing a worthwhile option for homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

The young fan, Marcus Ruelos, then chose to return the ball to Raleigh in exchange for a signed bat, stating the ball meant more to the player.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted on charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice related to his 2020 congressional testimony. The charges stem from questions about his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the probe into Russian election interference. Prosecutors allege Comey misled the Senate about authorizing leaks to the media, a claim some Republicans say is contradicted by testimony from his former deputy, Andrew McCabe. The indictment comes after years of public conflict with Donald Trump, who fired Comey in 2017 and has repeatedly called for his prosecution, raising concerns about political motivation.</p>
