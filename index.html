          <p>Mainland Chinese forces conducted an amphibious landing drill in the Taiwan Strait as Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te marked his first year in office.

The drill occurred on the same day Lai pledged to strengthen Taiwan‚Äôs defense against increasing cross-strait tension.

          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq won the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, Heart Lamp, the first book written in the Kannada language to win the prize. The stories, translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, capture the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India. Mushtaq's work mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society. The win is expected to encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for a budget package containing his legislative priorities, facing resistance from dueling factions within the party. Conservatives seek steeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates oppose larger cuts to the program and demand adjustments to the state and local tax deduction. Despite the divisions, Republican leaders are racing to pass the budget package before a Memorial Day deadline. Trump urged Republicans to support the bill and address waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid.</p>

          <p>Scientists warn that a 1,000-foot-tall ‚Äúmega tsunami‚Äù could potentially devastate America's West Coast if a strong earthquake hits the Cascadia subduction zone.

Cities like Seattle and Portland could be wiped out, and coastal land could sink by as much as 6.5 feet. The potential earthquake would happen within minutes, leaving no time for adaptation or mitigation.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed a bill legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients, making it the 11th state with such a statute. The End-of-Life Options Act allows mentally capable adults with a terminal illness and six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. Patients must be presented with other options for end-of-life care and undergo two waiting periods and a second medical opinion. The law aims to provide compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice in the final moments of life.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its scheme to pay out large bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its ¬£3bn rescue loan, following criticism from Downing Street and the environment secretary. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, potentially adding ¬£1m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses. The decision comes as the regulator Ofwat could be granted new rules to prevent any water firms from handing out any bonuses.

Some campaigners fear that the upcoming ban on disposable vapes could lead more young people to turn to the stronger nicotine pouches. Nicotine pouches are often referred to as snus, although that is a different product which contains tobacco and has been banned in the UK and EU since 1992.</p>

The most severe effects would be in southern Washington, northern Oregon and northern California. Alaska and Hawaii are also vulnerable because of their seismic and volcanic profiles.</p>

          <h2>Record Tropical Forest Loss in 2024 Driven by Wildfires, Climate Change</h2>

          <p>The world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate last year, with fires being the main cause, overtaking land clearances from agriculture for the first time on record. Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km of pristine, old-growth forests were lost in 2024. Brazil and Bolivia were most badly affected, with the Amazon experiencing its worst drought on record. The record loss of the world's old-growth tropical forests released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled plans for his ‚ÄúGolden Dome‚Äù missile defense shield, predicting that the ambitious plan to expand the country‚Äôs air defense system would be completed by the end of his term. U.S. officials have said the Golden Dome is necessary to protect against ‚Äúcatastrophic attacks,‚Äù but experts say it faces logistical and financial hurdles. The project has been a priority for Mr. Trump since he took office. He promised during the campaign to build a defense system against foreign attacks similar to Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome.</p>

          <p>Record-breaking global temperatures contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide in 2024, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction.

Brazil saw its worst year for forests since 2016, with 2.8 million hectares of old-growth forest wiped out.

          <p>Media coverage often focuses on young men supposedly voting for the far right, but a more significant shift is young women turning towards the left. Research shows that young people hold more progressive values than previous generations, with a sharp leftwing turn among young women. Center-left parties should focus on the priorities and values of female voters, such as actions to fight the climate crisis and strengthen the welfare state, rather than pandering to the reactionary politics of the far right.</p>

          <p>California and the rest of the nation is experiencing a shortage of veterinary professionals due to high turnover rates, rising student debt and a surge in pet ownership spurred by the pandemic. A recent survey found that more than 344,000 shelter animals in California do not have adequate access to veterinary care staff. The lack of animal medical care has led to overcrowded shelters, a rise in pet illnesses and an increasing rate of adoptable animals being euthanized. A 2019 study showed that veterinarians are as much as four times more likely to die by suicide than the general population.</p>
