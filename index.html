          <p>President Donald Trump publicly admonished Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would lead to price increases for consumers. Trump suggested that Walmart and China should absorb the tariff costs rather than passing them on to customers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey had previously stated that the company was experiencing unprecedented price increases due to tariffs. Walmart responded by reiterating its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible, acknowledging the challenges posed by retail margins, while other companies are also warning about higher prices due to tariffs.</p>

          <p>Ukraine criticized Russia's delegation to Istanbul, calling it a "sham" due to the representatives' lack of decision-making power. Despite the official meeting, no ceasefire deal was reached, though an agreement to exchange prisoners of war was made. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously expressed skepticism, stating that real progress would only occur with direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Experts suggest that Russia may be using the negotiations to appease the US while maintaining its strategic advantage.</p>
