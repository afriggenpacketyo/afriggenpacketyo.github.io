          <p>ABC News terminated its agreement with national correspondent Terry Moran after he called President Trump and Stephen Miller "world-class haters" in a social media post. The network cited a clear violation of ABC News policies, emphasizing its commitment to objectivity and fairness. This decision follows a settlement where ABC paid Trump $15 million over allegedly defamatory comments made by George Stephanopoulos regarding the E. Jean Carroll case. Moran's post criticized Miller's capacity for hatred, while Miller responded that Moran had unmasked himself as a radical journalist, prompting further condemnation from White House officials, ultimately leading to the network's decision to not renew his contract. The network has been trying to remain neutral in the public eye, however, it is clear that there is still room for some personal sentiment to shine through, whether that be for better or worse. </p>

          <p>A man from New Jersey was gored by a bison in Yellowstone National Park after approaching the animal too closely. The incident occurred in the Upper Geyser Basin at Old Faithful, resulting in minor injuries for the man, who received treatment from emergency medical personnel. This is the second bison-related incident in the park in just over a month, highlighting the danger of approaching wildlife. Park officials remind visitors to maintain a distance of at least 25 yards from large animals like bison and elk, and 100 yards from bears, wolves, and cougars, as bison can be unpredictable and run three times faster than humans, emphasizing the importance of respecting wildlife and maintaining a safe distance. The park has a long history of bison attacks and it is a constant concern. </p>

          <p>The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, has officially endorsed efforts to overturn the Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage. This decision is motivated by the success of conservative Christians in reversing Roe v. Wade, signaling a continued push to reshape legal and social norms around marriage. The denomination's stance reflects a broader trend of conservative religious groups seeking to influence legal and political landscapes, particularly on issues related to marriage and family. This stance is a clear continuation of the conservative movement in the United States. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to restore the original Confederate names of several Army bases, reversing a renaming process initiated by Congress and completed under President Biden. The bases will now honor other service members who share similar names, rather than the Confederate figures. This decision affects bases such as Fort Gordon, Fort A.P. Hill, and Fort Hood, with Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll tasked with implementing the changes. The move unwinds the work of the Naming Commission, which was created to remove Confederate symbols and names from military installations, reflecting Trump's desire to maintain historical ties despite the controversial associations. The decision has sparked considerable debate, with some viewing it as a reversal of progress in addressing racial injustice. </p>

          <p>Sportscaster Bob Costas criticized media organizations for their dealings with President Trump, citing ABC News' settlement over George Stephanopoulosâ€™ comments and Paramount's attempts to settle a "60 Minutes" lawsuit as examples of "ransom." Costas argued that while media companies make mistakes, correcting them solely to benefit Trump is not justifiable. He suggested that the normalization of Trump's actions has led journalists to falsely present two sides to issues where there is clear right and wrong. Costas emphasized that objectivity should not require defending Trump or the White House on matters where basic American principles and decency are disregarded, reflecting a broader concern about media integrity and balance in the face of controversial political figures.</p>

          <p>The village of Chimney Rock, North Carolina, is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene, which brought mudslides and flash flooding that devastated the town. Eight months after the disaster, the tourist town is not ready to welcome summer visitors, endangering the local economy. Residents like Theresa and Glenn Cauthren have had to move into their hotel, the Chimney Rock Inn, which lacks running water and sanitation, as their home was filled with mud. The remote location and geography of Chimney Rock have made recovery efforts slower and more expensive, leaving residents grappling with the stark contrast between their situation and the normalcy in nearby cities. Despite these challenges, the community remains resilient and determined to rebuild and come back stronger than ever. </p>

          <p>Khaby Lame, the popular TikTok personality, has left the U.S. after being detained by immigration agents in Las Vegas for allegedly overstaying his visa. Lame, a Senegalese-Italian influencer, was detained at Harry Reid International Airport but allowed to leave without a deportation order. His departure comes amid President Trump's increased immigration enforcement, including raids in Los Angeles, and a voluntary departure allows Lame to avoid a deportation order on his immigration record. Lame rose to fame during the pandemic for his silent reaction videos and has since partnered with Hugo Boss and become a UNICEF goodwill ambassador. His situation highlights the complexities of immigration enforcement and its impact on individuals, even those with international recognition. </p>

While some worry about the potential for violence or missteps that could give Trump an excuse to overreach, the article emphasizes the historical effectiveness of large protests. The author contends that Trump's decision to deploy the military demonstrates his vulnerability and that suppressing dissent only benefits him. Drawing parallels to past instances where public opposition swayed Trump's policies, the piece suggests that these protests can shape public opinion and hold the administration accountable. </p>

The rebound was fueled by Musk's demonstration of Tesla's driverless vehicles operating on public roads in Austin, Texas, without a safety driver. Tesla is expected to launch a limited "pilot" program for its robotaxi service in Austin, using the Model Y with an "unsupervised" version of its Full Self-Driving technology. Despite past delays and unfulfilled promises, this development suggests Tesla is finally making progress in the robotaxi market, though analysts caution against excessive optimism regarding the safety and cost-effectiveness of the technology. </p>

The Trump administration claims the plan was already underway, and State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce stated that the directive was expected.

          <p>The Atlantic argues that in an era dominated by AI-generated content, good taste is more critical than ever. Taste, defined as judgment with style, is the ability to discern what should be done, not just what can be done. It's cultivated through exposure, curation, and reflection, and involves ethical dimensions that AI lacks. As AI proliferates outputs across industries, the person who knows which option to choose becomes increasingly valuable. The article emphasizes the need to develop taste in education and leadership to make the right choices in the AI era. </p>
