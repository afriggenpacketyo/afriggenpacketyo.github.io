          <p>Chinese officials have pledged to tackle the issues of oversupply and excessive low-price competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. During a meeting with industry leaders, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology emphasized the need for lawful governance and the phasing out of outdated production capacity. This directive follows President Xi Jinping's call to eliminate disorderly competition, signaling a high-level focus on stabilizing the sector. The government aims to guide companies toward improving product quality to ensure the industry's healthy and sustainable development globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi has issued a warning from Iran, stating the government is intensifying its repression of citizens following its recent war with Israel. In a message, she claims the regime is using the conflict's aftermath to justify a surge in executions and arrests, aiming to instill fear and deflect from internal policy failures. Mohammadi, who is currently on medical furlough from Evin Prison, also described worsening conditions for political prisoners, particularly those transferred after an Israeli strike on the facility. She is calling for renewed international attention on Iran's escalating human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so since the group seized power in 2021. The announcement followed a meeting in Kabul between Afghanistan's Foreign Minister and the Russian ambassador. In its recognition, Russia stated it would assist the Taliban in combating terrorism and drug trafficking while also enhancing economic cooperation. This move has drawn criticism from human rights advocates, who view it as prioritizing strategic interests over international law and the rights of Afghan citizens.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Trump administration's signature legislative package, a massive bill that combines tax and spending cuts with increased funding for defense and immigration enforcement. The measure, which passed by a narrow 218-214 vote, now heads to the president for his signature. The legislation makes permanent many of the tax cuts from the first term while also making significant cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed 139 employees on paid administrative leave after they signed a "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's current policies. The employees' public letter argued that the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment under the Trump administration. In response, the EPA stated it has a "zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and has initiated an administrative investigation. The move represents a rare and forceful rebuke of internal criticism within a federal agency.</p>

While acquitted of the most serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges, he was convicted on two lesser counts and still faces significant jail time and numerous civil suits. Revelations during the trial about his private life have tarnished his legacy as a hip-hop mogul. Some observers believe the damage is irreparable, while others suggest that with strong fan support, he might attempt a comeback after serving his sentence.</p>

An NPR interview with an Atlantic writer explores how Vought, a co-author of Project 2025, advocates for dismantling or politicizing nonpartisan federal agencies to restore what he sees as the founders' original intent. The bill's deep cuts to Medicaid reflect his belief that much of the program's spending is improper. This legislative approach prioritizes shrinking the federal government over fiscal concerns like the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>
