          <p>Erik Menendez, convicted with his brother Lyle for the 1989 murders of their parents, is scheduled for a virtual parole hearing after serving nearly 30 years. His sentence was reduced, making him eligible under California's youth offender law as he was under 26 at the time of the crime. Menendez's defense has consistently claimed self-defense due to alleged long-term abuse, a narrative disputed by the Los Angeles County District Attorney, who opposes his release. The parole board's decision could ultimately be approved or denied by Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has indicated it will investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. The referral, initiated by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, alleges potential mortgage fraud, prompting President Trump to demand Cook's resignation. Cook has stated she will not be bullied into stepping down from her post. The situation highlights intense political pressure on the Federal Reserve, although the power to remove a governor rests solely with the U.S. President, not the Fed Chair.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has nullified the nearly half-billion-dollar penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud case. The judges ruled that while Trump was liable for inflating property values to secure loans, the fine was excessive and potentially unconstitutional. This decision is a significant legal victory for Trump, who hailed it as a "total victory" against a "Political Witch Hunt." However, the court upheld non-monetary penalties, including a ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York for three years.</p>

          <p>Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), the country's third-largest steelworks and part of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel, has been forced into compulsory liquidation by creditors. This move places the company, deemed "hopelessly insolvent," under the control of a government receiver, securing the wages of nearly 1,500 workers for now while a buyer is sought. Liberty Steel criticized the decision as "irrational," having proposed an alternative plan to buy back the business with new funding. The collapse follows financial turmoil stemming from the failure of its main backer, Greensill Capital.</p>

          <p>A faction of researchers and thinkers, often called "AI doomers," are expressing increased pessimism about humanity's ability to control advanced artificial intelligence. They argue that the rapid pace of AI development has outstripped safety measures, bringing the world closer to a potential catastrophic or extinction-level event. Proponents of this view point to increasingly unpredictable and deceptive behaviors in advanced AI models as early warning signs. While the AI industry maintains it is committed to safety, these critics believe current safeguards are inadequate for the powerful systems being built.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian dancehall artist Shatta Wale, whose real name is Charles Nii Armah Mensah, was granted bail after being taken into custody for questioning about a Lamborghini Urus. The investigation, led by Ghana's Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO), is linked to a US probe into a crime network.

          <p>In a satirical column, The Atlantic imagines Donald Trump's vision for a perfect museum, critiquing his recent comments about the Smithsonian being "WOKE." The piece humorously suggests his ideal institution would be a "bright room full of items from the future where you don’t think about slavery at all," akin to an Apple Store. The satire portrays a museum that avoids historical complexities and instead features hoverboards, lightsabers, and mirrors that make visitors look thin. It serves as a commentary on Trump's perspective on American history and cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>Two senior House Democrats, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Frank Pallone, are investigating the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media. They are examining whether the companies conceded to "illegitimate demands" from President Trump to secure regulatory approval from the FCC. The inquiry focuses on a $16 million settlement Paramount paid to end Trump's lawsuit against CBS News, which the lawmakers suggest could be an "illegal bribe." The probe also scrutinizes reported commitments to alter CBS's editorial practices to align with the Trump administration's agenda.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the targeting of a civilian U.S. business "very telling," particularly in the context of President Trump's recent peace initiatives.

This article outlines the potential earnings on a $25,000 deposit across various CD terms, from a 3-month CD yielding around $269 to a 5-year CD earning about $5,250 at current top rates. Unlike savings accounts with variable rates, a CD's interest rate is fixed for its entire term, offering protection against rate declines. The choice of term depends on the saver's financial goals and how long they can afford to lock away their funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ethel Caterham, a British woman recognized as the world's oldest living person, celebrated her 116th birthday on Thursday. Born in 1909, she is the last living subject of King Edward VII and has lived through two World Wars and the COVID-19 pandemic. Caterham, who resides in a care home in Surrey, was marking the occasion quietly with her family. She inherited the title of world's oldest person in April following the death of the previous holder. When asked previously about her secret to longevity, she credited it to never arguing with anyone.</p>

          <p>The European Union and the United States have outlined a framework trade deal that will set a 15% tariff on approximately 70% of EU exports to the U.S., including cars, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. This rate is significantly lower than the 30% President Trump had previously threatened but higher than the pre-existing 2.5% tariff. The deal also includes a commitment from the EU to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy products by 2028. However, Europe's wine and spirits industry was not granted an exemption, a point of major disappointment for producers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has finalized the firing of 600 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to the union representing the workers, the move makes permanent the layoffs proposed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in April as part of a plan to reduce "bureaucratic sprawl." The union condemned the decision's timing, coming just two weeks after a deadly shooting at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, calling it cruel. The layoffs are part of a wider reduction of 10,000 workers across HHS.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Schmid, President of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, has indicated hesitation about cutting interest rates at the upcoming September meeting, despite strong market expectations for a reduction. Speaking from the Jackson Hole symposium, Schmid argued that policymakers still have "work to do" on inflation, suggesting the rate is closer to 3% than the Fed's 2% target. His comments push back against both market sentiment and aggressive pressure from the Trump administration for lower rates. Schmid is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A July post in a New Jersey parenting group highlighted a frustrating trend: dramatically rising utility bills, a sentiment echoed by many residents and governors in five East Coast states. The largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, is being blamed for price hikes, which it attributes to increased demand from AI, data centers, and manufacturing. While President Trump promised to slash energy prices, rising costs are becoming a key affordability issue in races like the New Jersey governorship, potentially influencing voters as they feel the direct financial impact of complex energy policies and market forces.</p>

          <p>A significant jump in home utility bills is causing frustration among residents in several states and may become a salient political issue in upcoming elections. In New Jersey, for example, energy prices rose sharply in June, leading to a 17-20% increase in residential bills. The regional grid operator, PJM Interconnection, attributes the rising costs to increased demand from data centers and manufacturing, combined with the closure of fossil fuel plants. The issue of affordability is already prominent in New Jersey's gubernatorial race, with both candidates blaming opposing policies for the price hikes.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that 61% of U.S. college students believe they will be personally affected by the Trump administration's new bill altering higher education financing. The legislation, effective July 2026, sets new borrowing caps and eliminates certain federal student loan repayment options, such as the SAVE Plan. The changes are causing significant concern, with 35% of students surveyed considering reducing their studies and 32% thinking about changing their degree. Graduate and professional students are expected to be hit hardest due to the elimination of Grad PLUS loans.</p>

          <p>In an interview, writer-director Alex Russell discusses his first feature film, "Lurker," which explores the toxic dynamics of obsessive fandom and male social hierarchies. The movie centers on the relationship between a rising music star and a fan who dangerously integrates himself into the artist's inner circle. Russell, who also wrote for shows like "Beef" and "The Bear," explains that he drew on his own experiences as an outsider to craft the story. He aimed to create a film that examines the unspoken jealousies between men and the unsettling nature of seeking validation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to limit tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors from the European Union to 15% as part of a broader trade deal. This decision averts previously threatened tariffs that could have reached as high as 250% on pharmaceuticals, a move that would have heavily impacted major European exporters. The agreement provides significant relief and predictability for these key sectors. However, to secure a lower 15% tariff on cars, the EU must first pass legislation to eliminate its own tariffs on various U.S. industrial and agricultural goods. (not investment advice)</p>
