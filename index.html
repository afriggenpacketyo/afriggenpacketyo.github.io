          <p>More than 40 million Americans are facing dangerous heat conditions this weekend, with Extreme Heat Warnings active in the Southwest, including Arizona and California. The heatwave is expanding across the Plains and into the Northwest, with cities like Dallas, Oklahoma City, and Portland expecting temperatures to soar well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions are creating an elevated risk of wildfires, particularly in states like Oregon, Utah, and Colorado, where low humidity and gusty winds could lead to rapid fire spread. The intense heat is expected to persist into next week, moving towards the Midwest and Northeast.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor has outlined his reasons for avoiding joint training camp practices with other NFL teams, a popular preseason preparation method. Taylor argues that focusing on internal competition and installing the team's own systems is more beneficial than preparing for a specific opponent in a practice setting. He demonstrated this philosophy by playing key starters like Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase in a recent preseason game. This approach allows the team to continue evaluating position battles, such as on the offensive line, and fine-tune their strategies ahead of the regular season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals upon receiving a fixed-term custodial sentence. Under this proposal, these individuals would be barred from re-entering the UK, with their home countries deciding whether they serve any remaining sentence. The government states this would save taxpayer money, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population, but critics warn that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals. The plan would not apply to those with life sentences for the most serious crimes, who would serve their time in the UK first.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned UEFA for posting a tribute to Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid without mentioning the circumstances of his death. The Palestinian Football Association reported that al-Obeid, known as the 'Pele of Palestinian football,' was killed in an Israeli attack while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. In response to UEFA's post honoring al-Obeid's legacy, Salah posted on social media, "Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?" The incident highlights the ongoing conflict and the political sensitivities surrounding expressions of solidarity and mourning in the region.</p>

The mass arrests have drawn criticism from human rights groups like Amnesty International, who called the police response disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression. The government defended the ban, citing security advice regarding the group's activities.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, from funding Democratic lawmakers who left the state. The lawmakers fled to prevent a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan, and the lawsuit from Attorney General Ken Paxton alleges the PAC's financial support constitutes bribery and deceptive fundraising. O'Rourke has responded with a countersuit, accusing Paxton of attempting to silence dissent and dismantle a major voter registration organization. The legal battle escalates the high-stakes political standoff over Texas's congressional maps.</p>

          <p>Bollywood's depiction of Kashmir has transformed dramatically over the decades, mirroring India's shifting political landscape. Initially portrayed as a romantic, idyllic paradise in post-independence films, the region's cinematic image changed with the rise of militancy in the late 1980s. Films then began to frame Kashmir as a conflict zone, often focusing on themes of patriotism and terrorism. In recent years, and especially since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370, films like "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370" have been criticized for aligning closely with government narratives, highlighting how the film industry reflects and shapes national sentiment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he will hold a press conference on Monday to detail a plan that he claims will "essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C." This follows his threat to take federal control of the city's police force and the deployment of federal agents to patrol the city. The move comes after a government staffer was injured in an attempted hijacking, though official data shows violent crime rates in the city have been decreasing. The plan has drawn criticism from local officials who argue it undermines the district's right to self-governance.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from NASA's Crew-10 mission have successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule. The crew, consisting of two American astronauts, one Japanese, and one Russian, completed a nearly five-month (146-day) mission aboard the International Space Station. During their time in orbit, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments, studying phenomena like plant growth and cellular behavior in microgravity. Their safe return marks the conclusion of NASA's tenth successful commercial crew rotation mission, a cornerstone of its ongoing partnership with private space companies.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to halt German weapons exports intended for use in the Gaza Strip has triggered sharp criticism from within his own conservative political alliance. Some members of the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, argue the move breaks with Germany's long-standing foreign policy and special responsibility towards Israel. However, the decision has also garnered support from other conservatives and the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, who believe it is a necessary response to the Israeli government's recent actions. The debate highlights a significant rift over foreign policy within Germany's ruling coalition.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that tore through a homeowner's roof in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified by a planetary geologist as being 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than Earth itself. The space rock, which created a fireball seen across Georgia and South Carolina in June, is believed to originate from the breakup of a large asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter. Scientists have proposed naming the rock the "McDonough Meteorite," and it marks the 27th such object recovered in Georgia, offering a rare and tangible link to the early history of our solar system.</p>

          <p>An anti-immigration protest drew hundreds of people to the town of Nuneaton, where they marched through the town center. The demonstration was organized after a local council leader stated that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers. The protest was largely peaceful, though one arrest was made for threats to cause criminal damage, and a small group of counter-protesters was also present. The event is one of several similar demonstrations across England, reflecting heightened tensions around immigration and crime.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot in southern Lebanon has killed six Lebanese soldiers. The soldiers were part of a unit inspecting the depot and dismantling its contents near the Israeli border, a task aligned with a UN-backed ceasefire agreement. The blast occurred in Wadi Zibqin in the Tyre district, a region with a heavy Hezbollah presence. The incident underscores the dangers faced by the Lebanese army as it works to assert state control and implement disarmament plans in an area still rife with unexploded ordnance and armed factions.</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is facing a severe environmental crisis driven by a combination of plastic pollution, industrial overfishing, sewage, and the impacts of climate change. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report collapsing fish stocks and nets filled with plastic instead of fish, threatening their livelihoods. While nations bordering the sea are proposing solutions like coastal restoration and plastic reduction initiatives, local communities and activists remain skeptical. They feel that global commitments are slow to materialize and that those who depend on the sea are being left without the tools to protect their only source of income.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of modern partisan gerrymandering, tracing its roots to the Republican "Redmap" strategy after the 2010 census. This project used sophisticated data and mapping technology to redraw legislative districts, effectively locking in Republican majorities in state legislatures and the U.S. House for a decade, even when Democrats won more votes. The article details how this practice has entrenched hard-right lawmakers, insulated them from accountability, and led to the current high-stakes redistricting battles. The Supreme Court's 2019 decision to deem the issue non-justiciable in federal courts has further fueled this political arms race.</p>

          <p>In a bizarre geopolitical event, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous award for the son of a senior CIA official who was killed while fighting for Russian forces in Ukraine. The award, the Order of Lenin, was given to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff to pass along for 21-year-old Michael Gloss, son of CIA deputy director Juliane Gallina. Gloss, who reportedly suffered from mental health issues, had expressed pro-Russian views on social media before enlisting with Russian forces in 2023. The incident highlights a strange and tragic intersection of personal struggle and international espionage.</p>
