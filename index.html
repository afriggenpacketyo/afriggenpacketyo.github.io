          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports increased adoption of electric cars and heat pumps, highlighting progress toward the nation's net-zero emissions goal by 2050. While electric car sales are nearly one-in-five new cars sold in 2024, heat pump sales remain below target despite recent growth. The committee emphasizes the need for government action to lower electricity bills, making clean technologies more affordable for households. Removing charges related to older renewable energy projects from electricity bills could significantly reduce costs for consumers, incentivizing further adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. The government continues to work on delivering clean power for families and businesses.</p>

          <p>Amid increased ICE raids in Los Angeles, Regina Higuera, a grandmother who lived in the U.S. for 36 years, chose to self-deport to Mexico to avoid the uncertainty of potential arrest and deportation. Her daughter, Julie Ear, explained that her mother wanted to maintain control over her life rather than face the possibility of being detained at home or work. Higuera, who crossed into the U.S. illegally at age 15, worked in garment factories and contributed to the economy by paying taxes. She is now reunited with her mother in Guerrero, Mexico, while her children continue to build their lives in the U.S.</p>

          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral primary features a contest between left-wing Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, reflecting an internal battle within the Democratic Party. Mamdani, endorsed by progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, campaigns on affordability issues, including free public transit and universal childcare. Cuomo, seeking a comeback after resigning amid scandal, is viewed as the moderate establishment candidate with strong ties to the city's political history. The election utilizes ranked-choice voting, potentially influencing the outcome as voters rank their top five candidates. Mamdani has been compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and is focused on making the city more affordable.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding $5 billion in funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. Judge Tana Lin granted a partial injunction, ruling that the states' lawsuit against the Department of Transportation would likely succeed. The Trump administration had suspended the funding, citing a review of the program's policies, but the Government Accountability Office found the withholding unlawful. During his campaign, Trump expressed opposition to electric vehicles, contrasting with his later appointment of Elon Musk to a government efficiency role.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel appears to be holding after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a truce. However, an initial intelligence assessment suggests that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a few months. The report indicates that only the entrances to the deeply buried facility in Fordow were destroyed, while the underground structures remained intact. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt criticized the publication of the report, calling it "flat-out wrong." Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has vowed a return to normal life and expressed openness to resuming nuclear negotiations.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago, offering new insights into the Milky Way's past. Using data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older ones. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

          <p>China is implementing more strategies for foreign institutions to utilize the yuan, aiming to challenge the U.S. dollar as international confidence in the greenback weakens. The People's Bank of China is planning to establish a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promote yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Recent moves include expanding the range of tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and considering allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan. While global finance institutions have long been interested in diversifying to China, Beijing's strict controls on capital outflows and relatively opaque system have discouraged large-scale buying of mainland China assets.</p>

          <p>Adrian Clouatre, a Marine Corps veteran, is struggling after ICE detained his wife, Paola, during her green card application process, leaving him to care for their two young children. Paola, a Mexican national, had a deportation order from 2018 due to her mother's failure to appear at an immigration hearing. Despite marrying Adrian and seeking legal status, she was detained during an appointment with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Immigration law experts say that the Trump administration's strict enforcement directives have reduced the discretion previously afforded to military families, leading to increased deportations.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has decided not to testify in his sexual assault and trafficking trial, where he faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted on all counts. Prosecutors have rested their case after calling 34 witnesses over 28 days, alleging that Combs used his business empire to coerce women into sex. Combs' lawyers presented a brief case, suggesting the alleged victims consented to the sexual activity. The defense rested its case after asking the judge to issue an immediate acquittal, which was not ruled on.

Earlier, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the Trump administration's postponement of a scheduled classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict.

          <p>McDowell County in West Virginia, already facing economic decline, is struggling to recover from a devastating flood that occurred in February. The flood exacerbated existing challenges, including high poverty rates, population loss, and a high drug overdose rate. While approximately $12 million in federal relief has been provided, it is insufficient to cover all the cleanup and rebuilding costs. The community faces a brutal cycle of devastation, insufficient aid, and frustration with the government. The average life expectancy in McDowell County is 12 years less than the rest of the U.S.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is holding approximately 59,000 detainees, a record high, with nearly half lacking a criminal record. This surge in detentions reflects the Trump administration's aggressive expansion of immigration arrests. Internal agency figures show that ICE has averaged around 1,200 daily arrests in June, nearly double the average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration. This expansion has been achieved through large-scale operations and the reversal of previous administration's limits on who is subject to detention.</p>

Scientists concluded the creature was a new species based on unique features in its leg bones.
