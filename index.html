        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a high-stakes trial, two of the five Brazilian Supreme Court justices presiding over the case have voted to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of orchestrating a coup attempt following his 2022 election loss. A third guilty vote would secure a conviction, potentially leading to a prison sentence exceeding 40 years. Prosecutors allege Bolsonaro led a criminal organization that planned to prevent his successor from taking office, culminating in the January 8th, 2023 riots in the capital. Bolsonaro, who is under house arrest and denies all charges, has claimed the trial is politically motivated to block him from running in the 2026 presidential election.</p>

          <p>Shares for Oracle saw a significant 22% increase in extended trading after the company announced substantial future growth driven by new cloud contracts, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector. This optimism overshadowed the fact that both its quarterly earnings and revenue fell slightly short of analyst expectations. The company highlighted a massive 359% year-over-year increase in its remaining performance obligation, a measure of future contracted revenue, now totaling $455 billion. Key deals, including one with OpenAI and making Google's Gemini AI models available on its infrastructure, have positioned Oracle as a major beneficiary of the ongoing AI boom.

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister has resigned following intense, youth-led protests against widespread government corruption and a controversial social media ban. The demonstrations, organized by a movement identifying as "Gen Z," turned violent in Kathmandu and other cities, resulting in at least 22 deaths and numerous injuries during clashes with police. Protesters are demanding an end to systemic corruption, symbolized by the viral "NepoKids" trend highlighting the lavish lifestyles of political families. Despite the government repealing the social media ban, the unrest continues, with the army warning it may intervene if the situation does not stabilize through dialogue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a legal challenge concerning the broad tariffs imposed by President Trump through executive order, which two lower courts have already deemed illegal. The administration argues the tariffs are a critical tool for national security and economic stability, citing historical precedent and their role in combating fentanyl trafficking and trade deficits. However, a coalition of businesses and states contends that the president has overstepped congressional authority, inflicting significant harm on American businesses, particularly small ones. The case poses fundamental questions about the separation of powers and the extent of presidential authority over the economy.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in "Breaking Bad," was taken into custody for five hours following a dispute with three women in Los Angeles. The incident occurred while Cruz was washing his car and the women parked extremely close to him, refusing his request to move their vehicle. According to his agent, the women began recording him, and as Cruz turned to ask them to stop, some water from the hose he was holding may have inadvertently splashed them.

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in Boston, dubbed "Patriot 2.0," has resulted in the arrests of several undocumented immigrants with serious criminal charges and convictions. The Department of Homeland Security stated the operation targets individuals accused of violent crimes, including sexual assault, child abuse, and drug trafficking. The arrests have intensified the conflict between the Trump administration and Boston's Mayor Michelle Wu, who supports the city's sanctuary policies and has been sued by the Department of Justice over them. Wu maintains that local resources will not be used for federal immigration enforcement, arguing ICE's actions do not make the community safer.</p>

During a press event for the film "After the Hunt," the journalist directed a question to Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield about what was lost in the "politically correct era" now that "the #MeToo movement and Black Lives Matters are done." Edebiri interjected to state that the work of these movements is not finished, a sentiment Garfield echoed.

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has issued a temporary stay on a lower court ruling that would have compelled the Trump administration to unfreeze and spend over $4 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.

The administration is attempting to claw back the funds through a rarely used "pocket rescission" maneuver, arguing that the lower court's decision infringes on the separation of powers.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attacks as "savage" and reiterated his urgent call for more advanced air defense systems from allies.

          <p>Israel's recent airstrike targeting senior Hamas leadership in Doha, Qatar, is being interpreted as a strong signal that the Israeli government remains committed to a military defeat of Hamas rather than a negotiated ceasefire. The attack, which occurred as Hamas leaders were reportedly discussing a U.S. ceasefire proposal, complicates diplomatic efforts and raises questions about the future of negotiations. This move suggests a strategic pivot away from using intermediaries like Qatar for dialogue, potentially prolonging the conflict in Gaza. The strike has been praised by many Israeli politicians but criticized by others, including the family of a hostage who fear it could endanger their loved ones.</p>

Residents of Wyoming are projected to see the largest average reduction at $5,374, while those in Mississippi and West Virginia will likely see the smallest cuts. These geographic disparities are primarily due to differences in average state incomes, as the law favors higher-income households. Provisions such as the increased cap for state and local tax deductions will also provide greater benefits to residents in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Iran and UN Nuclear Watchdog Agree to Resume Cooperation with Egyptian Backing</h2>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement in Cairo to resume cooperation, including the potential relaunch of inspections at Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, brokered with help from Egypt, comes after Iran suspended all cooperation with the UN watchdog in July following an air war with Israel and the U.S. that targeted its nuclear sites. This development is a crucial step towards transparency, as the IAEA had expressed serious concern over its inability to verify Iran's stockpile of near bomb-grade uranium since the conflict. The agreement arrives at a sensitive time, as European powers have begun reimposing sanctions on Iran for non-compliance.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is reportedly causing frustration among some Republican lawmakers due to his aggressive social media presence and public attacks on the Federal Reserve. His actions have created friction within the Trump administration, highlighted by a recent confrontation where Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent threatened Pulte at a private dinner. While some hardline Republicans support Pulte's campaign against President Trump's perceived enemies, others view him as overstepping his role and prefer Bessent's more stabilizing influence on economic policy. The discontent also extends to Pulte's approach to housing policy concerning Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City's Erling Haaland continues to break goalscoring records, recently netting five goals in a single match for Norway. An analysis of his performance reveals that his phenomenal success is due less to superior finishing ability and more to his extraordinary talent for creating high-quality scoring opportunities. Compared to the average player, his finishing accounts for only a small fraction of his goal tally. Instead, his unique combination of strength, speed, anticipation, and movement allows him to get into better scoring positions more frequently than other elite strikers, such as his predecessor at Manchester City, Sergio Agüero.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Key inflation data to be released this week, including the consumer price index (CPI), is anticipated to show that prices rose again in August. Economists predict a 0.3% monthly increase for both the headline and core indexes, which would push the annual headline CPI rate to 2.9%, its highest since January. Despite the increase, the Federal Reserve is still widely expected to proceed with an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. Policymakers are likely to attribute the price hikes to tariff-sensitive goods rather than broader service-sector inflation and will focus more on the weakening labor market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals facing sudden unemployment, managing credit card debt can become a significant challenge, but issuers are unlikely to simply waive payments. Instead, they may offer temporary hardship programs that can reduce minimum payments, lower interest rates, or pause payments for a few months. These programs are not automatic and require direct negotiation with the lender, with eligibility often depending on account history. If a card issuer cannot provide relief, other options include seeking help from a credit counseling agency, exploring a debt settlement program, or using a balance transfer or consolidation loan to manage high-interest debt.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending all planned restaurant remodels after receiving negative customer feedback. The decision follows a recent controversy where the company faced widespread backlash, including from President Donald Trump, for introducing a new, more modern logo that removed its "Old Country Store" branding and "Uncle Herschel" character. Although the company quickly reverted to its old logo, it had also been testing updated restaurant layouts in a few locations. In a statement, Cracker Barrel assured customers that it heard their feedback and would preserve the vintage Americana atmosphere its patrons love.</p>

Instead of fronting Led Zeppelin, he recommended Robert Plant and John Bonham to Jimmy Page. While he never achieved the same level of commercial success as the bands he nearly joined, his solo work remains influential and has been covered by artists such as Chris Cornell and the Raconteurs.</p>
