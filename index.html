          <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs have sparked significant economic repercussions, with Thursday marking the worst day for U.S. stock markets since June 2020. China has retaliated by imposing a 34% tariff on American goods, and other nations are contemplating their responses. Amidst this escalating trade conflict, a House Republican is pushing to curtail Trump's authority on tariffs, reflecting growing concern within the party about the potential damage to the U.S. economy. The universal 10% levy against all countries went into effect early Saturday, further intensifying the global trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy has strongly criticized Israeli authorities for denying entry to Labour MPs Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, labeling the action "unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning." Israeli officials claimed the MPs intended to spread hate speech, a charge Lammy refuted. The Foreign Office has contacted the MPs to offer support, and Lammy has communicated to his Israeli counterparts that such treatment of British Parliamentarians is inappropriate. This incident strains diplomatic relations and raises questions about freedom of movement and expression for elected officials.</p>

          <p>Kenan Malik reviews Joel Budd's book, 'Underdogs,' which challenges common political perceptions of the white working class, arguing that their distinctiveness is rooted more in geography than ethnicity. The book highlights disparities in opportunities, social mobility, and infrastructure between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas where white workers disproportionately reside. Budd identifies diversity within this group, distinguishing between 'heartlands,' 'enclaves,' and 'colonies,' and questions myths surrounding immigration attitudes. The review also critiques the Labour party's shift away from class politics and its implications for representing working-class interests.</p>

          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier appears to have taken an alternative route to the east of Taiwan before a drill last week, bypassing wider waterways and transiting through narrower passages of the Philippine archipelago. Analysts suggest this move could be training to counter American warships and explore alternative routes in case of conflict over the island. The new route offers southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel, a strategic chokepoint, and northbound options through the waterway between Japan and Taiwan.

The iconic stripes have become a symbol of Canadian identity, driving up prices on items like wool blankets, which are being resold for over $1,000. The increased sales have allowed HBC to save some stores from liquidation, though many will still close. Founded in 1670, HBC played a significant role in Canada's history and its striped blankets have become an enduring symbol of the country's past.</p>

The move has wiped out trillions in stock market value and led to concerns about rising costs and job losses. Experts describe the tariffs as a "seismic" shift in global trade relations.</p>

          <p>China is confronting an escalating obesity crisis, with forecasts indicating that over 65% of adults could be overweight or obese by 2030. This rise in obesity is raising concerns about increased pressure on the healthcare system due to chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes. The government has initiated a three-year plan, including diet and exercise recommendations, and intends to introduce multidisciplinary "weight management clinics" in hospitals nationwide.
