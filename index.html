          <p>London's Mayor Sadiq Khan is actively trying to entice investors, visitors, and students from the U.S., especially given the perceived instability associated with another Trump administration. Khan emphasizes London's stability, openness, and diversity as attractive qualities for those seeking an alternative to the U.S. He highlights that London offers a conducive environment for innovation, creativity, and business. While acknowledging political differences with Trump, Khan asserts the importance of prioritizing national interests and maintaining open communication on areas of both agreement and disagreement.

The poll also revealed that Britons are the most likely to support a "strong leader who breaks the rules" to address their economic problems.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban, restricting foreign nationals from 19 countries from entering the U.S., has been met with concern but less surprise than his initial ban in 2017. This new ban is part of a series of draconian immigration restrictions implemented since Trump's second term began, including suspending the asylum system and ending temporary legal residency for various groups. The policy includes exemptions for visa holders already in the U.S., green-card holders, dual citizens, and athletes traveling for major sporting events. Experts suggest the new ban is more likely to withstand legal challenges, but it will undoubtedly separate families and disproportionately affect those seeking refuge from humanitarian crises.</p>

          <p>Despite a U.S. port fee aimed at ships linked to China, major shipping companies like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) are continuing to order vessels from Chinese shipyards. MSC senior vice-president Marie-Caroline Laurent stated that the port fee would not deter the company from ordering more vessels from China, citing their unmatched competitiveness. The global shipping industry is striving to achieve net-zero emissions in the next 25 years, leading to increased investments in decarbonization technologies and new ship orders. Laurent noted that reviving America's shipbuilding sector would require state subsidies and strategic asset retention, but would likely not change MSC's shipbuilding strategy.</p>

While some Republicans acknowledge Musk's influence, they remain committed to the legislation, arguing that there is no time for a new bill.
