          <p>China's military is rapidly deploying AI-powered drones, including a micro drone resembling a thermal flask, to enhance its battlefield capabilities. This micro drone features a coaxial dual-rotor system, enabling it to carry twice its weight, and is equipped with AI-powered targeting and real-time battlefield intelligence transmission. The PLA Daily describes this as a "phased leap" in unmanned combat team technology, aiming for autonomous operations and a strategic advantage in future warfare. The transition involves expanding drone usage and integrating them deeply into military operations to define future battlefield rules. </p>

          <p>Families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea decades ago are seeking assistance from U.S. government officials and lawmakers for the victims' early return. Takuya Yokota, brother of Megumi Yokota, and Koichiro Iizuka, son of Yaeko Taguchi, are traveling to Washington to convey their desire for the abduction issue to be addressed in U.S.-North Korea negotiations. They aim to emphasize the urgency of the matter, especially with evolving international relations, and are carrying a letter received by Akihiro Arimoto from Trump and a photo of his abducted daughter, Keiko Arimoto, to underscore the families' dwindling time. Since 2002, Japan has sought the release of 12 officially recognized abductees and suspects North Korea's involvement in other disappearances.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured a victory in the federal election, despite declining popularity and Conservative challenges, in an election heavily influenced by U.S. President Trump's policies. Trump's threats to annex Canada and impose tariffs became central issues, affecting voters' decisions alongside domestic concerns like affordability and immigration. Voters expressed concerns about Canadian sovereignty and the need for broader global partnerships to reduce reliance on the U.S. Trump's comments on Truth Social, repeating his desire to make Canada the 51st U.S. state, drew strong reactions from Canadian leaders, who reaffirmed Canada's independence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "border czar," Tom Homan, defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, claiming it was not an error but a correction based on changed circumstances. Homan asserted that Abrego Garcia is now considered a terrorist, as the gang he feared no longer exists, despite a previous withholding order protecting him from deportation. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has refused to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., echoing the administration's stance. Abrego Garcia was moved to a lower-security facility in El Salvador after initially being held in a maximum-security prison, and a federal judge has paused orders requiring the Trump administration to provide updates on efforts to facilitate his return.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's return to the Oval Office has been marked by a focus on prioritizing U.S. interests through policies emphasizing nationalism and economic protectionism, alongside a second state visit planned to the UK. He established the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, and continued to use Truth Social to shape his narrative. Key policy moves include withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, taking a binary view on gender, and imposing tariffs, with reactions ranging from public protests to legal challenges. Trump's first 100 days have also involved frequent golf outings, criticism of judges, and efforts to reshape education and media landscapes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures easing the impact of tariffs on imported cars and auto parts, allowing automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. Tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but will be modified to avoid stacking with tariffs on steel and aluminum. Automakers will be reimbursed for a portion of the cost of tariffs on imported components, up to 3.75 percent of a new car's value in the first year, phased out over two years. Despite these changes, substantial tariffs will still impact prices for new and used cars and increase repair costs.</p>

Badenoch stated she is not worried about criticism from those too scared to attach their name to it, dismissing the validity of such anonymous attacks. She also recently denied claims of a rift with shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick regarding an electoral pact with Reform UK.</p>

The costs of the new import duties will be borne by the U.S. clients, and at least one exporter in Jiangsu has also been asked to prepare for a recovery in demand, signaling a possible easing of trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asian countries face the risk of isolation by China and hindered growth if they side too closely with the U.S. in the ongoing trade war, according to Chinese political scientist Zheng Yongnian.

          <p>A research team predicts that global warming may prevent students in Japan from participating in extracurricular outdoor sports during the summer by the 2060s. Heat stress projections indicate that intense sporting activity should be avoided during certain hours in July and August in most areas, excluding Hokkaido. The team's model, based on weather data and heat stress measurements, projects hourly heat stress figures in various regions under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios, highlighting the potential impact on daily life as global warming progresses.</p>

          <p>A 45-year-old Iraqi man, Akeel Abdul Jamiel, has been charged with illegally voting in the 2020 presidential election in upstate New York, with the Justice Department crediting Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for assisting in the investigation. Jamiel, a non-U.S. citizen, registered as a member of the Conservative Party before the election. This case follows President Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud and his executive order directing Homeland Security to review state voting records with DOGE's assistance. Court filings suggest Jamiel is a Trump supporter who had previously accused New York City of providing sanctuary for illegal immigrants.</p>
