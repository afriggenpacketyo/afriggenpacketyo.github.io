          <p>The relationship between the United States and Venezuela has grown more tense after a U.S. strike on a speedboat that the White House claimed was carrying "narco-terrorists" from the Tren de Aragua group. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the strike as "imperialist policy" and announced the activation of millions of militiamen, while the U.S. has deployed warships to the Caribbean. This action is part of a broader militarization of the "war on drugs" by the Trump administration, raising fears of a potential intervention, though experts believe such a scenario remains unlikely.</p>

          <p>Germany's pension system, based on a "generational contract" where the current workforce finances retirees, is facing a severe crisis due to a rapidly aging population and a low birth rate. With the baby boomer generation approaching retirement, the ratio of contributors to pensioners is declining sharply, threatening the system's long-term stability. This demographic shift is forcing discussions about reforms, such as new taxes on wealthier pensioners or adopting models from neighboring countries like Austria and the Netherlands, which have more inclusive and stable systems.

          <p>Archaeologists in Camden, South Carolina, have discovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal clashes. The hastily buried remains include Continental soldiers, a British Highlander, and a Native American fighter. In what is being called the "ultimate cold case," forensic genealogists are now using advanced DNA analysis to build genetic profiles and identify the soldiers, asking potential descendants to submit DNA to help restore the names of these forgotten heroes.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has adjusted a key promise made at his party's conference to stop small boat migrant crossings within two weeks of entering government. He clarified on a BBC program that the two-week timeline would begin only after his government passes new legislation, the Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill. This proposed law would grant the power to detain and deport migrants quickly, a process that could take months, shifting the initial hard deadline he presented to his party's activists.</p>

The move highlights the administration's use of agreements with third countries to deport individuals, a practice that has sparked concern in nations like Eswatini about becoming a "dumping ground" for criminals.</p>

Her comments come as the court faces criticism over its conservative supermajority and recent landmark decisions that have expanded presidential powers and overturned abortion rights.</p>

While dispelling myths about mafia bodies, the dive highlighted the environmental challenges facing the 2-million-year-old lake and the ongoing efforts to remove trash and invasive species from its pristine waters.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a $4 billion position in PepsiCo and is pushing for significant changes to improve the company's underperforming stock. In a detailed presentation, Elliott recommends that PepsiCo refranchise its bottling network, divest from weaker brands like Quaker, and rationalize its product portfolio to cut costs. The firm argues these moves would allow for strategic reinvestment into core, high-growth brands like Frito-Lay and Gatorade, ultimately unlocking at least 50% upside for shareholders.
