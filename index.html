          <p>This New York Times article delves into Audra McDonald's Tony-nominated performance of "Rose's Turn" in the Broadway revival of "Gypsy," exploring the depths of the character Rose's self-delusion and self-knowledge. The article discusses how McDonald, along with director George C. Wolfe, musical director Andy Einhorn, and choreographer Camille A. Brown, crafted a rendition that exposes a previously unseen vulnerability and fear of abandonment in Rose. McDonald's interpretation draws on personal experiences and a focus on Rose's relationship with her own mother, resulting in a raw and emotionally devastating performance that leaves audiences deeply moved.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it is initiating a scientific review to potentially remove ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for children from the market by October 31. While fluoride is known to strengthen tooth enamel and reduce cavities, the FDA cites studies suggesting that ingested fluoride may alter the gut microbiome and be associated with thyroid disorders, weight gain, and decreased IQ. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a long-time critic of fluoride, supports the move, while dental experts largely maintain that fluoride is safe and effective in preventing dental decay.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration is considering accepting a $400 million luxury plane as a gift from Qatar, sparking legal and ethical concerns. While Trump calls it a "great gesture," some Democrats label it "wildly illegal," citing constitutional provisions against elected officials accepting gifts from foreign leaders without congressional approval. The move also raises questions about potential conflicts of interest, as Trump's family is pursuing business deals in Qatar and the UAE. Experts suggest that any use of the plane by Trump after leaving office would be a violation of the constitution.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders are considering cuts to federal aid, causing concern among state officials who fear their budgets cannot absorb billions in new costs. Governors are expressing alarm about the budgetary fallout from President Trumpâ€™s economic agenda, warning they will not be able to pick up the bill if the federal government reduces its funding for major public services. States are already experiencing less-than-expected growth and will not be able to absorb the federal cuts Republicans are pursuing, leading to potential impacts on public services millions of Americans rely on.</p>

The Dodgers' coaching staff is working with Sasaki to identify the root cause, exploring mechanical adjustments and pitch conviction issues, as his fastball performance has been a glaring red flag amid an otherwise underwhelming start to the season.</p>
