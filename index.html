          <p>Protests at a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, Essex, escalated into disorder, with demonstrators throwing bottles and flares at police vehicles. The unrest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker for alleged sexual assaults, leading to heightened tensions and multiple arrests during the demonstrations. In response to the violence, which injured eight officers in a previous clash, Essex Police implemented a Section 60AA order, requiring the removal of face coverings in the area to prevent further serious disorder.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has refuted a Wall Street Journal story that alleged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent convinced him not to dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The report claimed Bessent warned of negative economic repercussions and argued a rate cut was likely, making the move unnecessary. In a social media post, Trump labeled the story "untruthful," asserting his own superior understanding of the market and that he is the one who explains matters to his staff, not the other way around. This public dispute highlights ongoing tensions between Trump and the Federal Reserve's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, strongly criticized Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's recent statements on trade and the economy. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Himes labeled Lutnick a "huckster and a con man," refuting the claim that foreign countries pay for tariffs and dismissing the idea that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is "torturing" Americans. Himes argued that such rhetoric is dangerous and factually incorrect, emphasizing that the Federal Open Market Committee, not Powell alone, sets interest rates, and that firing the Fed chair would cause massive market instability.

          <p>A dietary strategy known as "meal sequencing" could offer health benefits, according to nutrition experts. The practice involves consuming fiber-rich vegetables, protein, and fats before eating carbohydrates, which may help prevent significant spikes in blood sugar after meals. This approach is considered particularly beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, as it can slow glucose absorption. Additionally, eating protein and fiber first can increase feelings of fullness, potentially aiding in weight management by suppressing appetite and delaying gastric emptying.</p>

          <p>Kentucky's Democratic Governor, Andy Beshear, is signaling a potential 2028 presidential run with a recent visit to the early primary state of South Carolina. Beshear is positioning himself as a candidate who can win in Republican-leaning areas, repeatedly highlighting his five-point victory over a Trump-endorsed opponent in 2023. He is part of a growing field of potential Democratic candidates who are already building name recognition. During his visit, Beshear advocated for a disciplined, values-based messaging strategy focused on everyday issues to win back voters who have become skeptical of the Democratic brand.</p>

The pilot expressed frustration that the Minot Air Force Base, which has radar, did not provide a warning.

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are facing a dual crisis of heightened fear from federal ICE raids and anxiety over potential state-level cuts to healthcare access. Community health centers like St. John’s report a dramatic increase in missed appointments, as undocumented residents are afraid to leave their homes. At the same time, California's budget deficit has led to a halt in the expansion of Medi-Cal for undocumented adults, creating a more immediate financial threat for clinics than federal policies. This situation is forcing healthcare providers to become political advocates to protect essential services for their vulnerable patients.</p>

Lyons also stated that under the current administration's broad mandate, ICE agents will arrest any individual they encounter who is in the country illegally, including those without criminal records. This policy marks a significant shift from the previous administration, which had more narrowly focused enforcement priorities.</p>
