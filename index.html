            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under further scrutiny after a second Signal chat came to light, revealing that he shared details about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The shared information included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets involved in the operation. This revelation follows earlier reports of Hegseth sharing sensitive details in another Signal group, raising concerns about potential leaks and security risks. The Pentagon's inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app to determine compliance with DoD policies, while former officials criticize the dysfunction within the Pentagon under his leadership. </p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has decided to keep its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision comes as China's economic data for the first quarter of 2025 exceeded expectations, showing a GDP increase of 5.4% year-on-year. The PBOC's move aims to stabilize the yuan amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States, giving them room to focus on currency stability rather than stimulating the economy. While rates remain steady now, future adjustments will likely depend on incoming economic data that will reflect the impact of US tariffs.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned countries against entering into trade deals with the United States that could harm its own economic interests. This warning follows reports that the U.S. intends to pressure nations to reduce trade with China to avoid new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. China's Commerce Ministry insists that appeasement will not bring peace and that compromise will not be respected. Beijing has vowed to take reciprocal countermeasures against any nation acting at the expense of China's interests, amid escalating trade tensions between the two global powers.</p>

            <p>A recent survey indicates that China's job market for PhD graduates, particularly in postdoctoral positions, is significantly more favorable than in the United States. The study found that the supply of postdoctoral positions at Chinese universities far exceeds the number of young researchers seeking employment. This contrasts with the US, where research funding cuts have led some high-profile Chinese scientists to return to China. The report highlights a substantial gap between vacancies and demand among postdocs in China, suggesting ample opportunities for young researchers.</p>

While Gatwick officials acknowledge the impact of ATC issues and have plans to improve on-time performance, the airport remains the busiest single-runway airport globally. Belfast City Airport recorded the best punctuality in the UK, while other major airports like Birmingham and Manchester also faced significant delays.</p>

            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, is expected to plead guilty in state court to avoid the death penalty. Crusius, who targeted Hispanics in the attack, has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges. The decision to forgo the death penalty was influenced by the majority of victims' relatives who desire closure. The plea arrangement will allow families to provide victim impact statements, reflecting on the devastating impact of the shooting.</p>

            <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to exchange Venezuelan deportees held in Salvadoran prisons for political prisoners in Venezuela. Bukele directed his proposal to President Nicolás Maduro, listing family members of opposition figures and activists detained during Venezuela's electoral crackdown. The proposal comes as El Salvador faces international scrutiny for detaining Venezuelans and Salvadorans deported by the U.S., with critics arguing that the country is becoming an "international prison." Venezuela's prosecutor's office responded critically, calling Bukele's statements "cynical."</p>

            <p>A federal program providing rental assistance to approximately 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence is facing a severe funding shortage. The Emergency Housing Vouchers program, launched in 2021, is expected to run out of money by the end of next year due to rising rental costs. This could result in a significant loss of rental assistance and subsequent evictions, potentially pushing vulnerable individuals back onto the streets or into abusive situations. The program's future depends on Congress allocating additional funds, but the prospects for such funding are uncertain.</p>

This opportunity arises from the trade war between the U.S. and China, which has led to uncertainty regarding Boeing's delivery slots.
