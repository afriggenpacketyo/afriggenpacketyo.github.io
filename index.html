          <h2>US and Japan Announce Major Trade Agreement with Reduced Auto Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 03:14:34 EDT</div>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unveiled a major trade agreement with Japan, proclaiming it as possibly the "largest Deal ever made" and a significant win for American jobs. The deal centers on a new reciprocal 15% tariff structure, which notably lowers the duty on Japanese auto imports from the previous 25%, a move confirmed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. For Japan, whose economy heavily relies on auto exports to the U.S., this development provided significant relief, sparking a major rally in automaker stocks on the Tokyo market. The agreement also reportedly includes a massive $550 billion Japanese investment into the United States and opens Japan's market to more American goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Djelika "Mami" Tounkara, a 21-year-old basketball player from Mali, is continuing her fight for justice after facing retaliation for reporting sexual advances from her former coach in 2021. Despite her actions leading to the coach's arrest for charges including attempted sexual assault, she was dropped from the national team and has received death threats. Her case has been mired in legal complexities, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport recently ruling it lacks jurisdiction, sending it back to FIBA's Ethics Panel. Tounkara and her advocates express deep disappointment with the lack of support and protection from basketball's governing bodies, highlighting systemic failures.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man, Terrance Lamar Bowie, has been charged with second-degree murder in Shelby Township, Michigan, following a suspicious incident. The investigation began when police responded to a welfare check after a man called 911 requesting help and then immediately hung up. Upon arrival, officers were met by Bowie, who allegedly told them there was a dead body inside the apartment. Police then discovered a deceased 27-year-old woman, whom Bowie knew, with evidence at the scene indicating a homicide. Bowie was arraigned and his bond has been set at $2 million.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's new £60m signing, Martin Zubimendi, is set to make his first public appearance for the club after a year-long transfer pursuit by manager Mikel Arteta. The Spanish international, a key player in Spain's Euro 2024 victory, revealed he turned down other offers last summer because he felt it wasn't the right time to leave Real Sociedad. Arteta expressed his excitement, confirming Zubimendi was signed specifically for the number six position to bring balance and impressive tactical intelligence to the midfield. Zubimendi stated that Arteta's meticulous coaching style was a major factor in his decision to join the London club.</p>

          <p>Amidst a backdrop of frequent demonstrations in the U.S., from the Women's March to racial justice uprisings, questions are emerging about the tangible impact of such protests. A new book, "A Protest History of the United States" by Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, examines centuries of American resistance to understand which forms of protest have historically led to lasting change. The analysis seeks to provide lessons from the past for contemporary movements. In conjunction, journalists covering recent events are also evaluating what constitutes a successful outcome or a "win" for modern protesters in today's political landscape.</p>

          <p>A new report from AI firm Anthropic suggests that China is significantly outpacing the United States in the race for artificial intelligence dominance, largely due to energy infrastructure. The report highlights that China added 400 gigawatts of power capacity last year, approximately ten times more than the U.S. This disparity is particularly concerning as the American AI sector alone is projected to require at least 50 gigawatts of power by 2028. The findings underscore how national energy capacity is becoming a critical and potentially limiting factor in the global competition for technological supremacy in AI.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a controversial bill that critics argue severely weakens the independence of the country's key anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO. The new law places these agencies under the control of the prosecutor general, a Zelensky loyalist, sparking the largest anti-government protests since the 2022 invasion. Western allies, including the EU and G7, have expressed serious concern, as a robust and independent anti-corruption framework is a critical condition for financial aid and Ukraine's potential EU membership. Zelensky defended the move, citing a need to clear the agencies of alleged "Russian influence" and improve their efficiency.</p>

After being dismissed from the band in 1979 due to substance abuse, he launched a highly successful solo career and later found a new generation of fans through the reality TV show "The Osbournes." Despite a life marked by extreme behavior and health struggles, including a recent Parkinson's diagnosis, he continued to record music, leaving an indelible mark on rock history.</p>

In the sixth and seventh innings, Dodgers relievers issued a series of walks and committed a glaring fielding error that allowed the Twins to score six runs on just two hits. Manager Dave Roberts described the performance as a "tough watch" and a potential "rock bottom" for the team, which has now lost 11 of its last 14 games. The struggles highlight the team's current pitching vulnerabilities, which are exacerbated by key injuries to veteran relief pitchers.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams has made a triumphant return to the sport, becoming the second-oldest woman in the professional era to win a tour-level singles match at 45 years old. In her first singles match in over a year, Williams defeated Peyton Stearns 6-3, 6-4 at the DC Open, marking her first singles victory in nearly two years. The only older player to win a match was Martina Navratilova, who was 47 in 2004. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, showcased glimpses of her classic power and skill after a long layoff for surgery, delighting the supportive crowd.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian officials are scheduled to hold a third round of talks in Istanbul, though expectations for a major breakthrough remain low, with the focus likely on prisoner swaps. Meanwhile, the US Energy Secretary stated that sanctioning Russian oil is a "very real possibility" to pressure Moscow, following President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs. In a separate development, thousands protested in Kyiv after President Zelensky signed a bill that critics, including EU officials, say weakens the country's independent anti-corruption agencies. China has also formally objected to recent EU sanctions placed on two of its banks over their dealings with Russia.</p>

          <p>The families of the four murdered University of Idaho students are expected to deliver victim impact statements directly to their killer, Bryan Kohberger, at his sentencing hearing. Kohberger, a 30-year-old former criminology Ph.D. student, recently pleaded guilty to the November 2022 killings of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin. The plea deal allows him to avoid the death penalty in exchange for waiving his right to appeal, with an expected sentence of four consecutive life terms without parole. While the deal provides closure for some families by avoiding a traumatic trial, others have expressed a desire for Kohberger to explain his motive.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has begun issuing severe disciplinary actions, including multi-year suspensions and expulsions, to dozens of students involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests last spring. The punishments stem from an investigation into the seizure of a campus library and the establishment of encampments, which the university stated were violations of its policies. A student group reported that around 80 students have been notified of their punishment. The move comes as Columbia, an epicenter of the nationwide campus protests, attempts to restore federal funding that was cut after the Trump administration accused the school of failing to address alleged antisemitism.</p>

The Emmy-winning actor described Trump as a "snake oil salesman" and lamented the current political climate, suggesting the country has lost decency.

          <p>Scientists have discovered evidence of a prehistoric battle between two apex predators from 13 million years ago. An analysis of teeth marks on the fossilized leg bone of a "terror bird," a large, flightless predator, suggests it was attacked and likely killed by a giant caiman, a crocodile-like reptile. Palaeontologists in Colombia used 3D scans to match the puncture marks to the extinct caiman species *Purussaurus neivensis*, which could grow up to five meters long. The fossil, found in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert, provides rare insight into the ancient ecosystem, revealing that even the formidable terror birds were vulnerable to ambush from other powerful predators.</p>

However, just hours later, the Trump administration's Justice Department ousted Grace, accusing the "rogue judges" of overstepping their authority.
