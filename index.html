          <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned that stablecoins may only have a minor role in the future monetary system due to lacking key characteristics of traditional currencies. The BIS suggests that stablecoins, cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currencies, could become the preferred choice for illicit activities due to their pseudonymity and lack of issuer oversight. Instead, the BIS proposes a unified platform that tokenizes central bank reserves, commercial bank deposits, and government bonds as the foundation for the next-generation monetary and financial system. The BIS emphasized that stablecoins circulate without issuer oversight, making them susceptible to misuse and bypassing integrity safeguards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, potentially ending nearly two weeks of escalating conflict. According to Trump, the agreement involves two 12-hour ceasefire periods, beginning with Iran and followed by Israel, after which the war would be officially declared over. However, neither Israeli nor Iranian officials immediately commented on the proposal. In the hours leading up to the proposed ceasefire, Israel reported that Iran launched a barrage of missiles, resulting in casualties, while Iran's foreign minister denied the existence of a ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the global oil supply, leading to volatility in energy prices. Although Iran's parliament approved cutting off the Strait of Hormuz, experts speculate that such a closure is unlikely due to the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital commercial waterway through which approximately 20% of the world's daily oil supply passes. While a limited disruption could cause initial price spikes, analysts believe that prices would dissipate if the conflict remains contained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, surpassing the current NATO target. The commitment aims to divide spending between core defense (3.5%) and defense-related areas like resilience and security (1.5%). This initiative seeks to appease US President Donald Trump's calls for increased defense spending while offering EU countries flexibility in meeting the target. Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel criticized the announcement, arguing that the government should increase funding sooner due to the current geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Americans consume plenty of text, but deep reading, or sustained engagement with longform text, is in decline. Deep reading activates a wide array of the brain’s linguistic and cognitive capacities, according to neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf. Some analysts suggest that digital media’s displacement of books is propelling humanity back to an ancient mode of cognition and communication. These theorists argue that print media laid the foundations for liberal democracy, and as deep reading declines, the electorate’s commitment to pluralism, objectivity, universalism, individual rights, and the rule of law is swiftly receding.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in disgrace amid sexual harassment allegations, is attempting a political comeback by running for mayor of New York City. Despite his lead in early polls, Cuomo faces a strong challenge from Zohran Mamdani, a progressive state representative. Cuomo's campaign is heavily funded by wealthy backers, including billionaires typically known for donating to Republicans. His rivals have criticized his past conduct and associations, while Cuomo focuses on his record and pledges to address crime and affordable housing.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates saw a slight dip today, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.67% and the 15-year fixed rate at 5.88%, according to Zillow. Economists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2025. With a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in from day one. The trajectory of future mortgage rates will largely depend on the Federal Reserve’s decision on whether or not to cut the federal funds rate at its 2025 meetings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Veterans’ advocates are voicing concerns about low morale among National Guard members and Marines deployed to Los Angeles due to protests against immigration raids. Some troops reportedly question the legality of the deployment and worry about its political nature. Advocates fear the deployment's impact on military retention and recruitment. They state that troops feel they did not sign up to police their own neighbors, and the situation is causing distress among military families. Despite the military's assessment of positive morale, concerns persist about the well-being of deployed soldiers.</p>
