          <p>Three SpaceX employees were elected without opposition to govern Starbase, Texas, a company town encompassing SpaceX's launch facility. The city, now a Type C city in Texas, includes a 1.6 square-mile area owned by SpaceX. Bobby Peden, a SpaceX VP, will serve as mayor, with Jenna Petrzelka and Jordan Buss as commissioners. SpaceX has faced regulatory scrutiny and fines for environmental violations in the area, and environmental groups have sued over the company's launch activities, however Starbase officials claim becoming a city will help improve the community for those working to build the future of space exploration.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has announced that it expects the Trump administration’s tariff policies to reduce its 2025 profit by approximately $1.5 billion and has suspended its financial guidance for the year. The company cited uncertainty related to shifting tariff policies, potential disruptions to automotive supply chains, and possible retaliatory tariffs. Ford's profit in the first three months of the year fell to $471 million, down from $1.3 billion in the same period last year, due to lower vehicle sales and production pauses. The company's revenue declined by 5 percent to $40.7 billion.</p>

          <p>Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to communicate strategic information to the super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. This practice, known as red-boxing, involves posting strategic information in a public location for big money groups to see, circumventing rules prohibiting direct communication. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned campaigns about the new rules targeting red-boxing, and a Cuomo opponent has requested an investigation into potential coordination.</p>

Experts explain that RBOB excludes taxes, transportation costs, and other fees, making it irrelevant to consumers.

          <p>The Trump administration is continuing the U.S. government's defense of rules easing access to the abortion drug mifepristone, a case that began during the Biden administration. The Department of Justice filed a brief urging a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by three Republican-led states on procedural grounds. Trump stated during his campaign that he did not plan to ban or restrict access to mifepristone, and his health and human services secretary has requested a study on the safety of abortion pills.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is calling for a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport. The disruptions have been caused by a shortage of air traffic controllers and equipment outages, Schumer said the FAA is "a mess" and pointed to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, old technology, and depleted federal funds. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark due to the disruptions.</p>
