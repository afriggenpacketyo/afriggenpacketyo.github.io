          <p>The UK government is exploring stricter online safety measures, including potential time limits on social media use for children, with proposals suggesting a two-hour cap on individual apps and a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited concerns about the addictive nature of apps and smartphones, while online safety campaigners like Ian Russell, whose daughter died after viewing harmful content, urge for stronger legislation to protect children. Current parental controls offered by Apple and Google, as well as TikTok's default 60-minute limit for users under 18, have seen low adoption rates. The government aims to define a healthy online life for children and remove barriers to achieving it. Optimism is tempered by the challenges of enforcement and potential circumvention of these limits, but the intention to safeguard young users is evident.</p>

          <p>President Trump has activated 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles to address violent clashes between protesters and authorities following ICE operations. The deployment comes amid escalating tensions, with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth threatening to send active-duty Marines if the violence persists. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory, asserting that local authorities can manage the situation. The protests erupted after ICE agents detained over 40 people allegedly violating immigration laws, leading to demonstrations and clashes with police, including reports of tear gas and property damage. House Speaker Mike Johnson supports Trump's decision, emphasizing the president's authority to maintain order.</p>

          <p>ABC News suspended Terry Moran, a veteran correspondent, after he posted a critical tweet about President Trump and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. Moran described Miller as a "world-class hater" and Trump as motivated by self-glorification, leading to accusations of violating the network's objectivity policy. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned the remarks, prompting ABC News to take swift action. This incident underscores the heightened sensitivity surrounding media coverage of the Trump administration, which has demonstrated a willingness to retaliate against critics. ABC News has faced previous legal challenges and scrutiny related to its coverage of Trump, contributing to a climate of caution within the network.</p>

          <p>A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck central Colombia, causing alarm among residents in cities like Bogota, Medellin, and Cali. The shallow quake, with a depth of 6.2 miles, was centered near Paratebueno, approximately 116 miles southeast of Bogota. The Colombian Geological Service reported additional tremors following the initial quake. While there were no immediate reports of casualties, authorities are assessing the situation in various municipalities, with images showing people evacuating buildings in Bogota.

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests has ignited controversy, with some praising his swift action and others fearing it will inflame tensions. Despite the LAPD's assessment that protests were largely peaceful, Trump administration officials cited targeting and injuries of immigration agents as justification for federal intervention. Over California Governor Gavin Newsom's objection, Trump federalized the National Guard, prompting concerns about states' rights and the potential for escalating the situation. While Trump declared victory, the deployment raises questions about the administration's intentions and its willingness to defer to local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common sources of conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contemptuous tones can signal deeper issues, while disagreements about family often stem from unmet needs and value clashes. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication patterns also contribute to friction. The psychologist suggests strategies such as naming the effect of condescension, reassuring partners of their importance, acknowledging the invisible load of domestic work, and using a designated phrase to signal the need for a time-out during heated conversations. Addressing these underlying issues can lead to healthier and more fulfilling relationships.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests marks a historic and aggressive use of executive power, raising concerns about states' rights and the proportionality of his actions.

The move is seen by some as a political ploy targeting a Democratic city in a Democratic state, intended to make a political statement.

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles amid immigration protests is seen as a tactic to redirect dissent from policy failures to an "enemy within." Critics view the move as an authoritarian flex aimed at crushing dissent and diverting attention from his administration's shortcomings. By militarizing the situation, Trump seeks to create a focal point for anger and fear, ensuring that opposition is directed away from the government. The action evokes parallels to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests and raises concerns about the potential for escalating tensions and undermining civil liberties.</p>
