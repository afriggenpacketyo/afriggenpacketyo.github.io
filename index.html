          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been eliminated from the US Open after a decisive 6-1, 6-2 loss to Elena Rybakina. Raducanu struggled against the ninth seed's powerful returns and groundstrokes, failing to gain any momentum throughout the 62-minute match. The 2021 champion acknowledged that Rybakina was superior in every aspect of the game, marking another instance where she has been outclassed by a top-10 opponent. This defeat serves as a reality check despite Raducanu's recent progress and return to form leading up to the tournament.</p>

          <p>Tesla has filed a motion to appeal a verdict holding it partially liable in a 2019 crash that resulted in the death of a 22-year-old woman and severe injuries to her boyfriend. The company is asking the court to either toss the $242.5 million judgment or grant a new trial, arguing the vehicle had no design defects. Tesla's lawyers claim the crash was caused entirely by driver error, as the driver was distracted while using the Enhanced Autopilot system. Plaintiffs' counsel maintains that the jury correctly found shared responsibility due to Tesla's misrepresentation of the system's capabilities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge heard arguments regarding President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position but did not issue an immediate ruling. Cook's lawsuit claims the firing is unlawful and a violation of the Federal Reserve Act, which only allows removal "for cause." Her lawyers argue the move is a politically motivated attack on the central bank's independence, based on unsubstantiated mortgage fraud allegations. The Justice Department defended the president's authority, asserting that courts cannot second-guess his judgment about what constitutes sufficient cause for removal.</p>

          <p>A growing number of multigenerational, high-end ranches are being listed for sale as heirs find themselves in disagreement over the properties' futures or lack interest in maintaining them. Brokers report a significant increase in inventory for these legacy properties, which are in high demand from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect. While some families sell due to financial pressures, others who purchased ranches as investments 20-30 years ago are now selling as their children have not developed ties to the properties, marking a significant transfer of wealth.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions for the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, signaling a strong start to the race weekend. Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso surprisingly split the two McLarens, finishing second-fastest, though he downplayed his team's chances of competing for a front-row start in qualifying. The sessions saw several incidents, including crashes by Aston Martin's Lance Stroll and Williams' Alex Albon. Teams are now preparing for Saturday's qualifying, where rain is expected to be a significant factor.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely lacked the authority to terminate the protections. The court noted that Congress designed the TPS system to be insulated from electoral politics. This decision provides continued permission for these individuals to live and work in the United States while the legal case proceeds.</p>

          <p>The era of inexpensive international online shopping for Americans is ending as the Trump administration has eliminated the 'de minimis' exemption for imported goods. This long-standing loophole allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without duties, a key factor in the business models of ultra-low-cost retailers like Shein and Temu. With the exemption gone, consumers will likely face higher prices, longer shipping times due to customs, or find that some international sellers no longer ship to the U.S. The change impacts a wide range of goods, from fast fashion to specialized hobbyist items.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's recurring use of the phrase "No one is above the law" to justify investigations into political opponents. It argues this represents a politicization of the Justice Department, contrasting it with the Biden administration, which prosecuted high-profile Democrats and even the president's son. The piece contends that the idea of using the law as a weapon against political rivals was introduced into modern American politics by Donald Trump himself during his 2016 campaign. The author concludes that Trump's own history of legal troubles is the primary reason he became the first ex-president to face criminal investigation.</p>

          <h2>Editorial Argues Federal Reserve's Independence Should Not Preclude Democratic Accountability</h2>

          <p>This editorial uses President Trump's attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook as a starting point to question the nature of central bank independence. The article argues that defending the Fed's autonomy is not synonymous with defending democracy, as the institution itself is not structured for broad public accountability and often favors business elites. Rather than replacing its current structure with a president's direct control, the piece calls for a deeper reflection on what a truly democratic central bank would look like, suggesting reforms such as broader board representation and a more explicit alignment with public priorities.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece by Jonathan Freedland presents a stark warning that the United States is rapidly moving toward authoritarianism under President Trump. The author cites a pattern of actions, including the deployment of troops to U.S. cities, using government agencies to target political opponents, and attacking the independence of the Federal Reserve. The column suggests that the public and international observers have become desensitized to these moves because of their brazenness. It argues that these actions collectively represent a fundamental threat to the principles of American democracy and the separation of powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose to a 2.9% annual rate in July, its highest level since February. The data, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, suggests that President Trump's tariffs may be contributing to rising prices in the U.S. economy. Despite the inflation figures being above the Fed's 2% target, financial markets still anticipate that the central bank will proceed with an interest rate cut at its next meeting, pending further labor market data.

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $679 million in federal funding for twelve infrastructure projects designed to support the development of offshore wind power. This move is the latest in a series of actions against the renewable energy sector. The largest project affected is the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind terminal in California, which lost about $427 million in support. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that the funds were for "wasteful" projects and will be redirected to other maritime industry needs, a decision that renewable energy executives warn will lead to higher power prices.</p>

          <p>This column analyzes the distinction between California Governor Gavin Newsom's use of the California Highway Patrol (CHP) in cities and President Trump's deployment of the National Guard. It argues that Newsom's approach is a targeted law enforcement strategy to supplement understaffed local police and address specific crime issues like auto theft. In contrast, the article portrays Trump's actions as a broader, more authoritarian show of force aimed at repression rather than nuanced public safety. The piece frames this as a fundamental difference between Democratic and MAGA approaches to crime.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial redistricting bill into law, redrawing the state's congressional map in a way that is expected to create up to five additional safe seats for the Republican party. The new map, which was passed along party lines after a walkout by state Democrats, followed a push from Donald Trump for the state to redraw its districts. The plan has drawn widespread condemnation from Democrats and civil rights organizations, who argue it is a partisan power grab that deliberately disenfranchises Black, Brown, and Asian American voters.</p>
