          <h2>Republicans Aim to Undermine Obamacare by Cutting Medicaid</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times reports that Republicans are attempting to undermine Obamacare by adding work requirements to Medicaid, potentially stripping millions of Americans of health insurance. This move is part of a broader effort to cut taxes for the wealthy. Evidence suggests that work requirements don't effectively increase employment, and the primary effect is to deprive eligible people of coverage. The bill would also reduce access to subsidized private insurance, leading to a significant increase in the number of uninsured Americans.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that a House-passed tax bill would repeal subsidies for electric vehicles, battery manufacturing, and charging stations, potentially slowing the adoption of EVs in the US. The measure would eliminate a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases and impose a new annual fee on EV owners. Analysts predict that the rollback would significantly hinder EV sales and production, putting the US behind China and Europe in the EV market.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that NATO allies are considering redefining defense spending to meet President Trump's demand for 5% of national income. The proposed plan involves spending 3.5% on traditional military items and 1.5% on non-traditional "defense-related" areas like infrastructure and technology. This approach reflects efforts to appease Trump while addressing European security needs. The proposal has sparked debate within NATO, with some members prioritizing traditional military spending.</p>
