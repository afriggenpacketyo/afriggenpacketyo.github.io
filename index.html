          <p>Protests continue in Los Angeles and other cities against federal immigration sweeps, leading to escalating tensions between President Trump and California Governor Newsom. Los Angeles Mayor Bass issued an overnight curfew for downtown LA following clashes between police and protesters. Trump deployed National Guard and Marines to LA against the wishes of Newsom and Bass, prompting a lawsuit from Newsom who claims the federal government unlawfully overstepped California's authority by federalizing the California National Guard. The situation remains tense as the protests continue. Optimism remains low given the conflict between the federal government and the state government.</p>

          <p>Chery Automobile, China's second-largest carmaker, intends to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong during the third quarter of this year. The company plans to use Hong Kong as a springboard to venture into the global market, according to Chairman Yin Tongyue. Chery hopes to establish more manufacturing, research and development, and data operations in Hong Kong. The IPO could potentially raise around US$1.5 billion without the involvement of Wall Street banks. This represents a significant step for Chery as it aims to become a global player in the automotive industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has maintained its position at 118th out of 148 countries in the 2025 gender gap report, the worst among G7 nations, according to the World Economic Forum. The report indicates slow progress in political empowerment, with few female government ministers and no female prime minister. While there was some improvement in women's economic participation, Japan still ranks poorly in female participation in management positions. The report estimates that it will take 123 years to reach full gender parity globally. The country's overall performance has slightly improved from last year, but the progress in narrowing the gender gap has been marginal since 2006.</p>

          <p>The United States is revitalizing its nuclear capabilities to power the growing demands of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and compete with China. A uranium enrichment facility has opened in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, aiming to secure a domestic supply of nuclear fuel. President Trump signed executive orders to quadruple domestic nuclear energy production by 2050. China plans to build 100 new nuclear power reactors by 2035. The U.S. aims to accelerate nuclear reactor construction to avoid falling behind in the AI race. The initiative highlights the importance of nuclear energy in powering AI and maintaining global competitiveness.</p>

He stated that it is clear there is a disagreement about the role of a vice chair and that he is stepping down to allow the party to focus on more pressing matters. DNC chair Ken Martin commended Hogg's activism and respected his decision to step back from his post. The DNC re-do election is still on track, but without Hogg on the ticket.</p>

          <p>The United States is set to partially evacuate its embassy in Iraq due to increased security risks amid rising tensions with Iran. Non-essential embassy staff and their dependents will be removed from Baghdad, according to US government sources. This decision follows reports that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, leading the US to advise some Americans to leave the region, anticipating potential retaliation against US sites in Iraq. Despite the evacuation, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still scheduled to meet with Iranian officials for talks. The partial evacuation reflects heightened concerns about regional stability.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a spending review that includes an additional £29 billion per year for the NHS in England, along with increased funding for defense and housing. The review also allocates more money for artificial intelligence and transport projects, aiming to "renew Britain." However, some departments, such as the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face cuts in day-to-day spending. The government hopes that increased spending in health and investment in longer-term projects will reassure voters after a challenging first year. Despite some budget cuts, Reeves insisted that this review is not a return to austerity policies. The spending review aims to balance economic growth with fiscal responsibility.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to inquiries about the specific operation, but the raids have triggered widespread protests and unrest in Los Angeles and other cities.

The astronomers described the star as being about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp, with a pure yellow color, smooth and bright. The record confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star, rather than a comet or meteor. The discovery was reported in The Astronomical Journal by researchers from China, Germany, and Chile. The details, including the star's size and brightness, helped the team narrow down the star's possible position.</p>

          <p>The United States has initiated a review of the multi-billion dollar Aukus submarine deal with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. The pact, aimed at countering China's growing power, involves Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines from the US and the allies sharing advanced technology. The review comes amid pressure from the US for Australia and the UK to increase military spending. While both Australia and the UK have downplayed the probe, the US's reassessment of the agreement raises questions about the future of the trilateral security pact. The review could lead to a shift in focus from submarines to other long-range weapons technology.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability rating among Republicans has dropped by 16 points since March, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number has decreased from 78% to 62%. The decline comes after a public falling out between Musk and President Trump over the president's spending bill. Despite the drop in favorability, Musk remains popular among Republicans, with 80% rating his work with the Department of Government Efficiency as either excellent or good. This indicates a shift in sentiment towards Musk within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>The United States may extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if negotiations continue "in good faith," according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

President Trump has been in talks with 18 important trading partners, including Japan, South Korea, and the European Union.

The leak preceded Israel's air strikes on Iran in October, which targeted military sites in response to earlier missile launches by Tehran.

The government aims to transform the public realm and economic potential through long-term investments, while limiting day-to-day spending. This approach represents a gamble on patience in an era of impatience, as it requires the electorate to wait for the benefits of these investments to materialize. The success of this strategy will depend on the government's ability to maintain public support and navigate volatile political conditions.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is positioning itself at the forefront of global finance with the passage of a comprehensive stablecoin law. The new law aims to address past industry setbacks and establish the city as a leader in the stablecoin market.

Combined with the city's vast offshore yuan holdings and China's restricted use of cryptocurrencies, the law has raised hopes that Hong Kong could secure a prominent spot in the stablecoin market, currently dominated by US dollar-backed tokens.

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, which they say "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86 million-year-old skeletons, found in Mongolia, represent the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. Khankhuuluu represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, weighing around 750kg. The species also exhibits early evolutionary stages of features that were key to the tyrannosaurs' dominance, including skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw. The discovery has helped revise the tyrannosaur family tree and rewrite what is known about the evolution of these dinosaurs.</p>
