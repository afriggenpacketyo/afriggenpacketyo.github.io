          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of online real estate company Opendoor following a campaign from investors critical of the company's performance. The move comes after the stock price surged recently, driven by interest from retail investors and hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, who had publicly called for her departure. Technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna will serve as interim leader while the company searches for a permanent replacement. Opendoor, which went public via a SPAC in 2020, has struggled with rising interest rates impacting its home-buying business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting at a joint military base in Alaska for high-stakes negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. The summit, which excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, focuses on establishing a ceasefire and addressing territorial disputes, with Russia currently controlling about 20% of Ukrainian land. The meeting follows a series of contentious interactions between Trump and Zelenskyy earlier in the year. Ahead of the talks, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated she would nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize if he could secure a just peace for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump greeted Russian President Vladimir Putin for their summit in Alaska with a significant display of American military power. The welcome included a flyover by a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and F-35 fighter jets, the same types of aircraft used in a recent strike on Iran's nuclear sites. The demonstration at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson appeared to be a deliberate show of force ahead of the critical talks regarding the war in Ukraine. Trump has recently praised the capabilities of the B-2 bomber, a key symbol of U.S. strategic air power.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted by a federal grand jury on corruption charges, making her the first mayor in the city's history to be federally charged while in office. The indictment alleges she used her position to foster a romantic relationship with her bodyguard at the city's expense, costing taxpayers over $70,000 for his travel. Cantrell and the bodyguard are also accused of conspiring to cover up their relationship, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from a federal investigation that began during the Biden administration and add to a turbulent second term for the term-limited mayor.</p>

          <p>A trend has emerged on the social media platform X where videos of sorority rush dances are reposted with captions claiming they provoke anger among liberals and leftists. However, an examination of the phenomenon reveals little to no actual evidence of this outrage, suggesting a manufactured culture-war narrative. Accounts, some of which are monetized through X's revenue-sharing program, appear to be farming engagement by framing the videos of happy, dancing young women as a trigger for political opponents. This manufactured controversy highlights how platforms can be used to create and amplify fake conflicts for clicks and profit.</p>

Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson argued that such a move is necessary to revitalize the struggling chipmaker and reduce American dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. The potential investment, possibly funded through the CHIPS Act, aims to bolster domestic high-end technology production.

This decision could clear the way for the administration to proceed with firing approximately 1,500 of the agency's 1,700 employees. The ruling, which was split between Trump-appointed judges and an Obama appointee, will not take immediate effect, allowing opponents time to seek a review.

Experts attribute the problem to a nationwide shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds and outpatient services for children.

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is reviving the Task Force on Safer Childhood Vaccines, a panel that was disbanded in 1998. The move, initiated by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., follows a lawsuit from the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, which Kennedy founded. The reinstated task force is charged with providing recommendations to improve the safety and quality of vaccines administered to children. This decision is part of a series of changes under Kennedy that scrutinize the U.S. childhood vaccination schedule, including replacing members of a key CDC advisory committee with vaccine skeptics.</p>

          <p>The common spice cloves, used for centuries in traditional medicine, may offer several health benefits according to scientific research. Studies suggest that the antibacterial properties of cloves can help control plaque and reduce the risk of gum disease. The active compound eugenol is also linked to the spice's ability to lower blood sugar levels, as seen in a 2019 study where participants taking clove extract showed improvement. Cloves are also a source of essential minerals like calcium and potassium and act as a natural antioxidant, which can help prevent cell damage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, it faces increasing concerns about its long-term financial stability. The program, which provides benefits to nearly 70 million Americans, is projected to see its trust funds depleted by 2034 due to outgoings outpacing income. Without congressional action, this could lead to an automatic 23% reduction in benefits for all recipients. The challenges are compounded by recent staffing cuts under the Trump administration, which critics argue have hampered the agency's ability to serve the public, further eroding confidence in the vital retirement and disability system.

          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has filed a lawsuit to challenge the Trump administration's recent takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department. The suit calls the action an "unlawful" and "hostile takeover" that infringes on the district's right to self-governance and asks for a temporary restraining order to block the move. The legal challenge comes after President Trump invoked a rarely used provision of the Home Rule Act to federalize the police force, and Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed a new commissioner to lead it. The White House defended the move as necessary to address a crime emergency, a claim D.C. officials dispute.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the first of the 2025 Atlantic season as it moves toward the Caribbean. The storm is bringing warnings of heavy rain, potential flooding, and landslides to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect Erin to continue strengthening over warm ocean waters, potentially becoming a major hurricane of Category 3 or higher by the weekend. While the current forecast track shows the storm curving northward and remaining offshore of the U.S. mainland, its long-range path is still being closely monitored.</p>

          <p>Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge has sharply criticized a lawsuit filed by the artist Drake, labeling it "groundless and indeed ridiculous." Drake is suing the company, which is the parent label for both him and rival Kendrick Lamar, alleging that UMG defamed him and damaged his career by promoting Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us." In a court declaration, Grainge stated that the accusation makes no sense given UMG's massive financial investment in Drake's career over the years. UMG's legal team further characterized the lawsuit's premise—that Drake only lost the rap battle due to a secret corporate conspiracy—as "absurd."</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from director Zach Cregger, centers on the mysterious disappearance of a third-grade class and the community's struggle to understand the senseless tragedy. The movie follows the parallel investigations of a grieving father and a teacher, ultimately revealing a supernatural villain behind the events. The article praises the film for providing a conclusive and cathartic ending where the villain is defeated, a choice that satisfies the audience. However, it also notes that the film subverts this satisfaction by emphasizing that vanquishing the evil does not undo the trauma it caused, making it a "feel-bad, feel-good movie of the year."</p>

In a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Hawley demanded the preservation of relevant documents for a probe into whether Meta's AI products enable child exploitation.

          <p>A new analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that the tax breaks from President Trump's recently enacted "big beautiful bill" will vary significantly by state. In 2026, the average individual taxpayer is projected to save $3,752, with residents in states like Wyoming, Washington, and Massachusetts seeing the largest benefits. The analysis also notes that some of the largest average tax cuts will be concentrated in high-income resort areas like Jackson Hole, Wyoming. A separate Congressional Budget Office report suggests the legislation could increase resources for top earners while reducing them for the lowest-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent statements about crime in Washington, D.C. finds his claims to be misleading. While D.C. did have a high murder rate in 2023 compared to U.S. states, it was not the highest among major cities, and Trump's statement omits the fact that crime has fallen significantly in 2025. According to the city's own police data, homicides have decreased by 32% and overall violent crime is down 26% from the previous year. This downward trend aligns with national FBI statistics showing a reduction in violent crime across the U.S., a nuance also noted by the AI bot on Trump's own Truth Social platform.</p>
