          <p>According to a report in The New York Times, the UK is poised to become the first nation to establish a trade agreement with the U.S. after President Trump hinted at a forthcoming announcement. While neither the White House nor the British Embassy responded to requests for confirmation, a UK Department for Business and Trade spokesperson affirmed ongoing discussions with the U.S., emphasizing the aim to alleviate pressures on UK businesses and consumers. The nature of the potential agreement remains unclear, with possibilities ranging from a finalized deal to a framework for future negotiations. The optimism score is based on the potential for economic cooperation between the two countries.</p>

          <p>South Korea and Japan reported that North Korea launched multiple ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, marking Pyongyang's first such action in nearly two months. The missiles, fired from the Wonsan area, traveled approximately 800 km, and Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani stated that one missile reached an altitude of about 100 km with a potentially irregular trajectory. No damage to ships or planes has been reported, but Tokyo has lodged a stern protest with Pyongyang, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi condemned the launches as a threat to peace. This event occurs amidst military cooperation between North Korea and Russia and ahead of South Korea's upcoming presidential election.</p>

          <p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) has revealed a takeover bid of 2.37 trillion yen to acquire the remaining shares of NTT Data Group Corp., aiming to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary. This strategic move is intended to enhance the competitiveness of NTT's overseas businesses, which are primarily managed by NTT Data. NTT, which already holds approximately 58 percent of NTT Data Group shares, will purchase the remaining stock through a tender offer, subsequently delisting the unit from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The reorganization aims to streamline operations and bolster NTT's global presence in the telecommunications sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rapid analysis by climate scientists indicates that the severe storms that caused significant death and destruction across the central Mississippi valley in early April were exacerbated by the burning of fossil fuels. The study found that rainfall was approximately 9% more intense and 40% more likely due to human-caused climate change, with warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico playing a crucial role in fueling the storm's moisture. The report also highlights the potential for even worse conditions in the future if the transition to renewable energy sources does not accelerate, and it emphasizes the importance of well-resourced forecasting services like the National Weather Service.</p>

          <p>A study by researchers from the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) suggests that China's hypersonic weapons can travel at extreme speeds and potentially be launched from space. The analysis reveals that these re-entry glide missiles can reach speeds of up to Mach 20, enabling them to strike global targets within half an hour. Certain variants may be launched from space-based platforms, significantly reducing adversary response time. The disclosure corroborates earlier reports from the U.S. that were initially dismissed, indicating advancements in China's hypersonic weapons technology.</p>

          <p>A study from World Weather Attribution reveals that the deadly storms that impacted eight U.S. states in early April were made significantly worse by climate change. Researchers determined that human-caused global warming increased the intensity of record-breaking rainfall by about 9%, with unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, made 14 times more likely by climate change, contributing to the storm's power. The report also expresses concern about the impact of ongoing staff shortages at the National Weather Service and highlights the increasing strain on insurance markets due to more frequent and severe weather events.</p>

          <p>Shipping giant Maersk has revised its global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4% due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, despite posting stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit.

Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc cited trade tensions and rising uncertainty as factors impacting global supply chains, as the shipping industry navigates a complex tariff landscape influenced by U.S. policies.

The 25 percent tariff on vehicle imports into the United States, implemented early last month, was extended to auto parts last week.

          <p>Minutes from a Bank of Japan (BOJ) meeting in March revealed that a policymaker warned of a "significant negative impact" from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on the Japanese economy. The member suggested that the central bank would need to be particularly cautious about raising the policy interest rate if conditions worsened. This concern reflects the potential economic strain caused by U.S. trade policies and the BOJ's considerations in maintaining its monetary policy. The minutes offer insight into the BOJ's internal discussions and its assessment of global economic risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling suggests that Nigel Farage's opposition to net zero policies resonates with voters who prioritize cutting the cost of living over climate action. A survey by Merlin Strategy revealed that nearly 60% of voters favor reducing living costs, while only 13% prioritize achieving net zero. This outcome indicates that voters may not genuinely believe in the urgency of net zero, as they would otherwise prioritize it above all other issues. The situation is likened to Labour's experience during the Jeremy Corbyn years, where popular policies failed to translate into electoral success due to voters' greater priorities.</p>

          <p>The use of AI to resurrect the dead raises ethical and legal concerns, as demonstrated by the case of Christopher Pelkey, whose AI avatar testified at his murderer's sentencing hearing. While Pelkey's sister created the avatar out of love, the emotional impact it had on the judge highlights the potential for AI to manipulate emotions, even when its artificial nature is known. The increasing availability of digital "deadbots" for grieving relatives and the commercialization of deceased figures like Agatha Christie raise questions about the dignity of the deceased and the lack of laws to protect them from exploitation. The article argues that grief is a natural process that should not be short-circuited by artificial resurrections.</p>

This threat is particularly alarming in Britain, where Hollywood blockbusters are a critical part of the industry. The British industry is still recovering from disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and then the 2023 actors’ and screenwriters’ strikes in the United States, and the concern is that uncertainty about tariffs could wipe out that progress.
