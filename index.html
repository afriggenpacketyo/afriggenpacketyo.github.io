          <p>Over 3,000 Boeing defense workers in Missouri and Illinois have initiated a strike after overwhelmingly rejecting the company's latest contract offer, which included a 40% average wage growth but failed to address key union concerns on work schedules and pensions. This marks the first walkout at Boeing's defense business since 1996 and compounds recent challenges for the aviation giant, including prior safety incidents and a significant passenger jet worker strike last year. While union officials emphasize the need for a contract that acknowledges workers' skills and dedication, Boeing stated it is prepared with a contingency plan, downplaying the strike's broader impact on its operations. The dispute affects the production of F-15 fighter jets and MQ-25 aerial refueling drones.</p>

          <p>Texas Democratic state legislators have fled to Chicago, initiating a quorum break to prevent Republicans from passing a new congressional map designed to heavily favor the GOP and potentially secure more U.S. House seats. Democrats argue this action is crucial to stop a "Trump gerrymander" and protest the Republican leadership's alleged prioritization of redistricting over disaster relief for recent floods. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened severe consequences for the absent lawmakers, including removal from the Texas House, while the Democratic National Committee has expressed support for their stand. This tactic, though not new in Texas politics, highlights deep partisan divisions over electoral fairness and legislative priorities.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident off Yemen's Abyan province resulted in the deaths of at least 68 migrants, mostly Ethiopian nationals, after their boat carrying approximately 157 people capsized in adverse weather conditions. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported 12 survivors, but many remain unaccounted for, underscoring the extreme perils faced by individuals using this route to reach Gulf states in search of employment. The IOM reiterated its call for strengthening legal migration pathways to combat human smuggling and prevent such devastating losses. This event is part of a broader pattern of hundreds of migrant deaths and disappearances in shipwrecks along this perilous route in recent months.</p>

          <p>A man in his 40s tragically died after sustaining injuries from a fall at an Oasis concert held at Wembley Stadium in London. Emergency services responded, but the individual was pronounced dead at the scene. The band Oasis conveyed their profound shock and sorrow over the incident, offering sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased. Metropolitan Police are actively seeking witnesses or any mobile phone footage that might shed light on the event, which occurred during one of the band's sold-out reunion concerts. Authorities believe many people may have witnessed the fall and are urged to come forward. The investigation is slated to be transferred to the Health and Safety Executive for further inquiry.</p>

The 40-year-old battled through 11 operations and gangrene on his Achilles, enduring 636 days out, with his family's encouragement crucial to his comeback despite doctors' doubts about him ever playing again. Cazorla, who even bought shares in Oviedo during financial hardship and plays for a minimum wage with academy donations, expresses humility about his legacy, prioritizing being remembered as a good person over a superstar.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, BYD, recorded its first monthly delivery decline this year in July, shipping 341,030 units, a notable drop from June's figures. This downturn is attributed to an intensifying EV price war across China, which has seen numerous automakers, including BYD, implement significant discounts to attract consumers. While some competitors like Xpeng, Xiaomi, and Leapmotor reported robust growth, the overall market is experiencing reshaped competition, prompting warnings from Beijing policymakers about excessive price competition. The dynamic landscape highlights the challenges and opportunities within China's rapidly evolving EV sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singaporean billionaire hotelier Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to charges related to a prominent corruption scandal, admitting to abetting former transportation minister Subramaniam Iswaran in obstructing justice. Ong confessed to belatedly invoicing Iswaran for an all-expenses-paid trip, including a private jet flight, after Iswaran learned of an ongoing police investigation into his associates. Due to Ong's severe health condition, a rare bone marrow cancer, both the prosecution and defense have proposed a fine instead of a custodial sentence, citing judicial mercy. This case underscores Singapore's commitment to combating corruption, following Iswaran's prior sentencing for accepting substantial gifts.</p>

New player signings such as Omar Marmoush, Rayan Cherki, Tijjani Reijnders, and attacking full-back Rayan Ait-Nouri further reinforce this strategic pivot, emphasizing ball-carrying and vertical attacks.

Buchman was participating in a summer sailing camp when her vessel collided with a large barge, an incident that had already claimed the lives of Mila Yankelevich, 7, and Erin Ko Han, 13. The devastating event, which also critically injured an eighth-year-old girl who has since been released from the hospital, has profoundly impacted the entire sailing community. The U.S. Coast Guard is conducting a comprehensive investigation into the crash, with international collaboration, to ascertain the circumstances and prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly expressed his approval for actress Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle ad campaign, declaring it "fantastic" after learning she is a registered Republican. Sweeney's voter registration became public amidst a wave of backlash concerning the advertisement, which some critics controversially linked to "eugenics-era" slogans due to its tagline "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Genes." Conversely, supporters lauded the campaign for pushing back against "woke" advertising. Trump's remarks exemplify the increasing politicization of celebrity endorsements and public perception, with Vice President JD Vance also commenting on the left's response to the controversy.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly pressing for an expanded military operation in Gaza to achieve a "military solution" for the release of an estimated 20 remaining hostages held by Hamas. This strategy stems from a growing conviction within Israeli circles that Hamas is unwilling to negotiate a diplomatic deal. The push for military action is highly contentious, as thousands of Israeli protesters are simultaneously demanding an end to the conflict and the immediate return of the captives, particularly after a recent video depicted a severely emaciated hostage. International concerns are also escalating over the critical hunger crisis and reported malnutrition deaths in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent and BeOne are on track to achieve profitability in 2025, signaling a significant maturation and value creation milestone for the burgeoning Chinese biotech sector. Innovent, an early beneficiary of Hong Kong's listing regime for pre-profit drug developers, is forecasted to report a net profit of 472 million yuan for the year. This anticipated financial success is largely underpinned by the strong market reception and projected sales of its newly launched weight loss drug, mazdutide, which is expected to be a major revenue contributor. This trend highlights the increasing self-sufficiency of Chinese biotechs, reducing their reliance on investor funding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A violent prison riot at the Taxpan facility in Veracruz, Mexico, has resulted in the tragic deaths of seven inmates and injuries to eleven others, with social media videos depicting fires and plumes of smoke emanating from the prison grounds. The unrest reportedly began on Saturday, fueled by inmates' anger over alleged extortion and abuse perpetrated by the Grupo Sombra criminal organization within the prison. This incident underscores critical, long-standing issues plaguing Mexican prisons, including severe overcrowding, widespread corruption, and significant control exerted by powerful gangs or drug cartels. The Taxpan prison, for instance, held 778 inmates in June, exceeding its designed capacity.</p>

          <p>Leveraging insights from the Ukraine war, Chinese aerospace engineers and defense researchers have put forth a groundbreaking technological upgrade for combat drones, aiming to elevate their survival rate against missile attacks to nearly 90%. The core of their innovative proposal involves integrating compact, side-mounted rocket boosters onto small and medium-sized drones. This would enable the drones to execute instantaneous, high-G evasive maneuvers in the critical final seconds before an incoming missile strike. Digital simulations, detailed in a Chinese defense journal, indicate that this "terminal evasion" system could allow drones to perform unpredictable course changes, effectively evading even highly sophisticated missiles.</p>

Originating in China, these online groups incentivize new members to commit and upload acts of cruelty to gain broader access to content.

          <p>A new conservation mission has been launched to protect the endangered Polymita tree snails, widely considered the "world's most beautiful" due to their exceptionally vibrant and intricately patterned shells.

Biologists from Cuba and the University of Nottingham in the UK are collaborating to study the snails' evolution and genetic makeup, undertaking challenging captive breeding initiatives despite logistical hurdles like power outages. The project aims to gather vital data to inform effective conservation strategies, highlighting the paradox where the snails' beauty is also their greatest vulnerability.</p>
