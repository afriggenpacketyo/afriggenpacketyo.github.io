            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 El Paso Walmart shooting that killed 23 people, is expected to plead guilty to capital murder charges, averting the death penalty in the state case. This plea follows his previous federal conviction on hate crime and weapons charges, for which he received 90 consecutive life sentences. The plea deal was offered by the El Paso County District Attorney to expedite the case and provide closure for the victims' families, some of whom expressed a desire to avoid a lengthy trial. The shooting, motivated by Crusius's racist views against Hispanics, deeply impacted the El Paso community and highlighted the issue of hate-motivated violence. Optimism score: 15</p>

            <p>An article discusses the rise in popularity of snail slime in beauty products, highlighting ethical concerns about the treatment of snails and the lack of solid evidence supporting the products' effectiveness.

            <p>An opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's political bullying of Harvard University, through demands for reorganizing governance and hiring practices to ensure "viewpoint diversity," is a flawed approach. The author contends that Trump's demands are a form of social engineering and undermine the principle of hiring based on qualifications, advocating for affirmative action for conservatives while simultaneously opposing diversity policies. The piece explores the complexities of achieving viewpoint diversity and cautions against institutionalizing political identities. Ultimately, the author suggests that fostering a richer culture of debate requires rethinking social and political engagement rather than imposing state mandates. Optimism score: 60</p>
