          <p>A tragic collision between a barge and a small sailboat on Biscayne Bay near Miami Beach has resulted in the deaths of two children, a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old. The incident, which occurred during a summer camp sailing program, also left two other children in critical condition. All six occupants of the sailboat, including five children and an adult counselor, were thrown into the water when their vessel was struck and submerged. An investigation into the cause of the crash is currently underway, with a safety zone established around the submerged wreckage.</p>

          <p>Preparations are underway to refit a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, an "unconditional donation" from Qatar, for use as Air Force One. The memorandum of understanding outlines the gift to the U.S. Defense Department, though it has raised constitutional questions about a president accepting gifts from foreign states. The Pentagon will be responsible for the substantial costs of upgrading the aircraft's security features, with funds expected to be diverted from the Sentinel nuclear missile program. Critics have called for an investigation into the arrangement, which President Trump has defended as a "very nice gesture."</p>

          <p>In a landmark case, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been convicted of bribing witnesses, marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been found guilty in a criminal court. The Bogota court found that Uribe, who led the nation from 2002 to 2010, attempted to persuade a jailed ex-paramilitary not to testify about his alleged connections to right-wing paramilitary groups. The highly politicized case could result in a prison sentence of up to 12 years for Uribe, who remains a divisive and influential conservative figure in Colombia.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a threatened 30% tariff imposition by the Trump administration. The deal establishes a new 15% tariff rate on many EU imports and includes provisions for tariff-free trade on certain products like aircraft and some generic drugs. As part of the agreement, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy over the next three years. However, the legality of the tariffs remains under judicial review, with a case expected to reach the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggests implementing a tax on large online retailers like Amazon to fund community renewal projects. The proposal comes a year after riots in Southport, which the report argues were fueled by local disrepair and a loss of shared community spaces. The proposed "21st-century welfare fund" would be generated by higher levies on warehouses or online sales taxes, aiming to make wealthy online firms contribute more to the communities they operate in.

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's perspectives and policy decisions, including his recent statements on starvation in Gaza, are primarily shaped by what he consumes on television. This reliance on TV news, rather than intelligence briefings or expert advice, makes him highly attuned to public opinion but also susceptible to manipulation and misinformation. The piece contends that this approach narrows his understanding of complex issues and has dangerous implications for governance, especially in an era of deepfakes and curated media narratives. His tendency to trust what he sees on screen over official sources is presented as a defining characteristic of his presidency.</p>

While it didn't set new legal precedent, the verdict served as a powerful reminder of the limits of First Amendment protections, particularly concerning the publication of graphic, private material. The case underscored that even for public figures, there is a right to privacy that can trump newsworthiness, a significant consideration in the internet age.</p>

          <p>A new report from real estate brokerage Redfin estimates that the Palisades wildfire in January caused approximately $51.7 billion in damage to residential properties within the city of Los Angeles. The analysis focused on roughly 11,000 homes, many of which were destroyed in the 23,000-acre blaze that ravaged wealthy neighborhoods like Pacific Palisades. The fire was one of the most destructive and deadly in California's history, forcing over 30,000 residents to evacuate. This figure does not include damage to commercial properties or public infrastructure, suggesting the total economic loss is even higher.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assertion that "there is no starvation in Gaza," stating that images of emaciated children appear to show "real starvation stuff." This divergence comes amid growing international pressure on Israel over the dire humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory. In response to the outcry, Israel has initiated daily pauses in fighting to allow more aid, but humanitarian groups and some Israeli rights organizations argue the situation is catastrophic, with one group labeling it a genocide. Trump stated the U.S. would increase efforts to get food into the region.</p>

          <p>An inquest has revealed that a 23-year-old Cambridge graduate with non-Hodgkin lymphoma died after refusing chemotherapy, having told a court she was "anti-vax." Paloma Shemirani, whose mother is a prominent struck-off nurse known for sharing conspiracy theories, opted for an alternative Gerson therapy diet instead. The young woman had denied her cancer diagnosis and expressed fears that chemotherapy could cause infertility, likening the actions of NHS practitioners to Nazi experiments. The inquest is examining the appropriateness of her care and the influence of her mother's beliefs on her medical decisions.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become a Category 1 hurricane, the first of the 2025 season to form in the central Pacific Ocean. According to the National Hurricane Center, Iona is currently located several hundred miles south-southeast of Honolulu and is not considered an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands. The storm is forecast to strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane as it moves westward over the next couple of days before gradually weakening later in the week. Forecasters express high confidence that the hurricane's path will remain well south of Hawaii.</p>

The family of six, who have a British relative, has been living in a tent in central Gaza at "constant risk of injury or death." While the government is not legally required to assist them, the judge found the situation to be legally exceptional. The Foreign Office had previously refused to help because its policy is limited to cases involving spouses or parents and children separated by the war.</p>

The deal imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S. but averts the 30% rate President Trump had threatened. While many capitals acknowledged it was better than an all-out trade war, there was little celebration for what is widely seen as an uneven agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

This move is seen by some as a sign of growing speculative frenzy in the crypto market, as more public companies look to leverage digital assets to potentially increase shareholder value.

The author contends that claims made by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard about "irrefutable evidence" are a dishonest attempt to shift public attention. The article asserts that the conclusion of Russian interference to help Trump was well-founded and supported by a bipartisan Senate committee.
