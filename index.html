British artists are hoping to replicate the success of their American counterparts, aiming for recognition at awards shows.

            <p>Demonstrations against President Trump's administration took place across the United States, with protesters decrying perceived threats to democratic principles.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court issued a temporary block on the deportation of Venezuelans held in a Texas detention center under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU filed an emergency appeal, arguing that immigration authorities were preparing to resume deportations under the wartime law without allowing detainees to contest their cases in court. The White House defended the actions, claiming the detainees were "foreign terrorists," but the Supreme Court's order ensures they have a chance to argue against their removal.</p>

The FAIR Plan has become overwhelmed as insurers cancel policies in fire-risk zones, leading to increased premiums for homeowners statewide. The plaintiffs seek three times the damages, accusing insurers of cartel-like behavior and burdening consumers with the costs of the L.A. fires.</p>

The case raises questions about the algorithm's effectiveness in protecting women and the reliance on algorithmic assessments in police practice. Critics suggest police are abdicating decision-making to an algorithm, and the lack of transparency and independent audits of VioGén are concerning. The algorithm's failure to accurately predict the threat highlights the potential for algorithmic bias and the need for thorough evaluation and oversight.</p>

The act, which allows for the detention and deportation of citizens of "enemy" nations, has been used to send alleged Venezuelan gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the deportations, arguing that the detainees had not been able to contest their cases in court.
