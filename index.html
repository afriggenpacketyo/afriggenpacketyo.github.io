          <p>Marks and Spencer has resumed online orders after halting purchases in April due to a cyberattack. Shoppers can now buy a selection of fashion products for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with more products and services resuming soon. The cyberattack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, initially affected click and collect and contactless payments. M&S estimates the attack will cost Â£300m in profits this year, and some customer data, including telephone numbers and addresses, was stolen, though payment details were not compromised. This event marks a critical step in M&S's recovery from the disruption caused by the cyberattack.</p>

          <p>American fund managers are lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," fearing it could cause foreign investors to pull out of U.S. markets. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the bill, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," could inadvertently impact most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI suggests the U.S. fund management industry, with around $18 trillion invested in U.S. stock markets, would be "collateral damage." The proposed tax, starting at 5% and escalating to 20%, could dent returns for foreign investors in U.S. equities (not investment advice).</p>
