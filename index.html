          <p>House Republicans, under Speaker Mike Johnson, approved a budget framework crucial to President Trump's agenda.  The plan aims to cut at least $2 trillion from federal spending over the next decade.  The framework faces challenges amidst declining public approval of Trump's performance and market volatility related to tariff policies.  Republicans are nonetheless optimistic about their legislative goals and midterm election prospects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case concerning the legal standard for proving discrimination in student disability rights cases.  A Minnesota school district argued that students must prove "bad faith" on the part of the school, while the family suing argued that "deliberate indifference" is sufficient.  The case has implications for the broader application of disability rights laws under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The justices seemed skeptical of the school district's argument.</p>
