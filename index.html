          <h2>Senior Police Raise Concerns Over Early Prisoner Release Plans</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns about the government's proposals to release some prisoners early to ease overcrowding. They argue that the plans could negatively impact public safety, citing concerns about the costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail. While acknowledging the government's difficult situation, Metropolitan Police head Sir Mark Rowley noted the proposed solutions would create extra work for the police and lacked sufficient impact analysis. The government insists that concerns have been addressed, with repeat offenders still facing short sentences and terrorists ineligible for early release, while increasing probation funding to monitor offenders. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan recommends decriminalizing possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use, suggesting removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). Lord Falconer, who chaired the London Drugs Commission, argues the current law disproportionately affects ethnic communities due to stop and search practices. While Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the force will adhere to existing laws, Khan emphasized the need for fresh thinking on drug-related crime. The report also recommends improved public health services, enhanced cannabis education, and fair access to medical cannabis, though critics like David Raynes caution against sending the wrong message to youth. The article highlights the ongoing debate surrounding cannabis policy and its impact on public health and criminal justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A German court in Hamm dismissed a climate case brought by a Peruvian farmer against energy giant RWE, who sought damages for potential flooding due to melting glaciers. Saul Luciano Lluiya argued that RWE, as a major polluter, should contribute to flood defenses in his town of Huaraz. The court ruled that no appeal is possible, stating that the case lacked direct causation between RWE's emissions and the specific threat to Lluiya's home. Despite the dismissal, the case is seen as having set a precedent by recognizing the transboundary effects of climate change, potentially influencing similar lawsuits against corporations worldwide.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a Â£122.7m fine, the largest ever issued by Ofwat, for breaches relating to its sewage operations and shareholder payouts. Ofwat stated the fines are a result of its "biggest and most complex investigation" and will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers. The fines include Â£104.5m for sewage operation breaches and Â£18.2m for shareholder payout breaches, marking the first time Ofwat has fined a company for such payouts. Thames Water has faced criticism for sewage discharges and leaks and is burdened by a Â£20bn debt, though a recent Â£3bn rescue loan staved off collapse; water supplies and waste services will continue as normal regardless of the company's future. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court to lift restrictions imposed by a federal judge on deportations to third countries. Judge Brian Murphy had ordered that detainees be given notice of their destination and time to raise safety concerns, a move the administration claims creates a logistical morass. Solicitor General John Sauer argues Murphy's order exceeds his authority and jeopardizes national security negotiations. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded "due process of law," though the specifics remain contested, as the administration pursues third-country agreements to remove unlawful or criminal immigrants.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Germany to meet with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, marking their third meeting in as many weeks, to secure financial assistance for expanding Ukraine's domestic arms production. Zelenskyy emphasized that financial support, estimated at $30 billion annually, is crucial for manufacturing attack drones, interceptors, cruise missiles, and ballistic systems. The visit underscores Germany's growing role in supporting Ukraine amid weakening U.S. commitments to NATO, and the need to maintain foreign industrial assistance. Zelenskyy also highlighted the importance of expanded sanctions against Russia to slow down its forces and raise the cost of war for the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>Japan's bond market is causing concerns about capital flight from the U.S. as long-dated yields reach record highs, potentially triggering a carry trade unwind. Higher Japanese government bond yields could lead Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., impacting global markets and increasing borrowing costs. Analysts warn of a potential "global financial market Armageddon" if yields continue to climb, particularly affecting U.S. tech stocks. However, some analysts suggest the carry trade impact may not be as severe as previously witnessed, with a gradual decline expected due to reduced confidence in the U.S. dollar.

          <p>Hundreds of Ukrainian drones targeted Russia overnight, with dozens aimed at Moscow, causing flight disruptions and damage. Russia's Defense Ministry claims to have shot down 296 drones over 12 regions, while Moscow Governor Andrei Vorobyov reported damage to homes. Ukrainian officials claimed successful strikes on facilities involved in aviation, missile, and drone technology production. The intensity of strikes has increased since President Trump's return to office, and the U.S. and Ukraine await Russia's peace memorandum amid ongoing tensions and skepticism from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

The move comes amid Trump's criticism of some US colleges, accusing them of enabling antisemitism and upholding discriminatory admissions policies.
