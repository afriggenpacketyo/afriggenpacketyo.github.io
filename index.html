          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, a leading producer of rare earth magnets critical for defense technology. The Pentagon will purchase $400 million of the company's preferred stock, a move aimed at securing domestic supply chains for essential military components. Following the announcement, shares of the Nevada-based company surged by over 40% in premarket trading, reflecting strong investor confidence in the strategic partnership and its implications for national security.

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four people in connection with recent, disruptive cyber-attacks on retailers M&S and Co-op. The suspects, including a 20-year-old woman and three males aged 17-19, were detained on suspicion of offenses including blackmail and organized crime. The attacks caused significant operational problems, with M&S estimating a £300 million loss in profits and expecting disruptions to continue for months. The arrests are considered a significant step in a complex, ongoing investigation into the large-scale data breaches and ransomware deployment.</p>

          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has sharply criticized what he termed "immoral" U.S. trade policies, contrasting them with Beijing's approach while addressing Southeast Asian nations. He specifically pointed to a 35% U.S. tariff on Bangladesh as an example of unreasonable American practices. Wang urged ASEAN members to protect free trade principles and maintain regional stability, positioning China as a reliable partner against global turbulence and economic challenges. The comments aim to strengthen China's economic ties within the region amid escalating trade tensions with Washington.</p>

          <p>Dispatch audio from the recent catastrophic Texas floods reveals that Kerr County officials waited 90 minutes to issue a CodeRED emergency alert after a firefighter requested it. The initial request was made at 4:22 a.m. as floodwaters were rapidly rising, but the first alert was not sent until after a supervisor's approval was sought. By the time some messages arrived, hours had passed and hundreds of people had been caught in the deluge. This delay has raised serious questions about the county's emergency response protocols and their effectiveness during the disaster.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has vowed to impose reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods if the Trump administration follows through on its threat to levy a 50% import tax. The U.S. threat was explicitly linked to the ongoing trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whom President Trump called a "highly respected leader." Lula asserted Brazil's sovereignty and rejected the U.S. interference, also challenging the accuracy of Trump's claims about a U.S. trade deficit with Brazil. The dispute marks a significant escalation in diplomatic and trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is expected to increase the cost of numerous consumer goods, including appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles. Experts warn that because copper is a fundamental component in everything from electrical wiring to military hardware, the tariff will have widespread inflationary effects. The administration argues the tariff is necessary to rebuild America's domestic copper industry for national security. However, economists express concern that companies will pass the increased costs directly to consumers, potentially impacting household budgets and energy infrastructure maintenance.

          <p>A comparison of two recent, back-to-back floods in New Mexico and Texas reveals starkly different outcomes based on preparedness. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where officials anticipated flooding due to wildfire "burn scars," the community was prepared, resulting in three fatalities despite record river levels. In contrast, the flash flood in Texas caught officials by surprise, leading to over 120 deaths. Experts note that recent experience with a hazard often informs a community's response, highlighting how Ruidoso's familiarity with post-fire flood risks led to a more effective, though still tragic, outcome.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by NPR and FRONTLINE indicates that federal flood maps significantly underestimated the flood risk for many structures in Kerr County, Texas, the site of the deadly Camp Mystic flood. Compared to maps from climate risk modeler First Street, FEMA's data failed to identify numerous buildings, including camper cabins, that were in extreme flood hazard zones. Experts explain that FEMA's maps are based on historical river and tidal data, largely ignoring the increasing danger from intense rainfall events driven by climate change.

          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer who went missing off the coast of Wooli, New South Wales, has been found alive and safe after spending a night on an uninhabited island. The surfer, Darcy Deefholts, failed to return from a surf session, prompting a large-scale land and water search. He was discovered the next day on North Solitary Island, approximately seven miles offshore. His father, who had made an emotional plea for help, called the rescue a "one in a million miracle," bringing a joyful conclusion to what could have been a tragic event.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis article suggests investors consider Chevron and TotalEnergies, two integrated energy giants currently offering high dividend yields of 4.7% and 6.3% respectively. The article highlights Chevron's strong balance sheet and 38-year history of annual dividend increases as appealing to conservative investors. In contrast, it presents TotalEnergies as a choice for those willing to accept more risk for exposure to the clean energy transition, as the company is aggressively investing its fossil fuel profits into electricity and renewables. The piece notes that recent weakness in oil prices has made both stocks attractively valued. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK regulator Ofcom has approved Royal Mail's proposal to reform its service by eliminating second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays and reducing them to every other weekday. The change, intended to cut costs amid a sharp decline in letter volume, means second-class mail will arrive on a three-day or two-day weekly cycle. While first-class letters will still be delivered six days a week, the move has been criticized by consumer and business groups. Ofcom estimates the changes could save Royal Mail up to £425 million annually but has also set new targets to reduce long delivery delays.</p>

          <p>South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial victory in her long legal battle against athletics' sex eligibility rules. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that her right to a fair hearing was violated by the Swiss Supreme Court in a 2023 appeal. Semenya, who has a difference of sexual development (DSD), has been barred from her preferred 800m event due to World Athletics rules restricting testosterone levels. While the ruling does not overturn the current regulations, it keeps her legal challenge alive and brings renewed scrutiny to the controversial rules.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The devastating flash floods in Texas, which caused billions in damages, are underscoring a critical gap in homeowner protection: a lack of flood insurance. Standard homeowners policies explicitly exclude flood damage, yet only about 2.5% of homeowners in the hard-hit Kerr County had separate flood coverage. Experts emphasize that flooding is a nationwide risk, with 99% of U.S. counties having experienced a flood event in the past two decades. The disaster serves as a stark reminder that flood insurance is not just for coastal areas and that many homeowners are unknowingly exposed to catastrophic financial risk.</p>

          <p>A new Republican-backed spending bill allocates an additional $75 billion to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over four years, a 308% annual increase over its 2024 budget. This infusion of cash will allow the agency to more than double its detention capacity from 41,500 to 116,000 beds. Critics and justice reform advocates worry the funding will enable the Trump administration to expand what they describe as indiscriminate enforcement tactics that undermine due process. The bill also incentivizes state and local governments with grants to collaborate on federal immigration detention, expanding the agency's reach nationwide.</p>

          <p>Health advocates and researchers in South Africa are expressing alarm that recent, drastic cuts to U.S. foreign aid could reverse decades of progress against HIV/AIDS. The funding cuts have led to the closure of many clinics that provided antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) to vulnerable populations, including sex workers. This forces patients into an overburdened public health system, risking treatment defaults. The situation threatens to undo the success of programs like PEPFAR, which helped save millions of lives and could lead to a spike in new HIV infections and a setback for critical vaccine research.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) in California could reshape its political dynamics, drawing lessons from its use in New York City. Unlike New York's partisan primaries, California's top-two nonpartisan system would interact with RCV differently. Advocates suggest RCV could eliminate the need for costly primary runoffs in local races, increase voter turnout, and discourage negative campaigning. However, its effect on the political makeup is uncertain; it could either lead to more centrist outcomes through crossover voting or push candidates to extremes to capture second- and third-choice votes from factional bases.</p>

The newly approved map shifts demographics to favor GOP candidates in what has become a competitive "purple" county. Critics have labeled the move "racial gerrymandering," while the county judge openly admitted it was a partisan effort to elect another Republican. This local action is viewed within a broader national context where Republicans are seeking to offset potential losses in other states by redrawing maps in their favor.</p>

Newsom preached a message of Democratic resistance to the Trump administration, touting California's role as a progressive counterweight. The visit allowed him to test his national appeal, though he faces criticism for California's own issues and questions about whether his progressive profile can win over voters in the Deep South.</p>
