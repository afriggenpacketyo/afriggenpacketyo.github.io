          <p>Six individuals were killed and eight others sustained injuries in a devastating shooting attack at a bus stop in Jerusalem, carried out by two Palestinian gunmen who were neutralized by an off-duty soldier and a civilian. This incident, one of the deadliest in recent years, involved five men and a 60-year-old woman, with two wounded still in serious condition. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the act as part of an intense war against terrorism, vowing to apprehend those who aided the attackers. The attack comes as Israeli forces intensify operations in Gaza City, underscoring the volatile security situation in the region despite ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal proposals.</p>

Critics, including environmental and consumer advocates, warn the deal could lead to increased utility rates for residents and undermine clean energy goals, despite agreements for a one-year rate freeze and non-binding renewable energy commitments. An administrative law judge has already recommended rejecting the proposal, citing concerns that the private equity firm's profit-driven agenda may not align with public interest or decarbonization efforts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Jury selection has commenced in the criminal trial of Ryan Routh, the man charged with attempting to assassinate President Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course last year. Routh, who has pleaded not guilty and is representing himself, faces charges including assaulting a federal officer and multiple firearm violations. Prosecutors contend Routh meticulously planned the attack for weeks, aiming a rifle through shrubbery before being intercepted by a Secret Service agent. Furthermore, the government alleges Routh attempted to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to target Trump's plane, underscoring the serious nature of the alleged plot.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict that the long-delayed Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, connecting Russia and China, would create a "structural shock" to global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade if it becomes operational. The overland supply offers China a significantly cheaper and more secure energy source, enabling it to bypass maritime chokepoints and better insulate itself from global price fluctuations. This project has gained crucial importance for Russia since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as Moscow seeks alternative markets following heavy sanctions from the US and Europe. While talks have revived, unresolved issues like pricing and the pipeline route suggest a protracted negotiation period (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs are significantly challenging the promised revival of US manufacturing, with many businesses reporting substantial increases in costs and declining profits. Manufacturers, like Accurate Services Inc. and Matouk, are grappling with higher expenses on imported supplies and difficulties in hiring, despite the administration's rhetoric of economic benefits. Business surveys indicate a contraction in the sector, leading to job losses and forcing companies to cut investments, underscoring the complex and often detrimental impact of these trade policies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that the UK could suspend visas for countries that do "play ball" and agree to deals for returning migrants, emphasizing her top priority is securing the UK's borders. Speaking at a Five Eyes summit, Mahmood highlighted the need for coordinated action among intelligence allies to ensure countries take back citizens with no right to be in the UK. This tough stance comes as the government faces mounting pressure to reduce the record numbers of people crossing the Channel in small boats.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy secured victory at the Amgen Irish Open with a dramatic eagle putt, but the triumph was marred by overly partisan crowd behavior directed at his play-off opponent, Joakim Lagergren.

European captain Luke Donald is already preparing his players for a potentially hostile environment from American fans, highlighting the increasing tribalism in golf.</p>
