          <p>The Metropolitan Police are urgently appealing to Hadush Kebatu, a migrant who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, to turn himself in after his erroneous release from an Essex prison. Kebatu, who had been jailed for the sexual assault, was mistakenly freed and traveled to east London, prompting a widespread search. Authorities have released CCTV footage showing Kebatu in Dalston, Hackney, carrying a distinctive white bag with avocados. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy has ordered an independent investigation into the error, with new prison procedures set to be implemented to prevent future occurrences. The public is asked to contact the police with any information regarding his whereabouts.</p>

          <p>The White House Family Theater, a venue that has hosted presidents and their guests for over 80 years, has been demolished to make way for a new ballroom. Converted from a cloakroom by Franklin Roosevelt in 1942, the theater has been a place for presidents to watch newsreels, documentaries, and feature films. Presidents like Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were avid moviegoers, while others like Lyndon B. Johnson were known to sleep through screenings. While the White House has not confirmed plans for a new theater, there is hope that the tradition will continue in the future.</p>

          <p>In Atlanta, a carjacking victim, Yoshay Carter, was arrested after allegedly shooting a boy who was breaking into his car. Police responded to a call about a person shot and found a boy with a gunshot wound to his foot, who admitted to breaking into the car. Carter confronted the boy, leading to the shooting, and he was subsequently charged with aggravated assault. Georgia law allows the use of force to defend property, but not deadly force unless to prevent a "forcible felony," raising questions about the applicability of self-defense laws in this case.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to increase tariffs on Canadian imports by an additional 10% in response to an anti-tariff advertisement aired by the province of Ontario.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford stated the ad would be removed after the weekend, but Trump proceeded with the tariff threat. Canada's economy, heavily reliant on exports to the U.S., has been significantly impacted by Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, an heir to a banking family, has been identified as the mystery donor who contributed $130 million to pay U.S. military troops during the government shutdown. The donation, however, equates to approximately $100 per service member, far short of the nearly $6.4 billion needed to pay troops every two weeks. The use of Mellon's donation may violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending funds not appropriated by Congress. Mellon is a long-time Trump donor, having contributed $50 million to Trump's super PAC during the 2024 election cycle.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval rating among Hispanic adults has significantly decreased since the beginning of his second term, according to a new poll. The survey indicates growing unease within this voting bloc, with only 25% now holding a favorable view of Trump, down from 44% in March. Hispanic adults also expressed less confidence in Trump's handling of the economy and immigration, and the number who believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction has increased. The decline in support is evident even among Hispanic Republicans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral bar chart claiming the UK has the highest sexual assault rate in Europe is misleading due to significant differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors across countries. The UK's seemingly high rate is more reflective of its reporting practices than actual prevalence, and criminologists recommend using victim surveys for more accurate comparisons. Claims linking immigration to sexual violence are false, and the UK does not publish data on the nationality or ethnicity of perpetrators. The #MeToo movement and police reforms have likely spurred victims to come forward, increasing reported cases.</p>

This move comes amid increased activity of Russian submarines in recent years, which NATO considers a strategic threat.
