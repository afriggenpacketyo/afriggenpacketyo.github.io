        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK health officials are reportedly planning a trial to make weight-loss injections like Ozempic available over-the-counter at chemists, potentially costing the NHS £9.90 per prescription. This initiative aims to widen access to these treatments, with approximately one in ten overweight individuals being eligible through the NHS. While proponents argue it will expedite access, critics warn about the potential strain on the NHS budget and the long-term implications of widespread use. The program is being called 'Britain's war on obesity' by some, while other sources worry about the financial impact of the new program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance has stated that the war in Ukraine is unlikely to end soon and emphasized the need for the US to help Russia and Ukraine find common ground. His remarks come after a deal between Washington and Kyiv to share profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals in exchange for future US security assistance. Vance suggested that both sides may need to compromise on territory, including potentially ceding Crimea, to reach a truce. Recent fighting has continued despite ceasefire calls, with both sides accusing each other of attacks and causing casualties.</p>

          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake for the first time since Hurricane Helene left debris in East Tennessee waterways. The study aims to determine the impact of the debris on sport fish, comparing current data with surveys from the past 30 years. The tourism department notes that sport fishing contributes hundreds of thousands of dollars to the area annually, and most fishing tournaments were rescheduled due to the hurricane's aftermath. Cleanup efforts on Douglas Lake are about 90% complete, with over 112,000 cubic yards of debris removed.</p>

          <p>The Senate has voted to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule designed to limit seven hazardous air pollutants emitted by heavy industry. The 52-46 party-line vote marks the first time Congress has moved to weaken the Clean Air Act. Republicans argue the rule, which requires strict pollution controls for major sources of toxic air pollution, disincentivizes companies from deploying new technology to reduce emissions. Environmental groups criticize the move, claiming it will allow polluters to release dangerous chemicals linked to cancer and other health issues.</p>

Making things more challenging were the unprecedented cuts to the Department of Education last month, impacting nearly half of the office of Federal Student Aid, which is responsible for managing FAFSA.
