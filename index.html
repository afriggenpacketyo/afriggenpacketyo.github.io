          <p>Families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea decades ago are traveling to Washington to seek U.S. government support for the victims' early return. The families plan to meet with U.S. officials and lawmakers to convey their desire for the abduction issue to be addressed in negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang, especially given the fluid international situation and potential for closer ties between the United States and North Korea. They aim to emphasize the urgency of the matter, particularly as time is running out for the families of the abductees. The Japanese government officially recognizes 12 abductees and suspects North Korea's involvement in other disappearances.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party has won the federal election, a surprising outcome influenced by U.S. President Trump's annexation threats and tariffs, according to Canadian media projections. The election was also heavily influenced by domestic issues such as affordability, immigration, jobs, and crime. Voters expressed concerns about Canada's sovereignty and the impact of tariffs on the market and prices of goods. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre was seen as having similarities to Trump, which may have cost him votes. Trump himself called on Canadian voters to elect someone who could make Canada the 51st U.S. state.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "border czar," Tom Homan, defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, asserting it was not an error but an oversight based on changed circumstances. Homan claimed that Abrego Garcia is now a terrorist, as the gang he feared no longer exists, referencing the administration's designation of certain gangs, including MS-13, as terrorist organizations. Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny his gang membership and criminal record, noting that he was granted "withholding of removal" in 2019 due to the risk of persecution in El Salvador. El Salvador's president has stated he will not send Abrego Garcia back to the United States.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's return to the Oval Office has been marked by a focus on "America First" policies, including prioritizing US interests in domestic and foreign affairs through nationalism and economic protectionism. Key events include planning a second state visit to the UK, creating the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, and continuing his crusade against traditional media. Other notable actions involve expanding the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, criticizing judges, withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, and taking a binary view on gender. His administration is also testing legal boundaries on all fronts, leading to frequent Supreme Court showdowns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and auto parts to allow automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. While tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, they will be modified to avoid "stacking" with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for some tariff costs on imported components, up to 3.75 percent of a new car's value in the first year, phased out over two years. Automakers have welcomed the changes, viewing them as leveling the playing field and encouraging domestic investment.</p>

Badenoch stated she is not concerned about criticism from those unwilling to attach their names to it. The article described her as an electoral liability, prompting Badenoch to reject claims of a rift with Robert Jenrick regarding an electoral pact with Reform UK.</p>

          <p>An Iraqi man, Akeel Abdul Jamiel, has been charged with voting illegally in the 2020 presidential election in upstate New York, with federal officials crediting Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for assisting in the investigation. Jamiel, a non-citizen, registered as a member of the Conservative Party and voted despite being prohibited from doing so. Court filings suggest he is a Trump supporter, adding an ironic twist to the case. The charge carries a potential sentence of up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.</p>

          <p>A Pittsburgh funeral home director, Patrick Vereb, is facing charges for allegedly discarding the bodies of thousands of pets and providing owners with the ashes of other animals. Vereb is accused of stealing over $650,000 from more than 6,500 customers who paid for pet burial and cremation services between 2021 and 2024. Instead of performing the services, investigators said Vereb threw many of the pets out at a landfill, giving customers the ashes of other unknown animals. Authorities are urging potential victims to come forward.</p>

The sentences have been condemned by Western governments and rights groups, while Hong Kong and Beijing maintain that everyone is equal under the law and that the democrats received a fair trial.</p>

They point to actions such as challenging birthright citizenship, deporting people without due process, targeting law firms and universities, and impounding federal funds. The scholars warn of an authoritarian regime and the erosion of constitutional principles, with some suggesting the U.S. constitutional system is on the verge of an authoritarian takeover.</p>

          <p>President Trump has decided to provide automakers with some relief from his tariffs, marking a shift from his previous get-tough policy aimed at boosting manufacturing jobs and government revenue. The move ensures that different types of tariffs charged by the administration do not accumulate on imports of foreign cars. Importers of foreign auto parts will also be eligible for government reimbursement of some tariff costs for the next two years. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this break will reward domestic manufacturers while providing a "runway" for those needing time to invest in domestic plants.</p>
