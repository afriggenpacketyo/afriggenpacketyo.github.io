          <h2>Fortnite Resubmitted to Apple App Store Following Court Ruling</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 15:31:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store after a judge ruled in their favor regarding link-outs and commissions. This follows Fortnite's removal from the App Store in 2020 due to Epic Games bypassing Apple's payment system. The recent ruling prevents Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, paving the way for Fortnite's potential return. Apple still has the option to reject the submission and is appealing the ruling, but developers like Amazon and Spotify have already updated their apps to avoid Apple's commissions. The game has been available in Europe through Epic Games' store due to the Digital Markets Act.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening tool, offering women an alternative to Pap smears. The test, developed by Teal Health, involves vaginal swabbing and mail-in HPV testing. This approval stems from the understanding that HPV causes almost all cervical cancer cases. The at-home test is considered as accurate as Pap smears and aims to improve screening rates, particularly for women who face barriers to in-person appointments. If the test is positive, a follow-up appointment is required.</p>

His company, which produces embroidered patches, initially saw an opportunity when tariffs were imposed on competitors in China.

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, stating that her detention could chill the speech of non-citizens. Ozturk was detained by ICE agents after co-authoring an essay critical of Israel. The judge found no evidence that Ozturk posed a threat to American foreign policy interests and cited First Amendment concerns. Ozturk, who suffers from chronic asthma, testified about the poor conditions at the detention center. The judge's decision marks another defeat for the government's efforts to deport international students involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>

The dispute could jeopardize the entire Republican tax bill, as any change to the SALT cap would be costly. Trump has expressed conflicting views on the matter, adding to the uncertainty.</p>
