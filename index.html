          <p>Iran has stated it will not resume discussions regarding its nuclear program while under attack, following warnings from Israel's defense minister about a potentially lengthy conflict. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European diplomats in Geneva, who urged him to re-engage with the U.S. on the nuclear issue. Israel's ambassador to the UN accused Iran of pursuing a "genocidal agenda" and asserted that Israel would continue targeting nuclear facilities until they are dismantled.

          <p>The United States' failure to secure a tariff agreement with Japan and threats of new duties on imports are perceived as signs of weakness, potentially emboldening China in trade negotiations. Analysts suggest that these developments indicate the difficulty Washington faces in achieving its objectives through trade talks this summer. A finance professor at the University of Hong Kong notes that these threats could empower Chinese negotiators, signaling desperation from the U.S. side. This comes after the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, later paused pending negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism after ordering a Michigan coal plant to remain open beyond its planned closure date and after the Supreme Court sided with fossil fuel firms in an emissions case. The decision to keep the JH Campbell coal plant open has drawn opposition in Michigan, with critics arguing it is ideologically driven and could increase costs for ratepayers. The plant emits a significant portion of the state's greenhouse gas pollution, raising concerns about environmental impact. The state's utilities have stated they did not request the plants to stay online.</p>

The U.S. has offered Iran a civilian nuclear program if it agrees not to enrich uranium on its soil, but the Supreme Leader of Iran has not responded.

          <p>An Iranian missile strike wounded 23 people in northern Israel, as emergency services responded to the scene. This attack occurred amidst diplomatic efforts in Geneva, where European foreign ministers met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Araghchi stated Iran would consider diplomacy only if Israel ceased its attacks, while Britain's foreign secretary expressed a desire to continue negotiations. President Trump stated the U.S. is "ready, willing and able" to engage with Iran, but also acknowledged the difficulty of requesting Israel to pause its offensive.</p>
