Wozniak argues that platforms are not doing enough to stop criminal activity, leaving consumers vulnerable to sophisticated and manipulative schemes that result in significant financial losses.</p>

          <p>A book excerpt from Mark K. Updegrove's "Incomparable Grace: JFK in the Presidency" provides a detailed account of President John F. Kennedy's political mindset in the weeks before his assassination. It describes a confident White House team planning for the 1964 election, buoyed by a strong economy and high approval ratings, despite legislative challenges. The narrative culminates in the fateful trip to Texas, planned primarily for fundraising, and vividly recounts the events of November 22, 1963, in Dallas, leading up to the tragic shooting.</p>

          <p>In a humorous essay, author David Sedaris reflects on the awkwardness and social pressure of modern tipping, particularly with the rise of digital payment screens that prompt for specific percentages.

The piece satirizes the guilt and internal monologues that accompany these small financial decisions, touching on themes of work, value, and social obligation.</p>

          <p>A new biography of novelist Muriel Spark prompts a re-examination of her work, arguing that her reputation as a comic writer obscures her significance as a major religious author. The article posits that Spark, a Roman Catholic convert, used narrative techniques like omniscience and irony to explore themes of divine judgment, free will, and the nature of God. Her fiction, particularly influenced by the Book of Job, often plays with the relationship between an all-knowing creator and flawed human characters, communicating her complex theology through literary form rather than explicit discussion.</p>

          <p>A coalition of key European nations, including the UK, France, and Germany, has issued a joint statement affirming that a lasting peace for Ukraine cannot be decided without its participation. The declaration comes ahead of a planned one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, which currently excludes Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. While welcoming U.S. efforts to end the conflict, the European leaders stressed that Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be the starting point for any meaningful negotiations.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization. The mass arrests, the largest on a single day in a decade, occurred after protesters displayed signs backing the group, which engages in direct action against companies linked to Israel's military. The event has sparked a debate over freedom of expression, with civil liberties groups calling the arrests disproportionate while the government defends the ban as necessary for national security.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars rookie kicker Cam Little made a remarkable 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. While the kick will not count as an official NFL record because it occurred in the preseason, the feat was celebrated enthusiastically by his teammates. The successful attempt, which would have been good from nearly 75 yards, showcases Little's powerful leg and potential as a strategic weapon for the team, particularly in end-of-game situations. The current official NFL record is a 66-yard field goal by Justin Tucker.</p>

The country is gaining popularity due to its surprising affordability, with low costs for rent and healthcare, and its stunning natural beauty, from the Albanian Alps to the Ionian coast. A significant advantage is that Americans can stay for up to a year without a visa, making it an ideal place to "test drive" expat life while enjoying a welcoming culture and a growing international community.</p>
