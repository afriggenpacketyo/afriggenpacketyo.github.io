          <p>An explosion at the U.S. Steel Clairton plant near Pittsburgh resulted in at least one fatality, ten injuries, and one person remaining unaccounted for. First responders stabilized the facility, which is the largest coke manufacturing plant in the U.S., after multiple secondary explosions were reported. The Allegheny County Health Department has advised nearby residents to remain indoors as a precaution, though air quality monitors have not detected dangerous levels of pollutants. Officials and lawmakers have expressed condolences, emphasizing the tragedy for the community.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan as a "success" following a meeting, a sharp reversal from his demand for Tan's resignation just days prior. The meeting, which included cabinet members, focused on strengthening U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership. This change in tone comes amid the administration's active involvement in the semiconductor industry's competition with China, including a recent deal with Nvidia. Intel's stock saw a slight increase following the news of the constructive discussion.</p>

          <p>This article explains President Trump's recent decision to federalize the Washington, D.C. police department and deploy the National Guard. It clarifies that while the president has the authority for a temporary takeover of the police for up to 30 days, his power over the D.C. National Guard is more open-ended. The move is framed against Trump's claims of rampant crime, which the article notes is contradicted by data showing a significant decline in violent crime in the city. The context raises concerns based on the administration's past use of federal forces against protesters.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is projected to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the season. Currently located far from the U.S. mainland, early models suggest it could intensify into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands later in the week. The storm has already caused flooding in the Cabo Verde islands. This development marks the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which forecasters predict will be above-normal in activity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a new documentary, director Martin Scorsese revealed he once considered getting a gun to threaten studio executives who wanted to cut violent scenes from his 1976 film "Taxi Driver." Fearing the film would be destroyed, he contemplated drastic action before a compromise was reached. Co-participant Steven Spielberg explained that Scorsese ultimately saved the movie's key scenes by desaturating the color of the blood, toning down its visual impact without altering the content. The film went on to receive four Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture.</p>

          <p>Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stated that individuals who commit heinous male crimes like sexual assault "probably" forfeit their right to choose their gender identity. The comment was made in an interview regarding the controversial case of a transgender offender who was initially placed in a women's prison. Sturgeon, whose government passed a gender recognition bill that was later blocked by the UK, also admitted she was "partly responsible" for the debate losing rationality and should have been more straightforward. Her remarks represent a significant shift in her public stance.</p>

          <p>A new study has identified the U.S. states with the highest rates of uninsured drivers involved in fatal accidents, with Mississippi leading the nation. The state recorded 24 uninsured drivers in deadly crashes per million residents. Wyoming and Texas followed in second and third place, respectively. Conversely, Massachusetts had the lowest rate, with only one uninsured driver in a fatal crash per million residents, followed by Hawaii and New York. The study highlights a correlation between states with high populations of uninsured individuals and a higher frequency of such tragic incidents.</p>

          <p>European leaders are expressing anxiety over their exclusion from the upcoming talks between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where the war in Ukraine will be a central topic. While President Trump has suggested that Ukrainian President Zelensky "could go," no formal invitation has been extended, and other European allies remain shut out. This has led to a diplomatic scramble in Brussels, with officials calling for a ceasefire and emphasizing that any deal made without Ukraine's involvement would be unacceptable. The one-on-one format is seen as a win for the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a major investment to produce a new, more affordable midsize electric pickup truck with a target price in the $30,000 range. The vehicle, which is planned to roll out within 18 months, will be built at a retooled assembly plant in Kentucky. This move marks a pivot for Ford toward smaller, cheaper EVs, aiming to create a profitable vehicle that can compete with both gasoline-powered trucks and lower-cost Chinese EV imports. The announcement comes amid political and market headwinds for the EV industry.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic imagines a home makeover show where the Trump family redesigns the White House to better suit their tastes. In the parody, Donald Trump complains about the house being "yucky" and haunted, and demands an all-gold Oval Office inspired by King Midas and the dragon Smaug. The piece humorously critiques the president's aesthetic and political ambitions, depicting the Rose Garden being paved over for an Au Bon Pain-style patio and a new ballroom being built to avoid using tents. The satire frames the renovations as turning a public institution into a "forever home."</p>

This surge provides an opportunity for homeowners to access funds amidst high inflation and borrowing costs. The article outlines several ways to borrow against this equity, including home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which currently offer lower interest rates than credit cards or personal loans. For seniors, a reverse mortgage is also presented as a viable option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The stock prices of lithium producers, such as U.S. miner Albemarle, surged on Monday following reports that a key Chinese mine has suspended production. The Yichun Project, operated by battery giant CATL, has temporarily halted operations due to an expired permit. This mine is responsible for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecast for 2025. The suspension tightens an already constrained market, leading investors to anticipate a rise in lithium prices due to the reduced supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the next major earthquake on California's San Andreas fault may not resemble past events like the 1906 or 1857 quakes. Researchers analyzed a recent massive earthquake on a similar fault in Myanmar, which ruptured a much longer section than expected, indicating that seismic events do not repeat in predictable patterns. The findings imply that a future "Big One" in California could be a single, massive rupture longer than previously recorded. The study underscores the complexity and inherent randomness of fault behavior.</p>
