          <p>Robinhood's stock has soared over 160% this year, but the company faces several significant challenges. A formal investigation has been launched in Florida over allegedly deceptive claims about its crypto trading costs. The company is also facing pushback for a new 25% fee on crypto staking rewards and friction with OpenAI over its tokenized stock offerings in Europe. Despite these obstacles and potential increased costs from data access fees, investors remain focused on the company's growth, particularly its connection to new government-seeded investment accounts.

          <p>David Gergen, a distinguished political commentator and adviser who served in the White Houses of four U.S. presidents, has passed away at the age of 83. He worked for Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton, offering a rare bipartisan presence in Washington. Gergen was known for his insightful analysis and was credited with crafting influential political phrases, such as Reagan's famous question, "Are you better off than you were four years ago?"

          <p>An investigation into xAI's new Grok 4 model, promoted by Elon Musk as highly intelligent, has revealed it can be easily prompted to produce racist and sexist outputs. When asked to write a program to identify a "good scientist" based on demographics, the AI used Nobel Prize data to conclude they are typically white, Asian, or Jewish men. Unlike other major chatbots that refuse such discriminatory queries, Grok 4 complied while noting the premise was flawed. The article suggests Musk's push for a non-"woke" AI may have resulted in fewer safeguards against generating harmful stereotypes.</p>

          <p>A lightning-sparked wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, is burning uncontrollably in Arizona, forcing the evacuation of the Grand Canyon National Park's North Rim.

Officials have evacuated approximately 500 guests from the area and closed a portion of a nearby state highway.

This "loyal wingman" concept, where drones are directed by crewed aircraft, is a key part of the U.S. military's strategy to maintain air supremacy.

          <p>Activists and civil rights lawyers accuse the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff's Departments of violating their own policies by indiscriminately using less-lethal weapons against peaceful protesters. During recent demonstrations against federal immigration raids, numerous individuals, including a data engineer who lost a finger, suffered serious injuries from projectiles like flash-bangs and rubber bullets. Critics argue that these crowd-control tools are being deployed without legal justification, escalating tensions and harming civilians exercising their First Amendment rights. The ACLU has received over 250 complaints of harm by law enforcement at the protests.</p>

          <p>Over seven million people in the United Kingdom are now under hosepipe bans as the country experiences its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures soaring to 34.7°C (94.5°F).

Health officials have issued amber heat alerts for much of England, warning of risks to the entire population, while wildfire warnings are in effect for Scotland and Northern Ireland.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reorganization by laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees, part of a broader plan to reduce its domestic workforce by 15%. This move integrates the former functions of USAID and aims to streamline operations by closing or merging offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the indiscriminate cuts undermine national security and diplomatic readiness. The layoffs are a component of the Trump administration's sweeping plan to reduce the size of the federal government, which has been met with alarm by many department staff.</p>
