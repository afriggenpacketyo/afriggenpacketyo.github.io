          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has stated there will be no relaxation of visa rules for India, despite a recent trade agreement aimed at boosting economic ties. During a visit to India with a large business delegation, Starmer emphasized that the focus is on leveraging the new trade deal, which reduces tariffs on goods like cars and whisky. While the UK seeks to attract "top talent," he confirmed that expanding visa routes for Indian workers or students is not part of the current plan, aligning with his government's broader goal of reducing immigration levels.</p>

The government is considering several measures, including potentially delaying the EU's 2035 ban on new combustion engine vehicles and extending tax breaks for electric cars to stimulate demand. The sector has seen significant profit declines and job cuts as it lags in EV innovation and faces protectionist trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a slight dip in interest rates, overall mortgage application volume has decreased, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. However, a growing number of borrowers still in the market are turning to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure lower initial rates, with the ARM share of applications rising to 9.5%. These loans are considered riskier because their rates can increase significantly after an initial fixed period, but they currently offer rates nearly a full percentage point below traditional 30-year fixed mortgages.

          <p>A new analysis by Public Citizen and the Revolving Door Project finds that the Trump administration has appointed over 100 individuals with connections to the fossil fuel industry or opposition to renewable energy into key policy roles.

The report argues these appointments have driven a broad deregulatory agenda, benefiting polluting industries and undermining climate policies, with the Department of the Interior identified as the most compromised agency.</p>

          <p>High-level mediators, including U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have joined the third day of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza. The presence of Qatar's prime minister and Turkey's intelligence chief signals a significant push to advance President Trump's proposed peace plan. Hamas has reportedly submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners for a potential exchange, and while Israeli officials express "cautious optimism," a Palestinian source noted that "deep gaps" remain on key issues.</p>

          <p>The Arab American community in Dearborn, Michigan, is experiencing heightened fear and anxiety due to a surge in Islamophobic attacks and threats since the start of the Israel-Gaza war. A particularly shocking incident involved a seven-year-old girl whose throat was slit at a playground, an attack her family believes was a hate crime. Residents report feeling targeted by right-wing media and abandoned by the political establishment, leading some who previously supported Donald Trump to reconsider their allegiance as threats at home continue.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee has issued a warning about the increasing risk of a "sharp market correction" in global financial markets. The committee identified two main vulnerabilities: stretched U.S. stock valuations, heavily concentrated in AI-related tech companies, and the potential for a repricing of U.S. government bonds if perceptions of the Federal Reserve's independence were to weaken. The bank noted that such a shock would have material spillover effects on Britain's financial system and borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a mathematics professor who was diagnosed with autism in his 30s argues against the framing of autism as a tragedy or a problem to be solved. He recounts how his autistic traits, such as pattern recognition and logical thinking, have been assets in his career, and draws parallels to historical figures whose neurodivergent behaviors likely contributed to their genius. The author contends that conversations about "eliminating" autism echo the dangerous logic of eugenics and that the world is a better place for embracing different ways of thinking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article from NPR's Planet Money explains why preordering a book is a critically important way to support an author, going beyond just the initial sale. High preorder numbers signal strong interest to booksellers, influencing decisions on stocking levels and prominent in-store or online placement. Furthermore, all preorders are counted as first-day sales, which significantly increases a book's chances of debuting on a bestseller list. This early success can create a snowball effect, generating more visibility and subsequent sales for the title.</p>
