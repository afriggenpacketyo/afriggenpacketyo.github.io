          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is primarily fueled by robust global demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips, with the high-performance computing division accounting for 60% of revenue. The company also provided a strong forecast for the upcoming quarter and the full year, projecting continued growth despite potential headwinds from U.S. tariff policies and global macroeconomic conditions. The positive results boosted TSMC's share price, reflecting investor confidence in the sustained AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A devastating fire broke out late Wednesday at a recently opened five-story shopping mall in al-Kut, eastern Iraq, resulting in the deaths of at least 61 people, including women and children. Most victims died from suffocation, many of whom were found in the building's bathrooms, according to the Interior Ministry. While civil defense teams managed to rescue over 45 individuals, the incident has prompted an investigation into the cause, with legal action initiated against the building and mall owners. This tragedy highlights ongoing concerns about poor building standards in Iraq, which have contributed to similar fatal fires in recent years.</p>

          <p>Italian rescue teams searching for Matthew Hall, a 33-year-old British hiker missing since July 9th, have discovered a body in the Alps. The discovery was made in a crevice near the Cross of Daloo, a location from which Hall had sent a photo to friends on the day he disappeared. Hall, an experienced hiker, was on a solo trip and had messaged a friend that he had taken a wrong turn. His family, who had traveled to Italy to assist with the search, has been informed, and a helicopter was used to recover the body from the dangerous terrain.</p>

          <p>Andre Correa do Lago, the diplomat leading the upcoming UN climate talks, acknowledges the difficulty of keeping climate change on the global agenda amid conflicts, trade wars, and political shifts. He emphasizes that despite these immediate crises, the threat of climate change continues to escalate, as evidenced by recent extreme weather events worldwide. The article explores the pressure on Brazil's presidency to advance the transition from fossil fuels, even as the country's own oil exploration policies face scrutiny. Correa do Lago remains optimistic that integrating climate action into economic policy can drive growth, a key objective for the next summit.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's jobs market is showing signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate climbing to 4.7%, its highest level in four years, according to the Office for National Statistics. Annual pay growth also slowed to 5% in the three months to May, and the number of job vacancies has fallen for three consecutive years. Economists suggest these trends make an interest rate cut by the Bank of England more likely in an effort to stimulate the sluggish economy. Businesses report that increased national insurance contributions have discouraged hiring, leading to reduced headcounts and operational cutbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

In response to U.S. tariffs, Volvo is shifting its U.S. strategy by adding production of its popular XC60 SUV to its South Carolina plant while discontinuing some sedans and wagons.

The original 2020 agreement, which was only partially fulfilled, is being viewed as a 'road map' for the current negotiations led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

This marks the first time since 1896 that no Welsh players have been named in a Lions Test squad against a major southern hemisphere team. The decision underscores the recent struggles of the Welsh national team, which recently ended an 18-match losing streak. Despite Morgan's strong performances on the tour, the highly competitive back-row positions went to players from England and Ireland, leaving Wales without representation on the field.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions will feature an all-Scottish fly-half and centre combination for the first time in history, with Finn Russell, Sione Tuipulotu, and Huw Jones starting against Australia.

          <p>China's top anti-corruption body, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), has announced a crackdown on fraud and bribery within the country's science and technology sector. The initiative will focus on key risk areas like the management of research funds and the project evaluation process. Li Xi, the agency's chief, stated the goal is to create a better environment for innovation by rooting out corruption, such as embezzling research funds or accepting bribes for project approval. The CCDI also plans to leverage technology like big data and AI to enhance its own supervisory and investigative capabilities.</p>

The appeal challenges the Shelby County Health Department's decision to allow xAI to run natural gas-burning turbines to power the data center. The groups argue the department ignored residents' complaints about air pollution, which they claim disproportionately affects nearby majority-Black communities, and improperly categorized the turbines in violation of the Clean Air Act. In response, xAI described the appeal as 'baseless' and 'politically driven,' maintaining that it complies with all laws.</p>

          <p>The UK's new Labour government has removed the party whip from four MPs and stripped three others of their trade envoy roles for voting against government policy, sparking a debate within the party. Downing Street frames the move as a necessary assertion of authority to discourage future rebellions. However, some Labour MPs have described the disciplinary action as 'petty,' 'vindictive,' and a sign of weakness, arguing it could lower morale among the party's base. This article analyzes the dual approach of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is attempting to project discipline while also increasing engagement with his MPs.</p>
