          <p>The opening Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth was temporarily stopped after Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator at Anfield. Despite the distressing incident, the Ghana international demonstrated remarkable resilience by scoring two goals in the second half. The event drew widespread condemnation from both clubs, the Football Association, and anti-racism organization Kick It Out, all of whom called for a full investigation and stressed that such behavior has no place in football or society. The game's referee followed protocol by pausing the match to address the situation with team managers and captains.</p>

          <p>Bodycam footage from a May arrest shows South Carolina Democratic gubernatorial candidate William McLeod in a state of undress, engaging in a profanity-laden and incoherent rant from a police car. During the episode, McLeod referred to himself as "Superman" and "God" and made threats against other public officials. The Charleston Police Department report noted symptoms consistent with stimulant narcotic influence. Following the release of the footage, the South Carolina Democratic Party has called for him to withdraw from the race to focus on his well-being, citing the profound challenges indicated by his behavior.</p>

Teammates were visibly moved, and winger Federico Chiesa dedicated his goal and the team's 4-2 victory to Jota, stating that the day belonged to him. The powerful display of solidarity highlighted the profound impact Jota had on the club and its community.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been federally indicted on charges including conspiracy, fraud, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors allege she engaged in a scheme with her bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, to defraud the city by using public funds for personal purposes related to their intimate relationship. The indictment claims Vappie was paid for work while he was actually meeting with the mayor privately or traveling with her on personal trips, costing the city over $70,000. Cantrell is also accused of using encrypted messages to conceal their activities and filing a police report against a citizen who photographed them together.</p>

The show, held at the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre, featured works by exiled artists, including those from Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang, which Beijing deemed harmful to its interests. Following visits from Chinese embassy officials, the gallery removed or obscured artworks, flags, and artist names. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an act of transnational repression, highlighting China's growing influence to silence dissent abroad.</p>

Prosecutors stated the pair would provide fake wire transfer receipts to victims when payments were due. Kingston's mother was previously sentenced to five years for her involvement in the scheme, which defrauded multiple businesses and banks.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting a new electric pickup truck with a minimalist, "open source" design intended to make it highly affordable and customizable. The company's strategy is to sell a basic two-seat truck and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into a five-seat SUV. While Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, the expiration of those incentives may push the price closer to $28,000. This higher price point could challenge its competitiveness against established models like the Ford Maverick (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following a lawsuit and a request for an emergency restraining order from Washington D.C., the Trump administration has agreed to scale back its federal takeover of the city's police force. An agreement reached in court will keep D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith in command, reversing an earlier directive that had appointed a DEA administrator as an emergency chief. The administration also agreed to rewrite a directive that aimed to end the city's "sanctuary" policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Compared to 1975, when nearly half of young adults had achieved all four, less than a quarter have done so today. The report attributes this shift to significant economic barriers, including rising costs of living and job instability, as well as changing societal attitudes toward family formation.

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of online real estate company Opendoor, following a period of intense pressure from investors and a recent surge in the company's stock price. Wheeler's departure comes after a disappointing earnings report and public criticism from prominent investors, including co-founder Keith Rabois, who called for new leadership. The company, which uses technology to buy and sell homes, has struggled with rising interest rates but has recently seen its stock rebound significantly from near-delisting levels. Technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna has been named interim leader while a search for a permanent CEO is conducted (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, with CEO Ben Kohn citing California's "anti-business" climate and high operational costs as key factors. The move is part of a growing trend of companies leaving California for states perceived as more business-friendly, such as Florida and Texas. The media and lifestyle brand plans to establish a new base in a luxury office complex and intends to open a new Playboy Club in the area. Miami Beach officials have welcomed the relocation, which marks a strategic return for the brand to South Florida.</p>

          <p>As Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska for his summit with President Donald Trump, he was greeted by a flyover of U.S. military aircraft. The display included F-35 and F-22 fighter jets as well as a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, the same type used in a recent strike on Iran's nuclear sites. The B-2 is a powerful symbol of American military might, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons on long-range missions.

          <p>Luke Sung, a James Beard-nominated chef, is sharing his side of a viral encounter with a TikTok influencer that he says ruined his reputation and led to the closure of his San Francisco restaurant, Kis Cafe. The influencer, Karla Marcotte, posted a video claiming Sung was rude and dismissive of her social media following. Sung contends that he questioned whether their audiences aligned after viewing her content and that Marcotte threatened him with consequences. The resulting online backlash forced the cafe to close, though it has since reopened under a new name with Sung's former partner.</p>

          <p>After a six-month pause and a legal challenge from over a dozen states, the Trump administration has agreed to resume funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The Department of Transportation has released new guidance that allows the $5 billion program, created by a 2021 bipartisan law, to proceed. However, the new rules strip several Biden-era requirements, such as mandating engagement with underserved communities and specific labor standards. While EV advocates and charging companies welcome the end of the funding freeze, many are frustrated by the lengthy and disruptive delay it caused to the nationwide buildout.</p>

          <p>This article explores a recent social media trend where videos of sorority recruitment dances are framed by right-wing commentators as something that makes liberals "seethe" with anger. Despite widespread claims of liberal outrage over these displays of traditional femininity and patriotism, the author finds no actual evidence of such reactions. Instead, the phenomenon appears to be driven by engagement-farming accounts on X that repost TikTok videos with incendiary captions to generate clicks and ad revenue. The narrative creates a culture war controversy where none actually exists, playing to a specific political audience for profit.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a tech analyst has described such an intervention as "essential" for national security. Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson argued that while government ownership of private companies is generally undesirable, it is necessary in this case to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. The potential deal, which could utilize funds from the CHIPS Act, aims to bolster domestic production of critical technology, a key priority for the administration amid growing concerns about the strategic importance of advanced semiconductors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell sharply by 14% after the company issued a disappointing financial forecast for the upcoming quarter. The weak guidance was attributed primarily to growing uncertainty and reduced demand from its business in China, as well as a slowdown in spending from leading-edge customers. Despite beating earnings and revenue estimates for the most recent quarter, the bleak outlook has concerned investors. Analysts noted that the uncertainty surrounding the company's China operations could persist, making it difficult for the stock to outperform in the near term (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a lower court's injunction that was blocking the Trump administration from conducting mass firings at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In a 2-1 decision, the court ruled that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to block the layoffs, setting the stage for the administration to proceed with its plan to fire 1,500 of the agency's 1,700 employees. The ruling will not take immediate effect, allowing opponents to seek a review by the full court.

The rising costs are not limited to homemade meals; the price of food served in school cafeterias has also increased by 3.3% since last July. In response, many parents are switching to store brands and choosing cheaper meal options to manage their budgets, as food costs have become a major source of financial stress for American families.</p>

          <p>PBS has approved a significant 21% budget cut for the public media company, a direct consequence of recent congressional legislation that stripped approximately $1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The CPB, which is now winding down its operations, provides crucial financial support to public television and radio stations across the country. In addition to the internal budget reduction, PBS will also decrease the dues it collects from its 350 member stations. These cuts are expected to have a severe impact, particularly on smaller stations and those serving rural communities, with some already announcing staff downsizing.</p>
