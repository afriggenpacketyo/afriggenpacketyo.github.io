        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brexit is back in the spotlight as the UK and EU explore revisions to their existing trade agreement, driven by the geopolitical shifts since the original deal. Both sides acknowledge the need for closer defense and security ties, particularly in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and concerns over US commitment to European security. Negotiations are focusing on narrowly defined changes, with the UK committed to staying out of the EU's customs union, single market, and free movement of people. Discussions include easing trade barriers, veterinary agreements, artist touring arrangements, and security pacts, with both sides aiming to highlight improved defense cooperation and streamlined travel for UK citizens in the EU. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ann Burgess, a psychiatric nursing professor from Massachusetts, is the subject of a new documentary detailing her groundbreaking work with the FBI in profiling serial killers. Starting in the 1960s, Burgess interviewed sexual assault victims, identifying behavioral patterns that helped the FBI understand how killers think, a shift from the traditional "just the facts" approach. Her work led to involvement in high-profile cases, and she faced sexism while changing the way law enforcement thought about sexual assault and murder. Now, Burgess works with her granddaughter, profiling school shooters and training nurses to recognize signs of sexual assault in dementia care facilities, continuing her legacy of crime analysis and prevention.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are becoming more severe, with climate change intensifying droughts and reducing summer rainfall, potentially doubling wildfire risk by 2100. A recent report highlights that about 60,000 forest fires occur annually in the EU, causing significant economic losses and impacting areas nearly twice the size of Luxemburg. Factors like increasing urbanization, abandoned farmland, and extensive monocultures of flammable trees contribute to the problem. The report suggests solutions such as controlled burning, ecosystem restoration, and public education to mitigate the risks, emphasizing that preventing fires is as important as fighting them and controlled fires can be part of a natural cycle.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, characterized by a high Gleason score and bone metastasis, according to Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel. The cancer is considered far advanced, presenting with urinary symptoms, and has a lower five-year survival rate. Treatment options include hormone therapy, radiation, and prostate removal, but bone pain is a concern. The doctor also mentions that if the cancer is caught early while still localized to the prostate gland, itâ€™s curable "most of the time."</p>

The economist, Hoe Ee Khor, notes that the US dollar is losing its status as the sole safe currency and that the yuan is increasingly used in cross-border purchase settlements. To further challenge the dollar, China needs to deepen its financial markets to allow easier foreign access to yuan-denominated assets and develop new yuan-backed asset classes.</p>

The Justice Department has launched "Operation Restore Justice" to address the crisis, but experts emphasize the need to remove the stigma around conversations about child sex abuse to encourage open dialogue and prevention. The FBI is also seeing an increase in risks to children due to advancements in AI technology and the pervasiveness of certain phone apps.

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate. The Gleason score is used to describe how prostate cancers look under a microscope; 9 and 10 are the most aggressive. The cancer is Stage 4, which means it has spread. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' pitching struggles persist, highlighted by Tony Gonsolin's bloodied hand during a loss to the Angels, resulting in a three-game series sweep. Despite a rally, the bullpen faltered, contributing to the team's ongoing injury problems. The team ranks 21st in the majors with a 4.22 team ERA. Manager Andrew Friedman acknowledges the challenges, stating that better protecting the clubâ€™s expensive stable of arms is â€œby far the No. 1 thing that keeps me up at night."</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidential election, defeating hard-right nationalist George Simion. The election, which followed months of political turbulence, saw a large voter turnout, with Dan securing 55% of the vote. While Simion initially claimed victory, Dan's win is seen as a repudiation of Simion's more skeptical approach to the EU and reaffirms Romania's pro-Western ties. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv.</p>
