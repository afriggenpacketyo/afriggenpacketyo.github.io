          <p>Addiction experts are warning that proposed cuts to addiction funding by Congress could lead to more overdose deaths. A letter signed by over 300 physicians, harm reduction workers, and researchers was sent to Congress, highlighting the potential "dire consequences" of these cuts. The letter notes that fatal overdoses decreased in 2024 due to sustained financial investment, emphasizing that now is not the time to reduce these investments. Experts are also concerned about potential cuts to Medicaid funding, which provides insurance coverage for addiction treatment.</p>

This move comes after Beijing and Washington agreed to unwind most tariffs imposed on each other's goods since early April.
