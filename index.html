          <p>A labor dispute involving Republic Services, a major private waste-management company, has led to strikes by sanitation workers in several American cities, including Boston, Massachusetts and Lacey, Washington. The Teamsters union, representing the workers, is demanding better pay and benefits, citing the high cost of living and claiming they are paid below industry standards. The strike has resulted in overflowing garbage, foul odors, and public health concerns, prompting some municipalities to sue the company for breach of contract. While some local disputes have been resolved, negotiations in other areas remain stalled, leaving residents and businesses to deal with the mounting waste.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County training facility, which killed three sheriff's deputies, is now under further scrutiny as officials confirmed a second grenade is missing. The deputies had recovered two grenades from a Santa Monica garage, believing them to be inert, before one detonated the next morning. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is leading the search for the missing explosive and a full investigation into the incident, which represents the department's largest loss of life since 1857. In response, the department has updated its policies to treat all explosive devices as live.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to remove all 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, according to a source familiar with the plan. This independent panel is responsible for recommending which preventive services, such as cancer screenings, must be covered by insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The source indicated that Kennedy views the group as overly influenced by progressive ideologies. While an HHS spokesperson stated that no final decision has been made, the move signals a potential major shift in the nation's approach to public health guidelines and insurance mandates.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled the preliminary design for its first commercial fourth-generation gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor, a significant step in its next-generation nuclear energy strategy. The reactor, named CFR-1000, is now awaiting final approval and is projected to become operational after 2030. This development places China among other major nuclear powers, like Russia and the United States, that are also developing advanced reactor technologies. The goal is to create a more fuel-efficient and sustainable source of power, marking a key milestone for China's national energy and atomic authorities.</p>

In a joint statement, the Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary described the bounties as an act of transnational repression and reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights and safety of Hong Kongers in the UK. The activists are accused of violating Beijing's national security law, and this is the latest in a series of such reward offers.

Chanting for the "fall of the regime," protesters criticized the jailing of opposition leaders, journalists, and activists, claiming the country has become an "open-air prison." Since dissolving parliament in 2021, Saied has consolidated power by ruling by decree and dismantling judicial bodies.

The warm conditions led to a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and created ideal conditions for butterflies to thrive, with many species being spotted weeks earlier than average. However, the associated lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying out wetland breeding grounds. The short-term boom contrasts with long-term research indicating a general decline in the UK's flying insect population.</p>

          <p>A Southern California man has been arrested on federal fraud charges for allegedly conning multiple people he met on dating apps out of more than $2 million. Prosecutors claim Christopher Earl Lloyd, 39, used platforms like Tinder and Bumble to find victims, whom he deceived by fabricating stories of his financial success and expertise as an investor. He allegedly convinced them to invest in bogus opportunities, promising regular returns, before using their money for his own purposes, including making a down payment on a Lexus. Lloyd faces 13 counts of wire fraud and one count of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.</p>

          <p>A feature article delves into President Donald Trump's multifaceted relationship with golf, portraying it as a business venture, a networking tool, and a fiercely competitive pursuit. Unlike past presidents who used the sport as a diversion, Trump leverages his golf courses to forge connections with political allies, business leaders, and foreign dignitaries. The article details his competitive nature on the course and his ownership of high-prestige properties like Turnberry in Scotland, which he uses to attract wealthy individuals. While his courses are not always profitable, they provide a private, influential setting for transactions and diplomacy away from public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity for her two-day, nine-hour interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, according to sources. This 'proffer immunity' allowed Maxwell to answer questions about Jeffrey Epstein's network without her statements being used against her, a common step when prosecutors seek cooperation. Her lawyer stated she was asked about roughly 100 different people and answered every question honestly, though no promises of clemency were made. The high-level meeting is unusual for a convicted trafficker and comes as the Justice Department faces pressure to provide more transparency on the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a critical mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. The disease spread from non-native animals brought into the region. In a rescue effort, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the state's last disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, protected mountain range. A recent check-in revealed that the relocated herd is not only surviving but also growing, with newborn lambs spotted, offering a monumental success and a sign of hope for the species' recovery in Texas.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, stating that Hamas's response showed a 'lack of desire' to reach a deal. The talks are deadlocked over conflicting demands: Hamas insists on a full Israeli withdrawal for the release of all hostages, while Israel refuses to end the war until Hamas is disarmed and removed from power. As diplomacy falters, the humanitarian crisis deepens, with the UN reporting that children are starving to death and facing deadly diseases due to Israel's blockade and the severe lack of aid, food, and sanitation.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas made a sudden, dramatic plunge shortly after takeoff, injuring two flight attendants. Passengers reported being lifted from their seats as the pilot executed an evasive maneuver to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft, believed to be a privately owned fighter jet. The pilot reportedly told passengers the plane's collision warning system activated after losing contact with air traffic control. The flight continued to its destination and landed safely, but the Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the serious incident.</p>

          <p>A feature article explores the validity and flexibility of popular daily health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps. Experts suggest that while these targets provide useful guidance, strict adherence isn't always necessary for a healthy life. For instance, thirst is generally a reliable indicator for hydration, and while seven to nine hours of sleep is crucial, consistency is key. The consensus among specialists is that individuals should use these recommendations as a guide rather than a rigid rule, adapting them to fit their personal lifestyle and focusing on overall consistency.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how elite competition uniquely affects the female body, moving away from treating athletes as 'mini-men.' Researchers are studying breast biomechanics, showing how proper sports bras can improve performance by reducing inefficient movement and stride length. Other studies are investigating the nuanced impact of the menstrual cycle on performance, fatigue, and injury risk, particularly for ACL injuries, which are more common in women. This growing body of research aims to optimize training, improve performance, and enhance the health and safety of female athletes.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the food aid boxes being distributed in Gaza by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised nutritional concerns among experts. While the boxes, containing items like pasta, chickpeas, and flour, may provide sufficient calories for survival, they are deficient in essential vitamins and minerals like iron, calcium, and vitamin C. Experts warn that a prolonged diet of these items could lead to 'hidden hunger' and diseases like anemia and scurvy. The aid also requires clean water and fuel for cooking, both of which are critically scarce in the territory.</p>

This adds a contemporary option to existing methods like PayPal and credit card payments on the 'Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt' page. The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion, having grown consistently for over two decades. While public donations have amounted to over $67 million since 1996, this represents a tiny fraction of the government's annual spending, making the new payment method a symbolic gesture of civic participation.</p>
