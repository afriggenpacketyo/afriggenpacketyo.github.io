          <p>Congressman Jim Himes appeared on "Face the Nation" to discuss the current budget bill, criticizing it for failing to address key American priorities such as tax relief for the middle class and deficit reduction, noting it adds trillions to the deficit while cutting essential programs. Himes also addressed the Russia-Ukraine war, urging the President to increase sanctions and continue arming Ukraine to maximize leverage against Putin, while cautioning against emulating Trump's approach. Additionally, Himes expressed concerns over the politicization of intelligence, referencing the situation with the Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua and the pressure exerted on analysts to align with political narratives, citing the dangers of distorting intelligence for political gain as a historical lesson learned from the Iraq War. The congressman stated that Joe Kent should not be confirmed for any position due to pressuring the National Intelligence Council to alter their conclusions.

          <p>Venezuela is holding an election for governor and legislators in Essequibo, a region internationally recognized as part of Guyana, a move seen as an attempt by President Nicolás Maduro to bolster nationalistic sentiment and consolidate power amid internal discontent. The election in Essequibo, which constitutes about two-thirds of Guyana and holds significant oil reserves, is viewed as a strategy to divert attention from Venezuela's ongoing political and economic crises. Guyana has tightened border security and threatened to arrest anyone supporting the election, while Venezuela's opposition has also historically supported claims to the region. The International Court of Justice has ordered Venezuela to refrain from electing officials to oversee the area, but Maduro has rejected the court's jurisdiction.

Barkley also dismissed concerns about player safety, asserting that the play is not inherently dangerous.

          <p>A New York Times article reveals that some Russian officials are joining a drone brigade called Kaskad to boost their careers while avoiding the dangers of frontline combat in Ukraine. This "V.I.P. unit" allows politically connected individuals to serve short stints in a relatively safe environment, take photo opportunities, and return home as war veterans, enhancing their career prospects. Commanded by a member of Parliament, Kaskad provides a way for Russian elites to sidestep statutory military service requirements and gain favor with the Kremlin.

          <p>President Trump has again criticized Harvard University following a judge's decision to block his administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. Trump claimed that some of Harvard's international students come from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education," demanding to know their identities. This attack follows a federal judge's temporary restraining order against the administration's revocation, which Harvard argued was a "blatant violation of the First Amendment." International students comprise about 27% of Harvard's student body and are typically ineligible for federal financial aid. The summary does not contain the phrase "optimism score."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A longtime West Point professor, Graham Parsons, resigned in protest of the Trump administration’s changes to the academy, objecting to the president’s use of his signature red Make America Great Again hat and the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Parsons, a philosophy professor specializing in military ethics, stated that the administration's orders were designed to indoctrinate rather than educate, censoring arguments and modifying syllabuses to align with the administration's ideology. He viewed these changes as a professional betrayal and a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education. Parsons' research agenda was effectively banned, leading him to conclude that he could no longer pursue important questions, prompting his resignation.

          <p>Lando Norris won the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a race lead and maintaining it through strategic pit stops. Charles Leclerc finished second, followed by Oscar Piastri in third, as the top three largely followed the same strategy. Max Verstappen, starting with a disadvantage in tire availability, ran an inverted strategy, delaying his final pit stop in hopes of a crash and red flag. Verstappen's strategy ultimately failed, forcing him to pit with one lap remaining and finishing fourth.

          <p>President Trump and his family have been accused of unprecedented monetization of the presidency, normalizing practices that once would have provoked significant backlash and official investigations. Examples include Melania Trump profiting from a promotional film, the family collecting millions from a new cryptocurrency, and the acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar. Critics argue that Trump has dismantled instruments of accountability, leading to a normalization of ethical norm-busting. While Democrats have attempted to highlight these activities, they have struggled to gain traction without official review mechanisms.
