          <p>Pentagon officials, including General Dan Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, defended the success of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, showcasing video evidence of "bunker-buster" bombs. This came amidst a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency report suggesting the strikes only delayed Iran's nuclear program by months. Hegseth criticized the media and accused them of misrepresenting the attack's impact, while Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard issued a statement asserting the nuclear sites were "destroyed," and CIA Director John Ratcliffe stated that Iran's nuclear program was "severely damaged." Final assessments are pending, but initial reports indicate significant destruction across all three targeted sites. The optimism score is based on the perceived success of the strikes despite conflicting reports.</p>

          <p>A group of 40 former world leaders, including ex-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, have issued a joint appeal for a "new economic coalition of the willing" to address escalating inequality, poverty, and environmental breakdown. The letter condemns "narrow unilateralism" and the "outdated" 1944 economic model, advocating for comprehensive debt relief, international tax cooperation, and reform of institutions like the IMF. They express optimism that a powerful shift is possible and call for a restoration of development aid and global minimum taxes on multinational profits. The former leaders identify major opportunities to advance their agenda at upcoming international conferences, emphasizing the need for global solutions to global problems.</p>

          <p>The Senate parliamentarian has dealt a blow to Senate Republicans by ruling that a key Medicaid provision in President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is out of order. The provision, which aimed to crack down on states' use of healthcare provider taxes to collect additional Medicaid funding, was deemed inconsistent with the rules governing the bill. This setback puts pressure on Republican leadership to either rework or scrap the provision to meet Trump's July 4th deadline for passage. The ruling necessitates potentially major revisions to the bill with limited time available.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Salvadorian migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia have filed an emergency motion requesting a federal judge to order his return to Maryland and prevent ICE from deporting him while his criminal case in Tennessee proceeds. This action follows a months-long legal battle regarding his status after he was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March, an event the Trump administration called an administrative error. Upon his return to the U.S., Abrego Garcia was immediately taken into custody for alleged federal crimes stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. The lawyers seek to ensure his return to Maryland upon release from criminal custody.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans relying on Medicaid are concerned that President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which mandates work requirements for Medicaid recipients in 40 states and D.C., could strip them of their health insurance. The bill requires enrollees to prove they are working, volunteering, or attending school for at least 80 hours a month, or qualify for an exemption. While Republicans argue this incentivizes employment, studies show most working-age enrollees already work, seek work, or have disabilities preventing employment. Critics argue the requirement imposes burdensome paperwork, potentially causing eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage, while supporters claim it integrates beneficiaries into their communities.</p>

          <p>The MAGA movement envisions an ideal American family with many children, a working father, and a stay-at-home mother, prompting policy proposals aimed at encouraging parents to stay home with kids. However, reversing decades-long trends in women's employment and convincing mothers to stay home may be challenging. Research suggests that simply increasing the child tax credit may not be enough to counteract economic forces driving women into the workforce. Some experts suggest that to truly incentivize stay-at-home motherhood, mothers would need to be financially compensated to a substantial degree to offset both financial and social incentives to work.</p>

          <p>Closing arguments are underway in the Sean "Diddy" Combs sex trafficking trial, with prosecutors arguing Combs used "power, violence and fear" to run a criminal enterprise involving sexual assault, kidnapping, and arson. Combs, who denies the allegations, faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted; he chose not to testify. The prosecution rested after calling 34 witnesses, including Cassie Ventura Fine, who testified about being pressured into participating in "freak-offs." Combs' attorneys argued Ventura Fine was a willing participant and that Combs' sexual habits do not constitute sex trafficking.</p>

Trump had previously criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell and expressed interest in candidates more aligned with his economic agenda.

          <p>The U.S. economy shrank faster than previously thought during the first three months of 2025, with GDP falling at an annual rate of 0.5%, marking the first contraction in three years. The decline was largely attributed to a surge in imports as companies rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs took effect. Consumer spending also slowed significantly, reaching its lowest level since the pandemic. Experts predict a rebound in the second quarter, but concerns remain about the long-term impact of tariffs on inflation and consumer behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential monthly payments from a $200,000 annuity purchased at age 65, noting that payouts vary based on factors like gender, annuity type, and interest rates. Current estimates suggest a 65-year-old man could receive around $1,294 per month, while a woman could receive approximately $1,240 per month. Joint life annuities offer lower monthly payments to ensure continued income for a surviving spouse. The article also advises considering liquidity needs and comparison shopping before purchasing an annuity, emphasizing its role as a personal pension for retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spain's Constitutional Court has upheld key provisions of the disputed amnesty law for Catalan separatists involved in the 2017 independence push. The ruling is considered a victory for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who agreed to the amnesty in exchange for parliamentary support. However, the ruling does not directly benefit former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, as he faces embezzlement charges. The court stated that amnesty is not banned by the Constitution when it addresses an exceptional situation and serves a legitimate public interest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of South Carolina's attempt to bar Planned Parenthood from participating in its Medicaid program. The court found that Planned Parenthood and a patient cannot sue the state under federal civil rights law to enforce a provision of the Medicaid Act allowing beneficiaries to choose their provider. The ruling reverses a lower court decision and is expected to allow more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. The dissenting justices argued that the decision weakens civil rights protections and deprives Medicaid recipients of their freedom to choose their healthcare provider.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that states can exclude Planned Parenthood clinics from providing medical screenings and healthcare for women on Medicaid.
