          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 12:11:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military recently executed its eighth known strike against an alleged drug vessel, this time operating in the Pacific waters off South America, resulting in two to three fatalities aboard. This incident follows seven previous interdictions in the Caribbean, bringing the total deaths from such U.S. strikes to at least 34 individuals since early September. The Trump administration has publicly justified these aggressive actions by declaring a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, contending that the substantial number of American deaths caused by smuggled narcotics constitutes an "armed attack" against the nation. This controversial policy underscores an expanding strategy to disrupt international drug trafficking routes, raising complex questions about legal frameworks, military engagement, and the treatment of those apprehended in these high-stakes operations.</p>

          <p>Australia secured a six-wicket victory over England in the Women's Cricket World Cup, despite an early top-order collapse that saw them at 24-3 and 68-4. A remarkable 180-run partnership between Annabel Sutherland, who also took three wickets, and Ash Gardner, who scored a sensational 104 from 73 balls, ultimately led the defending champions to victory with 9.3 overs remaining. England's Tammy Beaumont top-scored with 78, but a middle-order slowdown hampered their efforts, resulting in a total of 244-9. This match, though both teams had already qualified for the semi-finals, underscored Australia's astonishing batting depth and their formidable status as a cricket powerhouse.</p>

          <p>Beyond Meat shares experienced significant volatility, slashing earlier triple-digit gains and briefly dipping into negative territory as a meme stock rally faltered. The plant-based food company's stock, which had surged 111% in premarket trading and 127% on Monday due to its inclusion in a meme stock ETF and a short squeeze, closed Tuesday up 146%. However, Wednesday saw the stock struggling to maintain momentum, reflecting the unpredictable nature of meme-driven trading. This recent surge follows a prolonged period of decline for Beyond Meat, which has seen its share price fall dramatically since its 2019 IPO, highlighting the speculative risks in the current market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chapter 13 bankruptcy, often called a wage earner's plan, does not require filers to surrender all their income, dispelling a common misconception. Instead, it mandates that only "disposable income"—what remains after covering reasonable and necessary living expenses—be directed toward a repayment plan over three to five years. The bankruptcy court assesses a detailed budget to determine affordable monthly payments, allowing individuals to maintain a basic standard of living. This option is particularly beneficial for those with regular income who are behind on secured debts like mortgages, or who earn too much for Chapter 7, offering a structured path to financial stability while protecting assets.

          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, has contributed $22 million to the planned White House ballroom project as part of a legal settlement with former President Donald Trump. This settlement, recorded in federal court, stems from Trump's ban from YouTube after the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot. The funds are designated for the Trust for the National Mall to support the ballroom's construction, which has an estimated cost of $250 million. Public anger arose this week over images showing the demolition of a portion of the White House's East Wing for the project, despite Trump's previous assurances that taxpayers would not bear the cost and that the structure would not be touched.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued an advisory opinion stating that Israel is legally obligated to facilitate humanitarian aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip by the United Nations and its agencies. The court emphasized the necessity of meeting the basic needs of Palestinian civilians and rejected Israel's unsubstantiated allegations against the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) regarding neutrality and Hamas ties. While this opinion is non-binding, it carries significant moral and diplomatic weight, reinforcing international calls for unimpeded aid access. Israel, however, has dismissed the opinion as "political" and maintains its refusal to cooperate with UNRWA, intensifying the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump suggested the Department of Justice (DOJ) owes him a significant amount of money for past federal investigations, including the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case and the Russia probe.

Trump stated he is "not looking for money" for himself but would donate any funds to charity or White House restoration, including the ongoing ballroom construction.

The cuts, representing over 1% of its workforce, are part of an effort to streamline management functions ahead of its third-quarter earnings announcement.

This trend, exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of deepfake technology, risks eroding public trust in visual evidence and traditional arbiters of truth.

          <p>Drone attacks, reportedly launched by Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have apparently delayed the planned reopening of Khartoum International Airport, which had been shuttered for over 18 months due to civil war. Residents reported explosions near the airport, leading airline sources to confirm a multi-day delay. The reopening was intended to signal the government's full control of the capital, with President Abdel Fattah al-Burhan pushing for a return to normalcy and international flights. However, the RSF leader had warned of shooting down planes suspected of supporting the army, underscoring the ongoing intense conflict and humanitarian crisis, particularly in regions like Darfur.</p>

          <p>Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok streamer, is set to appear in federal court after being charged with assaulting a federal officer, following an incident where he was shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Authorities allege Parias rammed his car into agents' vehicles during an immigration enforcement operation, causing them to fear for their safety. The operation, part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, also resulted in a U.S. deputy marshal being wounded by a ricochet bullet. Parias's lawyer stated he was denied access to his client and was unaware of the federal charges, raising concerns about legal representation and due process.</p>

          <p>The ongoing demolition of the White House East Wing for former President Trump's planned ballroom project includes the first lady's office and numerous other workspaces, according to sources. This contradicts Trump's earlier assurances that the project would not interfere with the existing building. Offices for the White House visitors' office, legislative affairs, and military office, along with storage areas, are being razed, with staff relocated. The East Wing, originally built in 1902 and renovated in 1942, is slated for reconstruction as part of this $250 million, privately funded modernization effort, expected to be completed before Trump's term ends.</p>

          <p>A child abuse expert, along with three survivors, has withdrawn from a national inquiry into grooming gangs in the UK, citing concerns over "political opportunism and point-scoring" and the backgrounds of potential inquiry chairs. The expert, Mr. Gamble, and survivors raised issues about candidates having policing or social work backgrounds, given these services' past failures in bringing abusers to justice. Jess, a survivor who was sexually assaulted between ages 12-17, expressed deep shock and concern that officials were steering the inquiry away from its specific focus on grooming gangs. This highlights significant challenges in establishing a credible and victim-centered inquiry amidst political tensions.</p>

          <p>Manchester Pride, one of the UK's largest LGBT events, has entered voluntary liquidation, throwing its future into significant doubt. The charity confirmed its financial insolvency, citing rising costs, declining ticket sales, and an ambitious format refresh as contributing factors. Thousands of pounds are owed to performers and businesses, with at least one headliner unpaid for an August performance. The government's Charity Commission is assessing concerns, while Manchester City Council has pledged to support a new chapter for the event next August. This unfortunate development highlights the financial fragility even of established cultural events, leaving many stakeholders with losses.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for Prince Andrew to appear before MPs to give evidence regarding his lease of Royal Lodge, urging greater transparency into royal finances. Documents reveal the Prince paid a large upfront sum for a 75-year lease, effectively buying out future rent obligations, and has only paid a token annual rent. This arrangement, which former Crown Estate commissioner Lord Curry defends as honor-bound, has been criticized as a "rotten deal" by Baroness Margaret Hodge, who advocates for clearer scrutiny of all Crown properties. The calls for testimony intensify amidst Andrew's recent relinquishing of titles and renewed scrutiny over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

This generational reckoning follows concerns over long-serving politicians, exemplified by figures like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Dianne Feinstein, who remained in office late in life, and President Biden's recent debate performance. Younger activists and candidates are pushing for new blood and "bold, sweeping economic change," arguing that the old guard has become detrimental to the party's ability to respond effectively to current challenges.

          <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has clarified that the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas applies specifically to new applicants living abroad who are not current H-1B visa holders. This fee, imposed in September by the Trump administration, is intended to curb alleged abuse of the program and encourage hiring American workers. However, it does not apply to individuals seeking to change their visa status within the U.S., such as transitioning from an F-1 student visa to H-1B. While the administration anticipates improved job prospects for U.S. technology workers, some economists suggest H-1B workers can also stimulate additional domestic job creation.

          <p>A new study reveals that 90% of working Americans intend to disregard the common financial advice of waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which would ensure higher monthly payments. While most understand the trade-offs, only 10% plan to delay, with 44% expecting to file before their full retirement age of 67. This disconnect stems from financial necessity, a shortfall in personal retirement savings, and concerns about Social Security's long-term future. Many prioritize immediate income or consider their life expectancy, opting for earlier, albeit reduced, benefits rather than waiting for a larger monthly check later. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics view the election as a "coronation," raising concerns about fairness.
