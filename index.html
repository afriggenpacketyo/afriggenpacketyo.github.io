          <p>Max Verstappen won the Japanese Grand Prix after a challenging race where McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri closely pursued him. Norris voiced concerns about Verstappen's driving, but stewards sided with the champion. Despite Piastri's impressive pace and suggestion he could overtake Verstappen, McLaren maintained team order. Verstappen expressed satisfaction with his car's improved performance, while Norris acknowledged McLaren's need for further improvements. The race saw Ferrari's Charles Leclerc hold off Russell for fourth, and Antonelli briefly led, setting records as the youngest driver to lead a Formula 1 race and set the fastest lap.</p>

          <p>The nearly 30-year-old case of missing Iowa news anchor Jodi Huisentruit is seeing renewed attention as authorities continue their search. A private investigator is pushing to unseal case records, specifically those related to GPS tracking devices on vehicles linked to a person of interest, John Vansice. A judge has partially unsealed a search warrant but kept the supporting affidavit sealed to protect the ongoing investigation. Huisentruit's family opposes unsealing the documents, fearing it could hinder the investigation, which began after her disappearance in June 1995 when signs of a struggle were found near her car.</p>

          <p>Livia Tossici-Bolt, a prominent anti-abortion campaigner, was found guilty of breaching a Public Spaces Protection Order for holding signs outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth. Supporters, including JD Vance and the Alliance Defending Freedom, have misrepresented the case as a free speech issue, while critics argue it's about protecting women from harassment. A British judge ruled Tossici-Bolt had breached a buffer zone and ordered her to pay Â£20,026 in costs, stating she lacked insight into the impact of her actions. The case highlights the tension between free speech and the right of women to access medical treatment without harassment.</p>

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were denied entry to Israel, sparking criticism from Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who deemed the move unacceptable. Israeli authorities claimed the MPs intended to spread hate speech, a charge the MPs denied, stating their aim was to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory firsthand. The MPs said the trip was organized with UK charities experienced in parliamentary delegations, while Israel's immigration authority said the delegation had not been acknowledged by any Israeli official. Both MPs have been vocal about the Israel-Hamas conflict in Parliament, advocating for compliance with international humanitarian law and criticizing Israel's actions.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese seismologists warns of a heightened risk of major earthquakes in China and neighboring regions, linking seismic cycles to fluctuations in the Earth's rotation. The research, published shortly before a devastating earthquake struck Myanmar, analyzed 150 years of seismic data to identify six major earthquake active periods. These periods correlate with shifts in the Earth's rotational speed and corresponding tectonic stress realignments. The timing of the research has sparked debate about whether the planet's tectonic stress fields are entering a dangerous new phase.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, 'Underdogs', challenges common perceptions of the white working class, arguing that their distinctiveness is rooted more in geography than ethnicity. The author highlights the neglect of smaller towns outside metropolitan areas, where many white workers live, leading to limited social mobility and opportunities. While white workers are more opposed to immigration than their middle-class counterparts, opinions vary widely, with age being a stronger predictor of attitudes. The article also critiques the left's neglect of class politics, allowing parties with regressive policies to portray themselves as champions of working-class interests.</p>

          <p>Amidst Donald Trump's escalating tariffs and a potential global trade war, Britain should resist making damaging concessions and instead collaborate with the G7 (excluding the US), the EU, and Asia to sustain a rules-based global trading system.

This association could be extended to a newly relevant commonwealth, aiming for mutual tariffs, market access rules, reciprocal sanctions on US service exports, and a joint approach to challenging US monopoly digital platforms.</p>

The Shandong conducted joint maneuvers with naval and aerial units to the southeast of Taiwan, including the Type 055 destroyer Xianyang.

          <p>Esther Ghey, mother of Brianna Ghey, has criticized the government's approach to online safety, expressing frustration that young people are losing their lives due to online content. Brianna was murdered by two 15-year-olds, one of whom had been watching violent content online. Ghey warned that the Online Safety Bill, which aims to protect young people online, could be weakened to secure trade terms with the US. She has called for tougher action, including restricting social media access for children under 16, to address the mental health struggles caused by online content.</p>

          <p>Sarah A Boardman, the artist behind an official portrait of Donald Trump, says his public criticism is negatively impacting her business. Trump described Boardman's portrait as "truly the worst" in a Truth Social post, leading to its removal from the Denver State Capitol Gallery of Presidents. Boardman stated that her business is now in "danger of not recovering" due to the president's comments. The British-born artist had painted the portrait for the Denver State Capitol Gallery of Presidents, where it hung for six years.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's 10% tariff on imports from numerous countries, including the UK, has taken effect, causing turmoil in global markets. China has responded with countermeasures, including tariffs on US goods and export curbs on rare earth minerals. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is consulting with foreign leaders, acknowledging the potential damage of a trade war. Experts predict the tariffs will evolve as countries negotiate lower rates, but describe the change as a "seismic" shift in global trade.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban has warned that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs, combined with DOGE cuts, could cause long-term economic harm "far worse" than the 2008 financial crisis. Cuban suggested the policies could lead to a deeper recession, citing inflationary pressures and workforce reductions. The DOGE office has targeted agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the IRS's tax evasion enforcement wing for cuts. During the 2008 financial crisis, the country's GDP declined by more than 4%, the unemployment rate reached 10%, and the housing market crashed.</p>
