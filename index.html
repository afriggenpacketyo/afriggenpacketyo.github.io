          <p>Two fathers, David Stancombe and Sergio Aguiar, are running the London Marathon in memory of their daughters, Alice, Elsie, and Bebe, who tragically passed away at a dance class in Southport last year. They are raising money for projects established in their daughters' names, with Stancombe supporting Elsie's Story, a charitable trust for young people, and Aguiar building a playground dedicated to Alice and Bebe at Churchtown Primary School. The fathers express that their daughters will be with them in spirit as they undertake the 26.2-mile challenge, and their efforts are being supported by the girls' families. The community is rallying behind them, wearing t-shirts and hoodies featuring Elsie's Story logo to cheer them on during the race.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had the encrypted messaging app Signal installed on a computer in his Pentagon office to facilitate easier communication, especially in areas with poor cell service or where personal phones are restricted. This arrangement allows him to send and receive instant messages more conveniently. Hegseth has two computers in his office, one for personal use and one government-issued, and he had cables installed to connect a private computer to Signal in early March. The use of Signal was first reported by the Washington Post, highlighting concerns about security protocols.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with wounded veterans in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump noticed a "Let's Go Brandon" sticker and shared a lighthearted moment with a veteran who confirmed it was a picture of Joe Biden. The phrase, originating from a 2021 NASCAR interview, has become a popular way to criticize the former president. Following the sticker exchange, Trump addressed the veterans and their families, expressing his admiration for their service. The event also marked the rollout of new executive orders, including reforms to higher education accreditation and measures to enhance artificial intelligence education.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges related to his former son-in-law's employment at an airline. Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law, Seo, was hired as an executive director at Thai Eastar Jet despite lacking relevant experience, in exchange for the airline's CEO leading a state-funded agency. Seo received approximately $150,000 in salary and housing support between 2018 and 2020, which prosecutors consider bribes intended for Moon. This indictment comes amid a series of prosecutions against officials from Moon's administration, with his party condemning the prosecution as politically motivated.</p>

During his tenure, he engineered an economic transformation that shifted the country from reliance on tin, rubber, and palm oil to a major high-tech exporter.

The Pakistani government has adopted a measured tone, emphasizing its lack of interest in escalating tensions, but concern is growing as Indian officials hint at military responses. India has already announced punitive measures against Pakistan, including the suspension of a critical water treaty, citing Pakistan's support of terrorist activities.

          <p>The United States is reinforcing the "first island chain" to deter China by deploying strategic bombers and other weapons in the region. The first of at least two US B-1B strategic bombers recently arrived in Japan to participate in joint exercises and operate out of the US military base in Misawa for several months. This move is part of a containment strategy to restrict Chinese military access to the Pacific Ocean, which has become increasingly important as tensions between the two countries have escalated. The deployment signals US resolve to Beijing, particularly as the Trump administration appears to be disengaging from Europe and NATO.</p>

          <p>Indonesia has committed to maintaining "balanced and constructive" relationships with both China and the United States, signaling a careful neutrality in the face of increasing global tensions. This pledge follows high-level defense and foreign policy discussions in Beijing, marking the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia. Analysts suggest this non-alignment strategy allows Jakarta to preserve its strategic flexibility while reinforcing its position as a regional power broker. The new 2+2 dialogue mechanism could serve as a valuable communication channel between Jakarta and Beijing, particularly during regional contingencies.</p>

Economic issues are contributing to the decline, with only 38% approving of his handling of the economy, compared to 56% who disapprove.

          <p>City leaders in Uvalde have approved a $2 million settlement for families of the victims of the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting, marking the first financial compensation in the myriad of lawsuits filed. The settlement will be distributed among the 21 families who lost loved ones in the tragedy, and also includes enhanced training for city police officers and expanded mental health services for the community. The settlement also establishes May 24 as an annual day of remembrance and creates a permanent memorial in the city plaza.

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg announced that China has stopped accepting deliveries of Boeing aircraft due to the ongoing trade war with the United States. Some 737 Max planes destined for Chinese airlines have been returned to the US, and Boeing is considering redirecting future deliveries to other customers. Despite this setback, Ortberg emphasized that Boeing will not allow the situation to derail the company's recovery, as there is strong demand for the Max aircraft from other airlines. This announcement followed Boeing's report of a narrower-than-expected loss for the first quarter, with airplane deliveries surging during the period.</p>

          <p>In Japan, foreigners who overstay their visas often face the stigma of being treated as common criminals, raising questions about the fairness of this approach. Many individuals come to Japan as short-term visitors or technical interns and stay past their visa expiration dates, often due to unavoidable circumstances such as job loss or exploitation. While authorities focus on identifying and deporting those who overstay, some advocate for a more nuanced approach, recognizing that not having regular residency status should not equate to criminal behavior. Efforts are underway to promote more neutral terms, such as "irregular stay" or "unregistered stay," to reduce prejudice against immigrants and refugees.</p>
