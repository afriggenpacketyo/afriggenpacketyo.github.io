          <p>After a 16-year hiatus, the iconic British band Oasis has launched their reunion tour, "Live '25," with a performance at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. The tour's announcement sparked immense global interest, selling around 900,000 tickets despite controversy over Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing, which led to an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. The band, featuring brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher alongside other former members, is performing a setlist of their classic hits but has no plans for new music. This tour is being described by their management as their "last time around," marking a significant, albeit final, chapter for their fans.</p>

          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, have left seven people unaccounted for. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday evening, triggered mandatory evacuations and sparked multiple grass fires covering approximately 80 acres. Two individuals were confirmed injured, and families are anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones who were believed to be working at the facility. Investigations have revealed that the company, while holding a state license, lacked the necessary local permits to store fireworks on the agricultural property, raising significant regulatory questions.</p>

          <p>Alabama has set a September 25 execution date for Geoffrey Todd West, who was convicted of the 1997 murder of convenience store clerk Margaret Parrish Berry. West will be executed using nitrogen gas, a method Alabama was the first state to implement last year. He was found guilty of killing Berry during a robbery in Attalla, where he shot her in the back of the head while she was on the floor. The judge in his 1999 sentencing described the killing as a deliberate, "execution style" act, leading to the death penalty recommendation which the judge upheld.</p>

          <p>A recent profile in The Atlantic examines the significant influence of Russell Vought, a key figure in the Trump administration's efforts to fundamentally reshape the federal government. While not the direct author of the new tax and spending bill, the legislation is said to strongly reflect his vision for federal operations and conservative principles. Vought's ideology and strategic approach are central to the administration's push for a more streamlined and ideologically aligned government workforce and policy framework. The article delves into his role and the broader implications of his policy goals for the future of American governance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed President Trump's extensive tax and spending package in a 218-214 vote, sending the legislation to his desk. The passage followed days of intense negotiations, with President Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson personally intervening to persuade Republican holdouts to support the bill. The legislation, a cornerstone of Trump's domestic agenda, was finalized just ahead of his self-imposed July Fourth deadline. To celebrate the bill's signing, the White House has planned a flyover of B-2 bombers, which Trump stated will coincide with the official signing ceremony.</p>

The assessment covers the government's progress on economic growth, where results have been modest, and its handling of migration, where net numbers have fallen but small boat crossings have increased. On the international stage, the government has managed its relationship with the U.S. and reset ties with the EU, though critics argue for more decisive action on various fronts.

Experts from Canine Companions advise against taking pets to fireworks displays due to their sensitive hearing. To help dogs cope, it is recommended to exercise them earlier in the day to tire them out both physically and mentally. For dogs known to be anxious, creating a safe, secure space at home, closing windows, and using white noise or calming music can help muffle the sounds. Providing engaging toys like a frozen Kong can also serve as a welcome distraction during the noisy festivities.</p>

In a social media post, she criticized the political establishment and argued for a stark choice between "socialism or barbarism." While Corbyn has hinted at such a move, he has not officially confirmed his involvement, but the development signals a significant fracturing on the left of British politics.</p>

          <p>The Georgia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans has filed a lawsuit against the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, arguing that its plan to create a new exhibit violates state law. The proposed "truth-telling" exhibit would detail the park's ties to slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, and segregation, providing historical context for its massive Confederate monument. The lawsuit also contests the relocation of Confederate flags from a park trail. This legal challenge comes after the park's board voted for the changes in 2021 as part of a nationwide reckoning with racial history, setting up a clash over the interpretation and preservation of Confederate symbols.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, clearing the way for the deportation of eight men from a U.S. military base in Djibouti to South Sudan. This is a country with which most of the men have no connection. The 7-2 decision reinforces a recent ruling that allows the government to deport migrants to third countries without the extensive due process requirements previously imposed by a lower court. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the majority, stating the order gives the administration special treatment and sends the men to face potential torture or death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article outlines a strategy to improve insurance coverage for popular anti-obesity drugs like GLP-1s, which are currently unaffordable for most Americans. The author suggests a simplified pricing model where drug manufacturers charge employer-sponsored health plans the same direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month, eliminating complex rebates. Employers could then cover a portion of this cost, bringing the employee's out-of-pocket expense down to a more manageable level, similar to prices in other countries. This approach would increase access to clinically important medications and could be a transformative step for public health in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key provision in the newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" introduces a temporary tax exemption on tips for many U.S. workers. The law allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their taxable income, a policy championed by President Trump during his campaign. However, this benefit is not permanent and is set to expire at the end of 2028 unless extended by Congress. The exemption is also phased out for individuals earning over $150,000 a year to prevent high earners from exploiting the system. While fulfilling a political promise, Democrats universally opposed the package, citing its deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An undercover investigation by the BBC has exposed a thriving black market for illegal cigarettes across the UK, with many high street shops openly selling untaxed and counterfeit tobacco. The trade is not only costing the UK government billions in lost revenue but is also linked to serious international organized crime, including human trafficking. Criminology experts describe the networks as a "golden thread" for understanding organized crime, with some shops allegedly staffed by illegal workers. The report suggests that underfunded Trading Standards teams are struggling to combat the problem, which is eroding public trust and contributing to a sense of national decline.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's landmark tax-and-spending bill was a testament to his influence, requiring intense political maneuvering to unite a fractured Republican party. The journey involved late-night negotiations, direct intervention from Trump to sway holdouts, and the addition of targeted benefits to secure key votes from senators like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Despite conservative concerns over the bill's impact on the national deficit and cuts to Medicaid, Speaker Mike Johnson held a procedural vote open for a record seven hours to ensure its progression. The process showcased the formidable pressure the administration can exert to achieve its legislative priorities against significant internal opposition.</p>

The suspension means he must return the next day to potentially play just a single game, denying him a full day of rest. Shelton's frustration was compounded by the fact that he had reportedly asked for play to be stopped before the third set began.</p>

The author posits that the declaration is rooted more in a desire to restore the colonists' inherited rights as Englishmen and in the overarching biblical tradition of Western civilization. The famous line "all men are created equal" is presented not as a self-evident rationalist claim, but as a truth derived from the biblical concept of man being created in God's image. This perspective reframes the founding as an act of preserving and improving a political and moral inheritance, rather than a radical break from collectivism.</p>
