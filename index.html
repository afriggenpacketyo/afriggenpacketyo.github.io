          <p>Erin Patterson, on trial for the alleged murder of three relatives via poisonous mushrooms, testified that she foraged for wild mushrooms during the Covid pandemic, developing a preference for their enhanced flavor. Prosecutors argue she deliberately included death cap mushrooms in a meal served to her in-laws and their sister-in-law, all of whom later died. Patterson denies the charges, claiming it was a terrible accident, stating that she also foraged with her children and bought a food dehydrator to preserve the mushrooms. She also testified about strained relations with her husband and in-laws regarding financial matters, denying she had ovarian cancer, despite allegedly claiming this to her lunch guests. Optimism surrounding the case is minimal due to the serious charges and tragic deaths involved.</p>

          <p>Two Japanese men were murdered in Dalian, China, allegedly by a Chinese business associate, according to Chinese authorities and the Japanese Embassy in Beijing. The suspect, a long-term resident of Japan, was detained in connection with the deaths, which stemmed from a business dispute. The Japanese Consulate General in Shenyang was notified of the killings, and the Japanese government stated the incident was not politically motivated. The city of Dalian, which has close ties to Japan, hosts a significant number of Japanese businesses and residents, and the killings follow other recent incidents involving Japanese nationals in China.

          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecasts that U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year, down from 2.8% the previous year, citing disruptions from President Donald Trump's trade wars. These policies have reportedly increased average U.S. tariff rates to their highest level since 1938, raising costs for consumers and manufacturers. The OECD also projects a further slowdown to 1.5% in 2026, and world economic growth is expected to decelerate to 2.9% this year and remain at that level. The report notes that increased trade barriers and policy uncertainty have negatively impacted business and consumer confidence, hindering trade and investment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An independent review of England and Wales' water sector has found systemic failures requiring stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. Led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Water Commission highlighted issues including pollution, financial mismanagement, and infrastructure failures, shaking public trust. The review calls for clearer government direction, better long-term investment, and stronger local community input, with new legislation potentially needed. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the system as broken and promised a full government response, signaling a need for significant reforms and increased accountability within the water industry.</p>

          <p>Many popular holiday destinations are struggling with the environmental impact of high visitor numbers, described as overtourism, which negatively affects the quality of life for locals and visitors. Overtourism stretches infrastructure, disrupts local ecosystems, and threatens water resources, with emissions from tourism contributing significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. Some cities and regions are implementing measures such as limiting traveler numbers, imposing taxes, and promoting attractions outside city centers. Copenhagen is trying a different approach by rewarding more climate-friendly travellers, with those arriving by train able to access free rental bikes, yoga lessons, guided tours and reduced admission prices.</p>

          <p>Thames Water's future is uncertain after KKR, a US private equity firm, withdrew from plans to invest Â£4bn into the company, which serves a quarter of the UK's population.

Sources suggest that the politicization of the water industry served as a disincentive for investors.

          <p>During the Spanish Grand Prix, Red Bull ordered Max Verstappen to cede his fourth-place position after an incident with George Russell in Turn One, believing a penalty was imminent. However, stewards later ruled that Russell had lost control and collided with Verstappen, who did not deliberately leave the track, negating the need for a penalty. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner admitted that with hindsight, the decision to pit Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car was also a mistake, stating they should have left him out on his soft tires. Horner noted the difficulty in making subjective calls without clear direction from race control.</p>

          <p>Beijing has intensified its warnings regarding the cutthroat price wars among carmakers in China, highlighting concerns about deflationary pressures in the country's economy. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), state media, and a carmaker association have voiced concerns over recent discounts, deeming price wars a threat to product quality and long-term industry development. The MIIT emphasized that such competition hinders sustained investment in research and development, ultimately affecting product quality and service levels. People's Daily described the domestic carmaking sector as being in a "sub-healthy" state, pointing to its shrinking profit margin due to industrial overcapacity.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply cut its economic growth forecast for the U.S. to just 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2026, citing the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Factors contributing to the downgrade include elevated economic policy uncertainty, a slowdown in net immigration, and a smaller federal workforce. Global growth is also expected to be lower than previously forecast, with the OECD noting that the slowdown is concentrated in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The OECD adjusted its inflation forecast, saying higher trade costs will push up inflation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The BBC has discovered that food listings on TikTok Shop are potentially endangering consumers by failing to list allergen information, a legal requirement for UK businesses. Sellers are offering snacks and sweets without highlighting the presence of the 14 main allergens, prompting warnings from allergy organizations. TikTok stated it is committed to providing a safe shopping experience and removed highlighted listings, but the BBC found sellers still offering products without full allergen details. Allergy charities are calling for more stringent measures to ensure consumer safety and compliance with labeling standards.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent investigation into the deaths of dozens of Palestinians near an aid distribution site in Gaza, stating it is unacceptable for Palestinians to risk their lives for food.

The Gaza Health Ministry reported that Israeli forces once again fired on civilians trying to collect aid in Rafah, killing at least 24 people.

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. Lee, who lost to Yoon Suk Yeol in the 2022 election, currently holds a lead in opinion polling, and an electoral win for the Democratic Party candidate would set him up to be the country's next leader. Eurasia Group stated that Lee is likely to pursue a more left-leaning agenda in office, and Goldman Sachs noted that both Lee and Kim Moon Soo share similar goals but differ in their economic policy platforms. Regardless of the election outcome, the South Korean won is likely to appreciate against the U.S. dollar.</p>

This comes after US President Donald Trump stated that it would be "unfair" for the US if Tesla built a factory in India.

The government plans to increase production of submarines and weapons, learn from Ukraine's drone warfare, and establish a cyber command to counter Russia-linked attacks.
