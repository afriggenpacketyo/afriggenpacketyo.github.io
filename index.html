          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures, China's industrial profits demonstrated a faster pace of growth in April, marking the second consecutive month of increases, according to official data. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms rose by 3%, an acceleration from the 2.6% growth observed in March, with high-tech manufacturing and equipment sectors leading the gains. This growth comes even after the U.S. imposed substantial tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory measures from Beijing, though recent agreements have eased some of these levies. While some industries, such as automobiles and apparel, faced headwinds, private and foreign-invested enterprises saw profit improvements, demonstrating resilience in the face of external shocks.

          <p>A federal judge expressed frustration with the government's failure to provide due process to a group of migrants being held in Djibouti while facing deportation to South Sudan. Judge Brian E. Murphy criticized the logistical challenges of holding immigration proceedings on another continent, suggesting the government could return the men to the United States if remote proceedings proved too difficult. The judge's criticism reflects growing frustration in a contentious case involving the Trump administration and federal courts regarding the due process rights of migrants facing deportation to third countries. Despite the judge's orders, lawyers for the migrants have been denied phone access to their clients.</p>

          <p>A recent study has revealed that certain beers brewed in the United States contain elevated levels of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), commonly known as "forever chemicals," exceeding the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) allowed limits. Researchers from the ACS' Environmental Science & Technology discovered that beers brewed in North Carolina, California, and Michigan had the highest concentrations of PFAS, with a strong correlation between PFAS levels in municipal drinking water and the beer. While breweries have water filtration systems, they are not designed to prevent PFAS from entering the batch, and international beers tested showed lower levels of PFAS. The research team suggests that drinking water is a primary route of PFAS contamination in beer.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 34 years, Japan has lost its position as the world's leading creditor, with Germany now holding the top spot, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite an increase in Japan's net external assets to a record high, partly due to a weaker yen, Germany's gross external assets surpassed Japan's. The yen's depreciation boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. While Japan's external liabilities also climbed, the United States holds a net external liability, indicating its foreign debts exceed its overseas assets. (not investment advice)</p>

Other Chinese automakers also saw their shares decline as investors grew cautious about the potential for a price war.

The move comes amid significant challenges facing the global motor industry, including tariffs on imported cars, rising material costs, and slower sales in Europe. Volvo's CEO cited the "challenging period" faced by the industry as the reason for the layoffs, which represent about 15% of its white-collar workforce. This announcement follows a previous scaling back of the company's ambition to go fully electric by 2030, due to uncertainties created by recent tariffs on EVs.</p>

Trump's social media post also accused Harvard of being slow to provide information on foreign student lists, which the administration claims is necessary to identify potential security risks.

The 10 inmates initially broke out of the jail on May 16 by forcing open a cell door and breaching a wall, with the escape going unnoticed for several hours.

          <p>A Canadian man, Jeffrey Wood, has been sentenced to nearly two years in prison for stealing a famous photograph of Winston Churchill, known as "The Roaring Lion," from Ottawa's Château Laurier hotel. Wood pleaded guilty to stealing the original print, taken by Yousuf Karsh in 1941, and admitted to forgery after replacing the photograph with a fake. The photo, which features on the UK £5 note, was recovered last year in Genoa, Italy, in the possession of a private buyer unaware of its theft. The judge emphasized the breach of trust in stealing such a piece of national pride, while Wood's lawyer deemed the sentence unnecessarily harsh for a first-time offender.</p>

          <p>A report from the Lowy Institute warns that the world's poorest nations are facing a "tidal wave of debt" as repayments to China reach record highs in 2025. The report indicates that the poorest 75 countries are set to make a combined US$22 billion in debt repayments to China, shifting China's lending position from a net provider of financing to a net drain. This pressure from Chinese state lending, along with repayments to international private creditors, is jeopardizing spending on hospitals, schools, and climate change initiatives in developing economies. The report also raises concerns about China potentially leveraging these debts for geopolitical influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for sports team owners, potentially worth hundreds of millions, by reducing the deductible value of intangible assets like player contracts and media rights. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool the current high demand for teams, impacting current owners' investment growth. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the change would raise nearly $1 billion over 10 years, though team owners insist the number is far higher. The White House claims the measure aims to ensure fairness for fans, not team ownership, while some speculate it is a punitive measure against the NFL. (not investment advice)</p>

Jenkins was found guilty on fraud and bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but Trump claims he is a victim of a "corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ." Federal prosecutors stated that Jenkins took $75,000 in bribes, and Trump, a longstanding supporter of Jenkins, argued that the judge refused to allow evidence in his defense. This action aligns with Trump's history of granting clemency to allies and public officials.</p>

          <p>Bill Saporito argues that President Trump is asking retailers, such as Walmart and Home Depot, to deny the realities of economics by absorbing the costs of tariffs on imported goods, rather than passing them on to consumers. Trump has publicly demanded that Walmart "eat the tariffs," despite the company's warnings that it may need to raise prices. While some companies, like Home Depot, have indicated they will try to absorb some of the costs, Saporito suggests that this approach is unsustainable and ultimately self-defeating. He argues that businesses should be transparent with consumers about the impact of tariffs on prices, rather than engaging in wordplay or denying the economic realities.</p>

The youngest of the Jackson children, Jackson has topped charts for decades, with "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814" being the only album to generate seven top five-charting songs on the Billboard Hot 100.

Tapper's new book, "Original Sin," focuses on the cover-up of Biden's health issues, and he claimed that key figures like Jill Biden and Hunter Biden played a significant role in keeping it a secret.
