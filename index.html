          <h2>Huawei Reclaims Top Smartphone Position in China as Apple Sees Renewed Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 09:51:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Huawei has once again become the leading smartphone seller in China, shipping 12.2 million units in the second quarter for an 18% market share, its first time at the top since early 2024. Concurrently, Apple returned to growth in the country for the first time since late 2023, shipping 10.1 million iPhones, a 4% year-over-year increase. Apple's rebound is attributed to strategic price adjustments and enhanced trade-in offers for its iPhone 16 series amid intense competition from local brands. This performance data provides a crucial indicator of market dynamics ahead of Apple's upcoming quarterly earnings report.</p>

          <p>The European Union has reached a trade agreement with the United States, establishing a 15% tariff on most EU exports and a €514 billion investment commitment to the U.S. While the deal averted a potential trade war and was framed as a success by EU leaders like Ursula von der Leyen, it has drawn sharp criticism from within the bloc. Leaders from Hungary and France condemned the terms as a "submission" and a "disaster," arguing the EU made significant concessions without gaining reciprocal benefits. Despite the controversy, the agreement provides stability, though its long-term economic and political repercussions remain a subject of intense debate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Drastically Shortens Ukraine Peace Deal Deadline for Russia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 09:47:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly reduced the timeline for Russia to secure a peace agreement with Ukraine, shortening a previous 50-day deadline to just 10 or 12 days. Expressing disappointment with Vladimir Putin over the lack of progress and continued attacks on Ukrainian cities, Trump warned of severe consequences if the new deadline is not met. These measures would include "secondary tariffs" of around 100% on countries that continue to trade with Moscow. The move signals an escalation in U.S. pressure to end the conflict, shifting from a more patient approach to one of immediate urgency.</p>

          <p>As Dallas Cowboys star defender Micah Parsons enters the final year of his rookie contract, negotiations for an extension have become a major focus. Cowboys executive Stephen Jones addressed the situation, stating that while the team wants to pay Parsons, the player "has to want to be paid." This comment comes after Parsons expressed frustration over the delay, noting that other top defensive players have recently secured large contracts. Despite the ongoing contract discussions, Parsons has been present at the team's training camp, though he is not fully participating due to back tightness.</p>

          <p>With the WNBA experiencing unprecedented growth in popularity and revenue, its players are intensifying their push for a greater share of the league's income. The league recently secured a media-rights deal valued at nearly $3 billion, and franchise valuations are soaring, yet players currently receive less than 10% of total revenue. This disparity is a central issue in the ongoing collective-bargaining negotiations, with players arguing for a pay structure similar to other major sports leagues where athletes receive closer to 50% of revenue. The debate highlights the tension between the league's historical unprofitability and its rapidly expanding, lucrative future.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the second Trump administration has effectively dismantled the long-standing U.S. foreign policy tradition of promoting democracy and human rights. It points to the gutting of foreign aid programs, the shift in State Department focus, and business dealings like a Trump Tower project in Belgrade on the site of a former defense building bombed by NATO. The author argues these actions embolden authoritarians worldwide, who no longer fear condemnation from Washington for human rights abuses or anti-democratic actions. This shift represents a significant departure from post-Cold War norms, creating a more permissive environment for despots globally.</p>

The strategy involves more than just hearing; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking thoughtful follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said to confirm understanding. This approach not only shows respect and empathy but also subtly showcases one's competence and builds trust with colleagues and superiors. Research co-authored by Wood Brooks suggests that simply asking more questions can make a person more likable, which often correlates with better job performance reviews.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took the helm a year ago. The company's aircraft production and delivery numbers are improving, and it is expected to generate positive cash flow in the second half of the year, with analysts forecasting its first annual profit since 2018. Ortberg's hands-on approach, including relocating to the Seattle area where most planes are built, has been credited with helping to change the company's troubled culture. Despite ongoing challenges, including FAA production caps and quality control issues, there is growing optimism among investors and customers.</p>

          <p>A pro-Ukraine hacking group named Silent Crow has claimed it successfully breached and destroyed the internal IT infrastructure of Russia's national airline, Aeroflot. The attack caused a significant system failure, leading to the cancellation of dozens of flights and prompting a criminal investigation by Russian authorities. The group, allegedly working with Belarusian hacktivists, threatened to release the personal data of all past Aeroflot passengers. While the full extent of the damage is unverified, the incident marks a visible disruption to a major Russian company, affecting thousands of civilians amid the ongoing cyber warfare between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Over 3,200 union workers at three Boeing facilities in the St. Louis area have voted to reject a contract offer and will go on strike. The members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 turned down what Boeing called its "richest contract offer" ever, which included a 20% wage increase over four years. The union stated the proposal "fell short of addressing the priorities" of its workers. These plants are critical for producing U.S. military fighter jets, and the strike is set to begin on August 4 after a one-week cooling-off period.</p>

          <p>Following five days of deadly border clashes that killed at least 33 people, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an "immediate and unconditional ceasefire." The deal was brokered by Malaysia after significant international pressure, including a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump that trade negotiations could be halted. The conflict, which escalated from small arms fire to artillery and rocket barrages, displaced tens of thousands of civilians on both sides. While the ceasefire is a crucial first step, deep mistrust and powerful nationalist sentiments remain, posing challenges to maintaining long-term peace.</p>

          <p>Several Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, have finalized separate trade agreements with the U.S. to reduce tariffs ahead of an August 1 deadline. These deals typically involve the Southeast Asian nations lowering their own tariffs on U.S. goods to near-zero and increasing purchases of American products. Analysts suggest this could create more competition for European exporters in the region. However, it may also pressure these nations to offer similar favorable terms to the EU, potentially strengthening Europe's position in its own ongoing trade negotiations with ASEAN countries.

          <p>NHS England has criticized the British Medical Association (BMA) for rejecting a high number of emergency requests for striking resident doctors to return to work. During the latest five-day walkout over pay, a system allows hospitals to request doctors cross the picket line if patient safety is at risk, but 18 of 27 such requests were denied. The NHS expressed concern that the BMA's central panel was "second-guessing" frontline doctors, putting patient safety at risk, particularly in cancer care. The BMA countered that the requests were often due to poor planning by trusts trying to maintain non-urgent care.</p>

Reich calls for a vast network of moral resistance to hold the powerful accountable, protect the vulnerable, and restore norms of decency.
