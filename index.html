          <p>Hopes for a significant breakthrough in Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Turkey were diminished as key leaders, including Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, opted not to attend. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed skepticism about the talks, questioning the level of Russian representation and their decision-making authority. Trump suggested that progress would be unlikely without his direct involvement with Putin, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a diplomatic solution to the conflict. The symbolic return to Istanbul, a city that previously hosted peace negotiations, underscores the ongoing efforts to find a resolution to the devastating warfare, however, the absence of top leaders casts a shadow over the prospects for a meaningful agreement. </p>

          <p>President Trump suggested transforming the Gaza Strip into a "freedom zone" while in Qatar, despite stalled ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas. Trump highlighted the extensive destruction in Gaza, indicating that the territory has suffered greatly. This proposal aligns with previous suggestions from Israel's far-right government to displace Palestinians and redevelop Gaza. However, all Arab states and Hamas have rejected this plan, with Hamas labeling it as ethnic cleansing. Meanwhile, ceasefire negotiations remain stagnant, despite ongoing efforts and the recent release of a U.S.-Israeli hostage, demonstrating the complexities and challenges in achieving a lasting resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Walmart reported solid sales growth but cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could soon lead to higher prices for consumers. The retail giant, known for its low prices, said that the tariffs are impeding its ability to keep prices down. While Walmart will do its best to absorb the pressure, the magnitude of the tariffs makes it difficult to maintain current pricing. This warning highlights the potential impact of trade policies on consumer spending and the broader retail sector.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring establishing overseas "return hubs" for asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced during a visit to Albania. These hubs would serve as processing centers for individuals awaiting deportation from the UK. While Starmer refrained from disclosing specific countries involved, Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama clarified that his country is not participating in the scheme, citing loyalty to a similar agreement with Italy. This initiative differs from previous proposals, such as the Rwanda scheme, and aims to address the increasing number of individuals crossing the English Channel.</p>

          <p>A new term called "dry texting" is used by teenagers to subtly express disapproval or signal a change in the conversation's vibe, according to teens. Leaving someone on read, half-swiping on Snapchat, or turning off location sharing are all ambiguous signals that can cause anxiety and confusion. These behaviors, while not unique to teens, are amplified by their deep integration with technology. The reliance on these subtle cues can hinder the development of conflict resolution skills, as teens may avoid direct confrontation in favor of passive-aggressive communication.</p>

          <p>Investors are growing increasingly concerned about the potential for President Trump's tax plan to expand the budget deficit, leading to a sell-off in government bonds. The proposed budget, which includes extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, could add trillions to the national debt over the next decade. Fiscal hawks are alarmed by the potential consequences, with some drawing parallels to the economic turmoil experienced by Britain under Liz Truss. Trump has indicated a preference for prioritizing debt repayment, but the budget bill faces significant hurdles in Congress due to divisions among Republicans.</p>

          <p>Germany is supporting President Trump's call to increase NATO members' defense spending target to 5% of their GDP, according to German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. Wadephul believes this suggestion has been coordinated with the U.S. and will be discussed at the ongoing NATO foreign ministers meeting. Trump has long advocated for higher defense expenses from NATO members, with some countries already committing to boosting their spending. Germany spent around 2% of its GDP on defense in 2024, and the next NATO summit is set to address potential decisions regarding higher defense spending targets.</p>

          <p>An analysis of American policing identifies two distinct types of officers: "showboaters" and "real cops." Showboaters are described as those who prioritize appearing tough and knowledgeable, while real cops are characterized by their quiet competence and understanding of the law. The author argues that America is currently having a "showboater moment," exemplified by policies that prioritize appearances of strength over due process and individual rights. The author contends that true policing involves upholding the law and protecting individual freedoms, not simply imposing repression.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether federal judges can issue nationwide injunctions, a practice that has allowed single judges to block Trump administration policies across the country. The Trump administration argues that these injunctions hinder its ability to implement its agenda, while opponents contend that they are necessary to protect constitutional rights. A ruling limiting nationwide injunctions could significantly reshape how federal courts handle challenges to presidential policies, potentially curbing the power of the judicial branch and boosting executive authority. The outcome of the case could have major implications for the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

          <p>A large bloom of toxic algae is killing more than 200 marine species off the southern coast of Australia, scientists and conservation groups report. The algae, Karenia mikimotoi, appeared in waters around South Australia state in March, causing mass deaths in species including sharks, rays, crabs and octopuses. The bloom stretches across 1,700 square miles, affecting beaches on wildlife-rich tourist draws such as Kangaroo Island, Yorke Peninsula and Fleurieu Peninsula. The South Australian government said the event is thought to have been driven by a marine heatwave, as well as relatively calm marine conditions, and that climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and duration of marine heatwaves across Australia, which significantly affects marine ecosystems.</p>
