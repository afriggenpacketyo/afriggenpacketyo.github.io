          <p>The Israeli military has initiated extensive ground operations in both northern and southern Gaza, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict with Hamas. This new phase of the war aims to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages and ultimately dismantle the group or compel its surrender. Israeli warplanes have conducted numerous strikes on Gaza in recent days, targeting what the military claims are Hamas terror targets. Despite these operations, international efforts to broker a ceasefire have so far been unsuccessful, with the conflict resulting in a high number of casualties among both combatants and civilians. The article underscores the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where residents face near-constant bombardment and the risk of displacement.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is determined to bring the budget bill, which failed in committee, to the House floor before Memorial Day. Johnson emphasized the bill's significance and the need to pass it swiftly, despite resistance from some Republicans concerned about Medicaid requirements and spending. He acknowledged potential delays due to states' difficulties in implementing new eligibility rules but expressed confidence in reaching a resolution. Johnson also mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's urgency to pass the bill by July 4 and said he has been in contact with Senate Majority Leader John Thune to ensure the bill's passage in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Saturday Night Live's 50th season has been creatively and numerically successful, leading to questions about the show's future and ability to maintain relevance. Despite rumors of cast departures, the season finale unfolded in a typical fashion, with the show finishing as the top broadcast entertainment program among viewers aged 18 to 49, averaging 8.2 million viewers each week across all platforms. The article explores potential changes to the show, including who might replace Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che, and how SNL can continue to make news and lampoon modern politics effectively. The success of the 50th-anniversary celebrations has quieted rumors about Lorne Michaels' retirement, at least for another season.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio disputes the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is not a proxy force of NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government. Rubio insists that the gang is exported by the Venezuelan regime and has been contracted to murder an opposition member in Chile. This disagreement centers on the Trump administration's ability to deport suspected gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. The Supreme Court has blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas, while the FBI supports Rubio's view.</p>

The princess wore a wedding dress that showed her scar in 2018, emphasizing the importance of showing "people your scars" and changing perceptions of beauty. Scoliosis is a condition where the spine twists and curves to the side, often starting in children aged between 10 and 15.</p>

Despite historical trends favoring U.S. stocks, concerns about high valuations in the S&P 500 and potential recession risks make diversification a prudent strategy. Experts suggest considering China and India as part of an international diversification plan, highlighting China's economic stimulus and India's strong growth potential. Investors are also advised to be mindful of concentration within their U.S. stock holdings and consider investing in "quality" stock funds (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Ukraine reports that Russia has launched its largest drone attack since the full-scale invasion began, targeting several regions, including Kyiv, where one person died. Russia launched 273 drones, with 88 being intercepted, targeting the Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Donetsk regions. The attack comes just before a scheduled call between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as the US President has been urging a ceasefire. Russian and Ukrainian officials held their first face-to-face talks in more than three years on Friday in Turkey, but it yielded little besides a new prisoner swap deal.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes across the midwestern US have resulted in at least 27 deaths in Missouri and Kentucky, with many fatalities reported after a tornado in south-eastern Kentucky. The storms, part of a larger weather system, spawned over two dozen tornadoes in multiple states, left hundreds of thousands without power, and brought a heatwave to Texas. The National Weather Service radar indicated a tornado touched down in Clayton, Missouri, in the St Louis area. The storms hit after the Trump administration massively cut staffing of NWS offices.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with top U.S. officials and European leaders in Rome, amidst heightened diplomatic efforts ahead of a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war in Ukraine. The intensified diplomacy comes as Russia launched its largest drone barrage against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, after the first direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in years failed to yield a ceasefire. Russia fired a total of 273 exploding drones and decoys, Ukraine's air force said Sunday. Of those, 88 were intercepted and a further 128 lost, likely having been electronically jammed. The attacks targeted the country's Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions.</p>

Growers report a good crop with good size, and the combination of warm days and cool nights allows the strawberries to rest and put energy into producing more natural sugars. While warnings of potential drought conditions exist, growers have irrigation systems in place to mitigate the effects of extreme weather. The article also provides suggestions on how to enhance the flavor of strawberries, such as pairing them with black pepper or balsamic vinegar.</p>
