          <p>President Trump withdrew Jared Isaacman's nomination to lead NASA due to the nominee's past donations to Democrats, despite Isaacman having disclosed these contributions beforehand. Isaacman, an ally of Elon Musk, expressed his appreciation for the complexities of government and the dedication of political leaders after the nomination was pulled. The White House stated that the next NASA administrator would be fully aligned with President Trump's agenda to prioritize America's presence in space, particularly on Mars. Musk responded to the news by stating that Isaacman was a competent and good-hearted individual, despite the nomination withdrawal. Optimism surrounding this situation is low as a NASA leadership position remains vacant.</p>

The Minnesota fires have burned approximately 30,000 acres, with the U.S. Forest Service suspecting the Jenkins Creek Fire was human-caused.

          <p>Ukraine launched a large-scale attack targeting air bases in five regions of Russia, according to Russia's Defense Ministry, which reported that several aircraft caught fire. Ukrainian forces reportedly destroyed dozens of Russian warplanes in the attack, which an official says took more than a year to orchestrate, with the drones being transported in containers carried by trucks deep into Russian territory. Moscow has used Tupolev Tu-95 and Tu-22 long-range bombers to launch missiles at Ukraine, while A-50s are used to coordinate targets and detect air defenses and guided missiles. The White House stated that President Trump and his administration were not warned of the attack beforehand, as the conflict between Ukraine and Russia continues.</p>

          <p>David Challen, son of Sally Challen, is campaigning to raise awareness of coercive control after his mother was freed from prison in 2019, years after she killed his father, Richard, with a hammer. Sally Challen suffered decades of abuse at the hands of her husband, which David said had become "normalised" within the family home in Claygate in Surrey. A law passed in 2015, which recognizes psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse, helped secure Mrs Challen's release from prison after she had been jailed for life for murder in 2011. David Challen has written a book, called The Unthinkable, about the family's experiences, and said more needs to be done to protect victims.</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul expressed concerns about President Trump's "one big beautiful bill," stating that "the math doesn't really add up" regarding its cost. Paul opposes the legislation due to its inclusion of a $5 trillion debt ceiling increase, arguing that it would lead to excessive spending and increase the national debt. He suggested removing the debt ceiling provision and voting on it separately, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the bill, citing potential income from tariffs. President Trump has warned Paul about opposing the legislation, highlighting the political tensions surrounding the bill's passage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), questioned the necessity of obtaining congressional approval for all of President Trump's proposed cuts to the federal workforce.

He defended the One Big Beautiful Bill, asserting that it would not increase the deficit or harm the debt, despite criticism from experts and business leaders. Vought also emphasized that Trump is the primary driver of his administration's agenda, while acknowledging the alignment with Project 2025, which aims to dismantle the federal workforce and consolidate presidential power.

          <p>A teenage transgender athlete in California, AB Hernandez, won two track events despite facing political attacks from right-wing figures and the Trump administration. Hernandez tied for first place in the high jump and triple jump, with the California Interscholastic Federation recently changing its rules to award the same place and medal to the athlete finishing behind a trans athlete. The Justice Department is investigating the California Interscholastic Federation and the school district to determine whether they violated federal sex-discrimination law. Hernandez's participation is allowed under a 2013 state law, which permits students to compete in categories reflecting their gender identity.</p>

The study demonstrated that monitoring circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood samples could provide earlier indications of treatment resistance than traditional imaging techniques. This approach enables oncologists to make more timely decisions about altering treatment regimens, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients with advanced breast cancer.
