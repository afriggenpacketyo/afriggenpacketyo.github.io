Video footage showed missiles impacting Tel Aviv, prompting Israeli defense systems to intercept incoming projectiles, with citizens urged to seek shelter. Iran's Supreme Leader vowed consequences for Israel's actions, leading to the suspension of nuclear negotiations with the United States. President Trump urged Iran to pursue a nuclear deal before further escalation, emphasizing the United States' military capabilities and Israel's access to advanced weaponry. The situation remains volatile, with both sides trading threats and actions, raising concerns about regional stability. Optimism is tempered by the potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is alerting travelers to the potential cybersecurity risks associated with using public USB charging ports at airports. Hackers can install malware on USB ports, a practice known as 'juice jacking,' to access personal information on connected devices. The TSA recommends using TSA-compliant power bricks or battery packs instead of plugging phones directly into USB ports. Cybersecurity expert Kurt Knutsson advises travelers to use charging blocks plugged into outlets rather than USB ports, emphasizing the risk of malware installation and data theft. The agency also advises against using free public Wi-Fi for sensitive online activities.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, maps have emerged detailing the targeted locations, including Iranian nuclear facilities and military sites. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that the strikes hit multiple sites in Tehran and Natanz, a key uranium enrichment location. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the operation as a targeted effort to diminish the Iranian threat, while Iran responded by launching drones at Israel. The IDF stated that the strikes dismantled a facility producing metallic uranium and damaged the underground area of the Natanz site. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency confirmed no increase in radiation levels outside the Natanz site, but tensions remain high.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu was defeated by Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals of the Queen's Club tournament. Despite a promising start, Raducanu struggled against Zheng's powerful groundstrokes and serve. Raducanu took a medical timeout for a back issue, but capitalized on Zheng's inconsistent serve to gain a double break in the second set. However, Zheng fought back, winning four consecutive games to secure the match. Despite the loss, Raducanu showed signs of promise for the grass court season but recognizes the need to bridge the gap to challenge top players.</p>

          <p>The Senate is considering changes to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," with senators discussing potential revisions to the House-approved package. Changes are expected to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), including reducing the cost burden on states. The Senate is also likely to lower the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, potentially creating challenges in the House. Border funding and Medicaid reforms are also under discussion, with senators seeking to find consensus on these key provisions. The Senate aims to rein in government spending and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic analyzes how the October 7 attacks by Hamas have altered Israel's strategic considerations, leading to recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The article suggests that Israel's successful campaign against Hezbollah and reduced fear of diplomatic blowback have emboldened Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. President Trump's foreign-policy approach has also created an environment where Israel has more leeway to act alone. The article argues that Netanyahu's political situation and the consensus view of Iran as an existential threat have contributed to the timing of the strikes. The events initiated by Hamas's attacks have fundamentally changed Israel's military, diplomatic, and political standing.</p>

The CDC cautions that precision in the reporting period is low, but the increase in prevalence highlights the variant's high transmissibility.
