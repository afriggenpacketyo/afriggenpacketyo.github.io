          <p>Intense storms caused significant flash flooding across the New York City area, leading to widespread disruptions and a state of emergency declaration in New Jersey. The heavy rainfall inundated subway stations, severely delaying transit services and prompting officials to advise commuters to postpone travel. Major roadways like the Bronx River Parkway were closed, and numerous drivers required rescue from stalled vehicles in heavily flooded areas in Westchester County and New Jersey. The storm also caused property damage, including a house explosion in North Plainfield and flooding in local businesses.</p>

          <p>A man convicted of a 1993 double murder is scheduled for execution in Florida, which would mark the 26th execution in the U.S. this year. This total surpasses the 25 executions carried out nationwide during all of 2024, representing the highest annual number since 2018. Florida has been the most active state in carrying out executions this year, with this being its eighth. The article notes that last-minute appeals based on new evidence were rejected by the state's Supreme Court, citing overwhelming evidence of guilt.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a significant increase in antisemitism across the UK, particularly since the October 7th Hamas attack. The findings indicate that Jewish people are facing ostracism in workplaces, including the NHS, where they feel their concerns are often ignored. The report also found instances of antisemitic tropes being used in schools and calls for improved education and training to combat this prejudice. Key recommendations include creating a formal antisemitism training qualification and ensuring Judaism is recognized as an ethnicity as well as a religion to better address discrimination.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Angolans participated in mass protests in the capital, Luanda, against the government's decision to raise fuel prices, which has driven up the cost of transportation and basic goods. The demonstrations, organized by a social movement, reflect broader discontent with the ruling MPLA party, which has governed for 50 years. Protesters voiced frustrations over hunger and economic hardship in the oil-rich nation. Despite a harsh police crackdown resulting in injuries and arrests, organizers have vowed to continue their demonstrations until the government reverses its policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new multi-billion dollar military aid package for Ukraine and threatened Russia with severe tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached within 50 days. The package reportedly includes 17 Patriot air-defense systems sourced from European allies, who will then purchase replacements from the U.S. A former Russian president dismissed the threat as a "theatrical ultimatum," stating Russia "didn't care."

          <p>A Biden-era plan to install a hydrogen-powered blast furnace at a Cleveland-Cliffs steel mill in Middletown, Ohio, has been indefinitely postponed by the Trump administration.

The company's CEO cited the administration's freezing of clean energy spending and tax credits as reasons for the halt.

Housing advocates argue that blaming environmental laws like CEQA is a scapegoat for more significant issues, such as high construction costs, labor shortages, and disputes with insurance companies.

Furthermore, the piece highlights that modern filmmaking is an inherently international collaboration, and penalizing foreign productions would also punish American artists, producers, and distributors.

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of approximately $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. The high price is largely due to India's steep import tariffs and luxury taxes on vehicles. This positions the Model Y in the premium segment, competing with brands like BMW rather than mass-market local EVs. Analysts suggest Tesla is "testing the waters" and that a full commitment to the Indian market, including local manufacturing to lower costs, may not happen until the market matures further.</p>

          <p>Spinner Liam Dawson has been called up to the England Test squad for the first time in eight years as a replacement for Shoaib Bashir, who is out with a broken finger. The 35-year-old's selection for the fourth Test against India is a reward for his outstanding domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. Dawson, a left-arm spinner and capable batsman, offers a like-for-like replacement for Bashir and provides an unexpected opportunity to press his claim for a regular spot in the Test side.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to provide weapons to Ukraine through NATO has sparked anger among some of his most ardent conservative supporters. Key allies like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and former strategist Steve Bannon have criticized the move, arguing it betrays Trump's "America First" promise to end involvement in foreign wars. They expressed skepticism that U.S. taxpayers would not ultimately bear the cost, despite the White House's emphasis that European nations will pay for the U.S.-made weapons. This rare public disagreement highlights a rift within the MAGA movement over foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage drivers to switch to electric vehicles (EVs) by offering discounts of up to £3,750. The grants will apply to eligible cars costing up to £37,000 and are part of a £650 million program aimed at phasing out new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the government hopes this will make EVs more affordable, some industry leaders and consumers point to the lack of public charging infrastructure as a more significant barrier. The government has also pledged a separate £63 million investment to expand the charging network.</p>

While the policy shift is expected to boost Nvidia's revenue, some analysts caution that Chinese firms will likely continue developing domestic chips due to the unpredictability of U.S. policy.

Three separate bills have been introduced that would require the 2030 census to include a citizenship question and then subtract some or all noncitizens from the final apportionment counts. This move, which would be a departure from the 14th Amendment's mandate to count the "whole number of persons," is expected to face significant legal challenges and could undermine the accuracy of the census, similar to a failed attempt by the first Trump administration.</p>
