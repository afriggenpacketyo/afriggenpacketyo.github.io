          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, but both countries allegedly violated the agreement shortly after. Trump expressed frustration with both nations and demanded Israel halt further attacks.

Despite the violations, Trump insisted the ceasefire was in effect and thanked both countries for their attention to the matter, although the situation remained tense and uncertain.

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order, allowing the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to third countries without prior notice or the opportunity to contest their removals. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, with Sotomayor accusing the government of "flagrantly unlawful conduct." The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety and security.

          <p>In Los Angeles County, fears of ICE raids have led many immigrant residents to skip essential activities, including doctor's visits, causing a "pause" in their lives. Clinics have seen a significant increase in no-show rates, and individuals are sacrificing basic needs for safety. The "Healthcare Without Fear" program is attempting to address this by providing home visits, but it faces financial challenges due to lack of reimbursement. Health workers fear the situation will worsen as similar enforcement actions spread to other cities. The optimism score of this article is 25.</p>
