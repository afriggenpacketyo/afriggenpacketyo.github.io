          <p>Ukrainian President Zelensky and European leaders held phone talks with President Trump, focusing on peace efforts after a meeting in Kyiv. Ukraine has expressed readiness for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia beginning Monday, signaling a potential de-escalation in the conflict. The call emphasized a collective desire among Ukraine and its allies to halt hostilities and pursue a diplomatic resolution. This truce aims to create a window for substantive negotiations towards a lasting peace, contingent upon Russia's agreement and effective monitoring of the ceasefire. If the ceasefire is agreed upon, confidence-building measures would be put in place to facilitate peace negotiations, but Russia has yet to agree to the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have commenced high-level discussions in Switzerland aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, marking the first in-person contact between the two largest economies since President Trump imposed significant tariffs. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to negotiate potential tariff reductions. Trump hinted at potentially lowering the tariff rate against China, while China urged the U.S. to show sincerity by lifting unilateral tariffs.

          <p>As President Trump signals a potential pullback of U.S. support for Ukraine, European leaders are worried about their capacity to supply Ukraine with necessary weapons. European nations backing Ukraine are struggling to provide sufficient materiel, leading Ukraine to consider deals offering the U.S. a share of future revenue over natural resources to maintain arms shipments. While European leaders are willing to invest in weapons production, it will take time to ramp up assembly lines. Allies fear that Trump will pull Russian deterrents out of Europe, impacting their ability to support Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), aims to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the bill to allow research to catch up with the increasing cannabis consumption in the U.S. The bill would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, potentially attracting bipartisan support. If passed, the law could lead to increased research to inform medical use practices and advance medicine in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for crucial negotiations aimed at resolving the ongoing trade war. The meetings mark the first high-level discussions since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting retaliatory levies from China. While expectations for a significant breakthrough are low, the fact that the two sides are engaging in talks has raised hopes for a potential de-escalation. The outcome of these negotiations could have a significant impact on the global economy, influencing trade flows and consumer prices.</p>

The talks are the first high-level meeting between Beijing and Washington since President Trump's broad tariff hike last month.

While a major breakthrough is unlikely, hopes remain that the two sides will ease the punishing tariffs they have imposed on each other, which would soothe troubled global markets and reassure companies reliant on US-China trade.</p>

Miller described habeas corpus as a "privilege" and stated that Congress had already passed a law stripping judicial courts of jurisdiction over immigration cases.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a handheld device that they claim can detect cloaked stealth fighters, blending civilian telecoms tech with military-grade radar sensitivities. The device reportedly can detect low-probability-of-intercept radar (LPIR) signals at a rate of 100 percent, even through electronic jamming. If effective, this could be a major defensive tool for China, potentially lowering the threat of a first strike. The device is also relatively inexpensive compared to the stealth technology it aims to detect.</p>
