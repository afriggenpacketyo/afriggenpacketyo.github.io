          <p>A Chinese company executive, Qingzhou Wang, received a 25-year prison sentence in the U.S. for trafficking chemicals used to produce fentanyl. His company, Amarvel Biotech, and its marketing manager were also convicted of fentanyl precursor importation and money laundering. This case marks a significant step, as it's the first time Chinese companies have been charged for directly shipping precursor chemicals into the U.S., rather than through Mexico. The U.S. Justice Department's action highlights an increased focus on China-based suppliers in the fight against the opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation revealed that Walmart's online marketplace has become a hub for counterfeit and potentially dangerous products, with third-party sellers often impersonating legitimate businesses. Shoppers, including one who received fake brain supplements, reported issues despite trusting Walmart's brand. The investigation found that Walmart loosened seller vetting processes in a bid to compete with Amazon, leading to a "Wild West" environment. While Walmart states a zero-tolerance policy, critics argue the company prioritized growth over consumer safety, prompting recent changes to vetting for health and beauty products.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, resigned under intense pressure from President Donald Trump after his office found insufficient evidence to charge New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump publicly demanded Siebert's removal, claiming James was "very guilty of something," despite Siebert being a Trump nominee. Critics view this as an escalation of a retribution campaign, undermining the Justice Department's independence. Siebert intends to continue as a line prosecutor, but his departure leaves a critical office without leadership.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors concluded their case against Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump on his Florida golf course last year. Routh, representing himself, allegedly planned the attack meticulously, acquiring a military-grade weapon and researching Trump's movements. He was reportedly spotted by a Secret Service agent near Trump before fleeing and later being arrested. Routh faces five criminal charges, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. His defense, including character witnesses and a firearms expert, is scheduled to begin soon.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a third "lethal kinetic strike" by the U.S. military on an alleged drug-trafficking vessel in international waters, killing three individuals. The strike, occurring in the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, was justified by intelligence confirming illicit narcotics trafficking. This follows two similar strikes earlier this month, some targeting Venezuelan vessels, amidst the administration's crackdown on drug cartels. Democratic lawmakers have criticized these actions, questioning the legal justification for military force without Congressional approval, despite the White House citing the President's constitutional authority.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced productive phone talks with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, indicating progress on a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations, though Beijing's confirmation was less definitive. The proposed deal reportedly involves U.S. investors acquiring TikTok's U.S. business, utilizing ByteDance's algorithm under license. Trump has repeatedly delayed the app's ban, now extended to December, and views TikTok as crucial for his 2024 campaign. Concerns persist among U.S. lawmakers regarding potential Chinese Communist Party influence through the algorithm, even as both leaders agreed to future in-person meetings on trade and other thorny issues.</p>

Critics, including state senators and congressmen, condemn the detention of non-criminal immigrants, especially an elderly community member.

          <p>Moana, a two-year-old Hawaiian monk seal, was found dead after becoming entangled in fishing gear, specifically a "jug rig," near Mānana Island.

Wildlife officials emphasize the dangers of methods like jug fishing, which use strong lines and can lead to entanglement, exhaustion, or death for endangered marine life. NOAA and DLNR are urging fishers to avoid high-risk methods, report lost gear, and use barbless circle hooks to protect the critically endangered monk seal population, numbering only about 1,600 worldwide.</p>

          <p>CDC vaccine advisers unanimously voted to shift from a broad recommendation for Covid-19 vaccines to requiring consultation with a healthcare provider, a process called shared clinical decision-making. This means individuals aged 6 months to 64 years should discuss the risk-benefit with a doctor, with an emphasis on those at increased risk. The committee also narrowly voted against requiring a prescription. Experts warn this change, pending CDC director sign-off, will likely create confusion and decrease vaccine uptake, potentially leading to varied access across states, despite HHS assurances of continued coverage through existing payment mechanisms.</p>

He states he went to Russia for athletic races, was offered a job, and unknowingly signed military papers before being forced into service. His family in Kenya is traumatized but relieved he is with Ukrainians, urging Kenyan authorities to intervene for his repatriation. Ukraine is open to negotiations for his return, highlighting the plight of foreign recruits.</p>

          <p>Martin Jennings, chosen to sculpt the statue for Queen Elizabeth II's national memorial in St James's Park, aims to capture her "grandeur and dignity." The sculptor, known for portraying King Charles III, expressed elation at the commission and plans to involve the Royal Family in the final design. The memorial, with a budget between £23m and £46m, will also include a bridge, a statue of the Queen and Prince Philip, and new gardens. While an anti-monarchy group calls for the Royal Family to fund it, the project signifies a significant national tribute to Britain's longest-reigning monarch.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched the "Intervision" Song Contest, a revival of a Soviet-era event, positioning it as a geopolitical alternative to Eurovision after being banned from the latter. The contest features 23 countries, including China, India, Brazil, and the U.S., reflecting Russia's expanding political and economic alliances. Senior Kremlin officials, including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, presented it as a cultural initiative, though Ukraine's Foreign Ministry condemns it as "hostile propaganda." The event aims to project a softer image and demonstrate Russia's international connections, emphasizing traditional culture and national identity over the more diverse themes of Eurovision.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. tech companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google, are making substantial investments in the UK's artificial intelligence sector, signaling a "tech bromance" with potential to boost the UK economy. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang declared the UK an "AI superpower," while Microsoft announced a £22bn investment and Google committed £5bn. This influx of capital is seen as a vote of confidence, driven by the UK's scientific talent and a "pro-growth" regulatory environment. While raising optimism, some critics warn of dependence on U.S. giants and potential job displacement from AI. (not investment advice)</p>

As a "Peaky Blinders" film is set for Netflix release, Murphy remains tight-lipped about the plot. He is also promoting his new film, "Steve," where he plays a headteacher at a reform school. Murphy reflected on the unexpected global adoration and longevity of "Peaky Blinders," crediting its writing and timing, while emphasizing his ability to explore diverse roles between projects.</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement agents used teargas and pepper balls to disperse approximately 100 protesters, including Democratic congressional candidates, outside a Chicago ICE facility. Demonstrators were blocking government vehicles as part of "Operation Midway Blitz," an immigration crackdown targeting Democratic cities. At least three arrests occurred, and footage shared by DHS depicted protesters as siding with "vicious cartels." Illinois Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton condemned the violence against peaceful demonstrators, asserting it was about "fear, control, and the Trump administration’s attempt to intimidate Illinoisans into silence." Protesters also chanted the name of a man fatally shot by an immigration officer.</p>

          <p>UCLA has implemented new campus protest rules, some mirroring Trump administration demands, while others expand free speech zones. These guidelines formalize interim policies, banning unauthorized overnight encampments and masking during policy violations, and restricting protests in certain outdoor spaces. The university faces federal threats to pull $584 million in research funding due to alleged antisemitism during a 2024 pro-Palestinian encampment. While UCLA asserts its rules are content-neutral and not a direct response to Trump, the policies navigate intense pressure regarding free speech, campus safety, and federal intervention in university affairs, with potential disciplinary actions for violations.</p>

          <p>Estonia has requested urgent NATO Article 4 consultations after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets brazenly violated its airspace for 12 minutes over the Gulf of Finland. NATO confirmed it immediately intercepted the aircraft, calling it "reckless Russian behaviour." Italy, Finland, and Sweden scrambled jets in response. Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal condemned the incursion, stating it aims to divert NATO attention from Ukraine and tests Western resolve. This incident, the second Article 4 request in a week following a Polish airspace violation, underscores escalating geopolitical tensions and Russia's aggressive actions near NATO borders.</p>
