          <p>A federal judge is demanding answers regarding the potential deportation of a two-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras, along with her mother and sister. The judge expressed concern that the deportation may have occurred without due process, as the child was born in Louisiana and is therefore a U.S. citizen. The incident occurred after the mother attended a routine check-in with ICE, raising questions about the agency's procedures and adherence to legal protections for U.S. citizens.

          <p>A special tribunal is being planned to prosecute Russia's aggression in Ukraine, but faces numerous obstacles, including immunity for heads of state like Vladimir Putin. While the tribunal can investigate Russian leadership, it lacks the power to waive immunity, potentially delaying prosecution until Putin is out of office. The tribunal's jurisdiction and scope, particularly regarding events before the full-scale invasion in 2022, are also under debate. Political will and financial support from key nations, including the US, are uncertain, potentially hindering the tribunal's effectiveness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett questions the feasibility of Apple moving iPhone assembly to India to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. He argues that because the iPhone components would still be manufactured in China, the move would not significantly reduce costs related to tariffs. Moffett also suggests that Apple's supply chain remains heavily reliant on China and may face resistance in India. Furthermore, he believes that backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs could negatively affect iPhone sales.</p>
