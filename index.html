          <h2>Opinion: US Global Influence Faces Challenges Due to Domestic Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 21:30:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the United States is at a critical juncture, where its global influence is being undermined by domestic policies reminiscent of historical empires that declined due to internal strife and leadership missteps. The author contends that President Trump's policies, including tariff impositions and attacks on NATO allies, are eroding the foundations of Western economic and security dominance. These actions are stoking internal divisions and diminishing faith in the Western project, mirroring the errors of past leaders who led their empires to irreversible decline, suggesting the US needs to reassess its approach to maintain its superpower status. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Butler Library at Columbia University, renaming it ‚Äúthe Basel Al-Araj Popular University,‚Äù in a resurgence of campus activism, and this NYTimes article reports that dozens were arrested after the university called in the NYPD, marking a significant escalation since similar protests last spring. The demonstration, aimed at pressuring Columbia to divest from entities profiting from Israel's actions in Gaza, led to a tense standoff and injuries to both protesters and security officers. This event unfolds amidst ongoing scrutiny from the Trump administration regarding the university's handling of antisemitism allegations and subsequent funding cuts, further complicating negotiations between Columbia and federal officials.
