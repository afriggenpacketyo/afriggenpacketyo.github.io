          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has officially announced it is expanding its strategic business review and is now open to a potential sale, a move that caused its shares to jump 8% in premarket trading. This development follows earlier plans to split the company into separate streaming/studios and global networks businesses, and comes amid unsolicited takeover interest from multiple parties, including the newly merged Paramount Skydance. CEO David Zaslav framed the decision as a response to market recognition of the company's portfolio value, stating the comprehensive review will identify the best path forward to maximize asset value for shareholders.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has sharply criticized Congressional Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, asserting that their actions are undermining national security. A spokesperson argued that while the administration is securing peace deals, Democrats are jeopardizing global diplomatic engagement and foreign policy for political reasons. The article highlights the legislative stalemate in the Senate over a continuing resolution, with Democrats demanding changes to Medicaid policies signed into law under President Trump. The department also referenced past statements from former officials to underscore the dangers of a prolonged shutdown.</p>

          <p>While a short government shutdown is unlikely to significantly impact U.S. air travel, experts warn a prolonged one could cause major disruptions for passengers and businesses. Essential employees like TSA officers and air traffic controllers must work without pay, which in past shutdowns led to increased sick calls and staffing shortages, resulting in longer security lines. The U.S. Travel Association estimates a prolonged shutdown could cost the travel economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring of new air traffic controllers. This would exacerbate an existing shortage and potentially lead to widespread flight delays and cancellations across the country.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly checks during the U.S. government shutdown, as the benefits are covered by mandatory, pre-approved spending. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget requires congressional approval, meaning many administrative services could be disrupted. With nearly 10% of its workforce furloughed, the agency anticipates halting services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards. Furthermore, the shutdown could delay the release of key inflation data, which might postpone the annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>During a powerful storm in western Alaska, a man named Steven Anaver experienced a harrowing ordeal when his home was lifted from its foundation and floated for roughly a mile across choppy waters with him inside. The remnants of Typhoon Halong brought severe winds and record-high water levels, devastating several communities and displacing over 2,000 people. Anaver documented the terrifying event, showing water rising inside his home as it drifted in the dark, crashing into other structures. He was eventually rescued by neighbors after the floodwaters receded, describing the experience as being "inches away from death."</p>

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of 14 funding lapses that have occurred since 1980, a practice that became more common after legal opinions restricted agencies from operating without congressional appropriations. This historical overview details each shutdown, from the eight that occurred under President Ronald Reagan to the 34-day standoff in 2018 over border wall funding. The article notes that while early shutdowns were often brief, recent decades have seen more frequent and prolonged events driven by intense partisan battles over issues like healthcare and immigration. These funding gaps have resulted in furloughed federal workers and significant economic losses.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a savings vehicle that can offer returns outpacing the inflation rate. The article provides a snapshot of national average CD yields for various terms as of October 2025, noting that online banks typically offer more competitive rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead. Currently, short-term CDs, such as those with six-month to one-year terms, are yielding higher rates than longer-term options, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. Financial experts suggest strategies like CD laddering to capitalize on high short-term rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State agencies are warning that the federal government shutdown could halt the distribution of SNAP benefits, or food stamps, for over 40 million Americans in November. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has informed states that there will be insufficient funds for the program if the funding lapse continues, instructing them to pause benefit processing. This has raised alarms among advocates, who warn of devastating consequences for low-income families who rely on the assistance for groceries.

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown requires all active-duty military personnel to continue serving without pay until Congress reaches a funding agreement.

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is expected to have a minimal impact on most mortgage applications, but it could cause delays for borrowers seeking government-backed loans. While private lenders will operate as usual, loans insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA may face processing slowdowns due to furloughed staff. The USDA will halt the issuance of new home loans for rural buyers entirely during the shutdown. Another potential issue is the National Flood Insurance Program, administered by FEMA, which cannot issue new policies during a shutdown, potentially delaying closings for homes in high-risk flood zones that require such coverage.</p>

          <p>Despite the government shutdown forcing hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work without pay or be furloughed, members of Congress and the President will continue to receive their salaries. This is because their compensation is authorized under the Constitution and funded by a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal. In contrast, most federal agency employees are affected by the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending without congressional approval, leading to delayed paychecks. While a 2019 law ensures furloughed federal workers receive back pay once the shutdown ends, the lawmakers responsible for the funding lapse face no interruption to their own income.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass appropriations bills to fund federal agencies before the fiscal year begins on October 1. This constitutional and legal requirement halts all non-essential government functions, forcing many federal employees to be furloughed without pay. Essential services, such as national security, law enforcement, and air traffic control, continue to operate, but employees in these roles also do not get paid until funding is restored. Programs with permanent funding, like Social Security and Medicare, continue to issue payments, although their administrative services may be slowed.

The article suggests that as the Federal Reserve potentially stops raising rates, mortgage rates may also stabilize, offering some relief to borrowers.

          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump, marked by confusing statements and tangential remarks, have intensified scrutiny over his cognitive fitness for office. This has led to renewed discussions about the mechanisms for removing an unfit president, particularly Section 4 of the 25th Amendment. This constitutional provision allows for the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to declare a president unable to discharge their duties. However, the process is deliberately difficult, requiring a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress if the president contests the removal, a higher bar than impeachment. Despite numerous examples of unusual behavior, there appears to be no appetite among Republicans to challenge the president's capacity.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have advanced to the World Series for the first time since their back-to-back championship wins in 1992 and 1993. They will face the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are aiming to become the first team to win consecutive titles in 25 years. The Blue Jays secured home-field advantage after winning the American League Championship Series against Seattle and finishing the regular season with one more win than the Dodgers. The series pits Toronto's powerful offense against a dominant Dodgers team led by two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani, setting the stage for a highly anticipated championship matchup.</p>

          <p>The documentary "Khartoum" provides a human-first perspective on the devastating civil war in Sudan, which has created what some experts call the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The film, which began production before the conflict erupted in April 2023, portrays the lives of five residents of the capital, capturing the city's vibrant culture before it was shattered by war. The filmmakers had to adapt their approach after the fighting began, using reenactments and animation to chronicle the protagonists' escapes. The documentary aims to raise global awareness of the conflict, which activists describe as an "actively ignored war" despite its catastrophic impact.</p>

          <p>In response to a new U.S.-Australia deal aimed at countering its dominance in critical minerals, China has stated that resource-rich countries should play a proactive role in stabilizing global supply chains. The agreement between Washington and Canberra is designed to boost the supply of rare earths outside of China, which recently expanded its own export controls on the crucial minerals. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that global supply chains are a result of market choices. The deal has caused fluctuations in the stock prices of Australian and U.S. rare earths companies. (not investment advice)</p>

This threatens to leave millions of low-income households without critical aid as winter approaches and heating bills rise. An energy assistance advocacy group warns that even if a funding deal is reached, states may not receive the funds until December due to severe staff shortages at the agency that administers the program.

Experts suggest that climate change, with warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns, may be contributing to the spread of these diseases.
