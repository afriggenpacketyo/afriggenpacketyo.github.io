          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 18:38:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. military strikes in Iran, concerns arose about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and subsequent increases in energy prices, including gasoline. Initially, oil prices surged but later declined as experts predicted Iran was unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport. However, ongoing tensions could still impact the energy market, with potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities or attacks by Iranian proxy groups posing significant risks. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though deemed unlikely, could cause prices to spike dramatically, affecting economies worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of certain immigrants to third countries without advance warning or the chance to challenge their removal based on potential torture or death in those countries.

Justice Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the Court's abuse of discretion and highlighting instances where the government wrongfully deported individuals to unsafe countries.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, set to begin within six hours, involving two 12-hour ceasefire periods initiated by Iran and followed by Israel.

Trump congratulated both countries for their stamina, courage, and intelligence in ending what he termed 'The 12 Day War.' The announcement followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear targets two days prior, escalating the conflict that began with Israeli strikes on Iranian military and nuclear targets on June 12.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump raised the possibility of toppling Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, suggesting regime change if the current Iranian regime cannot 'MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN.' This statement marks a shift from discouraging Israeli military strikes against Iran to potentially supporting broader interventionist goals. The phrase 'regime change' has a toxic history, associated with external, forcible transformations. Trump's remarks have caused acrimony within the MAGA right, as some aides, like J.D.

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can effectively bypass a federal law and an international treaty designed to protect immigrants from torture. The ruling allows Trump to send immigrants to countries where they may face torture while the case is being litigated. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the decision undermines due process protections for immigrants. The Trump administration claims it has found a loophole allowing it to bypass laws protecting immigrants from being sent to countries where they may be tortured, particularly by deporting them to third countries not initially considered.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Constitution divides war powers between Congress, which has the power to declare war, and the president, who serves as commander-in-chief. President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran without Congressional consultation has drawn criticism, highlighting the ongoing tension between the executive and legislative branches regarding military action. While Congress is granted the authority to declare war, presidents have historically engaged in military actions without formal declarations, leading to debates over the limits of executive power. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 sought to reassert Congressional authority, but its effectiveness has been debated, with presidents often sidestepping its requirements.</p>

          <p>Analysts in Taiwan are expressing concerns that the United States' involvement in the Middle East could stretch its military resources too thin to respond effectively to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. recently launched precision strikes on nuclear-related sites in Iran, prompting worries that American attention might be diverted from the Taiwan Strait. This concern arises from the fact that the U.S. is already heavily engaged in supporting Ukraine, potentially leaving fewer resources and less political capacity to respond swiftly if Beijing were to take action against Taiwan. Despite assurances that Taiwan remains a core U.S. interest, questions are being raised about the practical allocation of resources should the U.S. face multiple major conflicts simultaneously.</p>

Ballistic experts express skepticism about the effectiveness of bunker-buster bombs against deeply buried facilities, while others emphasize the importance of allowing international inspectors access to ascertain the true extent of the damage.

          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, earning $21 million in the U.S. and Canada. Despite positive reviews, the film struggled to attract audiences, highlighting the challenges faced by original animated movies in the current market. Analysts suggest that the film's performance may have been affected by competition from other family-friendly movies and a lack of familiarity with the title among audiences. Disney remains optimistic that 'Elio' will find its audience over the summer, similar to the success of 'Elemental,' and plans to continue investing in original animated content alongside sequels and franchises.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Doubts China Will Use Navy to Secure Strait of Hormuz</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a U.S. analyst, China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it due to rising Middle East tensions. Instead, China is expected to prioritize quiet negotiations and its own self-interests, rather than direct military intervention. This approach is consistent with China's past actions, such as its agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels. While China relies heavily on Middle Eastern oil, its response will likely be shaped by economic interests and strategic partnerships.</p>

          <p>A shooting at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, resulted in one person injured and the suspect dead after police responded to 911 calls. The suspect, identified as Brian Anthony Browning, arrived at the church wearing a tactical vest and armed with a long gun and handgun, firing at the church from outside. A parishioner struck the suspect with a vehicle, and at least two staff members, including a security guard, shot at him, killing the attacker.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran has vowed retaliation, with potential targets including U.S. military assets across the Middle East, the Strait of Hormuz, and global cyberattacks. Iran's short-range ballistic missiles make U.S. military installations in the Gulf vulnerable, while naval assets could be targeted with speedboats and missiles. Closing the Strait of Hormuz could disrupt global oil supplies, and state-sponsored terrorism remains a long-term threat.
