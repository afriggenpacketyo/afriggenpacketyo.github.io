          <p>The remains of a deceased Israeli hostage were transferred into Israel on Monday as part of a U.S.-brokered peace plan. This handover occurs amidst a fragile ceasefire that was recently tested by a weekend bout of violence, prompting diplomatic visits from U.S. envoys to keep the peace process on track. The agreement requires Hamas to return all hostages, both living and deceased, but the process has been slow, creating a point of contention in the ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>A recent survey highlights a significant generational divide in economic confidence among America's small business owners. Generation X entrepreneurs, many in their peak career years, report the lowest levels of optimism regarding both their own companies' stability and the broader U.S. economic outlook. They are most concerned with immediate pressures like inflation and rising costs, whereas younger Gen Z and millennial owners, while more optimistic about current conditions, express greater anxiety about a potential future recession.</p>

Investor optimism was boosted by reports of easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as strong performance from key companies like Apple, which approached a record high. Additionally, positive analyst ratings for companies such as Disney contributed to the market's upward momentum ahead of a busy week of corporate earnings reports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With a near-certain Federal Reserve interest rate cut expected at the end of October, savers are being advised to consider opening Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts now to lock in current rates. While top CD rates have decreased from their recent peaks, they still offer significantly better returns than traditional savings accounts. Financial experts suggest that prompt action is necessary, as banks often reduce their offered rates in anticipation of, or immediately following, a formal Fed decision. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American workers with employer-sponsored health insurance are expected to face premium increases of 6% to 7% in 2026, a rate more than double the current level of inflation. An analysis by consultant Mercer attributes the jump to factors like an aging workforce using more medical services and rising demand for expensive treatments. During the upcoming open enrollment period, employees may also see higher out-of-pocket costs, such as increased deductibles and co-pays, adding to financial pressures on households.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts jury has acquitted Karen Read of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, though she was convicted on a lesser charge of driving under the influence. The high-profile retrial concluded after her first trial ended with a hung jury. Prosecutors had alleged she struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die in the snow, while her defense team successfully argued she was framed in an elaborate cover-up.</p>
