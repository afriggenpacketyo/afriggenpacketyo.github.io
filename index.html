          <p>Recent corruption investigations into senior officials from ethnic minority groups signal a significant shift in the Chinese Communist Party's approach to elite politics. Previously, non-Han cadres were often treated with a degree of leniency, but the latest probes suggest this is no longer the case under President Xi Jinping's expansive anti-graft campaign. Observers interpret this as a move to enforce uniform political discipline across all ranks, indicating that ethnicity no longer serves as a protective factor against scrutiny within the party's upper echelons.</p>

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, known for his local persona as the "Zombie Hunter," has been sentenced to death for the brutal murders of two young women in the early 1990s. During the trial, his defense admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother led to dissociative amnesia. The judge rejected this defense, finding him guilty after prosecutors presented evidence undermining his claim of having no memory of the killings.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Craig, a dentist in Aurora, Colorado, faces a first-degree murder charge for the death of his wife, Angela Craig, who died following a mysterious illness. Authorities allege that he poisoned her daily protein shakes with lethal substances, including arsenic and potassium cyanide, which he reportedly researched and purchased online. The investigation was initiated after a staff member at his dental practice discovered a suspicious package containing cyanide and alerted a business partner, who then informed hospital staff and police. Craig has pleaded not guilty.</p>

His comments followed a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, where Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region as a condition for ending hostilities. As Zelenskyy prepares for crucial talks with Trump and European leaders in Washington, he reaffirmed Ukraine's position that substantive negotiations cannot begin until a ceasefire is in place.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first major storm of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane after briefly intensifying to a powerful Category 5. While its maximum wind speeds have decreased, the storm's overall size is expanding, and its outer bands are lashing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain and gusty winds, prompting flood warnings. The hurricane is forecast to turn northward, sparing the U.S. mainland a direct hit but still expected to generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>Demonstrators gathered in large numbers across Israel, particularly in Tel Aviv, to demand that the government secure a deal for the release of hostages held in Gaza and bring an end to the ongoing war. Protesters blocked major roads and participated in a general strike, reflecting a growing public sentiment that prioritizes the return of the remaining captives over continued military action. The movement has faced condemnation from far-right members of the government, who argue that such public pressure undermines national security.</p>

          <p>A derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has undergone a remarkable transformation into a luxury private venue, now listed for £3 million. After purchasing the abandoned property in 2017, owner Mike Conner undertook a challenging five-year renovation to modernize the off-grid, historic structure. Originally built to defend against French naval attacks, the fort now boasts 40 beds and its own nightclub, reviving its former identity as a unique and secluded party destination.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink attributes her successful and mentally resilient recovery from a torn ACL to the practice of creating vision boards. Introduced to the concept by a teammate during her 13-month rehabilitation, Brink used the collages to visualize her goals and maintain a positive mindset through the arduous process. Both her coach and the team's psychotherapist have praised her patient and focused approach, which they believe contributed significantly to her strong and immediate impact upon returning to the court.</p>

          <p>Germany's decision to suspend its humanitarian visa program has left approximately 300 Russian and Belarusian dissidents, whose applications were already approved, in a precarious situation. This program had been a vital lifeline for activists, journalists, and critics fleeing persecution in their home countries. Advocacy groups warn that without this path to safety, these individuals face a heightened risk of extradition or abduction if they remain in neighboring former Soviet states, effectively cutting off a key escape route from authoritarian regimes.</p>

          <p>Germany's ruling coalition is currently split on the issue of military conscription as it seeks to expand the Bundeswehr to meet NATO targets. The Social Democrats (SPD), led by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, favor enhancing voluntary service to attract more recruits. In contrast, their coalition partners in the CDU/CSU are pushing for a quicker return to some form of compulsory service, arguing that relying on volunteers alone is insufficient given the current geopolitical security threats and that the proposed reforms lack necessary urgency.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man has been rescued after being trapped for two days in a small cave behind a powerful waterfall in Tulare County, California. The man, an experienced rappeller, was navigating the Seven Teacups waterfalls when intense currents forced him off his lines and into the cavern. After he was reported missing, search crews located him with a drone, and a California Highway Patrol helicopter executed a challenging hoist to lift him to safety. He sustained only minor injuries and was treated for dehydration.</p>

          <p>As the annual cost of attendance at some American universities climbs toward the $100,000 mark, nine U.S. colleges stand out by offering a completely tuition-free education. This select group, which includes institutions like Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and the five U.S. service academies, provides a debt-free degree path. In exchange, these schools typically require students to meet high academic standards and commit to work-study programs or a period of post-graduation military service, making them a highly competitive but valuable option.</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling that ended race-based affirmative action, the Trump administration is demanding detailed admissions data from universities to investigate the potential use of "racial proxies." This heightened scrutiny is causing concern that the administration may also target class-based affirmative action programs, which are legal but often result in increased racial diversity. Some political strategists suggest this could be a misstep, as class-based preferences also benefit the white working-class students who are a key demographic for the Republican party.</p>

These sessions provided a platform for both coaches and players to share personal stories and express vulnerability, which Foster said led to emotional breakthroughs and a stronger team bond. The initiative is a core part of establishing a "We over me" culture as the Bruins prepare for the upcoming season, aiming to translate this newfound chemistry into on-field performance.</p>
