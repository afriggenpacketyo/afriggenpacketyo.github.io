          <p>Multiple firefighters were attacked in Kootenai County, Idaho, while responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain. The local sheriff's office reported that shots were fired shortly after the firefighters arrived, prompting warnings of an active shooter and a shelter-in-place order for residents. Idaho Governor Brad Little condemned the incident as a "heinous direct assault" on first responders and asked for prayers for them and their families. The situation is still developing, with the shooter reportedly at large and the wildfire continuing to burn.</p>

Mamdani, who would be the city's first Muslim and Indian American mayor, also addressed his pro-Palestinian views and dismissed President Trump's accusation that he is a communist.</p>

          <p>The search for the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, declared extinct in 1986, has become a national obsession in Australia, fueled by thousands of reported sightings. While enthusiasts use trail cams and search for physical evidence, scientists are pursuing a different path through de-extinction. A lab at the University of Melbourne, in partnership with Colossal Biosciences, is working to engineer the genome of a related marsupial, the dunnart, to recreate the thylacine. Despite skepticism from some experts who deem the project impossible, the efforts reflect a deep-seated hope and perhaps remorse for the animal's extinction.</p>

          <p>A rare photo album donated to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum provides a chilling glimpse into the off-duty lives of SS officers at the Auschwitz concentration camp. The scrapbook, belonging to SS officer Karl HÃ¶cker, shows officers and secretaries socializing, singing, and eating blueberries, activities that occurred while over a million people were being systematically murdered nearby. The photos, which include the only known images of Dr. Josef Mengele at the camp, inspired the Pulitzer-nominated play "Here There Are Blueberries." The discovery underscores the terrifying normality with which perpetrators of the Holocaust conducted their lives, raising profound questions about human capacity for evil.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is confronting a significant national security challenge posed by mysterious drone swarms repeatedly flying over critical installations, including Langley Air Force Base. These incursions, which have occurred for over five years, involve drones of various sizes, some as large as a small car, and have forced the relocation of advanced F-22 fighter jets. Top military officials admit to a "capability gap," as current radar systems are ill-equipped to detect these low-flying objects, and legal and safety concerns prevent simply shooting them down over U.S. territory. The incidents have prompted a high-level response, but the origin and purpose of the drones remain largely unknown.</p>

          <p>Esteemed German director Werner Herzog, now 82, reflects on his six-decade career, known for films that explore the extremes of nature and human sanity. In a wide-ranging interview, he discusses his impoverished childhood, his belief in "good criminal energy" for filmmakingâ€”including stealing a camera to start his careerâ€”and the grueling production of his classic film "Fitzcarraldo." Herzog, who narrates his own documentaries with a distinctive tone, maintains that he is the "only one who is clinically sane" in the film industry. He continues to work, teaching his "rogue film school" and insisting his prose will outlive his extensive filmography.</p>

          <p>Sealand, a former British anti-aircraft fort in the North Sea, stands as the world's smallest self-proclaimed state, established in 1967 by "pirate radio" broadcaster Roy Bates.

Its claim to statehood is bolstered by a 1978 incident where a German diplomat visited to negotiate a citizen's release, arguably constituting de facto recognition. To stay afloat financially, the royal family now sells noble titles online, continuing the unique legacy of their tiny, concrete nation.</p>

The 787 program has been plagued by production issues and serious allegations from whistleblowers, including the late John Barnett, who claimed that pressure to speed up production led to compromised safety standards. Whistleblowers have alleged that defective parts were used and that structural issues in the fuselage could lead to premature fatigue failure. While Boeing denies the claims pose a safety risk, the recent tragedy raises questions about whether past manufacturing flaws could have contributed.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on writers of "danmei," a popular genre of gay erotic fiction, with dozens of young female authors reportedly arrested since February. The writers, who publish on the Taiwan-hosted site Haitang Literature City, are accused of producing and distributing obscene material, a crime that can carry a prison sentence of over 10 years. The crackdown has sparked a debate on Chinese social media about the country's vague and selectively enforced pornography laws, which critics say are used to suppress LGBTQ+ themes and female sexual expression. The genre had become a pop culture force, making the state's scrutiny particularly notable.</p>

In New York, the annual Pride March drew large crowds, honoring the legacy of Stonewall and demonstrating the community's enduring spirit and resilience.</p>

          <p>One week after the U.S. strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, conflicting statements from the Trump administration have created confusion about the mission's effectiveness. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary initially claimed the sites were "obliterated," preliminary intelligence assessments reportedly suggested the setback to Iran's program was only temporary. As the week progressed, top officials appeared to shift the goalposts, emphasizing that the strike successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than focusing on the destruction of nuclear material. The evolving descriptions have led to ongoing questions about the actual extent of the damage and the primary objectives of the attack.</p>

          <p>A heatwave is building across the UK, with London recording temperatures of 31C (88F) for the second consecutive day. An amber heat health alert is in effect for much of England, warning that the weather is likely to impact the entire health service. Temperatures are expected to peak at 33C on Monday and potentially 34C in London on Tuesday, prompting health officials to urge the public to stay hydrated and check on vulnerable individuals. The heat is also affecting major events, with Glastonbury festival-goers advised to leave early to avoid the heat and Wimbledon expecting a record-hot opening day.</p>

          <h2>Accidental Ejection Caused by Tangled Strap Likely Led to Air Force Instructor Pilot's Death, Report Finds</h2>

          <p>An Air Force investigation has concluded that the death of Capt. John Robertson, an instructor pilot, was likely caused by an accidental ejection seat activation. The report suggests that while taxiing after a flight, a strap from Robertson's gear likely became tangled with the ejection handle, triggering it while he was not fully secured in his seat. The incident, which occurred at Sheppard Air Force Base last May, launched the highly respected pilot 100 feet into the air, causing fatal injuries. The investigation highlighted that unbuckling while taxiing is not uncommon and that guidelines on the practice are unclear.</p>
