        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Senate reviews President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, some Republican senators, including Rand Paul and Ron Johnson, are voicing concerns about its impact on the national debt, which stands at nearly $37 trillion. These deficit hawks are advocating for deeper cuts than those proposed in the House-passed version. While the bill aims to reduce outlays by over $1.5 trillion against current baseline spending, the Congressional Budget Office estimates it would add approximately $3.1 trillion to the debt. The Senate's challenge lies in balancing the demands for steeper cuts with the desires of moderates who want to protect key social safety net programs, while the White House insists the bill will save $1.6 trillion over 10 years.

          <p>Amid escalating attacks between Ukraine and Russia, the Trump administration has adopted a less prominent role in mediating the conflict, signaling a shift in U.S. strategy. President Trump has not publicly reacted to Ukraine's drone strikes inside Russia, which occurred just before negotiations in Istanbul. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, but the U.S. expressed disappointment with Russia's demands for a 30-day truce. As negotiations falter, both Russia and Ukraine have intensified their attacks, with Ukraine claiming significant damage to Russia's strategic bomber fleet, and Russia launching a record number of drones and missiles against Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A geomagnetic storm, anticipated to generate vibrant displays of the Northern Lights across a wide swath of the United States, turned out to be less potent than initially predicted. The colorful streaks of light, which are typically visible in northern regions, were not as widespread or intense as expected. Geomagnetic storms occur when disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere, caused by solar activity, interact with the upper atmosphere. This interaction excites atmospheric gases, resulting in the beautiful auroral displays known as the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis.</p>

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by Ernst's remarks regarding potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to concerns about the cuts by saying, "Well, we're all going to die," which Scholten criticized as lacking leadership. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and professional baseball player, intends to focus on President Trump's trade policies and their impact on Iowa farmers. While Iowa's House seats may be competitive in 2026, Democrats have not won a Senate race in the state since 2008.</p>

The decline comes amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with 1,088 cases reported.

Congress has been largely ineffective in pushing back, with Republicans hesitant to confront Trump and Democrats struggling to exert political power.

The ruling is the latest to limit the controversial practice of rapidly deporting individuals accused of gang membership under the 1798 law. The judge determined that the government has not provided sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation.

While he can source chicken feet from Brazil or Russia, they do not meet his standards. He hopes to resume serving the American phoenix talons once the tariffs are reduced.</p>

The agreement establishes a fixed price for delivering water supplies, starting at $671 per acre-foot in 2026, adjusted annually for inflation. This resolves a long-standing dispute over the price the Water Authority pays MWD for an exchange of water. The settlement is expected to improve collaboration between the agencies, enhance financial stability, and facilitate the movement of water to communities in need.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has described Mexico’s judicial elections as “extraordinary” and a “great success,” despite a turnout of less than 13% of eligible voters. The elections, championed by Sheinbaum, aimed to allow citizens to vote for judges, but the low participation rate has been criticized by opponents. Experts attribute the low turnout to the election being off-year, a convoluted balloting process, and the obscurity of the candidates. Critics have labeled the vote a setback for the ruling party, Morena, while supporters maintain it will reinforce the party's control over the judiciary.</p>

The closures would have affected offices of the Farm Services Agency, Natural Resource Conservation Service, and U.S. Forest Service. Lawmakers argued that the closures would hinder the USDA's ability to support California's agricultural sector, which is the largest in the nation. The administration cited cost savings as the initial reason for the closures, but ultimately rescinded the termination notices for eight of the nine offices.</p>
