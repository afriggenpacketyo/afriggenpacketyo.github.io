          <p>China recently held a major military parade in Beijing, attended by leaders from Russia and North Korea, signaling its ambition to challenge the U.S.-led global order. President Xi Jinping's vision is for China to become a dominant global power by 2049, leveraging economic influence through initiatives like the Belt and Road project to build political partnerships. While the West criticizes this "China model" for creating debt traps and ignoring human rights, it is gaining traction in the Global South. This strategic push aims to reform global governance and establish a new world order centered on Beijing's interests.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed edible microbeads made from green tea, vitamin E, and seaweed that show promise in combating obesity. In a study on rats fed a high-fat diet, the microbeads blocked fat absorption and led to a 17% reduction in body weight without the side effects associated with some existing weight-loss drugs. The components are all food-grade, and the nearly flavorless beads could potentially be integrated into everyday foods. While the results are exploratory and human trials are still needed, a clinical trial is now underway in China.</p>

          <p>Increasingly intense heatwaves are disrupting the start of the school year across the United States, forcing districts to shorten days or delay openings. With many school buildings lacking adequate cooling systems, educators and policymakers are exploring solutions like HVAC upgrades, creating greener schoolyards, and even rethinking the traditional summer break. The heat disproportionately affects students in low-income areas, exacerbating educational inequalities and posing health risks.

          <p>Despite a challenging first half of the year, Morgan Stanley analysts predict a significant improvement for China's major property developers in the coming months. The bank projects that the decline in sales and profitability will slow, with sales expected to fall by only 2% for the remainder of the year, potentially picking up in the fourth quarter. This optimistic outlook contrasts with weak interim results but is based on positive guidance from developers regarding margin recovery and a large stock of available homes in major cities.

The players, including Danny Murphy and Brian Deane, were clients of Kingsbridge Asset Management and now face significant financial hardship and tax debts. The MPs argue the case represents a "failure of regulation, accountability and duty of care," stating the players were victims of "financial abuse." The City of London Police previously investigated but closed the case in 2020 without bringing charges, citing insufficient evidence.</p>

Applications for purchasing a home fell by 3%, ending a four-week streak of increases, while refinancing applications saw a minor 1% rise. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the decline in purchase activity suggests that high home prices and broader affordability challenges remain significant barriers for potential buyers.

          <p>Contrary to a common narrative that women are happier without spouses or children, a new nationally representative survey suggests married mothers are the happiest demographic among women. The survey found 19% of married mothers described themselves as "very happy," compared to lower percentages for unmarried women and women without children. The study, controlling for factors like income and education, links this higher happiness to a greater sense of purpose and meaning derived from parenthood. Marriage was also associated with lower rates of loneliness and more frequent physical affection, which are strongly linked to well-being.</p>

          <p>A faction of the American right, including prominent media figures like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens, is increasingly questioning the historical consensus on Adolf Hitler and World War II. This revisionism often involves downplaying Hitler's evils, suggesting the U.S. should have sided with him, or blaming Winston Churchill as the primary villain. This trend is seen as a deliberate attempt to transgress societal taboos and challenge the post-war understanding of anti-Semitism's catastrophic consequences.

          <p>This article posits that the Democratic Party's struggles are not due to a messaging problem, but a fundamental framing problem, based on E.E. Schattschneider's 65-year-old theory of political conflict. It argues that Democrats have allowed Republicans, particularly under Donald Trump, to define the central conflicts of American politics, such as immigration and trade, forcing Democrats into a defensive posture. Instead of simply refining their talking points, the party needs to create and define new conflicts, like "builders vs. extractors," to reshape the political battlefield.

          <p>This op-ed argues that Senate leader Chuck Schumer and House leader Hakeem Jeffries should step down, describing their leadership as a record of "cowardice and capitulation" in the face of Donald Trump's authoritarianism. The author criticizes their failure to take strong stands, their deference to corporate interests, and their inability to inspire the Democratic base. The article points to specific instances, such as their refusal to endorse their own party's mayoral candidate in New York, as evidence that they are not equipped for the current political moment. It concludes that the party needs more fearless and energetic opposition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an unusual series of events, federal grand juries in Washington, D.C., have rejected at least four separate indictment requests from the Department of Justice in the past week. Former federal prosecutors describe the refusals as "exceptionally rare," suggesting a potential loss of credibility for the administration with local jurors. The rejected cases include one involving a woman who allegedly posted a threat against President Trump and another against a man accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent. This pattern raises questions about prosecutorial discretion and the grand jury's role as a check on government power.</p>

          <p>China's film market saw a slight year-on-year increase in box office revenue this summer, reaching 11.96 billion yuan (US$5.5 billion), but this figure remains significantly below the record set in 2023 and pre-pandemic levels. While more people returned to cinemas, industry insiders note that the market is still struggling with significant challenges. Demand has not kept up with the rapid expansion of theaters, and many big-budget films are failing to recoup their costs. In the first half of the year, only a small fraction of films managed to achieve significant box office success.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade featured several surprises in its strategic arsenal, including the public debut of new and advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Among the new systems displayed were the DF-61, DF-31BJ, and the submarine-launched JL-3, which are believed to represent significant upgrades in China's nuclear deterrent capabilities. The DF-61, in particular, is thought to be a successor to the advanced DF-41, potentially possessing a range of up to 15,000 km. The showcase of these powerful new weapons underscores Beijing's ongoing efforts to modernize and expand its military forces.</p>

          <p>The personal wardrobe of the late Venezuelan-born painter Luchita Hurtado, crafted entirely by her own hands, is being shared publicly for the first time. For nearly 80 years, Hurtado wore a self-designed uniform, typically a boxy, four-pocket smock shirt with matching pants or skirts, which she adapted with various fabrics and details. She began making her own clothes out of necessity while pregnant, rejecting contemporary maternity wear, and continued the practice throughout her life as a form of personal expression. This collection reveals another facet of her artistic practice, where every aspect of her life was part of a deliberate and creative routine.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Republican Party, including its members who are medical doctors, has abandoned scientific principles in favor of political ideology. The author contrasts former Senator Bill Frist, a surgeon who championed public health initiatives, with current Senator Bill Cassidy, a gastroenterologist who voted to confirm anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary. The piece contends that this shift represents a dangerous journey into denialism on critical issues like vaccines and climate change.

          <p>For decades, a treacherous three-mile stretch of Highway 101 in northern California known as Last Chance Grade has been plagued by landslides, threatening the region's only viable transport link. After years of costly temporary repairs, Caltrans has proposed a permanent solution: a $2.1 billion, 6,000-foot tunnel through the redwoods to bypass the eroding cliffs. The project highlights the struggle of remote, economically depressed areas to secure funding for critical infrastructure. If funding is secured, construction could begin by 2030, finally providing a safe and reliable route for the isolated communities that depend on it.</p>

While the overall level of hospital admissions remains low, the increases have prompted some local health officials to recommend that residents, particularly the vulnerable, consider wearing masks in indoor public settings. The West is currently the region with the highest coronavirus levels in sewage in the U.S. The updated 2025-26 vaccine is expected to be available soon, though new administration rules are causing some frustration.</p>
