          <p>Resorts World Sentosa's CEO affirmed the company will be prepared for its casino license renewal in 2026, following a reduced two-year extension from Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority due to "unsatisfactory" tourism performance. Despite the rebuke, the integrated resort is proceeding with a SG$6.8 billion expansion, including new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium. The company's strategy is shifting from retail to experiential offerings, with new hotels and attractions like Super Nintendo World planned to transform it into a premium lifestyle destination.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would know "in the first two minutes" of meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin whether a peace deal for Ukraine is achievable. The meeting, planned to be held in Alaska, faces skepticism as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refuses to participate, fearing Russia aims to legitimize its territorial gains. Trump has suggested the possibility of land swaps, a proposal Ukraine's constitution prohibits, raising concerns that any deal might reward Russian aggression. The article notes Trump's history of not following through on threats against Moscow and the potential for him to walk away if a deal seems impossible.</p>

          <p>The technology behind gene-editing human embryos is experiencing a revival, years after a Chinese scientist's 2018 announcement of the first gene-edited babies sparked global condemnation from the scientific community. The initial experiment, which utilized the new CRISPR technique, was widely seen as reckless and unethical. Now, some companies are again exploring and advancing this controversial field of human reproduction. This renewed push raises ongoing ethical questions and concerns about the future of genetic modification in humans.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a 5.8% drop in vacancies to 718,000 between May and July. The number of payrolled employees also saw a slight decrease, particularly in the hospitality and retail sectors, suggesting some firms are slowing recruitment or not replacing departing staff. Despite the slowdown, other indicators like wage growth remaining at 5% and a stable unemployment rate of 4.7% point to a gradual, rather than sharp, cooling of the labor market.

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened immediate legal action against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store rankings. Musk claims Apple is making it impossible for any AI company other than its partner, OpenAI, to achieve the top ranking, specifically citing his own Grok AI chatbot. The threat came after Musk celebrated Grok reaching the number five spot among free apps, while noting OpenAI's ChatGPT holds the top position and is featured in Apple's "Must-Have Apps" section. This escalates Musk's ongoing feud with OpenAI and adds to Apple's existing antitrust challenges.</p>

          <p>Ahead of President Trump's planned peace talks with Vladimir Putin, leaders from 26 of the 27 EU member states have issued a joint appeal, urging him to ensure any potential deal respects Ukraine's right to "choose its own destiny." The statement, which Hungary's Viktor Orban did not sign, emphasizes that a just peace must respect international law and territorial integrity. European leaders have expressed concern about being sidelined from the U.S.-Russia summit and fear that Trump might make territorial concessions to Russia that would undermine European security and reward Moscow's aggression.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, suspending planned tariff hikes that were set to take effect. Under the agreement, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances, unfair practices, and increasing market access for U.S. exporters. Despite the truce, some business owners express concern over the prolonged uncertainty, and trade flows between the two nations have already been significantly impacted this year.

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along Western Australia's coast, including the World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Reef, have experienced their most severe bleaching event ever recorded. The damage, spanning 1,500km, was caused by the state's "longest, largest and most intense" marine heatwave between August 2024 and May 2025. This event is part of a two-year global coral bleaching crisis driven by record-high ocean temperatures. Experts warn that climate change is making these events more frequent and intense, giving reefs insufficient time to recover and threatening their long-term survival.</p>

However, the same research reveals a stark lack of sympathy for Palestinian suffering, with 79% of Jewish Israelis reporting they are not troubled by reports of famine in Gaza.

While these overseas jobs are coveted in North Korea, the majority of their earnings are sent to the state, with recent tactics preventing workers from accessing their pay until they return home to deter escapes.

Analysts suggest Spain's minority leftist government may be using these high-profile foreign policy moves to distract from domestic issues.

          <p>Employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have recounted the harrowing moments of a shooting last week where a gunman fired nearly 200 shots at campus buildings, killing a police officer. Workers described hiding in bathrooms and knowing they were in a "killing field," expressing frustration with the leadership's response. The CDC union criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy for a brief visit and called for enhanced security measures, including armed guards and bulletproof glass. The gunman, who was killed during the incident, was reportedly an anti-vaccine advocate.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian firm, Wild Hornets, has released video of its new "Sting" interceptor drone, which it claims can reach speeds of up to 195 miles per hour. This speed is crucial for its mission of chasing down and destroying Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munitions used by Russia. The low-cost, $2,500 first-person-view (FPV) drone is part of Ukraine's broader strategy to use innovative technology to bolster its air defenses against overwhelming Russian drone and missile attacks. While still deployed at a small scale, Ukraine hopes such interceptors can help close a critical gap in its defense capabilities.</p>

Dohmke will stay on through the end of the year to manage the transition, but no immediate successor has been named. GitHub, now part of Microsoft's CoreAI group, has seen significant growth with its Copilot tool, but the competitive landscape for developer productivity tools is rapidly evolving.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his nomination of E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has defended Trump's economic policies. The nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, has raised concerns among some economists about the potential politicization of the independent federal statistical agency.

As e-commerce platforms vie for dominance in the instant retail market, which involves 30-minute delivery of goods, Wang argues for a balanced approach that fosters innovation without encouraging a zero-sum mindset. He suggests that instead of stifling competition, the goal should be to elevate it towards quality upgrades and a healthier industrial ecosystem.

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located a mountain lion hiding in the brush on the property and killed it.

This initiative focuses on mountains in the poorer Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The move contrasts with a significant fee increase for climbing Mount Everest, where peak season permits will now cost $15,000. Authorities hope waiving fees will attract climbers to less-explored areas, generating local income and jobs, though questions remain about the infrastructure needed to support an influx of tourists in these developing regions.</p>
