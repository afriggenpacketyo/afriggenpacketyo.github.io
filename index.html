          <p>Authorities have identified 20-year-old Wess Roley as the suspect who allegedly ambushed firefighters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, killing two and critically injuring a third. The sheriff believes Roley intentionally started a fire to lure the first responders into a trap before opening fire with a shotgun. Roley was found deceased at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. An investigation into his motive is ongoing, though it appears he was living out of his vehicle and had previously aspired to be a firefighter.</p>

The new U.S. factory is expected to be operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding plant in China will close.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has voiced strong opposition to the deep Medicaid spending cuts included in the GOP's major budget bill. He highlighted that the cuts break a promise from President Trump not to touch the program and questioned how he could justify the loss of coverage for over 600,000 people in his state. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that nearly 12 million people nationwide could lose their health insurance if the Senate bill becomes law, with significant concerns about the impact on rural healthcare services.</p>

          <p>A satirical commentary from The Atlantic frames the Republican "Big, Beautiful Bill" as a mechanism for redistributing wealth from average Americans to the ultra-rich. The piece humorously suggests that each citizen is assigned a billionaire to support, allowing them to live vicariously through lavish spending on yachts and private jets. The article contrasts this with cuts to social programs and the construction of facilities like the "Alligator Alcatraz" detention center, using irony to critique the bill's priorities and its impact on society.</p>

The legislation aims to defund Planned Parenthood for a decade, which could lead to the closure of nearly 200 clinics that provide a range of health services.

          <p>Over the weekend, Russia unleashed its most extensive aerial attack on Ukraine to date, launching over 500 drones and missiles across the country. The barrage was notable for targeting regions in Western Ukraine, which are far from the front lines and have been less frequently attacked. The massive assault marks a significant escalation in the conflict, which has now been ongoing for over three years, demonstrating Russia's continued and formidable offensive capabilities.</p>

          <p>In the current interest rate environment, savers are weighing the benefits of various financial products. A comparison of placing $10,000 in a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a money market account reveals nuanced differences in potential earnings. While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher fixed rates for 3- and 6-month terms, a money market account could yield more over a 9-month period. Savers must consider the guaranteed return of a CD against the variable rate of a money market account, especially with potential Fed rate cuts anticipated later this year.

          <p>A federal judge has delayed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. His lawyers requested the delay due to conflicting statements from the Trump administration about whether he would be deported again upon release from criminal custody, which would interfere with his trial. Abrego Garcia's case has become a focal point in the debate over the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement policies and procedures.</p>
