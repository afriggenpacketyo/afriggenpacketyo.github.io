          <p>Following a week of strikes between Israel and Iran, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to a ceasefire.

Netanyahu stated that Israel "achieved great historical achievements and placed itself on a par with the world powers." Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi affirmed that Iranian forces continued to "punish Israel for its aggression continued until the very last minute."</p>

          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, secured a trainee accountant position after applying for 646 jobs over 18 months. Morgan felt discouraged after facing numerous rejections and a lack of feedback, despite having completed a year in industry as part of her finance and accounting degree. She believes that the use of AI in resume screening programs may have initially hindered her application process. After adjusting her CV to be more ATS-friendly, she began to receive more assessment invitations and ultimately secured a job in London, highlighting the competitive nature of the graduate job market.</p>

          <p>Oil prices declined by 2% following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, alleviating concerns about supply disruptions in the Middle East.

The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key route for oil shipments, remained a tail risk, but the ceasefire announcement eased immediate fears. The International Energy Agency reassured that it had 1.2 billion barrels of emergency stockpiles available. (not investment advice)</p>

Perry, who is the godfather to Harry and Meghan's daughter, Princess Lilibet, has not received public support from the couple, leading to criticism from royal commentators. Experts suggest that their silence reflects a self-serving behavior, potentially damaging their credibility among friends and allies, regardless of the outcome of the allegations against Perry.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's proposed changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save Â£5 billion annually by 2030. The amendment cites concerns about the number of people expected to be pushed into relative poverty and the lack of adequate impact assessments. The vote on the government's bill is scheduled for July 1, and the level of support for the amendment indicates a potential rebellion facing ministers.</p>

The expert highlights that American children are more likely to die from gun injuries and road accidents than children in comparable countries. The commentary calls for policy changes to prioritize child health and safety.</p>

The government argues that measures on energy and tackling smuggling gangs could be classified as security spending. The plan aims to provide flexibility to EU countries while urging NATO allies to increase their defense spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of students enrolled in Japanese schools in China has decreased by over 10% in the academic year starting April. The decline is attributed to an economic downturn in China and safety concerns among Japanese expatriate communities. These concerns were heightened following a knife attack near Shanghai in June of the previous year, where Japanese nationals were injured, and the fatal stabbing of a Japanese boy in Shenzhen. Security measures have been increased at Japanese schools in China, but parents remain vigilant.</p>

Ferrari is seen as a national team within Italy, leading to intense scrutiny and high expectations from the media and the public. Team principal Frederic Vasseur expressed concerns about the impact of negative reports on the team's morale. The media's role is to report objectively and scrutinize, not to support, and the facts of Ferrari's current performance are ultimately Vasseur's responsibility.</p>

Trump's skepticism towards the CIA and his ideological purge of national security staffers have led him to disregard expert advice. The debate over Iran's nuclear program has devolved into theological disputes over the significance of uranium enrichment, with no evidence of weaponization.</p>

Western firms are barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese companies continue to use it, giving them a competitive advantage. The closure of airspace in Iran, Israel, Iraq, and Jordan has led to flight diversions and cancellations, particularly after Iran's missile assault on a U.S. military base in Qatar. Chinese airlines have more flexibility due to Moscow's closure of its airspace to the West after the Russia-Ukraine war started in 2022.</p>

Ian Byrne has written to Prime Minister Starmer demanding a "duty of candour" obligation, expressing concerns that it has been removed from a draft version of the bill. The proposed law aims to provide a legal responsibility for public servants to tell the truth and to offer legal funding to those affected by state-related disasters. Attempts to replace the bill with deficient redrafts are opposed by those who seek to protect their reputations above telling the truth.</p>
