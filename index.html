          <p>The European Union has fined Apple 571 million and Meta 228 million for violating the Digital Markets Act. Apple is penalized for preventing developers from informing users about alternative offers outside the App Store, while Meta is fined for requiring users to consent to data sharing or pay for an ad-free service. Meta's chief global affairs officer criticized the EU's actions as unfairly targeting American businesses and imposing a multi-billion-dollar tariff. The EU has ordered Apple to remove restrictions on steering and Meta to change its business model.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A hidden religious divide is emerging in politics, with a growing number of young, white men converting to Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, often influenced by online communities. These converts, disillusioned with modern values like feminism and racial equality, seek traditionalism and community, sometimes leading to clashes with established religious hierarchies. This trend is further polarizing American religion, traditionally a place of diverse political views, as these converts challenge established norms and seek to reshape religious institutions to align with their ideological aims. This shift reveals a deeper cultural rebellion against the American mainstream, fueled by online echo chambers.</p>

          <p>The enduring popularity of “Star Wars” raises questions about its influence on our understanding of rebellion, particularly the reliance on “chosen one” narratives. While the series explores themes of political animosity and complex moral choices, the “I am your father” twist shifted the focus to inherited destiny rather than collective action. This emphasis on messianic figures in blockbuster franchises may promote a passive expectation that societal change is best left to extraordinary individuals, rather than inspiring ordinary people to take action.</p>

          <p>The State Bar of California admitted to using artificial intelligence to develop multiple-choice questions for the February bar exam, causing outrage among prospective lawyers and legal experts. Concerns have been raised about the validity and reliability of the questions, as well as potential conflicts of interest. The State Bar maintains confidence in the questions' ability to assess legal competence fairly, but the California Supreme Court was unaware of the AI usage until recently. The State Bar will ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.</p>

California also faces potential funding losses over a law prohibiting schools from automatically notifying families about student gender-identity issues, with federal officials arguing it violates parental rights.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security mistakenly sent notices telling undocumented people to leave the country to some U.S. citizens. The error occurred as the Trump administration revokes legal status for migrants who entered the U.S. using the Biden-era border appointment app. Immigration attorneys report clients are choosing to self-deport due to fear. The DHS acknowledged the error, attributing it to the use of non-personal email addresses provided by immigrants.</p>

          <p>At least 26 people were killed and many others injured Tuesday, the vast majority of them tourists, when suspected militants opened fire on civilians in Indian-controlled Kashmir, according to Indian authorities in the region. Tens of thousands of Indian security forces spread out across Kashmir a day after the attack, as police, army and paramilitary forces continued their manhunt for the perpetrators. The attack came as U.S. Vice President JD Vance, along with his wife Usha and their children, paid a largely personal visit to India. It was the worst attack in the conflict-hit region in nearly a year, and it came at a time when tourism in Kashmir was recovering.</p>

          <p>China has reportedly called on Japan to form a united front against US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, but analysts say that is unlikely given Tokyo’s strategic calculus – one that prioritises its security alliance with Washington over economic alignment with Beijing. Citing multiple Japanese government sources, news agency Kyodo News reported on Tuesday that Chinese Premier Li Qiang had written to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to suggest an alliance to “fight protectionism together”. Beijing presumably hopes that an alliance of two of the world’s largest economies stands a better chance of convincing Trump to change course from the 145 per cent tariffs he has imposed on Chinese imports into the US.</p>
