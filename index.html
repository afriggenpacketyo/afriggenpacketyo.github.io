          <p>Authorities are investigating whether Ramon Morales Reyes, a migrant accused of threatening to shoot President Trump, was framed. Reyes allegedly wrote a threatening letter to an ICE agent, leading to his arrest, however, law enforcement sources are now examining whether the letter was sent by someone else. Reyes submitted to a handwriting test, which did not match the letter, suggesting a potential setup. The Milwaukee Police Department is investigating an identity theft and victim intimidation incident related to the case, adding another layer of complexity to the ongoing investigation. Optimism is tempered by the seriousness of the initial threat and the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>A US court ruling briefly suspended President Trump's tariffs on imported goods, offering a glimmer of hope to the EU, but an appeals court quickly reinstated them, creating further confusion. The EU is currently engaged in negotiations with the US to reach trade agreements, aiming for a "zero-for-zero" tariff deal. The EU has also prepared countermeasures on US goods, which have been paused pending negotiations. Experts are divided on whether the court ruling strengthens the EU's position or adds more uncertainty to the trade landscape, as the president could find other ways to impose tariffs regardless of the ruling.</p>

          <p>Despite Jamie Dimon's consistent warnings about economic calamities, JPMorgan Chase has thrived under his leadership, generating record profits. Dimon's public statements often express concerns about potential crises, geopolitical turmoil, and the U.S. deficit, which some attribute to brand-building or a strategy to keep his management team focused on future risks. While his predictions haven't always materialized, JPMorgan has consistently outperformed rivals, driven by its diversified business and investments in technology. The bank's success underscores the resilience of the U.S. economy, even amidst global uncertainties, and the value of cautious leadership in the financial sector.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal is pending. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, criticizing the majority for potentially causing needless human suffering before the courts reach a final judgment. The Department of Homeland Security stated it can now begin removing migrants under the CHNV parole programs. The ruling follows a similar decision allowing the Trump administration to revoke the status of Venezuelan immigrants under the Temporary Status Program.</p>
