          <p>A group of international culinary experts toured Higashikagawa and Miki in Kagawa Prefecture, Japan, to experience the local food culture. The chefs visited a soy sauce brewery, participated in a traditional tea ceremony, and made "somen" noodles by hand. Participants praised the rich flavor of the tea and the emphasis on simple cooking that highlights local ingredients. Miki Mayor Yoshiharu Ito presented the guests with a traditional hand towel featuring designs by a local artist. The tour was organized in conjunction with a national conference for promoting food education in Tokushima, providing the experts with a deep dive into regional culinary practices and traditions. The experience was described as memorable, highlighting the similarities between Japanese and Italian cooking philosophies.</p>

          <p>Germany may face tax hikes and rising debt as NATO considers a higher defense spending target, potentially reaching 5% of GDP. In 2024, Germany spent about 2% of its GDP on defense, totaling over 90 billion euros. An increase to 5% would require significant additional funding, possibly through loans, leading to budget conflicts and potential cuts in other areas. Experts suggest that while additional debt might provide short-term flexibility, it could lead to higher interest costs in the medium term, impacting the federal budget. The EU's fiscal rules could also pose challenges to increased debt, though temporary suspensions are possible under exceptional circumstances (not investment advice).</p>

Blaze went missing on January 2, 2018, and his parents found messages on his Snapchat from Sam Woodward, a high school classmate, indicating they had met up the night he disappeared. After days of searching, investigators found Blaze's body buried in a shallow grave in Borrego Park; he had been stabbed more than 20 times. Sam Woodward was arrested and charged with murder, later receiving a hate crime enhancement due to evidence of his involvement with a neo-Nazi group; he was sentenced to life in prison without parole after being found guilty of first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump asserts a major foreign policy victory by claiming a lasting ceasefire between Iran and Israel following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump declared the "obliteration" of Iran's nuclear program and an unlimited ceasefire, though questions remain about the completeness of the destruction and a missing stockpile of enriched uranium. Critics point out that Trump acted without consulting Congress and ignored intelligence suggesting Iran wasn't close to developing a weapon.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1," the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, potentially accelerating AI and data centers. The chip achieves a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, rivaling Nvidia's advanced GPUs. This development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors. Optical computing offers advantages like ultra-high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption, positioning it as a critical future direction in overcoming these barriers. The focus is now on expanding computational parallelism to enhance chip capabilities.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East.

Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some suggesting a "peace through strength" strategy. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, which allowed for the prevention of casualties, and called for a move toward peace, signaling a potential shift in the regional dynamics (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, accounting for 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar's deposits are high in heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium, crucial for high-tech manufacturing. China effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar, leading to environmental and human rights concerns.

          <p>Eight people died on Lake Tahoe after multiple boats capsized due to a sudden storm with high winds and large swells. Gloria Brigantino witnessed the event, describing rapidly changing conditions and boats crashing into each other. The winds reached 35mph and caused tents and canopies to fly, with some people risking their lives to help others get off the water. The last missing person was recovered, bringing the death toll to eight, and officials are investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments by £5 billion a year by 2030. The MPs express concerns about the plans making it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The amendment cites concerns about pushing people into poverty, a lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. The vote on the government's bill is scheduled for July 1.</p>

          <p>Florida is constructing a migrant detention center, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' on an air strip in the Everglades. The facility aims to temporarily hold migrants and is part of efforts to ramp up deportations. The location is intended as a natural deterrent for escapees due to the presence of alligators and pythons. The mayor of Miami-Dade County criticized the plan, citing potential environmental damage to the Everglades ecosystem, though officials stated the facility would not be located within Everglades National Park.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded the 2001 'Roadless Rule,' a policy that protected 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, arguing that rescinding it will enable better forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups denounced the decision, stating it would harm wildlife habitats and water sources, and accusing the administration of prioritizing timber companies over environmental protection. The decision aligns with Trump's efforts to expand mining, logging, and drilling on public lands.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning or the chance to challenge them on the grounds of potential torture or death in their home countries. The court lifted an injunction that blocked the practice, with the three liberal justices dissenting. Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin praised the ruling, while the head of a legal group representing the immigrants criticized it for stripping due process protections. The ruling is set to remain in effect as an appeal by the Trump administration plays out.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump took a gamble by involving the US in the conflict between Israel and Iran, but it may have resulted in a ceasefire. Trump announced that the two countries agreed to a ceasefire, potentially stepping back from a conflict that could have engulfed the region. Iran stated they would halt attacks if Israel stopped its aggression by 4 am Tehran time, and the attacks reportedly ceased. The article examines the events leading up to the ceasefire, including Iran's retaliatory missile strike and Trump's warning of an overwhelming American response.</p>
