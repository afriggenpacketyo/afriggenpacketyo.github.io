        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated boxing match between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford, sports analysts are divided on the likely outcome, presenting compelling arguments for both fighters. Crawford's supporters highlight his technical prowess, adaptability, and potential to expose Canelo's perceived decline, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, those favoring Canelo emphasize his significant size and power advantage, extensive experience at super-middleweight, and strategic selection of opponents throughout his career. The article details how Crawford's speed and boxing intelligence could challenge Canelo, while Canelo's strength and ability to control the fight's pace could ultimately overwhelm the smaller Crawford, making the bout a fascinating clash of styles.</p>

          <p>It is understood that officials in No 10 and the Foreign Office were aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended him. Sources indicate that while the Foreign Office received a media inquiry about the messages on Tuesday, the Prime Minister himself was not briefed on their contents before his statement on Wednesday. The emails, which revealed a close relationship, led to Mandelson's dismissal as UK ambassador to the US, with Downing Street citing the messages as "new information." The situation has intensified pressure on Starmer regarding his handling of the appointment and the vetting process involved.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous administration, calm has returned to Nepal's capital as Sushila Karki was sworn in as the nation's first female interim prime minister. The youth-led 'GenZ' demonstrations, which left over 50 people dead, led to the dissolution of parliament, with new elections now scheduled for March 5. Karki, a 73-year-old former Supreme Court Chief Justice with a reputation for fighting graft, was appointed after negotiations involving the army, the president, and protest leaders. The appointment marks a significant political shift after widespread unrest fueled by a social media ban and prolonged economic difficulties, offering a potential path toward stability.</p>

The initiative, starting with the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to 20 new mothers. To qualify, applicants must be under 40, have given birth within the last two years, and hold a doctoral degree with a senior professional title. This program is designed to support women in science returning to their careers after childbirth, tackling two of China's major policy challenges simultaneously.</p>

Faye Hall, who was detained with the couple, stated they are "literally dying" and that their health has deteriorated rapidly due to harsh conditions, with Barbie Reynolds losing significant weight and Peter Reynolds suffering from pre-existing heart and cancer conditions. The couple, aged 80 and 76, have lived in Afghanistan for years and ran a charity, yet the reason for their detention remains unknown. The Foreign Office has stated it is supporting the family, but diplomatic options are limited since the UK embassy in Kabul closed in 2021.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill that would ban most on-duty law enforcement officers from wearing masks that obscure their identity. The measure, which now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, was proposed in response to recent immigration raids where federal agents concealed their faces. Proponents argue the ban is necessary for public trust and accountability, questioning how citizens can verify the identity of masked individuals claiming to be officers. However, law enforcement agencies and Republican lawmakers oppose the bill, contending that face coverings are crucial for protecting officers' safety from potential retaliation and threats. The legislation includes exceptions for undercover operations, medical masks, and certain tactical gear.</p>

          <p>NATO is bolstering its eastern flank with additional troops and fighter jets after a significant Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace. Denmark, France, and Germany are leading a new mission to reinforce the region's air defenses, with other allies expected to join, following an incident where 19 drones entered Poland, some being shot down. The incursion has heightened tensions across Europe, with Poland's Prime Minister calling it the closest the continent has been to open conflict since World War II. While Warsaw insists the act was deliberate, Moscow has downplayed its significance, claiming it had no intention of targeting Polish facilities.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential reasons behind Cristiano Ronaldo's decade-long absence from the United States and his sudden renewed interest, linking it to the current political climate and the upcoming World Cup. It speculates that a friendly match between Portugal and the U.S. could signal a clearing of the way for his return, possibly influenced by a more favorable political environment. The author connects his absence to long-standing, though unproven, allegations of sexual assault from 2009, suggesting that his presence could have previously drawn negative publicity and legal risks. The piece frames Ronaldo's potential return as a strategic move for his brand and a symbolic victory for a political administration that favors powerful, wealthy figures.</p>

          <p>A concrete border wall erected as part of a demarcation process between Armenia and Azerbaijan has physically divided the Armenian village of Kirants, creating a new reality for its residents. While the wall has successfully stopped cross-border gunfire that once plagued the community, it has also brought economic hardship, cutting off farmers from their lands and depressing the local economy. The demarcation, based on old Soviet maps, resulted in some villagers' properties suddenly falling on the Azerbaijani side, for which they received government compensation. The situation reflects a broader national political crisis in Armenia over territorial concessions, leaving villagers with mixed feelings of relief from conflict but anxiety over their future.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece uses the recently released 2003 Jeffrey Epstein birthday album as a lens to examine the widespread normalization of the sexual exploitation of underage girls in the 1970s and 80s. The author, Rebecca Solnit, recalls how movies, rock music culture, and societal attitudes of that era often excused or even celebrated relationships between adult men and teenage girls. The article argues that this permissive culture has been significantly challenged and changed by decades of feminist activism. Feminism, Solnit contends, successfully reframed consent, exposed the power dynamics inherent in such relationships, and denormalized abuses like child abuse and sexual assault, marking a profound shift from the cultural standards prevalent when Epstein's network was flourishing.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to order an airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar appears to have backfired significantly after the mission reportedly failed to kill its primary targets. The strike, which killed five low-level Hamas members and a Qatari guard, has enraged mediator Qatar, strained relations with the United States, and jeopardized ceasefire negotiations, potentially endangering the remaining hostages in Gaza. While intended to project strength and move closer to "total victory," the failed gamble has instead damaged Netanyahu's international standing without delivering a strategic blow to Hamas. Despite the setback, Netanyahu's hard-line coalition remains supportive, and he shows no signs of altering his war strategy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' recent momentum was halted in a frustrating 5-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants, decided by a walk-off grand slam in the 10th inning. The defeat wasted an exceptional performance from starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who allowed only one run and one hit over seven innings while striking out ten. However, the Dodgers' lineup struggled to produce, scoring only a single run and going 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position. The game ultimately fell to the bullpen, where closer Tanner Scott gave up the decisive home run, marking another disappointing late-game collapse for the team and reigniting concerns about its offensive consistency.</p>

          <p>The mysterious disappearance of British woman Sarm Heslop from a luxury yacht in the US Virgin Islands in 2021 remains unsolved, with newly released CCTV footage raising more questions. The footage shows Heslop and her boyfriend at the time, Ryan Bane, returning to their dinghy at 8:45 PM, an hour earlier than Bane had reported to the Coast Guard, creating an unaccounted-for hour in the timeline. Bane, who has never been formally questioned and is considered a person of interest, maintains Heslop likely fell overboard. He also waited over nine hours after reporting her missing to local police before contacting the Coast Guard, a delay that officials say severely hampered the search effort.</p>

          <p>A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck off the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula early Saturday morning. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter approximately 112 kilometers east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 39 kilometers. Despite the quake's strength, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the sparsely populated region. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a threat advisory but quickly rescinded it, confirming that there was no danger of a tsunami impacting the area. The peninsula is a seismically active region and experienced a series of powerful quakes in July 2025.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is expected to achieve significant success in local elections in Gelsenkirchen, a traditional stronghold of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD). This election is seen as a major test of public opinion for the new national coalition government. The AfD's campaign has capitalized on local frustrations over issues like dilapidated housing and crime, which they link to labor migration. Community leaders and social workers express deep concern that an AfD victory could lead to funding cuts for vital integration and youth programs, while political opponents work to counter the party's narrative by highlighting its anti-worker economic policies.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the Karen Read case, from the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in January 2022, through two lengthy and contentious murder trials. Read was accused of striking O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in a snowstorm, while her defense argued she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The first trial ended in a hung jury and a mistrial in July 2024. The retrial concluded in June 2025 with jurors acquitting Read of second-degree murder and manslaughter, but convicting her of driving under the influence, for which she received one year of probation.</p>
