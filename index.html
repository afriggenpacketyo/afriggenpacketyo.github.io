          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, accusing the company of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. The lawsuit alleges that Uber systematically denies service to individuals with disabilities, particularly those with service animals or mobility devices like wheelchairs. Uber has refuted the claims, stating it has a zero-tolerance policy for such discrimination and has invested in training and technology to ensure accessibility. This legal action follows a previous settlement where Uber compensated disabled users for being charged wait-time fees.</p>

The suspect was later identified using surveillance footage and was found to have used the victims' credit cards after the attack. The crime has shocked the community, highlighting concerns about violent crime and the suspect's extensive criminal record.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in central London for a "Unite the Kingdom" march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, prompting a significant police presence and a counter-protest by anti-racism groups. The march featured slogans such as "Stop the Boats" and drew various groups, including anti-transgender activists. Simultaneously, a "March Against Fascism" was held nearby by Stand up to Racism, with demonstrators advocating for refugee rights and opposing Robinson's platform. The Metropolitan Police deployed around 1,000 officers to manage the demonstrations and prevent clashes between the opposing groups.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships have commenced in Tokyo, marking a return to large-scale sporting events in the city four years after the pandemic-affected Olympics. However, the event is accompanied by significant controversy surrounding the reintroduction of mandatory genetic testing for female athletes. World Athletics requires athletes in the female category to undergo an SRY gene test to detect a Y chromosome, a policy critics argue is unreliable and discriminatory. The federation defends the rule as necessary to protect the integrity of women's sports, but it has sparked debate and criticism.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The attack, described as a targeted assassination, involved a single shot fired from a high-powered rifle on a nearby building's roof. Investigators tracked the suspect using surveillance footage and recovered the weapon, which was found with bullets inscribed with messages like "hey fascist! CATCH!". Robinson's father reportedly recognized his son from police photos and urged him to surrender, leading to his capture.</p>

The plan includes expanding investment opportunities in key sectors like new infrastructure and emerging services. The government also intends to increase financial support through central budget allocations and reserve a portion of government procurement contracts for small and medium-sized enterprises.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy is showing signs of heading toward stagflation, a rare combination of stagnant growth, high inflation, and rising unemployment. Economists are increasingly pointing to former President Trump's policies, such as tariffs and immigration crackdowns, as contributing factors that have slowed hiring while pushing prices higher. This economic condition complicates the Federal Reserve's ability to manage the economy, as traditional tools like interest rate adjustments are less effective when both inflation and unemployment are rising. The situation creates uncertainty for consumers and investors alike. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of scientists is advocating for Chagas disease, which is spread by "kissing bugs," to be officially treated as an endemic disease in the United States. While commonly associated with Latin America, local transmission has been confirmed in at least eight U.S. states, yet awareness among the public and medical professionals remains low. The disease, caused by a parasite, can be asymptomatic for years but may lead to severe cardiac or intestinal problems later in life.

          <p>For individuals receiving a significant inheritance, financial experts recommend a structured approach to managing the windfall. The first steps should be to pay off all existing debts and establish a substantial emergency fund for financial security. Following that, the remaining capital should be invested in a diversified portfolio to limit risk and minimize costs. A common strategy, endorsed by Warren Buffett, is to allocate a large portion to a broad market index fund like the S&P 500, with the remainder in safer assets like short-term government bonds.

          <h2>Kashmiri Artisans Face Economic Hardship Due to New U.S. Tariffs on Indian Goods</h2>

          <p>Artisans in India-administered Kashmir, known for their traditional papier-mache, carpets, and shawls, are facing a severe economic threat from new U.S. tariffs. The tariffs, imposed amid a dispute over Russian oil, have sharply increased the prices of these luxury handicrafts, leading to a drop in demand from American buyers. This has jeopardized the livelihoods of thousands of artisans who depend on exports, particularly Christmas orders, to the U.S. and Europe. The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry has described the tariffs as "catastrophic" for the region's vital handicraft sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck off the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka region early Saturday. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's epicenter was located about 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a relatively shallow depth. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the sparsely populated region. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a threat advisory but later canceled it, though Japan's meteorological agency noted the possibility of minor sea level changes along its coasts.</p>

          <p>A growing number of smaller colleges are adding or reviving football programs as a strategy to increase overall enrollment, particularly among male students. With women now outnumbering men at four-year colleges nationwide, administrators hope that the sport and its associated campus spirit will attract more men. For example, Roanoke College in Virginia brought back its team after an 82-year hiatus and saw its incoming freshman class become majority male. While research suggests these enrollment gains may be temporary, schools see it as a viable tool to address declining student populations.</p>

          <p>Over thirty individuals across the U.S., including many public school teachers, have reportedly lost their jobs or are facing investigations due to social media posts critical of conservative activist Charlie Kirk following his assassination.

          <p>A California ballot measure aiming to redraw the state's congressional districts features unusual and explicitly partisan language, directly referencing Texas's recent redistricting efforts. The measure, which seeks voter approval to temporarily bypass the state's independent commission, is a Democratic response to a Republican-led gerrymander in Texas. The ballot title, "AUTHORIZES TEMPORARY CHANGES TO CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT MAPS IN RESPONSE TO TEXAS' PARTISAN REDISTRICTING," highlights the national political stakes. Experts note the rarity of a ballot measure referencing another state's actions and its potential to play on voters' partisan emotions.</p>

          <p>As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become widely used by teenagers for everything from homework to personal advice, child development experts are urging parents to engage in open conversations about the technology. They recommend that parents learn about AI themselves and explore it alongside their children to discuss its benefits and limitations. While AI can be a helpful learning aid, it also poses risks, such as providing inaccurate information or unsafe responses to mental health queries. Establishing household rules and setting limits are key strategies for navigating this new technological landscape.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that senior officials in Downing Street and the Foreign Office were aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly defended the ambassador. A media inquiry detailing the emails was allegedly sent to the Foreign Office the day before the Prime Minister's Questions session. While sources state Starmer himself was not personally aware of the emails' contents at the time, the revelation has raised questions about his office's handling of the situation.

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of adult film actress Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account. The court found that the company removed her account, which had over five million followers, without clear justification and applied its content moderation policies inconsistently compared to similar accounts. The ruling states that social media posts are protected under the Colombian constitution. Meta has been ordered to review its policies to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions and to better define its rules.</p>
