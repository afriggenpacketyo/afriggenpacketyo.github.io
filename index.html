          <p>Former President Trump toured central Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic flash floods that killed over 120 people. His visit focused on coordinating with state officials, including Governor Greg Abbott, and meeting with first responders and victims' families. Unlike his responses to other disasters, Trump has refrained from criticizing local authorities, instead emphasizing his strong relationship with the Republican state leadership. The visit comes amid ongoing search and rescue operations for over 170 missing individuals and scrutiny over the federal and local response to the crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant shift from the previous month's deficit. This unexpected surplus was largely fueled by a substantial increase in customs duties, which surged over 300% compared to the previous year following new tariffs. Despite this monthly gain, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains high at $1.34 trillion, with net interest on the national debt continuing to be a major expense. The figures highlight the immediate fiscal impact of the administration's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ashley Williams, a long-serving aide to former President Joe Biden, voluntarily appeared for a closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee. The committee is investigating allegations that Biden's staff concealed his cognitive and physical decline during his presidency. Williams, who has worked with the Bidens since the Obama administration and continues to advise the former president, is the third inner-circle member to be questioned. Her appearance was not under subpoena, as the Trump White House waived executive privilege for her and other former aides.</p>

          <p>A disturbing pattern of kidnappings targeting women from Syria's Alawite minority has emerged, with dozens reportedly abducted, abused, and held for ransom. The article details the harrowing experience of "Nora," who was brutalized for a month before her family paid a large sum for her release. These incidents are seen as a form of subjugation against the Alawite community, which has faced persecution following the ousting of Bashar Assad. The UN and human rights groups are documenting these cases, but many families remain silent due to fear and shame.</p>

Despite a long career in public service, he faced sustained pressure over the shooting and ultimately resigned after losing the support of then-Mayor Boris Johnson.

A recent article highlights three potential strategies: reverse mortgages, annuities, and personal loans. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive payments from their home equity, while an annuity provides guaranteed lifetime payments in exchange for a lump-sum investment. Although less ideal due to interest costs, a personal loan can also serve as a crucial financial backstop for immediate needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tax experts are highlighting a potential tax surprise in President Trump's "big beautiful bill" that could affect high-income earners. The legislation temporarily raises the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 but includes a phaseout for those with modified adjusted gross incomes between $500,000 and $600,000. This structure creates a "SALT torpedo," where the loss of the deduction combined with a higher income bracket can result in an unusually high effective tax rate, potentially over 45%, on earnings within that specific income range.

          <p>The widely adopted fitness goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent research has shown it is a reasonably effective benchmark for health. Studies indicate that health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts, around 2,500 to 3,000 per day, and may plateau near 7,500 steps. Experts agree that while 10,000 is a good target, the most important thing is to be more active than you currently are.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its most severe measles outbreak in 33 years, with over 1,200 cases confirmed in 2025, surpassing the total for all of 2019. Health experts are concerned that the summer travel season will further accelerate the spread of the highly contagious disease. The resurgence is attributed to declining vaccination rates, fueled by disruptions during the pandemic and the growth of anti-vaccine sentiment. Officials are urging the public to ensure their MMR vaccinations are up to date to prevent further illness and potential fatalities.</p>

          <p>A recent essay in The Atlantic challenges the concept of American exceptionalism by arguing that the U.S. is not immune to the political and social troubles seen in other countries, including moves toward authoritarianism. The piece draws on two books, one about Argentina's Dirty War and another on the history of the Western Hemisphere, to make its point. It suggests that just as the U.S. can learn from the cautionary tales of state violence elsewhere, it can also learn from the democratic principles and liberation movements pioneered in Latin America.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has ranked the most expensive states to live in for 2025, with California taking the top spot, followed by Hawaii, Florida, and Colorado. The rankings consider the cost of goods and services, housing affordability, and rapidly rising homeowner's insurance premiums. States like California and Florida are burdened by a high percentage of residents paying over a third of their income on housing. The report underscores how inflation and other economic pressures, such as the insurance crisis, vary significantly by location and continue to impact household budgets across the country.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that COVID-19 cases are likely on the rise in half of all U.S. states, signaling the start of a potential summer wave. While national activity is still rated as "low," data from wastewater samples and emergency room visits show an uptick, particularly in the Southeast and on the West Coast. A recent CDC analysis suggests the virus has settled into a predictable biannual surge pattern, with peaks in late summer and winter.

          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling under the weight of debt, several relief options can provide a path to financial stability. An article details four key strategies: credit counseling, credit card debt forgiveness, hardship programs, and bankruptcy. Credit counseling can help create a manageable payment plan, while debt forgiveness involves negotiating a lower lump-sum settlement with creditors. Hardship programs offered by lenders can provide temporary relief, and for overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can offer legal protection and a chance for a fresh start.

          <p>Missouri's governor has signed a bill repealing a paid sick leave law that was approved by voters just eight months ago. The original ballot measure guaranteed workers could earn paid time off and linked the minimum wage to inflation. Business groups, who called the measure a "job killer," lauded the repeal, while workers' rights advocates described it as a "betrayal" of Missouri families. The repeal, which takes effect in August, marks a significant reversal of a policy passed directly by the electorate, though supporters are already planning a new ballot initiative to reinstate the benefits.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a pilot project in England where GP surgeries will offer patients services like career coaching and exercise classes to help them return to work more quickly. The goal is to reduce the number of people signed off on long-term "fit notes" by shifting the focus to what support they need to re-enter the workforce. The initiative is part of a broader government effort to address the 2.8 million people out of work due to health conditions. The Royal College of GPs expressed support but cautioned that the scheme should not be punitive for patients or doctors.</p>
