          <p>Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly of Virginia has died at the age of 75 after battling esophageal cancer. Connolly, who served in Congress since 2008, was known for his advocacy on behalf of federal employees in his district. He had stepped down from his role as the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform due to his returning cancer. Colleagues across the aisle paused a House Rules Committee meeting to honor Connolly with a moment of silence, remembering his dedication to public service and his ability to build friendships on both sides of the aisle.</p>

          <p>Target CEO Brian Cornell has cautioned about the potential for "massive costs" due to tariffs, emphasizing that the company would only raise prices as a last resort to protect American families' budgets. This warning follows similar concerns raised by Walmart and Best Buy regarding possible tariff-driven price increases. Target reported a 2.8% drop in sales for the most recent quarter, attributing it to consumer concerns over tariffs and backlash related to the rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. Cornell acknowledged the challenging environment and the company's focus on improving the shopping experience to regain market share.</p>

          <p>This article reports that current certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates are providing opportunities for savers to earn returns that outpace inflation. Online banks often offer the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. The inverted yield curve has made short-term CDs (six months to one year) more attractive than longer-term options. Strategies such as CD laddering can help savers take advantage of high rates while planning for long-term financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>
