          <p>Jannik Sinner defeated Novak Djokovic in the French Open 2025, marking a potential shift in the tennis hierarchy. Djokovic, aiming to become the oldest Grand Slam champion, was unable to overcome Sinner's consistent pressure and varied tactics. Sinner's ability to save set points and maintain control in the tie-break ultimately secured his victory. This sets up a highly anticipated final match against Carlos Alcaraz, signaling a new generation of tennis stars. The article highlights Djokovic's efforts to adapt his game, including baseline duels and serve-and-volley attempts, but Sinner's resilience proved too strong. Optimism is tempered by the acknowledgement of Djokovic's aging and the shift in dominance.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant wrongly deported by the Trump administration, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal charges related to human smuggling.

          <p>A public dispute has broken out between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, with Trump dismissing Musk's political opinions and Musk criticizing Trump's policies.

Trump stated he is not interested in speaking with Musk, who he claims has "totally lost it."

The article details the close relationship the Salarno family had with Burns before the murder, the warning signs they missed, and the devastating impact of Catina's death. The Salarno family's activism led to significant changes in California law, including allowing victims to give impact statements and ensuring children have support when testifying.

This decision permits DOGE to proceed with its work while legal proceedings continue, despite concerns over privacy violations. The lawsuit, brought by labor unions and an advocacy group, alleges that the SSA unlawfully granted DOGE unfettered access to data systems containing personal information of millions of Americans. Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson dissented, emphasizing the potential privacy risks and questioning the need for such access before legal entitlement is established.</p>

          <p>Fresh US sanctions against judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) have sparked calls for the EU to intervene and protect the court's independence. The sanctions, targeting judges involved in investigations related to the US and Israel, have been criticized as undermining international justice. While the EU has expressed support for the ICC, some are urging the bloc to activate its "blocking statute" to counter the extraterritorial impact of US measures. The situation highlights divisions among EU member states regarding the ICC and its ability to enforce international law.</p>

This decline in billings, a closely watched sales metric, has raised concerns among investors about the company's future growth. The lowered outlook reflects potential challenges in maintaining sales momentum for the e-signature provider.</p>
