          <h2>CCTV Error Uncovers Widespread Abuse at Northern Ireland Psychiatric Hospital</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:37:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major adult safeguarding investigation was launched at Muckamore Abbey Hospital in Northern Ireland after a CCTV system, mistakenly left running for six months, captured 300,000 hours of footage. The recordings revealed horrific systemic abuse against vulnerable, non-verbal patients, including physical assaults and severe neglect by staff. Despite the discovery in 2017, which police described as one of the UK's largest crime scenes, no cases have yet come to trial, and families have been denied access to the footage. The scale of the abuse and the slow pace of justice have drawn criticism, with campaigners calling for mandatory CCTV in all facilities caring for vulnerable people.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent offers a behind-the-scenes look at the chaotic and unusual trial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who were convicted of manslaughter in the death of their baby, Victoria. The couple displayed a united front and affection for each other in court while showing contempt for the legal process, causing numerous delays and nearly collapsing the retrial. The article details their disruptive behavior, frequent changes in legal representation, and a moment when Marten deliberately revealed her husband's past conviction to the jury. The correspondent highlights the couple's inability to grasp how their choices led to their daughter's tragic death.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Announces Major Shift in Ukraine Policy with New Arms Deal and Tariff Threat to Russia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:32:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the Trump administration has announced it will facilitate a "massive" sale of weapons to Ukraine, funded by European NATO allies, to help the country defend itself against Russia. President Trump also issued a 50-day ultimatum to Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire or face severe secondary tariffs on Russia's trade partners. This marks a dramatic shift from the administration's previous stance, which involved public criticism of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and attempts at direct negotiation with Putin. Analysts suggest the move stems from Trump's frustration with Putin's refusal to engage in peace talks, though the long-term impact on the war remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Rescue and recovery operations in Texas are being severely hampered by forecasts of more heavy rain, following devastating floods that have killed at least 131 people. Most of the deceased were children at a summer camp, and authorities have lowered the number of missing persons to 101. No survivors have been found since the initial flooding on July 4, when the Guadalupe River basin was inundated. The disaster has sparked criticism over the lack of flash-flood warning sirens in Kerr County and has prompted the governor to call a special legislative session to investigate the emergency response.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's dominant season, including seven PGA tour wins and a second Masters title, is credited to a dramatic improvement in his putting. In late 2023, while ranked as the best player from tee to green, he was among the worst putters on tour. He then began working with renowned putting coach Phil Kenyon, who helped him with green reading, his grip, and most critically, a switch from a blade to a mallet-style putter. This change sparked an incredible run of form, solidifying his position as the world's top player ahead of The Open Championship.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts and keeping it on track to meet its annual 5% target. However, underlying data reveals significant weaknesses, including slowing retail sales growth and a deepening slump in the real estate sector. Despite resilient industrial output, economists point to a sharp decline in a broad measure of prices, fueling deflationary fears and calls for more substantial government stimulus. While officials expect consumer prices to improve, analysts note that the growth was partly driven by price discounting, which erodes trade terms and points to underlying fragility in the economy.

Key measures include VAT exemptions, discounts on road and parking taxes, access to bus lanes, and significant investment in public charging infrastructure.

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial to determine its share of responsibility in the 2019 death of a woman who was struck by a Model S operating on its Autopilot feature. The victim, Naibel Benavides, was stargazing in Florida when the car, allegedly traveling nearly 70 mph, ran a stop sign and hit her. Lawyers for the victim's family argue that the driver-assistance system should have braked or warned the driver, who they claim was distracted. Tesla maintains the driver is solely to blame, setting the stage for a case that scrutinizes the safety and marketing of the company's automated driving technology.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Skeptical That U.S. Can Secure Public Defense Pledges from Japan and Australia on Taiwan</h2>

          <p>The United States is reportedly pressuring key allies Japan and Australia to make public commitments on how they would respond to a potential conflict over Taiwan, but analysts believe such pledges are unlikely. Chinese and U.S. experts suggest that while Washington is trying to build a united front, Tokyo and Canberra will likely resist being publicly boxed into a specific military response. Some analysts argue the U.S. push is more about hyping the "China threat" to encourage allies to increase their own defense spending and military cooperation with Washington. This reflects growing U.S. concerns about its ability to deter Beijing in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, terminating a 2019 agreement that had set a minimum price to avoid such duties. The Commerce Department stated the move was necessary to protect U.S. tomato growers, particularly in Florida, from being undercut by what they claim are unfairly low-priced imports. The decision has been praised by domestic growers but criticized by groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and some lawmakers, who warn it could lead to higher consumer prices for products like salsa, disrupt supply chains, and risk retaliatory tariffs from Mexico.</p>

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence that animals react to sounds produced by plants. Scientists discovered that female moths chose not to lay their eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic "scream" sounds, which the plants emit when they are dehydrated or otherwise distressed. The moths appeared to associate these sounds with an unhealthy host for their larvae. This groundbreaking finding suggests a previously unknown layer of communication in ecosystems, opening a new field of study into how animals and potentially other plants use these sounds to make decisions.</p>

          <p>A joint report from the WHO and UNICEF revealed that more than 14 million children worldwide received no vaccinations at all in 2024, leaving them vulnerable to preventable diseases. The report highlights a worrying trend, with childhood vaccination rates stagnating or declining in regions like Europe, where measles and whooping cough cases have surged dramatically. Officials attribute the widening coverage gaps to the spread of misinformation and significant cuts in international aid. Over half of the world's unvaccinated children are concentrated in just nine countries, underscoring a critical global health challenge.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly ordered the incineration of nearly 500 metric tons of high-energy biscuits intended for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The emergency food, worth about $800,000, is set to expire after requests from career staff at USAID to ship the aid were allegedly ignored by new political leadership. This action comes amid a broader halt of U.S. foreign assistance programs, and the food will now be destroyed at an additional cost of $130,000 to taxpayers. The incident highlights a significant policy shift and has drawn criticism as millions face starvation in global crises where the aid could have been used.</p>

The claimants state the changes could cost them hundreds of millions and impact their ability to invest and make charitable donations. Leaseholder advocates fear the legal battle will stall much-needed reforms for years, trapping homeowners in unsellable properties with escalating fees.</p>

Many of the corporation's biggest names, including the hosts and stars of shows like "Strictly Come Dancing," "The Traitors," and "The Apprentice," do not appear on the list. This is because the disclosure requirement only applies to talent paid directly from the license fee, not those employed by independent production companies or the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. This arrangement, designed to allow BBC Studios to compete commercially, means the public list excludes a significant portion of the BBC's highest-paid presenters and actors.</p>
