          <h2>German Politics Faces Tumult as Friedrich Merz Takes Chancellorship</h2>

          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's new chancellor amidst significant challenges, including a stagnant economy and strained relations with the United States. Despite lacking executive government experience, Merz aims to address these crises head-on, criticizing President Trump and seeking a stronger European role. However, his policy shifts, such as relaxing fiscal restraint and softening immigration plans, have alienated some conservative voters, leading to a decline in his party's poll numbers. The article suggests that while Merz is seen by some as an agile politician, others question his long-term planning and consistency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed a 100% tariff on all films produced outside the United States, claiming the American film industry is dying due to foreign incentives attracting filmmakers. He argues that this is a matter of national security and aims to encourage more film production within the U.S. However, the implementation and impact of such a tariff on international productions remain unclear, especially considering the common practice of co-productions involving both U.S. and foreign elements. The Motion Picture Association has not yet responded to requests for comment on the potential implications.</p>

The de minimis exemption, which allowed goods worth $800 or less to be imported without tariffs, has been closed for imports from mainland China and Hong Kong. This change could reduce the volume of shipments from China, affecting the revenue of logistics companies and airlines. However, a late change by the Trump administration provided a waiver, potentially mitigating some of the impact.</p>
