          <p>A Serbian official has admitted to forging a key document that allowed a protected site in Belgrade to be demolished for a Trump International Hotel, a project involving Jared Kushner. The forged document served as the legal basis for lifting protection from the former Yugoslav Ministry of Defense headquarters, which was heavily damaged during a 1999 NATO bombing campaign. The revelation has spurred outrage and protests in Serbia, with opposition leaders alleging that the Trump and Kushner families received special treatment. Kushner's company, Affinity Partners, stated they had no role in the review of the site's cultural status and will review the matter. This article highlights the ethical concerns surrounding foreign governments' involvement in the Trump family's business ventures.</p>

          <p>China Vanke, a property developer facing significant debt obligations, has secured a 1.55 billion yuan (US$215.4 million) loan from Shenzhen Metro Group, its largest shareholder. The loan, with a 36-month term and a low annual interest rate of 2.34%, aims to help Vanke meet its debt obligations, which total US$3.4 billion this year. This financial support follows a government-led shake-up in February, where authorities tightened control over Vanke by appointing new executives. Despite this aid, Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Vanke's bonds further into junk territory, reflecting ongoing concerns in the financial markets.</p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown academic, has been released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. US authorities had accused him of "spreading Hamas propaganda" and having "connections to a known or suspected terrorist," claims the judge refuted. The Justice Department argued for his continued detention until court proceedings finished, but the judge found no evidence supporting the government's claims. The ACLU, involved in Suri's defense, emphasized that "speaking out about what's happening in Palestine is not a crime," even as the Trump administration seeks to deport Suri in separate proceedings.</p>

          <p>Missouri's near-complete abortion ban could potentially be reinstated if a new ballot measure, passed by the GOP-controlled state legislature, gains voter approval. This measure aims to repeal an earlier constitutional amendment passed by voters last year that enshrined abortion protections in the state's constitution. The proposed amendment includes exceptions for sexual assault and incest and will appear on the state's ballots in the 2026 general election, though the governor could call a special election sooner. This article underscores the ongoing battle over abortion rights in Missouri and the Republican's determination to restrict access to the procedure despite voter support for abortion protections.</p>

The administration is welcoming white South Africans as refugees while suspending the program for others, claiming they face "race-based discrimination." This policy shift follows an executive order halting foreign aid to South Africa and the expulsion of the South African ambassador after he criticized Trump's approach to race.

          <h2>Missouri Republicans Seek to Reinstate Abortion Ban After Voters Approved Protections</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Missouri's Republican-controlled legislature has approved a ballot measure that would ask voters to ban abortion again, aiming to reverse a recent citizen-sponsored ballot measure that overturned a near-total abortion ban. The measure would amend the state Constitution to ban abortion except in medical emergencies, or in cases of sexual assault or incest if reported to police within 48 hours and the pregnancy is less than 12 weeks along. This action bucks the trend of voters siding with abortion rights in recent ballot measures, highlighting the ongoing conflict over abortion access in the state.</p>

While the FDA maintains that the dye is not harmful to humans at current consumption levels, In-N-Out's decision reflects a commitment to using healthier ingredients.

Smartmatic claims this destruction was intentional and created "an evidentiary void," preventing the revelation of further evidence regarding Fox executives' knowledge of false broadcasts. The accusation comes as Fox News secured a ruling granting them access to documents related to a Department of Justice investigation into Smartmatic executives.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the expansion of state-funded health care benefits to more low-income immigrants without legal status in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit. While those already enrolled in Medi-Cal will not be affected, new applications will be frozen, and adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" will have to pay a $100 monthly premium starting in 2027. Newsom attributed the decision to higher-than-expected costs and economic uncertainty stemming from federal tariff policies. The plan aims to save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.</p>
