          <p>The Trump administration defied a court order to return deportation flights carrying Venezuelan gang members to the U.S., claiming operational and national security reasons.  The administration argued that the order did not apply once the planes were over international waters, prompting a legal challenge.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio refuses to provide evidence justifying the arrest and deportation of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was involved in student protests at Columbia University.  Rubio cites a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, but critics argue that the arrest violates Khalil's constitutional rights.  The lack of transparency surrounding the case has fueled concerns about free speech and the weaponization of immigration.</p>
