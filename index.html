        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Secretary announced that over a thousand inmates serving one to four year sentences, who were recalled for breaching their licenses, will be released after 28 days to alleviate overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales. The move aims to free up around 1,400 prison places and provide ministers with time to address systemic issues, although it excludes those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk. While a Â£4.7bn investment will fund more prisons, officials warn that without this action, the government would run out of prison spaces by November. The interim permanent secretary of the Ministry of Justice noted that the number of recalled prisoners has significantly increased, contributing to the overcrowding crisis.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura, Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, testified in his sexual assault trial, recounting alleged violence and control throughout their 10-year relationship. Ventura described instances of physical abuse, including being knocked over, kicked, and stomped on, and said that Combs exerted control over her appearance, career, and social interactions. She testified that Combs allegedly introduced her to drug-fueled events called "freak offs," where she was forced to perform sex acts with hired sex workers, leading her to feel disgusted and humiliated. Ventura stated that her music career took a backseat to these events, and she worried about angering Combs due to his control over her life and the possibility of blackmail.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have expressed varied reactions to President Trump's acceptance of a $400 million luxury Boeing jet from the Qatari royal family, with some raising national security concerns and admitting they were not briefed on the details. Some Republicans, like Senator Rick Scott, voiced concerns about Qatar's relationships with Hamas and China, questioning the safety of the plane. Other Republicans, such as Senator Eric Schmitt, viewed the "free plane" as a positive deal for the government. The White House defended the donation as benefiting the U.S. Air Force, emphasizing that it was not a personal gift to Trump.</p>

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace secured a $96 billion agreement to sell Qatar Airways up to 210 aircraft during President Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The deal, for 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines, is Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order, expected to support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually. Trump highlighted the agreement as the largest order of jets in Boeing's history, potentially boosting the company's financial recovery. However, the deal may also increase scrutiny of Trump's acceptance of a luxury 747 jet from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One.</p>

Dugan's lawyers argue she is protected by judicial immunity, while critics accuse the Trump administration of attacking the judicial system.

          <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar is set to deliver a speech criticizing President Trump for what she describes as "unprecedented overreach" and disregard for the rule of law. Klobuchar plans to argue that Trump is attempting to make the executive office immune from outside accountability. She also intends to highlight the impact of tariffs on small businesses, farmers, and consumers. The speech comes as Democrats seek effective messaging to challenge Trump's second term and address divisions within the party.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber is taking a 25% pay cut following the Trump administration's decision to cut $450 million in grants to the university. This action follows a lawsuit filed by Harvard in response to the administration's freezing of $2.2 billion in federal funding and threats to revoke the university's tax-exempt status. The administration has cited concerns over race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment on campus as reasons for the funding cuts. The university has rejected the administration's conditions for resuming funding, which include changes to leadership and halting diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.</p>

          <p>Esa-Pekka Salonen's recent appearances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, including a tribute to Pierre Boulez, have fueled speculation about a potential return to the orchestra. Salonen, who recently announced he would not renew his contract as music director of the San Francisco Symphony, has a history-making relationship with the L.A. Phil. The orchestra is currently without a music director, and many musicians and audience members would welcome Salonen back to guide the orchestra through a transition period. However, it remains to be seen whether Salonen would accept such an offer, as he has expressed a desire for a reprieve from institutional demands.</p>

The state's Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, has expanded to cover an estimated 1.6 million immigrants without legal status, costing $9.5 billion per year. The governor's budget revision proposes an enrollment freeze and monthly premiums for this population, while the Trump administration threatens to cut Medicaid funding for states providing such coverage.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Australia have found that Barbie's foot posture has changed over time, correlating with her designated career or hobby. The study examined 2,750 dolls produced from 1959 to 2024 and found that early Barbies had arched feet, while more recent "employed" dolls are more likely to have flat feet. The researchers suggest that Barbie's empowerment is tied to the structure of her feet, reflecting societal shifts in women's roles. Mattel confirmed that foot design was a deliberate part of Barbie's evolution to support her "bold steps forward."</p>

          <p>U.S. drug overdose deaths fell by an estimated 27% in 2024, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded, with 30,000 fewer deaths than the previous year.

While annual overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, the decline offers optimism, though concerns remain about potential reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce. The number of at-risk Americans is shrinking, after waves of deaths in older adults and a shift in teens and younger adults away from the drugs that cause most deaths.</p>
