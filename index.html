          <p>The third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was delayed due to adverse weather conditions, specifically the threat of lightning, which led to a temporary suspension of practice. The start was pushed back to 16:43 BST, and tee times were revised, with players now competing in threesomes off split tees. Max Greyserman was scheduled to hit the first shot, with Rory McIlroy and defending champion Xander Schauffele in the second group. The adjustments aimed to accommodate the revised schedule following the weather disruption.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a civilian minibus in north-eastern Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of nine people and injuries to seven others.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a deliberate killing of civilians, stating that Russian forces were aware of the type of vehicle they were targeting. The strike took place shortly after Russia and Ukraine held their first face-to-face talks in over three years, where they agreed to a prisoner swap.</p>

          <p>The release of a 2023 audio recording of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur has reignited discussions about his mental and physical fitness for office. The recording captures Biden's halting speech and memory lapses, providing context for Hur's description of him as an "elderly man with a poor memory." The audio clip comes as a forthcoming book reveals new details about Biden's cognitive decline and the efforts of his advisers to suppress discussion of his limitations.

Given Irenic's track record, a sale to a strategic or financial acquirer is more likely, allowing Couchbase to pursue organic growth away from public market pressures.

While the tech industry is investing in renewable energy, it may need to rely on fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, in the short term.

          <p>Three alleged Iranian spies have been charged in the UK with targeting journalists so that "serious violence" could be inflicted on them. The men, who had been granted temporary leave to remain in the UK after claiming asylum, are accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service. The charges come after a complex investigation by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. The men are alleged to have carried out surveillance to locate journalists associated with Iran International, which is critical of the Iranian regime.</p>

          <p>Combat sport clubs are being used to boost recruitment for the white nationalist hate group Patriot Front, according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. These Active Clubs, smaller networks of white supremacist groups, train in mixed martial arts and bond over white nationalist ideologies. Patriot Front uses these groups to expand their reach while maintaining a low profile, evading researchers and law enforcement. The new recruitment method coincides with Patriot Front's faltering brand after years of controversies and lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings has downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing government debt and rising interest costs. This decision reflects concerns about the failure of successive administrations to address large annual fiscal deficits. The downgrade is expected to slightly increase the yield investors demand for U.S. Treasury debt and could negatively impact sentiment towards U.S. assets. This aligns Moody's with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, which previously downgraded the U.S. credit rating.</p>

          <p>Most female business leaders in Japan are skeptical that the country will achieve its goal of having women occupy 30% of top corporate roles by 2030, citing slow shifts in views among male-dominated executives. A survey of 41 senior women revealed that a change in top management's perspective and company culture is needed to increase female representation. The government has asked firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's top-tier Prime Market to increase the ratio of female executives, but many respondents believe this target will not be met due to traditional gender roles and work-life balance issues.</p>

          <p>The United States is finally turning the corner on the drug overdose crisis, with provisional figures showing a significant decline in deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. The drop of 27,000 deaths is the steepest single-year decline in 45 years, bringing overdose deaths back to pre-pandemic levels. Factors contributing to this decline include the increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, and opioid-settlement funds. However, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution could hinder further progress.</p>
