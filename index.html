          <p>Former President Donald Trump has asserted that a potential peace deal to end the war in Ukraine would involve Ukraine foregoing NATO membership and accepting Russia's annexation of Crimea. These statements were made just hours before a scheduled White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and numerous European leaders. The high-stakes talks follow a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where a U.S. envoy reported that Putin had agreed to a possible NATO-like security pact for Ukraine, creating a complex diplomatic landscape for the assembled leaders to navigate.</p>

          <p>China has published its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy and using the issue as a "bargaining chip" in political power games. The document criticizes the American political system for being controlled by money, leading to political violence and voter disenfranchisement. It also highlights what it describes as widespread racism, social inequality, and the politicization of immigration, where migrants are used as scapegoats by political parties. The report suggests that the U.S. turns human rights into props for political theater rather than genuinely upholding them.</p>

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets saw gains on Monday as investors anticipated details from the upcoming talks between the U.S. and Ukraine, following a U.S.-Russia summit that did not result in a ceasefire. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced, while South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline. In economic news, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports contracted more than expected in July. The market movements reflect cautious optimism, influenced by a strong previous week on Wall Street driven by hopes for U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An undocumented immigrant truck driver faces three counts of vehicular homicide after allegedly causing a fatal crash in Florida by attempting an illegal U-turn. The maneuver resulted in the semi-truck's trailer colliding with a minivan, killing all three occupants inside. Authorities stated the suspect, Harjinder Singh, entered the U.S. illegally in 2018 and obtained a commercial driver's license in California. In addition to the state charges, he is in custody for immigration violations, and the incident has drawn sharp criticism regarding state policies that grant driver's licenses regardless of immigration status.</p>

          <p>A Sacramento woman and her infant daughter, who had been missing for several weeks, were tragically found deceased inside their submerged vehicle under a bridge. The discovery was made by Adventures With Purpose, a volunteer dive team that specializes in searching for missing persons. Whisper Owen, 36, and her 8-month-old daughter, Sandra McCarty, were last seen on their way home from a doctor's appointment. While authorities had not initially suspected foul play, the California Highway Patrol is now investigating the circumstances that led to the vehicle ending up underwater.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense principle. This development, described as a "game-changing" concession, emerged from the recent summit between President Trump and Putin in Alaska. Such an arrangement could serve as an alternative to Ukraine's formal NATO membership, a long-standing point of contention for Moscow. European leaders have welcomed the potential for these guarantees, though Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has noted that the details of how they would function remain unclear.</p>

The storm is causing heavy rain and strong winds in the Caribbean, with tropical storm warnings issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas. Although not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, it is generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast.</p>

The case was brought by the Transport Workers' Union, which will receive A$50 million of the fine on behalf of the fired employees.

          <p>Dame Helen Mirren has expressed her belief that the iconic character of James Bond should continue to be portrayed by a male actor. In a recent interview, the Oscar-winning actress, who identifies as a feminist, argued that casting a woman would fundamentally change the character into something else. Her sentiment was echoed by former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who is starring alongside her in an upcoming film. The producers of the spy franchise have indicated they plan a "fresh" take on the character while honoring his legacy, but Mirren's comments add to the ongoing debate about the future of the 007 role.</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the United Kingdom is in the midst of a leadership election that highlights a fundamental debate over its political strategy. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bolder, "eco-populist" approach that directly confronts wealth and power to connect with voter anger. His opponents, current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, argue for continuing the party's current strategy of building broad appeal, which led to record success in the last general election. The contest will determine whether the party embraces a more radical, anti-elite message or sticks with its proven formula for gradual growth.</p>

          <p>The upcoming meeting in Washington between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his European allies, and President Donald Trump is fraught with tension, as the unity of the Western alliance faces a significant threat. Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, Trump appears to have shifted his position on key issues, abandoning calls for an immediate ceasefire and seeming open to Ukraine ceding territory. Zelenskyy and the European leaders face the difficult task of steering Trump back towards a unified stance against Russian aggression without alienating the U.S. president. The outcome of these talks could have profound implications for the future of the conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The birth rate in the United States has fallen to a historic low, with the total fertility rate now at 1.6 children per woman, well below the 2.1 needed for natural population replacement. This decline is largely driven by women under 30 having fewer babies, a trend attributed to factors like increased contraception use, delayed marriage, and shifting societal values regarding family and personal fulfillment. Experts warn this demographic shift could lead to future economic challenges, including a smaller workforce to support an aging population, prompting discussions about policies to encourage family growth and manage the long-term impacts.</p>

          <p>A massive concert by the ultra-nationalist Croatian singer Thompson has exposed deep political and historical divisions within the country. The event, attended by hundreds of thousands, featured the controversial chant "Za dom, spremni" ("For homeland, ready!"), which originated with the World War Two-era fascist Ustasha movement. While supporters, including some government officials, defend the chant as a patriotic symbol from the 1990s war of independence, critics and human rights groups condemn it as neo-fascist. The concert has intensified the debate over Croatia's interpretation of its past and the rise of nationalist sentiment.</p>

          <p>Nearly a quarter-century after the September 11th attacks, the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its painstaking work to identify the victims from remains found at Ground Zero. Using advanced DNA technology, scientists are still making new identifications, bringing long-awaited, albeit painful, news to families who have waited decades. The effort involves testing and retesting over 21,000 fragments, many of which were damaged by extreme conditions, in a promise to provide answers for the roughly 1,100 victims who remain unidentified.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population shrinking for 15 consecutive years due to record-low birth and marriage rates. The country now sees more than two deaths for every baby born, leading to a net loss of nearly a million people last year and projections that the population could halve by 2100. This decline poses significant threats to Japan's economy, national defense, and social structure, creating labor shortages and straining social support systems. The government has implemented initiatives like a city-run dating app and shortened workweeks to encourage family formation, but these efforts have yet to reverse the trend.</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has stated that its members deployed to patrol Washington as part of the Trump administration's increased policing initiative may be armed. This clarification comes after the Army initially said the troops would not carry weapons or make arrests. The move is part of a federal surge in law enforcement that President Trump initiated, citing rising crime, though city data shows a decrease in violent crime. The decision has sparked alarm from local officials and residents, who view it as a federal overreach, while some Republican governors have offered to send their own Guard members to assist.</p>

The judge's order also freezes the group's funds held by financial institutions, including the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue.
