          <p>Rodney Hinton Jr. has been charged with aggravated murder after allegedly hitting and killing a sheriff's deputy with his car a day after his son, Ryan Hinton, was fatally shot by police during a stolen vehicle investigation. Prosecutors allege that Mr. Hinton deliberately accelerated his car, causing the deputy's death outside of the University of Cincinnati graduation. The incident occurred hours after Mr. Hinton and his family watched police footage of the encounter with his son, which left him distraught. Lawyers for the Hinton family issued condolences to the deputy's family, calling it a horrific tragedy on both sides.</p>

          <p>A man accused of participating in sectarian violence against Syria's Alawite minority claims that Syrian security forces oversaw armed civilians who killed Alawites. Abu Khalid stated that the General Security department instructed them to only target insurgents and not harm civilians. However, he filmed himself killing a 64-year-old resident, Mahmoud Yusef Mohammed, an act that contradicts his claim that Mahmoud was an armed insurgent. Human rights groups estimate that almost 900 civilians, mainly Alawites, were killed in early March. The violence occurred after fighters loyal to the country's overthrown former President Bashar al-Assad led deadly raids on government security forces.</p>

          <p>Brazilian police have arrested two suspects, reported to be fans of Lady Gaga, who were allegedly planning an attack on her free concert at Copacabana Beach using improvised explosives. The suspects are part of an online group that promotes hate speech and encourages violence, with one also found in possession of child pornography. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat ahead of the singer's performance, which drew over two million fans. The concert proceeded without incident, and Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the operation until after the fact.</p>

          <p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, which allows taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. Most students attending an accredited private school will receive $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities will receive up to $30,000 annually. Home-schooled students will get $2,000 a year. Democrats argue the legislation hurts public schools, siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private schools.</p>

A vote to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by local voters, most of whom are SpaceX employees. The creation of Starbase has drawn criticism from those who worry it will expand Musk's control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. SpaceX officials have said the city authority would streamline launch operations, but critics argue the beach closure authority should remain with the county government.</p>

          <p>The 80th anniversary of the liberation of Dachau concentration camp was commemorated with a ceremony attended by survivors, liberators, and their families, highlighting the dwindling number of firsthand witnesses to the Holocaust.

Participants expressed concern over increasing antisemitic hate crimes and the threat to liberal democracy, underscoring the importance of remembrance and accountability. The New York Times article notes that the camp, established in 1933, initially held political opponents and served as a training site for S.S. troops.</p>

          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff exemption is set to increase prices on cheaper goods from China for U.S. consumers, as ultra-low-cost retailers like Shein and Temu will no longer be able to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free. Temu has announced a shift to its business model, with all sales in the U.S. now handled by locally based sellers. Experts predict that the end of the exemption will lead to shipment delays and a diminished market for Chinese goods.

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, initially approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and cost overruns, raising questions about the state's ability to complete large-scale infrastructure projects. The New York Times article explores the challenges of acquiring private property through eminent domain, the impact on local farmers, and the shifting ambitions of the project. What was once envisioned as a high-speed connection between Los Angeles and San Francisco has been reduced to a 171-mile stretch between Bakersfield and Merced, with completion uncertain.</p>
