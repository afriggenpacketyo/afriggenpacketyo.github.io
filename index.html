          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the U.S. from nationals of 12 countries, citing national security risks, while also imposing partial travel restrictions on seven additional countries. The White House claims these restrictions are necessary to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors, pointing to a recent attack in Colorado as evidence. The order includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents, their immediate family members, U.S. government employees, athletes participating in major sporting events, and dual nationals not traveling on a passport from an affected country, with the Secretary of State able to grant exemptions on a case-by-case basis. The ban is expected to face legal challenges, with reactions ranging from promises of cooperation from affected countries to condemnation from human rights groups and Democratic politicians.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that a Catholic charity in Wisconsin does not have to pay unemployment taxes, citing religious freedom guarantees under the First Amendment. The Catholic Charities Bureau argued that the state's requirement to pay the tax violated their religious freedom because other faith groups were exempt. Wisconsin contended that the organization's daily work did not involve religious teachings, making it ineligible for the exemption. This ruling is one of several religious-rights cases the Supreme Court is considering this term, reflecting ongoing debates about the intersection of religious freedom and government regulations.</p>

Younger investors are more interested in crypto, private equity, and overseas investments, and they expect advanced digital offerings from their wealth managers.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce is playing a crucial role in the global auto industry by controlling the export of rare earth magnets, a vital component in electric vehicle motors. As part of the trade war with the United States, China added rare earth magnets to an export control list, requiring exporters to apply for licenses. Delays in issuing these licenses have raised concerns in Washington, with officials claiming China is reneging on commitments made during trade talks. The situation highlights China's dominance in rare earth magnet production and its potential leverage in international trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>
