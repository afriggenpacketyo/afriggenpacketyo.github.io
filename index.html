          <p>Former Department of Health and Human Services workers are warning that mass terminations and budget cuts are creating a "real danger" of missing disease outbreaks. The Trump administration's cuts to the HHS workforce and grants are impacting state public health agencies, leading to staff layoffs and reduced disease surveillance capabilities. The article highlights concerns about the dismantling of the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) program and the impact on child support services. Workers claim the cuts have increased workloads and made it difficult for state and tribal agencies to comply with federal requirements, potentially harming vulnerable children and families. The article also details accusations of illegal firings and improper procedures within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>

          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has released its annual allergy report, naming Wichita, Kansas, as the top allergy capital for the third year in a row. The report considers tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, over-the-counter allergy medicine use, and the availability of allergists. The article provides tips from Dr. Purvi Parikh on managing allergy symptoms, including starting medications early, washing clothes after spending time outdoors, and paying attention to pollen count timing. Parikh also advises seeking medical care if breathing issues arise, as they could indicate asthma. The article notes that allergy symptoms can be similar to those of colds and viruses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall electric vehicle exports from China to the UK have decreased, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports have experienced a significant surge. The UK has become China's second-largest export destination for EVs and fifth-largest for hybrid electric vehicles. The article attributes this trend to the UK's standard 10% import tariff, which is the same as other non-EU rivals, making Chinese EVs more attractive due to affordability. In March alone, China's hybrid EV exports to the UK increased dramatically, indicating a growing preference for plug-in hybrids among British consumers.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net profit due to lower crude prices and production. The company's net income for the quarter was $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations, but free cash flow and cash flow from operating activities also decreased. CEO Amin Nasser cited global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty as factors affecting energy markets. The company reduced its performance-linked dividend payout, signaling continuing strain on its balance sheet as crude prices remain low and global demand slows. The article also notes that OPEC+ raised its production target for June, anticipating large supply gluts and weak demand which has prompted banks and energy agencies to downgrade their oil price outlooks for the year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested imminent progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, expressing his intent to continue working with both sides to end the conflict. His statement follows Putin's announcement of a unilateral three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine stated was repeatedly violated.

Putin offered direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, to which Zelenskyy responded as a "positive sign," indicating the importance of a ceasefire as the first step towards ending the war.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, encourages mothers to stop striving for perfection and cut themselves some slack. She argues that being flawed is an important part of a mother's job, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. Dr. Ross also notes that the field of psychiatry has historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, overlooking the credit they deserve. She includes a quiz to help mothers recognize that they are good enough, even if they are not perfect.</p>

Putin stated Russia's commitment to serious negotiations and didn't rule out agreeing to a ceasefire later in the talks. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has previously expressed readiness for peace talks after a ceasefire is in place.

Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as global demand for US Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policy, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster start to the spring home-buying season.</p>

          <p>The new German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing scrutiny due to the appointment of several individuals with strong ties to the business world to top cabinet positions. Critics argue that these appointments could lead to conflicts of interest and undue influence from lobbyists. The article explores Germany's lobbying regulations, including the Lobby Register, and the potential for a "revolving door" between business and politics.

          <p>Faced with the threat of new sanctions, President Vladimir V. Putin called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in the coming days, proposing a meeting in Istanbul on May 15, without specifying who would participate in the talks. This came after European leaders threatened “new and massive” sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors if Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire. Putin did not directly address the European call for a 30-day cease-fire, but indicated Russia wouldn’t stop fighting before the negotiations on May 15, if they happen. In Kyiv, European leaders expressed solidarity with Ukraine, emphasizing the need for a truce and coordinating closely with the White House.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to USAID funding are having catastrophic consequences for healthcare in Africa, particularly in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Reduced funding has led to the closure of treatment centers, disrupted medication supplies, and canceled essential programs. Experts warn that these cuts could result in hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths and a resurgence of diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. While some African countries are attempting to fill the funding gap, the overall impact is expected to be devastating, reversing years of progress in disease prevention and treatment.</p>

The strike, prompted by a dispute over role changes and pay, has garnered international attention due to images of overflowing bins.
