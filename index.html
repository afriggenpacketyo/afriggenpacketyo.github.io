          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has begun its new term with several cases that could significantly define the scope of presidential power, particularly concerning actions taken by Donald Trump. Key issues include the president's authority to deploy National Guard units domestically against state objections, control independent federal agencies, and unilaterally impose tariffs. The court's decisions in these high-profile cases are expected to have lasting implications for the balance of power within the federal government.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve begins cutting interest rates, the earnings difference between a $10,000 certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account has become minimal. While high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly better returns for some short terms, their variable rates are expected to fall with future Fed cuts. In contrast, CDs provide a guaranteed fixed return, making them a potentially more stable option for savers looking to lock in current high rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a document reviewed by Fox News Digital, former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigative team tracked the private phone communications of nearly a dozen Republican senators. The surveillance was part of the "Arctic Frost" investigation into the events of January 6, 2021, and involved analyzing toll records to see call details without listening to the content. FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino are reportedly briefing the affected lawmakers on the findings, which they described as a past weaponization of the agency.</p>

          <p>Two psychiatric organizations have publicly called for the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from his position as Secretary of Health and Human Services. The groups argue that his actions and statements, particularly his criticism of psychiatric medications and efforts to shutter the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), have increased stigma and harmed access to mental health care. They express alarm over the administration's direction, stating it misrepresents scientific data and undermines progress made in treating mental illness and addiction.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court has found Ali Muhammad Ali Abd–Al-Rahman, a leader of Sudan's Janjaweed militia, guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. The conviction is the court's first for the atrocities committed in the region over 20 years ago, where judges found he was personally involved in mass killings, sexual assault, and torture. The verdict is a landmark moment for international justice, though arrest warrants for other Sudanese officials, including former president Omar al-Bashir, remain outstanding.</p>
