          <p>Zhou Xianwang, the former mayor of Wuhan, is now the subject of a high-level corruption investigation in China, according to the country's top anti-graft body. Zhou is most recognized internationally for his role during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, where he publicly defended the city's heavily criticized slow response to the outbreak. In a notable television interview in January 2020, he made a rare admission for a Chinese official, stating that as a local leader, his authority was limited and he could only disclose information about the new virus after being authorized by higher-level government. This investigation for suspected 'serious violations of discipline and law' brings renewed scrutiny to the actions of key officials at the pandemic's epicenter.</p>

          <p>Fast-fashion giant Shein has reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, a move seen as an attempt to pressure U.K. regulators to approve its stalled London listing. The Singapore-based retailer has faced significant regulatory hurdles in London, primarily due to disagreements between U.K. and Chinese authorities over risk disclosures in its prospectus. These disclosures relate to Shein's supply chain in China's Xinjiang region, which is under scrutiny for alleged human rights abuses. The company's listing ambitions have also been complicated by an EU investigation that found breaches of consumer protection laws, making the path to going public a challenging international endeavor.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that China, Japan, and South Korea are positioned to be titans of technological innovation, building on the export-led growth model that defined their economic histories. The piece contrasts Japan and South Korea's development of home-grown technologies with China's historical role as an original equipment manufacturer, noting China's evolution beyond low-cost production. It highlights China's significant investment in automation and industrial robotics, where it now ranks third globally. As geopolitical and cost factors shift global manufacturing, the article suggests that the region's focus on high-tech sectors like electric vehicles, where Chinese companies like BYD challenge Tesla, signals a new era of dominance.

          <p>A recent poll of 5,000 U.S. adults has identified Virginia as the state with the highest per-capita consumption of french fries. According to the study commissioned by McCain Foods, the average Virginian eats approximately 21 pounds of fries annually. The states of Alabama, Georgia, and Maryland followed closely, with residents consuming about 20 pounds per year. On a national scale, the average American eats at least 17 pounds of fries each year, contributing to a nationwide total of over 5.6 billion pounds. The survey, conducted by Talker Research, was released ahead of National French Fry Day, highlighting regional preferences for one of America's most popular side dishes.</p>

          <p>Lord Norman Tebbit, a formidable and often controversial figure in British politics and a key ally of Margaret Thatcher, has passed away at the age of 94. As a cabinet minister, he was central to the Thatcherite revolution of the 1980s, championing self-reliance and implementing tough trade union reforms. He is widely remembered for his 1981 speech in which he recalled his unemployed father getting 'on his bike' to find work, a phrase that became political shorthand. His life was profoundly impacted by the 1984 IRA Brighton hotel bombing, which left him injured and his wife, Margaret, permanently paralyzed. Known for his plain-spoken and uncompromising views, Tebbit remained an influential voice on the right wing of the Conservative Party long after leaving government.</p>

The pause had included vital systems like Patriot air defense missiles, prompting appeals from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Following recent U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin about a heightened risk of terrorism. Former FBI special agent Jonathan Gilliam suggested that these cells could exploit vulnerabilities in less-protected rural regions, drawing parallels to attacks seen in other countries. The expert linked the potential threat to border policies, while federal sources confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increased arrests of Iranian nationals in recent weeks amid the elevated tensions between the two countries.</p>

Scientists highlight that while the underlying theories are not new, Chinese researchers have demonstrated a hundred-fold increase in computability by using more light channels for data transfer. This hardware innovation represents a substantial leap forward, as experts believe electronic chips are approaching their physical limits, making optical computing a key area for future AI hardware development.</p>

Dame Rachel reiterated her call for the government to scrap the two-child benefit cap, a policy she argues would immediately lift half a million children out of poverty.

          <p>A Formula 1 Q&A addresses several key topics from the British Grand Prix, including the controversial penalty given to McLaren's Oscar Piastri. The article contrasts Piastri's 10-second penalty for braking behind the safety car with a similar incident involving George Russell in Canada that went unpunished, highlighting driver and team frustrations over inconsistent stewarding. It also delves into the reasons for McLaren's remarkable resurgence, attributing it to a series of strategic leadership changes and technical restructuring initiated by CEO Zak Brown and team principal Andrea Stella. The piece further discusses the factors that determine when racing conditions are too wet and unsafe, primarily focusing on driver visibility in heavy spray.</p>

          <p>Officials in Yolo County, California, have confirmed that the remains of all seven missing workers have been recovered following a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto. The coroner's office is now working to formally identify the victims through autopsies and DNA testing. The fatal blast occurred at a facility owned by Devastating Pyrotechnics, which a county official stated was not permitted to store fireworks at that location. The property owner is reportedly a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. Federal and state agencies, including the ATF, are investigating the incident's cause and determining whether the operator had the necessary licenses and permits for their operations.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss pressing Middle East security issues, including the war in Gaza and policy towards Iran. While both leaders celebrated the recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, with Netanyahu nominating Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize, significant policy differences remain. Indirect ceasefire talks with Hamas are ongoing, but Netanyahu reiterated his opposition to a sovereign Palestinian state, a key requirement for normalization with Saudi Arabia. Trump expressed a desire for diplomacy with Iran and cast doubt on future military action, while Netanyahu stressed the need for constant vigilance against a resurgent threat.</p>

          <p>The U.K. is preparing for its third heatwave of the summer, which is forecast to be the most sustained and widespread yet. High pressure is expected to build, bringing hot air from continental Europe and leading to extended periods of sunshine across the country. Temperatures are predicted to peak around 33°C (91°F) in England over the weekend, but the heat will also affect Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, where some areas could see highs of 29°C. Unlike previous heatwaves that were concentrated in the south and east, this event will be more extensive, with many places potentially exceeding their official heatwave temperature criteria for seven consecutive days, accompanied by high UV and pollen levels.</p>

          <p>An investigation into public records reveals that officials in Kerr County, Texas, had discussed the need for an improved flood warning system for years prior to the recent deadly floods. As early as 2016, county commissioners acknowledged being 'very flood prone' and explored funding for better infrastructure. A 2016 engineering study, commissioned by local authorities, highlighted the region's high risk of flash floods and recommended a nearly $1 million project to enhance monitoring and public warnings, but the project did not move forward. More recently, in April of this year, a local river authority voted to develop a new flood warning system, but the status of that project remains unclear, raising questions about preparedness.</p>

          <p>Brazilian club Fluminense has defied expectations to reach the Club World Cup final, where they will face Chelsea in a special matchup for defender Thiago Silva. The 40-year-old veteran, who won the Champions League with Chelsea, has been a crucial leader for Fluminense, anchoring a surprisingly solid defense alongside 44-year-old goalkeeper Fábio. Under the charismatic management of Renato Gaúcho, the team has embraced its underdog status, overcoming wealthier opponents through tactical discipline and strong team spirit. Silva's on-field leadership and emotional pre-game speeches have been instrumental, fueling a campaign that has captivated Brazilian football fans and set the stage for a dramatic final against his former club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beijing's recent implementation of export controls on rare earth minerals has triggered a wave of international efforts aimed at diversifying supply chains and lessening global dependence on China. In response to China's control over these critical materials, companies and countries are accelerating exploration and development projects elsewhere. For example, an Australian-listed firm has begun work at a rare earth project in Brazil, while U.S. companies have partnered with Kazakhstan's national geological survey to explore new deposits. Despite this global pushback, analysts note that Beijing still holds a 'strong hand' due to its long-standing and deeply entrenched dominance in both the mining and processing of these essential elements.

          <p>Yorkshire Water has declared the U.K.'s first hosepipe ban of the year, affecting over five million customers starting this Friday. The decision follows a record-breaking dry and warm spring, with the region receiving less than half its average rainfall between February and June. Reservoir levels have fallen to just over 50% capacity, a record low for this time of year, prompting the restrictions to ensure essential water supplies and protect the local environment. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens and washing cars with a hosepipe, with potential fines for non-compliance. Officials state the restrictions may need to last into the winter months until significant rainfall replenishes water stocks.</p>

Developed by Novartis in partnership with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, the new drug, Coartem Baby, is designed for infants weighing less than 4.5kg. Previously, these vulnerable patients were treated with modified doses of drugs for older children, which carried a risk of overdose and was less effective. With malaria killing hundreds of thousands of children under five annually, this approval fills a critical treatment gap and is expected to be rolled out on a not-for-profit basis in African countries within weeks.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed United Nations investigators that the U.S. maintains legal responsibility and control over the Venezuelan migrants who were deported from the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison. This admission, revealed in court filings, contradicts public statements from both governments, which had claimed the men were beyond the reach of U.S. courts. The revelation is part of a legal challenge by lawyers for over 100 migrants sent to the notorious CECOT prison under a controversial deal between the two nations. This challenges the Trump administration's argument that it is powerless to act on the migrants' behalf, suggesting the U.S. has not been fully transparent with the courts.</p>
