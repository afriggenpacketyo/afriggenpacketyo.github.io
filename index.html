          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) retirement plans. This move would allow investments such as private equity, cryptocurrencies, and real estate within these common retirement accounts, a significant change from traditional options. The order is seen as a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for greater access to the trillions of dollars held in American retirement funds. Proponents argue it offers diversification, while critics raise concerns about the higher risks and fees associated with these assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Connected fitness company Peloton reported an unexpected net income of $21.6 million for its fiscal fourth quarter, a significant turnaround from a loss in the previous year. This profitability was driven by better-than-expected sales and aggressive cost-cutting measures under new CEO Peter Stern. Despite the positive results, the company announced it will lay off 6% of its staff as part of a new plan to reduce annual expenses by an additional $100 million. The strategy aims to ensure long-term stability as Peloton navigates a post-pandemic market and new tariffs.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet is set to meet to discuss a controversial plan for a complete military takeover of the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly views this as the only way to dismantle Hamas and rescue hostages, despite opposition from military leaders who warn of catastrophic outcomes. The United Nations has condemned the potential move, which would involve relocating over a million residents, as a violation of international law. This high-stakes decision comes after the breakdown of ceasefire negotiations and amid a severe humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite broad opposition from economists, President Trump's tariff policies have found support from some labor unions, including the United Auto Workers (UAW). For decades, manufacturing unions have argued against free-trade agreements like NAFTA, blaming them for job losses and advocating for protectionist measures to save American industries. This historical stance places them in an awkward position, as they now align with a policy that many analyses suggest will ultimately harm the working class through higher consumer prices and potential economic recession. The article explores this complex dynamic, where unions see tariffs as a necessary tool to rebuild the domestic manufacturing base, even if the current implementation is viewed as chaotic.</p>

Sesko, who has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig, is expected to complete a medical before the move is finalized. This signing is part of a significant offensive overhaul for the club, which has already spent heavily on other forwards this summer and is reportedly looking to sell striker Rasmus Hojlund.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International (RBI) reported mixed second-quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share of 94 cents falling short of Wall Street's expectations. However, the company's revenue of $2.41 billion surpassed forecasts, largely driven by strong performance at Tim Hortons and in international markets. Burger King saw modest same-store sales growth as its U.S. turnaround continues, but the Popeyes brand was a notable laggard, with same-store sales declining by 1.4%. RBI executives noted a slight improvement in the consumer environment and plan to boost Popeyes' performance with new product innovations in the coming months.</p>

          <p>This article posits that President Trump's tariffs, despite being economically questionable and politically unpopular, could remain in place long after his presidency. The core reason is the significant revenue they generate, estimated at $2.2 trillion over the next decade, effectively creating a major tax increase without congressional approval. As the U.S. faces rising deficits due to an aging population and growing spending on social programs, future administrations may be reluctant to repeal this revenue stream. This dynamic could transform American fiscal policy, making tariffs a politically convenient, though inefficient, way for governments to raise funds while avoiding the challenge of passing traditional tax legislation.</p>

          <p>While President Trump's recent broad and haphazard tariff proposals have drawn criticism, this article explores the argument that tariffs are not inherently bad policy. Economists suggest that when used strategically, tariffs can be an effective tool for promoting industrial development and protecting domestic industries from unfair competition, such as from state-subsidized foreign producers or countries with poor labor standards. An effective tariff policy would be targeted at specific industries for strategic reasons, like national security or climate goals, and complemented by other policies like subsidies and investments. The article contrasts this targeted approach with the current administration's broad-based strategy, which is viewed as disruptive and lacking clear, coherent objectives.</p>

          <p>New archaeological evidence from Pompeii indicates that the ancient city was reoccupied by survivors following the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Researchers believe that some former residents, unable to relocate, returned to live in what they describe as a "precarious and grey agglomeration" among the ruins. These informal settlements lacked typical Roman infrastructure, with inhabitants converting the ground floors of old houses into cellars and workshops. This discovery challenges the long-held narrative that Pompeii was completely abandoned after the eruption, revealing a period of makeshift survival before the area was ultimately deserted centuries later.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has reduced its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, a move that will have varied effects on household finances. Homeowners with variable-rate mortgages will likely see their monthly payments decrease, offering some financial relief. Conversely, savers will face lower returns, as interest rates on savings accounts are expected to continue their downward trend. The central bank's decision comes despite inflation remaining above its 2% target, reflecting a delicate balancing act to stimulate a struggling economy and a weakening job market without further fueling price increases.

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's tariff policies are not based on strategic economic development but are fueled by a powerful sense of nostalgia for the manufacturing-heavy U.S. economy of the mid-20th century. This era is associated by right-wing nationalists with high wage growth, stable families, and low inequality, conditions they believe can be restored by reshoring all types of manufacturing. However, the analysis contends this is a fantasy, as the shift to a service-based economy is a global trend in all advanced nations, driven by consumer demand and automation. The policy, therefore, aims to resurrect an anachronistic economic model at a potentially immense cost, rather than fostering competitiveness in modern, high-value industries.</p>

Analysts believe that a serious disruption to Russia's oil exports would cause a significant spike in global prices, a risk the administration may be unwilling to take. The market's skepticism is also fueled by the administration's past record of not always backing up strong rhetoric on energy sanctions with action. (not investment advice)</p>

However, Swiss officials and economists argue this is misleading, as refiners earn only a small processing fee on the gold, which is not truly a Swiss-manufactured product.

Critics argue the policy will be harmful, forcing people with unstable housing, mental health issues, or substance use disorders into detention rather than providing solutions like affordable housing. The order also moves to end support for "housing-first" policies and threatens to restrict federal funding for cities that do not comply.</p>

          <p>Bilateral trade between China and Russia climbed to $19.14 billion in July, an 8.7% increase from the previous month, according to Chinese customs data. This surge comes as the U.S. threatens tariffs on nations importing Russian oil, a key component of Russia-China trade. While total trade was up month-over-month, it represented a 2.8% decrease compared to the same period last year, with Chinese exports to Russia declining by nearly 9%. Russia remains a primary crude oil supplier to China, though deliveries in July were reportedly lower than in June, highlighting the complex economic dynamics at play.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a "new and highly accurate CENSUS" that explicitly excludes undocumented immigrants from its count. In a social media post, Trump stated the new census would be based on "modern day facts and figures," including information from the 2024 presidential election. This move represents his latest attempt to alter the decennial survey, which is constitutionally mandated to count all persons and is used to apportion congressional seats and federal funding. The effort follows a previous attempt during his first term to add a citizenship question to the census, which was ultimately blocked by the Supreme Court.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores the contentious decision by the Bank of England to cut interest rates even as inflation remains well above its 2% target. The move, which was not unanimous among the Monetary Policy Committee, suggests the Bank is prioritizing concerns about a weakening economy over immediate inflation control. The central bank appears to be betting that a cooling jobs market, evidenced by fewer vacancies and rising unemployment, will reduce long-term inflationary pressure. However, the decision is risky, as visible costs like food prices are still rising, and it signals uncertainty about the future pace of rate cuts needed to stimulate growth without reigniting inflation.</p>

With average home equity levels high, these products offer significantly lower interest rates, currently averaging in the low 8% range. This article explains the difference between the two products: fixed-rate home equity loans provide a lump sum, while variable-rate HELOCs offer a revolving line of credit. While rates are attractive and may offer tax benefits, homeowners are reminded that their home serves as collateral, making it crucial to choose a product that fits their budget.
