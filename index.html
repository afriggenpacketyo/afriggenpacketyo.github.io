        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and Congress are seeking to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry through subsidies and penalties on foreign-built ships, particularly those from China. However, the industry faces significant obstacles, including higher costs and longer production times compared to Asian shipyards. The Philadelphia yard, acquired by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha, aims to increase production through methods like automated welding, but it requires a steady stream of orders and government support to compete effectively. Critics argue that previous government efforts have largely failed, and a strategic fleet could be assembled more efficiently using vessels from allies like Japan and South Korea.

          <p>Bivo, a small Vermont business selling stainless steel water bottles, is struggling with the impact of President Trump's tariffs on imports from China, even after temporary reductions. The tariffs, while temporarily lowered, still significantly impact Bivo's cash flow and sales projections, forcing the company to rework its strategy. Small businesses like Bivo lack the financial reserves and lobbying power of larger corporations to navigate these trade shocks. The company has explored options like selling in Europe and negotiating better terms with its Chinese supplier to mitigate the tariff's effects. (not investment advice)</p>

This move follows Trump's consideration of rerouting $3 billion in Harvard grants to trade schools, escalating his ongoing battle with the Ivy League institution.

          <p>Donald Trump's recent shake-up of the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), including the dismissal of many staff from the China team, may signal a shift towards relying more on instinct than expert advice. This restructuring could lead to increased unpredictability in Washington's approach to China, according to diplomatic observers. The changes, which include the removal of national security advisor Mike Waltz and the reassignment of Alex Wong, may also negatively impact Taiwan's ability to communicate with key White House personnel. The White House aims to reduce the NSC staff to 50, a significant decrease from the over 300 staff under Joe Biden.</p>

Trump's order seeks to end government funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which supports NPR and PBS, labeling them as "left wing propaganda." The lawsuit argues that Congress, not the president, allocates funding for CPB, which is intended to be an independent entity.

The lack of government buy-in and the erosion of the NGO sector in India have further weakened these efforts.

It is important to consider the purpose of the money and create a CD ladder to keep funds accessible over time. The Federal Reserve will hold its target rate steady at 4.25% to 4.50%.

          <h2>Flesh-Eating Parasite Advances Toward U.S., Threatening Cattle Industry</h2>

          <p>A flesh-eating parasite, the New World screwworm, is advancing toward the U.S. after breaching a long-standing barrier in Panama. The parasite, which eats animals alive, has moved 1,600 miles through eight countries and is now in Mexico, prompting the U.S. to suspend live-cattle imports. The anti-screwworm program, which involves releasing sterile flies, cannot produce enough flies to stop the parasite's advance. Experts warn that the U.S. cattle industry is unprepared for the screwworm's return, potentially increasing beef prices.</p>

          <p>Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, remains imprisoned as his political future becomes increasingly uncertain, with Khanâ€™s efforts to regain his freedom seemingly growing ever more remote. His PTI party is facing a leadership crisis and internal disputes while Khan is behind bars, and his supporters are fearful of crackdowns. The recent clashes with India have boosted the image of the military in Pakistan, seemingly strengthening Khan's rivals. Despite Khan's supporters and millions of followers, the military's rising popularity after the conflict makes his release and return to power more challenging.</p>
