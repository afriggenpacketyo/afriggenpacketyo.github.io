          <p>The union representing over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants has announced it will defy a federal order to end its strike, which the Canada Industrial Relations Board has ruled unlawful. The ongoing job action has already grounded hundreds of flights and stranded tens of thousands of passengers. Union leaders stated they are prepared to face penalties, including jail time, to continue fighting for higher wages and improved working conditions at the bargaining table. The strike has caused significant disruption to Canada's largest airline during the peak travel season.</p>

          <p>This opinion article discusses China's proposal to build a large new embassy at the historic former Royal Mint site in London, framing it as a powerful symbol of the nation's rising global status. The author argues that diplomatic buildings have long been statements of national ambition, contrasting China's long-term investment with the UK's recent sales of prime diplomatic properties. The project has faced political opposition, with some citing national security risks, but it also signals China's view of London as a critically important global capital.</p>

          <p>Author J.K. Rowling has publicly criticized transgender athlete Hannah Mouncey, who expressed fears that new rules would prevent her from competing for a spot on Australia's women's Olympic handball team. On social media, Rowling accused Mouncey of attempting to "cheat" by playing against women. Mouncey has dismissed the idea that transgender athletes have an unfair advantage, advocating for fair restrictions rather than blanket bans. The debate occurs within the context of evolving policies from sporting bodies like the International Handball Federation and the IOC regarding transgender athlete participation.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, has strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm and is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. While the storm is not projected to make landfall in the U.S., its size and strength will create dangerous coastal conditions throughout the week. Officials have issued tropical storm watches and storm surge warnings for North Carolina's Outer Banks, where mandatory evacuations have been ordered for some areas due to the risk of severe coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>During a high-stakes meeting at the White House, President Trump signaled that the U.S. would be involved in providing security guarantees for Ukraine but walked back his previous demand for an immediate ceasefire as a precondition for peace talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a delegation of European leaders pressed for firm security commitments. The summit also focused on arranging a trilateral meeting between the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia, which Trump suggested was a matter of 'when, not if,' in the effort to end the war.</p>

          <p>An accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), utilized by major U.S. retailers like Walmart and Target, may be distorting their reported profitability in the face of new tariffs. Because RIM relies on an average cost-to-retail price ratio across broad categories of items, it is slow to reflect sudden increases in product costs. This can lead to a temporary overstatement of gross margins, creating a potential disconnect between a company's operational reality and its financial statements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health officials in Texas have officially declared the end of the state's largest measles outbreak in over three decades, which resulted in 762 confirmed cases. The outbreak, which led to nearly 100 hospitalizations and the deaths of two unvaccinated children, is considered contained after 42 days passed without a new case. Officials credited a comprehensive public health response for stopping the spread but warned that the state remains vulnerable to future outbreaks due to declining vaccination rates.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked more than 6,000 visas held by international students, citing violations of U.S. law and visa overstays. The department specified that the majority of revocations were due to offenses such as assault, burglary, and driving under the influence, as well as for 'support for terrorism.' This action is part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on immigration that includes enhanced social media screening for visa applicants, a policy that has drawn criticism over due process concerns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the age limitations associated with purchasing annuities, noting that while there are no federal laws setting a maximum age, most insurance companies impose their own caps, often between 80 and 85 years old. The optimal time to buy an annuity depends on an individual's retirement strategy rather than a specific age. Purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s can offer growth potential, while buying later in life often results in higher monthly payouts due to shorter life expectancy calculations.

          <p>A newly discovered interstellar object, designated 3I/ATLAS, is exhibiting unusual characteristics that have led some astronomers, including Harvard's Avi Loeb, to speculate that it might be generating its own light. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope show a glow ahead of the object without a corresponding cometary tail, prompting theories that it could be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy or a rare, radioactive supernova fragment. Scientists are planning to use NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to gather more data when the object makes a close approach to Mars.</p>

Prosecutors are arguing that Lai used his now-defunct newspaper, Apple Daily, to conspire with foreign forces and call for international sanctions against Hong Kong and China. Lai has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which could result in a life sentence, in a case that has drawn widespread international condemnation as a symbol of diminishing freedoms in the city.</p>

Critics suggest this move is a pretext to impede the growth of the renewable energy industry, noting that the administration has simultaneously worked to weaken other environmental regulations that impact the oil and gas sector. While wind farms do cause bird fatalities, conservation groups emphasize that climate change represents a far greater threat to eagle populations.</p>
