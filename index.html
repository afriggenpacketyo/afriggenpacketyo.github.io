          <p>Rick Jansen, known as DJ Admin, is the official DJ for Max Verstappen's dedicated fan grandstands, an integral part of the vibrant 'Orange Army' culture at Formula 1 races. He describes Verstappen as an icon treated like a god, despite the driver's down-to-earth nature. Jansen has seen the fan experience evolve, with Zandvoort hosting its final Dutch Grand Prix after 2026, raising questions about the future of these unique fan zones. His role, which began in 2014, has grown significantly, reflecting F1's shift towards a more festival-like atmosphere.</p>

The Shanghai-listed firm cautioned about substantial trading risks, attributing recent surges to China's favorable AI chip policies and new domestic AI models. Additionally, Cambricon highlighted its vulnerability to supply chain disruptions due to ongoing US export restrictions, which have placed the company and some subsidiaries on the US Commerce Department's Entity List.

          <p>Former world number one Naomi Osaka has strongly condemned Jelena Ostapenko's "no class" and "no education" comments directed at Taylor Townsend after their US Open match. Osaka stated that these remarks were "one of the worst things you could say to a black tennis player" in a predominantly white sport, highlighting the historical stigma in the African-American community. Although Townsend herself did not perceive a racial undertone, she acknowledged the broader societal context of such comments. Ostapenko has since denied any racist intent behind her outburst.</p>

          <p>Starting January next year, all young children in England and Wales will receive a free chickenpox vaccine through the NHS, administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the MMR jab. This new public health initiative aims to protect children from severe complications, reduce lost income for parents, and address declining childhood vaccination rates. Experts believe this will significantly decrease chickenpox cases and related hospitalizations. A catch-up campaign is also planned for slightly older children.</p>

Rooney also disclosed that Sir Alex Ferguson initially wanted to wait another year, but United had to act quickly to prevent him from joining Newcastle. He also recounted a near-move to Chelsea, which would have involved a loan to Middlesbrough, a condition he promptly rejected.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit marks his first in seven years, following strained relations after the 2020 Galwan Valley clashes. Despite deep-seated suspicions and China's close ties with Pakistan, economic challenges, particularly US tariffs, are pushing both nations towards cautious cooperation. India faces a widening trade deficit with China but relies on it for critical imports like AI components and EV materials. The summit may signal a willingness to find common ground, though experts remain skeptical about a lasting friendship.</p>

          <p>Italy's recent surge in banking mergers and acquisitions has seen significant setbacks, with major bids by UniCredit and Mediobanca collapsing. UniCredit withdrew its bid for Banco BPM, citing opaque conditions imposed by Rome's "golden power" rules, while Mediobanca's shareholders rejected its offer for Banca Generali. This unraveling occurs despite improved sector performance and a push for consolidation across Europe to compete with larger Wall Street firms. Analysts believe M&A activity will continue, with Monte dei Paschi still pursuing Mediobanca and Credit Agricole eyeing Banco BPM. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US tariff exemption for parcel shipments valued under $800, known as the "de minimis" rule, officially ended, impacting global businesses and supply chains. This policy change, broadened from China and Hong Kong earlier this year, aims to curb the flow of narcotics like fentanyl and increase tariff revenues. A six-month transition allows postal services to pay flat duties of $80-$200 per package, depending on origin, before shifting to full ad valorem rates by February 2026.

          <p>Thailand's suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra faces a critical judgment from the Constitutional Court regarding a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen. Accused of poor ethical standards and undermining the military, a ruling to sack Paetongtarn, who has been in power for only a year, could plunge Thailand into political turmoil. This decision comes amidst a fragile ceasefire with Cambodia and highlights a long history of prime ministers being removed by the court, reflecting deep divisions between pro-royalist elites, the military, and the Shinawatra dynasty.</p>

          <p>The UK government has instructed contractor Mitie to remove job adverts for floristry and "ballooncraft" tutors at a Heathrow immigration removal centre, following public and political outcry. The roles, some with salaries up to £39,000, were criticized by Home Office minister Seema Malhotra and Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp as unnecessary perks, arguing efforts should focus on deportations. Mitie, which manages Europe's largest immigration removal centre, stated these services aim to help detainees manage stress, but the government deemed some roles inappropriate.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Tennessee has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers convicted in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in 2023. Judge Sheryl Lipman cited concerns of bias after the original presiding judge allegedly suggested one defendant was a gang member following a separate incident. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, Jr. were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of the more serious civil rights violation causing Nichols' death. The case, which sparked nationwide protests, will now undergo further legal proceedings.</p>
