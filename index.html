          <p>Young adults, having lived through the Great Recession and pandemic, express growing economic pessimism online, using humor to cope with concerns about recession and economic policy.  This online sentiment reflects declining consumer confidence among 18-to-34-year-olds, despite historically higher readings in this age group.
