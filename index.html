        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>IBM has committed to investing $150 billion in the United States over the next five years, with over $30 billion specifically aimed at advancing American manufacturing capabilities for mainframe and quantum computers. CEO Arvind Krishna emphasized IBM's long-standing commitment to American jobs and manufacturing, highlighting the investment's role in maintaining IBM's position at the forefront of advanced computing and AI. This announcement follows President Trump's unveiling of a 'reciprocal' tariff policy designed to boost U.S. manufacturing, from which chips, smartphones, computers, and other tech devices have been exempted. The investment is expected to accelerate America's role as a global leader in computing and stimulate economic growth.</p>

          <p>A significant power outage impacted large areas of Spain and Portugal, causing widespread disruptions including halted transportation, communication breakdowns, and the shutdown of essential services. The Spanish power distributor, Red El√©ctrica, initially estimated restoration could take up to 10 hours, while Portuguese grid operator REN suggested full restoration could take up to a week. While the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center ruled out a cyberattack, REN attributed the outage to a rare atmospheric phenomenon involving extreme temperature variations in Spain. Both countries' governments convened emergency meetings to address the crisis, with efforts focused on progressively restoring voltage across the Iberian Peninsula and ensuring emergency services remained operational.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has turned down Karen Read's request to review her case, effectively ending her appeal based on double jeopardy arguments. Read is accused of vehicular manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, during a blizzard in January 2022, allegations she denies. Her defense had argued that jurors in her initial trial had allegedly agreed on acquittal for two charges, thus constituting double jeopardy. With the Supreme Court's denial, Read's retrial has resumed, with testimony continuing from a digital forensics examiner.</p>

          <p>Rep. Gerry Connolly, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, announced he will step down from his leadership role and will not seek reelection due to the recurrence of cancer. Connolly, who was first elected in 2009 and recently defeated Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez for the committee chair, had previously announced his diagnosis of esophageal cancer in November. Despite undergoing treatments, the cancer has returned, prompting his decision to retire from public service after this term.

          <p>A recent analysis by Times Opinion surveyed legal scholars to evaluate the constitutionality and legality of actions taken by President Trump during the first 100 days of his second term. The scholars identified actions, such as the executive order challenging birthright citizenship, as potentially unlawful and exceeding presidential powers. Thirty-five scholars from diverse ideological backgrounds participated, assessing the damage and connecting the dots on where Trump's administration is heading. The analysis aims to distinguish between actions within the president's legal authority and those likely to face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>While Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims to have saved $160 billion, a new analysis suggests these cuts have cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year. The Partnership for Public Service (PSP) estimates costs associated with paid leave for federal employees, rehiring mistakenly fired workers, and lost productivity contribute to this figure. The analysis excludes expenses from lawsuits challenging DOGE's actions and lost tax revenue due to IRS staff cuts. DOGE's efforts, including deferred resignation plans and workforce reductions, face criticism, with a recent poll indicating disapproval from a majority of Americans regarding Musk's role in the Trump administration.</p>

Willgoose's parents have since become advocates against knife crime and plan to establish a youth club in his memory.

          <p>Following President Trump's implementation of tariffs, Chinese e-tailer Temu has begun adding 'import charges' of approximately 145%, significantly increasing the prices of its products. These charges, often exceeding the cost of the items themselves, are attributed to covering customs-related processes and fees. This move erodes Temu's competitive advantage of low prices, potentially aligning its costs with U.S. competitors like Amazon, Walmart, and Target, while maintaining longer shipping times.

ICE is engaging in 'welfare checks' that also gather intelligence to assess whether children are a 'flight risk,' a 'threat to public safety,' or viable for deportation. Critics argue that these operations are primarily enforcement actions disguised as welfare checks, creating a climate of fear for immigrant children and their sponsors.

However, there is potential for rates to decrease later in the year if the Fed implements projected rate cuts. In the meantime, HELOCs may offer a more attractive option due to their currently lower rates, although borrowers should be mindful of their variable interest rates and the importance of actively paying down the principal.

          <p>Cliona Ward, an Irish woman who has legally resided in the U.S. for four decades, has been detained by immigration officials due to drug possession convictions dating back to 2007 and 2008. Ward, who holds a green card, was detained at San Francisco airport upon returning from Ireland, where she visited her sick father. The Irish Taoiseach, Miche√°l Martin, has expressed concern and pledged to address the situation bilaterally, emphasizing that individuals with green cards and citizenship rights should not face such challenges. The case highlights increasing scrutiny of documented immigrants under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Three U.S. citizen children, including a four-year-old with cancer, were deported to Honduras alongside their mothers, according to advocacy groups and lawyers. Border czar Tom Homan stated the mothers made the decision for their citizen children to be removed with them, asserting that having a U.S. citizen child does not provide immunity from the law. A federal judge expressed concern that one of the children, a two-year-old citizen, was deported with 'no meaningful process.'

          <p>Angela Beatty, Chief Leadership and HR Officer at Accenture, identifies a pattern of short employment stints (one year or less) as a resume red flag.

A LinkedIn survey supports this concern, with 37% of hiring managers citing frequent job changes as a potential barrier to moving forward with a candidate. Beatty advises job seekers to address any short-term roles by explaining the specific reasons behind them, especially if they were designed to be shorter term.</p>

          <p>A Brazil-led study has found a link between high intakes of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) and increased rates of premature death across eight countries. The study suggests that countries with stronger food cultures and lower UPF consumption tend to have lower premature death rates. Researchers advocate for food system improvements, including sugar taxes and incentives for diversified food production, to promote healthier dietary patterns. In the US, the FDA is considering policies to encourage manufacturers to replace artificial colors with natural ingredients.</p>

Alternative debt relief options that can improve credit scores include debt management plans and debt consolidation.
