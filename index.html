          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, has detailed China's objective to build a "world-class" military by the middle of the 21st century. The piece explicitly uses the United States' military as the benchmark for this goal, aiming for top-tier indicators in weaponry, organization, and military theory. This ambition is framed as necessary for China to match its global power status, protect national security, and effectively compete on the international stage. The strategy emphasizes achieving parity to "stand on equal footing with global powers."</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group experienced a significant 13% surge in its share price, reaching a new record high following a better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings report. The Japanese investment conglomerate reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, far exceeding analysts' predictions and marking a strong recovery from a loss in the same period last year. The positive results were largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, buoyed by the performance of portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy. Several other portfolio companies are also expected to go public soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan proposed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the military to occupy Gaza City, signaling a significant expansion of operations in the region. The decision includes five principles for ending the war, such as disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, and establishing an alternative civil administration. This move comes amid international condemnation of the humanitarian crisis and concern from hostage families who fear the expanded conflict endangers their loved ones. Hamas condemned the decision, stating it reveals Netanyahu's intent to prolong the conflict for personal and ideological reasons.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi accused Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who collaborates with cartels to bring drugs into the U.S. Maduro was first indicted in the U.S. in 2020 on charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy. Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yvan Gil dismissed the increased bounty as "pathetic" political propaganda and a desperate attempt at distraction by the U.S. administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed a significant increase in the presence of federal law enforcement agencies throughout Washington, D.C., to address a recent surge in violent crime. The operation, involving agencies like the FBI and DEA, will focus on high-traffic tourist areas and known crime hotspots for an initial seven-day period. The move is part of the "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force" established by an executive order earlier in the year. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the action is intended to protect residents and visitors and fulfills a campaign promise to restore safety in the capital.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. The judge certified a class action on behalf of all children born in the U.S. who would be affected by the order. The administration argues the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause does not apply to parents without legal permanent status, a position most legal experts dispute.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research published in Science Advances quantifies that California's fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer compared to the 1990s, primarily due to human-caused climate change. In some areas like the Cascade Range, the season now begins 46 days earlier. The study identifies earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of flammable vegetation from rising temperatures as the main drivers, ruling out human-ignited fires as a cause. This year is already on pace to exceed the five-year average for burned acreage, underscoring the growing and near-constant threat of wildfire in the state.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs on semiconductors and chips are raising questions about their potential to shift the economic balance in Southeast Asia toward China. The duties, which exempt companies with a U.S. manufacturing presence, add to the economic pressure the region is already facing from other U.S. trade policies. According to analysts, the unpredictability of Washington's tariff strategy could create an opening for Beijing to strengthen its economic ties and influence within the region.

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that Americans get an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. These foods, which include items like burgers, sweet bakery products, and savory snacks, are typically high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats while being low in fiber. The consumption is even higher among young people aged 1 to 18, who get nearly 62% of their calories from these sources. Previous research has linked high consumption of ultra-processed foods to a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and early death.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries 'Chimp Crazy,' has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. After a court ordered her to relinquish several chimpanzees, Haddix claimed Tonka had died, but the animal was later discovered confined in a small cage in her home. Animal rights group PETA, which was instrumental in the case, expressed relief at the sentencing.</p>

          <p>Following the implementation of new duties by the Trump administration, U.S. tariffs on imported goods have reached their highest level in almost 100 years. According to the Budget Lab at Yale, Americans are now expected to pay an average of 18.3% more for imported products, a rate not seen since 1934. The move has prompted international concern, with countries like Brazil and Switzerland planning responses to mitigate the economic impact. The White House, however, remains confident that the policy will encourage domestic investment and manufacturing, ultimately rebalancing the U.S. economy.</p>

The "one in, one out" deal, which began this week, allows the UK to return a migrant who arrives illegally in exchange for accepting a vetted asylum seeker from France. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed that transfers to immigration removal centers are underway but declined to provide specific numbers. The government stated it would robustly defend against any legal challenges to the removals, asserting that France is a safe country.</p>

          <p>Instagram's launch of a new map feature has triggered a backlash from users concerned about the privacy of their location data. The tool, similar to Snapchat's Snap Map, allows users to share their "last active location" with friends. Although Meta, Instagram's parent company, insists the feature is opt-in by default, many users expressed fears that their location was being shared without their consent. Instagram head Adam Mosseri responded to the complaints, stating the company was double-checking but that it appeared most users were confused about how the feature works.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning legislation that would confine serious violent and sexual offenders to specific geographical zones upon their release from prison. Unlike current exclusion zones that bar offenders from certain areas, this new system would define the area where they are permitted to be, policed by enhanced electronic tagging. Ministers argue this will provide victims with greater peace of mind, allowing them to travel without fear of encountering their attacker. However, some probation officers have raised concerns that the plan will add more pressure to an already strained service.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is calling for regulatory and legislative action after State Farm announced an average 27% increase in homeowners insurance rates in the state. The governor expressed deep concern, suggesting the insurer is unfairly shifting out-of-state catastrophe costs onto Illinois residents, as the company's loss numbers are inconsistent with the state's analysis. State Farm has cited its own unprofitability and an increase in severe weather events, such as hail damage, as reasons for the substantial price hike. Pritzker hopes new measures will lower rates for homeowners.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse announced mixed financial results for its second quarter, with revenues slightly exceeding expectations but earnings per share falling short due to high beef prices. The company reported a 12.8% year-over-year revenue increase to $1.51 billion, driven by strong customer traffic and comparable sales growth of 5.8%. Despite the positive sales trends, profitability was impacted by commodity inflation, a headwind expected to worsen in the next quarter.
