          <p>In Sean Combs' racketeering conspiracy and sex-trafficking trial, Dawn Richard, a former performer in groups backed by Combs, testified that she witnessed him physically assaulting his former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, on multiple occasions between 2009 and 2011. Richard recounted incidents of Combs punching, kicking, and slapping Ventura, including an instance where he attempted to hit her with a skillet. The defense sought to undermine Richard's account by pointing out inconsistencies in her statements over time. Instances of violence against Ventura are central to the prosecution‚Äôs argument that she was a victim of sex trafficking during her relationship with Combs, who denies the allegations. </p>

The season also saw the unexpected viral success of a bridesmaid sketch and included a polarizing monologue by Bill Burr.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the collision of a Mexican navy ship with the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in the deaths of two sailors and injuries to 19 others.

Witnesses reported the ship lost power before crashing into the bridge, snapping all three masts and leaving crew members dangling. The U.S. Coast Guard clarified that its Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) was fully functional during the incident, countering concerns raised by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. </p>

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are becoming more severe due to climate change, with predicted risk more than doubling by 2100, as droughts intensify and summer rain decreases. A report from the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC) highlights that about 60,000 forest fires occur annually in the EU, causing ‚Ç¨2 billion in economic losses. Climate change, urbanization, and land use practices, such as extensive monocultures of flammable trees, contribute to the increased fire risk. Solutions include controlled burning, ecosystem restoration, and increased public awareness and education. </p>

          <p>Falling behind on a payday loan can lead to the lender sending the account to a collection agency, potentially resulting in frequent calls and letters demanding payment, additional fees, and damage to your credit score.

It's crucial to request debt validation, understand your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and attempt to negotiate a settlement.

SPACs allow executives to raise money without a business plan, acquiring a business within two years or returning the funds.

This action is part of a larger push by national, regional, and local authorities to prioritize housing rights over economic interests, amid concerns that the proliferation of tourist rentals has driven up prices and displaced residents. </p>

          <p>Having 100% home equity means the homeowner has fully paid off their mortgage or bought the home with cash, making the total value of the home theirs without owing anything to a lender. While lenders typically limit borrowing to 80%-90% of the home's value, having 100% equity positions the homeowner for better interest rates and terms. Options include home equity loans and HELOCs, with HELOCs potentially becoming more affordable if interest rates are cut later in 2025. Borrowers should carefully evaluate their affordability before borrowing, as the home will function as collateral. </p>

          <p>Recent tornadoes in Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia resulted in 42 deaths, highlighting the challenge of predicting these events and the importance of timely warnings. Staffing cuts imposed by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have left 40% of the National Weather Service's local forecasting offices with significant gaps, potentially affecting the ability to provide timely and accurate tornado alerts. The dismantling of the nation‚Äôs early-alert and notification system is a dangerous gamble that is already affecting America‚Äôs citizens, ultimately depriving them of vital time to seek safety from catastrophic weather events. </p>

          <p>Federal officials are investigating a near-miss incident at New York's LaGuardia Airport where a Republic Airways jet had to abort takeoff to avoid colliding with a United Airlines plane taxiing across the runway. Despite LaGuardia being equipped with an advanced surface radar system (ASDS-X), a miscommunication between air traffic controllers led to the close call. The FAA is taking additional steps to reduce close calls, including plans to install an additional warning system at LaGuardia in the future. Efforts are also underway to develop a system that directly warns pilots about traffic on the runway, but the FAA has not yet certified such a system. </p>

Mounting pressure also came from the powerful Novo Nordisk Foundation, the controlling shareholder of the Danish drugmaker. Eli Lilly's Zepbound leads to more weight loss than Wegovy, and Novo Nordisk has struggled to convince Wall Street that its pipeline of next-generation weight loss drugs can help it maintain its position in the market. </p>
