            <p>China's GDP grew by 5.4% in the first quarter, surpassing expectations despite escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The growth builds on a recovery from late 2024, driven by policy stimulus, with retail sales and industrial output exceeding forecasts. However, officials cautioned about external complexities and insufficient domestic demand, emphasizing the need for proactive macro policies. Despite these challenges, the Chinese leadership aims for around 5% annual growth, emphasizing innovation and strengthening the domestic economy to counter global uncertainties.

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) issued a cease and desist order against Google for violating anti-monopoly laws. Google allegedly required Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements. The JFTC stated that Google mandated the preinstallation and prominent featuring of Google Search and Chrome on devices, restricting manufacturers from including rival search services as a condition of advertising revenue-sharing. This action aligns with similar crackdowns on Google in the UK and the U.S.</p>

            <p>The White House has introduced a new media policy that significantly restricts access to President Trump, particularly for wire services like the Associated Press (AP). This move follows a court ruling that the White House improperly punished the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico. The new policy will limit the number of wire service reporters in pool coverage and give the press secretary greater control over who questions the president. The White House Correspondents Association has criticized the policy, arguing that it allows for viewpoint discrimination.</p>

            <p>China's economy expanded by 5.4% in the first quarter, exceeding expectations despite an ongoing trade war with the United States. The growth aligns with the previous quarter but faces challenges in achieving the annual target of around 5%. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledges a complex external environment and insufficient domestic demand. China is shifting its focus towards the domestic market to mitigate external shocks, but challenges persist in consolidating sustained economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>
