        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher, Alexander Miller, has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be vulnerable to hacking due to tiny delays between its onboard lasers. Miller's analysis of data from Micius revealed time delays in the quantum transmitter, potentially allowing eavesdroppers to exploit these flaws in the satellite's experimental implementation. Quantum communication, which relies on quantum physics-based cryptography, is theoretically unhackable, but realistic devices can be susceptible to side-channel attacks. This vulnerability could compromise the security of quantum key distribution, a method used to exchange secret keys for decrypting information.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. draft ceasefire proposal, suggesting amendments while reiterating demands for a permanent truce, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and continuous humanitarian aid, none of which are in the current deal. While not explicitly rejecting the proposal, Hamas offered to release 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 dead hostages in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff deemed Hamas' response "totally unacceptable," stating it only moves negotiations backward. Caught between pressure from Palestinians and the threat of an escalated Israeli ground offensive, Hamas is attempting to negotiate a more favorable agreement.</p>

The IAEA report raises concerns, noting that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material.

This investment, part of the Strategic Defence Review, aims to create an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be rapidly scaled up. The factories will support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs.

          <p>U.S. officials have stated that Hamas' response to the proposed Gaza ceasefire is not constructive, as it seeks changes regarding guarantees for a permanent end to the war. The core issue remains the disagreement between Hamas and Israel on ensuring a lasting resolution to the conflict. The U.S. continues to work with both parties to find a mutually acceptable agreement. The focus remains on achieving a ceasefire that addresses the needs and concerns of both sides.</p>

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), an ambitious reforestation effort, faces scrutiny due to concerns about its effectiveness and sustainability. Satellite data and field reports suggest that deforestation events have occurred on NGP land, with native trees cleared to grow cash crops. Communities often have short-term access to the land and are required to grow single cash crops, leading to economic instability and illegal logging activities. The program also struggles with poor site selection, limited community support, and weak long-term sustainability planning.</p>
