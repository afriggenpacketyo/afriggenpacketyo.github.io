          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not cede any territory for peace, dismissing a potential U.S.-Russia summit that excludes Kyiv. His comments came after President Trump announced a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, suggesting that a deal might involve "some swapping of territories." Zelenskyy emphasized that any peace decisions made without Ukraine's participation would be "dead solutions" and a violation of its constitutional integrity. The planned summit is the first direct meeting between U.S. and Russian leaders in four years.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Qatar's prime minister in Spain to discuss a new Egyptian-Qatari proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The framework reportedly involves the simultaneous release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the territory. The meeting occurs amid international condemnation of Israel's announced plan to launch a military takeover of Gaza City. Meanwhile, families of the hostages are pressuring the Israeli government to prioritize their return, fearing the new offensive will endanger them further.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, from funding state Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to block a Republican redistricting plan. Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the PAC, alleging it engaged in bribery by covering travel and lodging for the legislators. O'Rourke has responded with a countersuit, accusing Paxton of attempting to silence dissent and suppress voter registration efforts. This legal battle is a key development in the partisan standoff over new congressional maps.</p>

          <p>A coalition of approximately 20 Arab and Muslim nations, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, has denounced Israel's plan for a military takeover of Gaza City as a "dangerous and unacceptable escalation." The United Kingdom also announced an additional £8.5 million in aid for Gaza, demanding that Israel allow more supplies to enter the territory safely. The international backlash follows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approval of the military offensive. In a separate event in London, British police arrested over 365 people for supporting Palestine Action, a group recently banned under anti-terrorism laws.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Southern California, named the Canyon Fire, has grown to nearly 5,400 acres, prompting evacuation orders for thousands of residents near the Los Angeles and Ventura county line. The blaze, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, remains only partially contained, though firefighters made progress overnight due to favorable weather. A Kern County firefighter sustained serious injuries when his truck rolled over a ridge while battling the fire.

          <p>A new scientific theory suggests that gravitational waves, not a hypothetical particle called the inflaton, may have been the driving force behind the universe's rapid expansion after the Big Bang. Researchers propose that quantum fluctuations in space-time could have created density variations in the primordial plasma, leading to the formation of the first stars and galaxies. This model offers a simpler explanation for the universe's structure, relying on known principles of gravity and quantum mechanics rather than speculative elements. The theory provides an elegant alternative to the long-standing inflation model.</p>

          <p>The depiction of Kashmir in India's Bollywood film industry has transformed significantly over the decades, shifting from a scenic, romantic paradise to a complex, conflict-ridden region. Early films used Kashmir's landscape as a picturesque backdrop for love stories, but the rise of militancy in the late 1980s prompted a narrative change. More recent movies, such as "Haider" and "The Kashmir Files," delve into the area's political turmoil, human rights issues, and sectarian divides.

          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission, including two from NASA, one from Japan, and a Russian cosmonaut, have safely returned to Earth after a five-month stay on the International Space Station. Their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego, marking the end of NASA's 10th commercial crew rotation. During their 148 days in orbit, the crew conducted over 200 scientific experiments. This was the first NASA-sponsored mission to land in the Pacific, a change made to ensure debris falls in unpopulated areas.</p>

          <p>A chairlift collapse at a resort in Nalchik, Russia, has left at least eight people injured, one of whom sustained a serious spinal cord injury. CCTV footage showed a cable suddenly failing, causing chairs to plummet into a lake below. A total of 21 people were on the lift at the time of the incident, with the uninjured individuals being evacuated by emergency services. The preliminary cause has been identified as wear and tear on the cables, and Russian authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of people participated in an anti-immigration protest in Nuneaton, England, marching through the town center. The demonstration was organized after the local council leader, from the Reform UK party, claimed that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers. Warwickshire Police, who were present at the largely peaceful protest, arrested one teenager on suspicion of making threats. The force follows national guidance not to release the immigration status of charged individuals, a policy that has drawn criticism from Reform UK leader Nigel Farage.</p>

          <p>Six Lebanese soldiers were killed in an explosion while inspecting a Hezbollah weapons depot in the southern city of Tyre. The army stated the soldiers were dismantling munitions as part of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement with Israel, which requires confiscating unauthorized weapons. The incident highlights the immense domestic and international pressure on the Lebanese government to disarm Hezbollah, a powerful political and military group backed by Iran. Hezbollah's new leader has rejected these calls, describing them as a threat to Lebanon's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is grappling with a severe environmental crisis driven by plastic pollution, overfishing, and the impacts of climate change. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report dwindling catches and nets filled with plastic waste, while industrial trawlers deplete fish populations. In response, regional governments and international bodies are proposing solutions, including coastal restoration projects in Egypt and the High Seas Treaty aimed at protecting global oceans. However, local fishermen and activists remain skeptical, calling for more direct involvement and tangible support rather than just promises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of how partisan gerrymandering has reshaped American politics, focusing on the Republican "Redmap" project launched after the 2008 election. The strategy involved targeting key state legislative races in 2010 to gain control of the redistricting process, successfully locking in a significant GOP advantage in Congress and statehouses for a decade. The piece traces the evolution of this tactic, the subsequent grassroots reform movements, and the 2019 Supreme Court decision that effectively closed federal courts to gerrymandering claims, setting the stage for the current partisan redistricting battles.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous award to the son of a senior CIA official who was killed while fighting for Russian forces in Ukraine. According to sources, Putin gave the Order of Lenin to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff to pass along for Michael Gloss, 21, the son of CIA deputy director Juliane Gallina. Gloss, who reportedly suffered from mental health issues, enlisted with Russian forces in 2023 and was killed in April 2024. The gesture occurred as plans were confirmed for a Trump-Putin summit in Alaska.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has outlined a "point system" to evaluate and compensate clergy abuse claims as part of a proposed bankruptcy settlement. Court documents reveal that specific acts of abuse are assigned point values, with sexual assault receiving the highest score, which will determine the payout from a settlement fund valued between $180 and $235 million. The plan requires approval from at least two-thirds of the 660 claimants, but some attorneys are urging a "no" vote, arguing survivors could receive more through individual lawsuits.</p>

James's office and her lawyer have condemned the move as political retaliation, calling it a "weaponization of the justice system."

The files, obtained after a six-year freedom of information battle, indicate that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) cited "shortfalls in maintenance" as the cause. One incident in 2019 resulted in an "unnecessary radioactive waste" release containing low levels of tritium. Both Sepa and the Ministry of Defence stated that the discharges posed no significant risk to the public or environment.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's push for Republican-led gerrymandering in states like Texas, the Democratic party is adopting a more aggressive, confrontational strategy. Democratic leaders, including governors of California and Illinois, have threatened retaliatory redistricting and have abandoned the previous motto of "when they go low, we go high." This shift reflects a growing sentiment within the party that they must fight fire with fire to protect democracy from what they see as authoritarian tactics.
