        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Existing home sales experienced a decline in March, reaching their slowest pace for that month since 2009, primarily due to elevated mortgage rates and broader economic uncertainties. Sales dropped 5.9% from February and 2.4% year-over-year, with the West experiencing the steepest monthly decline. Despite increased listings, affordability challenges persist, impacting first-time buyers who now represent a smaller portion of the market, and while prices remain high, the rate of annual increase is slowing, signaling a potential cooling of the housing market.

Germany's economy minister highlighted the country's vulnerability to the U.S. trade policy, noting that it is already suffering from weak foreign demand and reduced competitiveness, and Germany is currently the only G7 nation whose economy has not grown in the past two years.</p>

          <p>Coinbase is waiving fees for PayPal's stablecoin (PYUSD) purchases to promote its adoption and expand on-chain payment opportunities. The move aims to boost PYUSD, which has lagged behind market leaders like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, and PayPal and Coinbase will collaborate on stablecoin-based solutions for global money transfers and decentralized finance applications. The stablecoin race is intensifying as Congress considers crypto legislation focused on stablecoins, and other companies like Circle and Ripple are also launching payment networks and stablecoins.</p>
