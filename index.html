          <p>The largest rail workers' union in the United States, SMART-TD, has announced its intention to challenge the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The union cites significant concerns over Union Pacific's labor practices, alleging a troubling safety record and a culture of harassment against its workers. In contrast, the union notes that Norfolk Southern has made progress in its labor policies. The opposition will be formally presented to the Surface Transportation Board, which must approve the deal that would create the first coast-to-coast freight rail operator in the nation.</p>

          <p>Shares of identity management software company CyberArk jumped significantly following a report that Palo Alto Networks is in discussions to acquire it for over $20 billion. This potential deal highlights the growing importance of cloud security, especially with the rise of AI-related threats and ransomware attacks. If completed, this would be the largest acquisition for Palo Alto Networks, a major consolidator in the cybersecurity industry. The move reflects a broader trend of large-scale acquisitions in the sector, including Google's purchase of Wiz and Cisco's acquisition of Splunk. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorneys for Sean 'Diddy' Combs are demanding his release from jail pending his sentencing, arguing that his conviction for transporting for prostitution was related to a consensual 'swingers' lifestyle. Combs was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges, and his lawyers contend that incarcerating him for arranging consensual encounters is unprecedented. They have proposed a $50 million bail package secured by his Miami mansion. However, the judge previously denied bail, citing concerns about the safety of others based on Combs' admitted history of violence in personal relationships.</p>

          <p>Three individuals who own seats at the Royal Albert Hall have lost a High Court bid for £500,000 in damages against the venue's operator. They claimed the corporation unlawfully excluded them from more performances than permitted under the rules governing privately owned seats. The judge dismissed their request for a summary judgment, stating that the complexities of the case and the history of the dispute require a full trial. The case involves historic rights granted to investors who funded the hall's construction, with about 1,268 of the venue's seats remaining in private hands.</p>

          <p>President Alassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast has confirmed he will seek a fourth term in the upcoming presidential election, a move the opposition deems unconstitutional. The 83-year-old economist, who has been in power since 2011, cites constitutional changes that reset his term limits as the basis for his candidacy. While credited with delivering strong economic growth, his rule has faced criticism for tightening its grip on power and excluding key opposition figures from running. The announcement raises concerns about potential political instability and violence, echoing the deadly unrest that followed the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>Recent inter-communal violence in Syria, particularly between the Druze and Bedouin-Sunni communities, is causing social friction among the Syrian diaspora in Germany. Syrians living in cities like Berlin report a rise in sectarian abuse and hate speech on social media, straining relationships that were once united against the Assad regime. While some protests in Germany have seen isolated incidents of hateful rhetoric, many Syrian activists are organizing to reject division and foreign interference. Analysts suggest that while tensions are high, the idea of the Syrian war playing out on German streets is exaggerated.</p>

The move has drawn sharp criticism, including from John F. Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg.

          <p>While Turnberry's infrastructure limitations make it unsuitable for The Open Championship, Donald Trump's golf resorts in Scotland are quietly deepening their ties with professional golf. The European Tour Group is already hosting two events at Trump Aberdeen, and reports suggest Trump's Irish course, Doonbeg, is being considered for the Irish Open. This growing relationship indicates that Turnberry could soon host the Scottish Open, a major event on the DP World Tour. The developments show Trump is successfully increasing his golf footprint and influence in a country central to the sport's heritage.</p>

          <p>Comedian and actor Marc Maron has announced that he will be ending his influential podcast 'WTF with Marc Maron' this fall after a 16-year run. Maron explained that the decision was made to conclude the project with its quality intact, as he was concerned about potential burnout. The podcast, launched in 2009, became known for its deeply personal and revealing long-form interviews with celebrities, musicians, and public figures, including a landmark conversation with President Barack Obama. Maron acknowledged the difficulty of ending a project that has been a nourishing and significant part of his life.</p>

          <p>According to a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the 'worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out' in Gaza. The alert indicates that thresholds for food consumption and acute malnutrition have already been reached in parts of the territory, with mounting evidence of rising hunger-related deaths. UN agencies attribute the crisis to Israel's blockade and military operations, calling for an immediate ceasefire and a massive, unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid. The report underscores a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions, with over two million Palestinians facing severe food insecurity.</p>

          <p>The Royal Collection Trust has received an insurance payment of over £3 million following the theft of two historic snuff boxes from a Paris museum last year. The richly decorated 18th-century items, one of which was encrusted with nearly 3,000 diamonds, were on loan to the Cognacq-Jay Museum when they were stolen in a daylight raid. The trust's annual report reveals the figure and states the money will be used for the 'enhancement of the collection.' The report also showed record visitor numbers to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, boosting the trust's income.</p>

          <p>A German court has convicted three men for the 2022 theft of 483 ancient Celtic gold coins from a museum in Manching, Bavaria. The defendants received prison sentences of up to 11 years for the gang robbery. The heist, which took only nine minutes, involved cutting local communication cables before breaking into the museum and smashing a display case. The treasure, considered the largest trove of Celtic gold found in the 20th century, is still mostly missing, with evidence suggesting some of it was melted down.</p>

          <p>As catastrophic hunger affects millions in Gaza and other conflict zones, medical experts detail the devastating physiological process of starvation. The body first depletes its carbohydrate and fat stores before beginning to consume its own muscle and organ tissue for protein, a final and fatal stage. This process leads to severe malnutrition, muscle wasting, organ failure, and a weakened immune system, often resulting in death from infection or cardiac arrest. Children, pregnant people, and the elderly are especially vulnerable, facing long-term health consequences even if they survive the immediate crisis.</p>

          <p>A painting by Surrealist artist Salvador Dali, which was purchased for just £150 at a house clearance in Cambridge, is now expected to sell for up to £30,000 at auction. The piece, titled 'Vecchio Sultano,' has been authenticated as a genuine work from a series of illustrations Dali created for 'The Arabian Nights.' An art dealer who bought the piece discovered it had previously been attributed to Dali at a Sotheby's sale in the 1990s before its attribution was lost. The rediscovery is considered significant for Dali scholars and highlights the potential for finding hidden treasures.</p>

As part of the settlement, UCLA is prohibited for 15 years from facilitating the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas, including based on their beliefs about Israel.
