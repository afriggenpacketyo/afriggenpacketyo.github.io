          <p>Following the targeted shootings of Minnesota state lawmakers, members of Congress will receive security briefings this week to address rising concerns about political violence. Senators will be briefed by the Senate Sergeant at Arms and the U.S. Capitol Police, while House members will receive a virtual briefing. Former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger noted that threats against members of Congress have significantly increased in recent years, with over 9,400 concerning statements and direct threats investigated in 2024, more than double the figure in 2017. The heightened threat assessment reflects the current political landscape, prompting increased security measures and nationwide investigations. Optimism is tempered by the severity of the situation.

A CD ladder, which combines short-term and long-term CDs, offers flexibility and access to cash at regular intervals.

          <p>Despite high hopes for elevating soccer's profile in the United States, recent major soccer events have faced challenges in drawing large crowds. The expanded Club World Cup and Concacaf Gold Cup have seen underwhelming attendance figures, even with price cuts. While the U.S. men's national team secured a 5-0 victory in their Gold Cup opener, the turnout was modest. The article suggests that high ticket prices and a lack of widespread enthusiasm may be contributing to the attendance issues.

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris unexpectedly closed due to a strike by its staff, who are protesting against unmanageable crowds and chronic understaffing. Gallery attendants, ticket agents, and security personnel refused to work, citing untenable working conditions. The closure highlights the challenges of global overtourism, as the Louvre struggles to accommodate the millions of visitors it attracts each year. President Macron's plan to renovate the Louvre and address infrastructure issues feels distant to the staff, who are demanding immediate improvements to their working conditions. The situation reflects a broader struggle for iconic museums to balance accessibility with the well-being of their employees and the preservation of art.</p>

          <p>At Home, a home decor and furniture retailer, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of a restructuring agreement to eliminate $2 billion in debt. The company, owned by Hellman & Friedman, has faced challenges due to rising tariffs and a slowdown in consumer demand.

The bankruptcy reflects broader financial difficulties in the retail sector, with other large retailers like The Container Store and Big Lots also filing for bankruptcy last year.

          <p>President Trump's military parade in Washington D.C. was met with a disappointing turnout and starkly contrasted with large-scale "No Kings" protests across the country. The parade, intended to mark the U.S. army's 250th anniversary and celebrate Trump's power, was criticized for its ostentatious display and lack of enthusiasm. The event was seen as an attempt to underscore Trump's determination to quash dissent, while the protests reflected a desire for equality and self-government. The article suggests that Trump's actions are increasingly authoritarian, imitating the behavior of dictators seen on TV. The optimism score reflects the division and concerns surrounding the event.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp is set to introduce three new ad features in a global rollout, appearing in the Updates section of the app. These ads will not be displayed within private chats, and the content of encrypted messages will not be used to target users. Instead, WhatsApp will leverage user location, language, ad interaction, and followed channels for ad suggestions. However, users who have linked their WhatsApp account to Facebook or Instagram will experience more personalized ads. This move is intended to monetize the platform at scale.</p>
