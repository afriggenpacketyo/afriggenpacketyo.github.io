          <p>President Donald Trump has directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ensure military personnel receive their pay, circumventing the federal government shutdown that commenced on October 1. This directive aims to prevent troops from missing their scheduled paychecks, a situation contrasting with other federal employees who have already experienced withheld wages or layoffs. Trump, leveraging his Truth Social platform, accused Democrats of holding the military and national security hostage by failing to agree on a spending plan to reopen the government. Concurrently, the administration has initiated layoffs of thousands of federal workers across various agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Treasury Department, an unprecedented move intended to pressure Democrats and further his goal of reducing the federal workforce. This action highlights the escalating political tensions surrounding the shutdown.</p>

          <p>A helicopter crashed in a busy oceanfront area of Huntington Beach, Southern California, on Saturday afternoon, leading to the hospitalization of five individuals, including a child. The incident occurred near a parking lot off Pacific Coast Highway, with dramatic social media video capturing the helicopter spinning multiple times before colliding with palm trees and a pedestrian bridge staircase. Both occupants of the aircraft and three pedestrians on the street sustained injuries, though their current conditions have not been disclosed. Police closed a significant section of PCH for investigation, with the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board now probing the unknown cause of the crash. This event unfolded near a planned helicopter landing party.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster CCTV has launched "Silent Honour," a new TV series that publicly chronicles and commemorates Communist Party espionage activities in Taiwan. This marks a rare shift in Beijing's approach to these historical clandestine operations, which were systematically crushed by the Kuomintang (KMT) on the island, resulting in the capture and execution of many operatives. The show premiered on September 30, marked as Martyrs’ Day in mainland China, signaling a deliberate re-evaluation of this period. The article highlights that the series chronicles the party's intelligence efforts that commenced in the final months of the Chinese Civil War, following the KMT's retreat to Taiwan in June 1949, and was produced under state guidance.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that democracies must implement six key steps to rival China's climate action, emphasizing the critical need for stronger mechanisms to safeguard climate policy from political cycles and populist erosion. Despite global energy investment projected to reach $3.3 trillion this year, with two-thirds directed towards clean technologies, a significant crisis of confidence is unfolding. The article highlights that political will erosion, driven by populist pressures, has led to cancelled clean energy projects and investor retreats, attributing these setbacks not to technological inadequacy or lack of capital but to political instability. Leaders are increasingly framing climate action as incompatible with affordability and energy security, exploiting the disconnect between immediate costs and deferred benefits.

Casualties remain unclear, but Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the "unprovoked" attacks on civilians and vowed a strong response, stating Pakistani forces would respond "with a stone for every brick." Islamabad accuses Kabul of harboring terrorists targeting Pakistan, a claim the Taliban consistently denies. This escalation occurred as the Afghan Taliban foreign minister was on an historic visit to India, adding a complex diplomatic layer to the ongoing border tensions and prompting calls for restraint from Saudi Arabia and Qatar.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment as part of his ongoing treatment plan for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, a spokesperson confirmed to CBS News. He was diagnosed in May 2025 with prostate cancer characterized by a Gleason score of 9, indicating a highly aggressive form, with metastasis to the bone. Sources close to Biden report he is doing well and responding positively to the treatment, which commenced "a few weeks ago" in Philadelphia. This health update follows his previous treatment for basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer, two years prior. Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer affecting men, with age being the most common risk factor.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's significant struggles at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series, where he went one for 18 with nine strikeouts, have raised considerable concerns for the upcoming NL Championship Series. Ohtani attributed some of his difficulty to facing numerous left-handed pitchers, a sentiment partially echoed by manager Dave Roberts regarding the team's overall hitting woes. However, Roberts also urged Ohtani to "do a little self-reflecting" on his aggressive swing decisions outside the strike zone and passive approach within it. The manager explicitly stated that the Dodgers cannot win the World Series with such performance, highlighting the critical need for Ohtani's "recalibration" and improved at-bat quality.</p>

          <p>Golf legend Tiger Woods has undergone his seventh back surgery, a lumbar disc replacement to address a collapsed disc in his spine, casting further doubt on his return to competitive golf. The 15-time major winner experienced pain and lack of mobility, leading to Friday's successful operation performed by Dr. Sheeraz Qureshi and his team in New York. This procedure marks Woods' second back surgery in just over a year, adding to a growing list of injuries that include a ruptured Achilles tendon earlier this year. His last competitive appearance was at the Open Championship in 2024, and his planned comeback for the Genesis Invitational was previously derailed, leaving his future in the sport uncertain.</p>

The rising floodwaters topped control systems built almost 20 years ago, with the water expected to peak Saturday night and more heavy rain forecast for Monday and Tuesday. Despite the immediate crisis, the low Vallecito Reservoir, after months of drought, is expected to accommodate the deluge, offering a small silver lining amidst the "insane" amount of water, contrasting with recent wildfires.</p>

While it brings sunset forward by an hour, the article notes the nights are already drawing in, with four to five minutes of daylight lost daily. The practice of Daylight Saving Time, initiated by Germany in 1916 to conserve fuel during World War One, has continued with ongoing debates about permanent BST. Concerns about darker winter mornings in Scotland, where sunrise could be as late as 09:45 BST, remain a key argument against year-round summer time.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is ending support for its Windows 10 operating system on October 14, meaning devices running it will no longer receive security updates and become more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Users are urged to upgrade for free to Windows 11 if their computers are compatible, or sign up for Extended Security Updates (ESU) until October 2026, which may incur a $30 fee for personal users or require 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points. Consumer groups criticize this move, arguing it will lead to unnecessary spending and environmental waste, as many older devices cannot run Windows 11.

          <p>During the government shutdown, the Trump administration mistakenly issued reduction-in-force notices to employees in key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offices due to "coding errors." Workers involved in responding to Ebola and measles outbreaks, as well as a significant portion of the staff responsible for the CDC's influential Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), were among those erroneously laid off. A federal health official confirmed that these employees would "eventually" receive formal notices rescinding their terminations, likely within days. The article clarifies that these errors affected only four CDC offices, meaning hundreds of other HHS employees will still lose their jobs, highlighting the chaotic nature of the RIF process amidst ongoing public health threats.</p>

          <p>The Himalayas' autumn climbing season, traditionally known for clear skies, is becoming increasingly deadly due to extreme weather shifts, with meteorologists linking prolonged monsoons to climate change. Last weekend, a shock blizzard stranded hundreds of tourists near Everest's eastern face, resulting in one death from hypothermia and altitude sickness, despite successful rescue efforts for others. Similar incidents occurred on the Nepal side, with communication lines disrupted by torrential rains and heavy snowfall, causing an estimated 60 deaths from landslides and flash floods. Experts explain that warmer, wetter air from climate change, interacting with westerly disturbances, "turbocharges" the monsoon, leading to sudden, damaging precipitation and dangerous mountain conditions, significantly impacting tourism.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, the expansive blueprint is expected to redefine the country's infrastructure playbook, shifting towards more tech-driven and people-focused projects. This plan follows decades of rapid expansion, including a 4-trillion-yuan stimulus package in 2009 that helped navigate the global financial crisis through massive public works. While these past projects significantly spurred economic growth and connected the vast population, some also contributed to local government debt, a persistent source of financial pressure. Despite these concerns, officials and government advisers remain bullish on the scale of infrastructure spending over the next half-decade, indicating continued investment as a key driver for economic development and national priorities.
