          <p>A Hudson Institute report warns that China is expanding its nuclear arsenal not just for deterrence, but to intimidate U.S. allies and weaken American influence in Asia. By 2035, China is expected to match the U.S. in nuclear capability, aiming to create doubt about the U.S. security umbrella for nations like Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea. The report argues China's strategy is to achieve regional dominance, potentially for actions against Taiwan, without provoking a direct allied military response. It recommends the U.S. strengthen conventional deterrence and counter Chinese information campaigns rather than pursuing arms control.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking crimes, has been moved from a low-security prison in Florida to a minimum-security camp in Texas. The transfer occurred shortly after she met for two days with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, where she reportedly discussed numerous individuals connected to Epstein. The reason for the move has not been officially disclosed, raising speculation about whether she is cooperating with the Justice Department for a potential sentence reduction. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for grooming underage girls for sexual abuse by Epstein.</p>

          <p>The implementation of new broad-based U.S. tariffs is creating significant uncertainty for the retail industry as it plans orders for the upcoming spring season. Trade groups like the National Retail Federation warn that the tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices, fewer product choices, and potential job losses. Small and large businesses alike are struggling with the unpredictable trade landscape, making it difficult to manage supply chains and costs, particularly for goods sourced from countries like China, Mexico, and India. Some business owners report pausing new product releases and spending significant time on logistics instead of growth. (not investment advice)</p>

With IVF treatments costing between $12,000 and $25,000 per cycle and rarely covered by insurance, the out-of-pocket expense remains a major barrier for many. Advocacy groups emphasize the broad, bipartisan support for IVF access and are urging the administration to follow through on its pledge.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, visited a controversial aid distribution site in Gaza operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The visit, intended to assess the humanitarian situation, comes amid reports of hundreds of Palestinian deaths near these Israeli-backed sites, a figure the GHF disputes. Critics, including some Gazans and aid organizations like Oxfam, have labeled the visit a "media stunt" that fails to address the root causes of the severe food shortages. Human Rights Watch has condemned the GHF system as a "flawed, militarised" operation and called for its suspension.</p>

          <p>A new reboot of "The Naked Gun," starring Liam Neeson, successfully channels the spirit of the original spoof comedies. Directed by Akiva Schaffer, the film leverages Neeson's established action-hero persona for comedic effect, much like the original films did with dramatic actor Leslie Nielsen. The movie prioritizes a high volume of gags and silly set pieces over a coherent plot, offering a refreshing dose of pure farce in a cinematic landscape dominated by action blockbusters. While not as groundbreaking as its predecessors, the film is praised for its zany, lighthearted fun and commitment to unapologetic goofiness.</p>

The states argue the federal actions are an unconstitutional overreach that undermines state laws and creates a chilling effect, causing clinics to close and leaving vulnerable youth without necessary medical support.

Experts like Michael Mann and Naomi Oreskes argue the non-peer-reviewed document cherry-picks data and uses outlier scientists to create a false narrative promoting fossil fuels.

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, personal neck cooling fans have become a popular gadget for beating the heat, but their effectiveness is debatable. These devices work by blowing air across the neck and face, which can enhance the body's natural cooling process of sweat evaporation. However, experts caution that in high humidity, this effect is diminished. While the fans can make a person feel cooler due to the high concentration of thermal receptors in the neck, they likely do little to lower core body temperature. This could create a false sense of security, potentially leading to overexertion in dangerous heat.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Outline Key Rules for Purchasing Annuities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With ongoing economic uncertainty, annuities are a popular tool for securing retirement income, but making a smart purchase requires understanding key guidelines. Financial experts suggest several rules, including keeping total annual fees below 1% and not buying a deferred annuity unless you can wait at least 10 years for it to mature. Another principle is to use guaranteed income sources like annuities to cover essential living expenses first, creating an "income floor." Planners also recommend allocating no more than 25% of a total retirement portfolio to annuities to maintain liquidity and diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Interest has started accruing again for approximately 8 million federal student loan borrowers who were enrolled in the SAVE repayment plan. These borrowers had been placed in a zero-interest forbearance after court injunctions halted the Biden-era program. The Department of Education's decision to resume interest could increase monthly costs by an average of $300 for a typical borrower. While enrollees can choose to remain in forbearance and not make payments, their loan balances will now grow, making future repayment more expensive. Borrowers are encouraged to review their options and consider switching to other available repayment plans.</p>

          <p>Nintendo has announced it will raise the U.S. prices for its original Switch family of systems and some accessories, effective August 3. The company cited "market conditions" as the reason for the price hike, which will affect the standard Switch, Switch Lite, and OLED models. This move comes amid a shifting tariff landscape under the Trump administration, which recently unveiled new tariff rates for many countries. The price of the newly released Switch 2 console and all games will remain unchanged for now, though Nintendo noted that future adjustments may be necessary.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of cooling as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, well below forecasts. Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics sharply revised totals for May and June downward by a combined 258,000, indicating hiring was much weaker than previously thought. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, while wage growth remained steady. The slowdown was broad, with job gains concentrated almost entirely in the healthcare sector, while federal government and professional services shed jobs. The weak report raises concerns about the economic impact of escalating trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Allergy experts are increasingly calling for the removal of the common over-the-counter medication diphenhydramine, best known as Benadryl, from the market. They argue the first-generation antihistamine is outdated and poses unnecessary risks compared to safer, more effective modern alternatives like cetirizine (Zyrtec) and loratadine (Claritin). Side effects of diphenhydramine can include significant drowsiness, cognitive impairment, and in some cases, dangerous cardiac effects, with heightened risks for children and older adults. Despite its widespread use for allergies and as a sleep aid, experts say it should no longer be a first-line treatment.</p>

The company also announced it could spend up to $118 billion on capital expenditures this year, primarily to build out infrastructure for artificial intelligence. While Amazon's retail and advertising segments showed steady growth, concerns about its competitive position in the cloud and the timeline for AI monetization weighed heavily on the stock.

In multiple instances reviewed by DW Fact Check, Grok incorrectly identified recent, verified photos of malnourished children in Gaza as being from different conflicts in Iraq and Yemen years ago. These false claims were then amplified by X users to dismiss the severity of the current situation. The analysis highlights the dangers of relying on AI tools for rapid fact-checking, as their inaccuracies can fuel misinformation campaigns, particularly around sensitive and contentious global events.</p>

          <p>A collection of eight books explores the value of pursuing hobbies, from knitting and gardening to bird-watching and solving puzzles. The selections emphasize that the joy of a hobby is often found in the process itself, rather than achieving perfection or a productive outcome. Authors like Peggy Orenstein ("Unraveling") and Amy Tan ("The Backyard Bird Chronicles") recount how their personal pursuits became life-affirming practices. The list champions the idea of "intentional amateurism," arguing that trying new things simply for enjoyment is a deeply human act that can provide fulfillment and a deeper connection to the world.</p>
