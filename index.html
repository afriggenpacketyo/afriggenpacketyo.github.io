          <p>A union representing CDC employees is urging the federal government to condemn vaccine misinformation after a fatal shooting at the agency's Atlanta headquarters. The suspect, who killed a police officer before dying, reportedly believed the COVID-19 vaccine had negatively impacted his mental health. The union stated the attack highlights the real-world dangers faced by public health staff due to the "vilification" and "mistreatment" fueled by disinformation campaigns. They are demanding enhanced security and a clear statement from leadership to rebuild public trust and protect scientists.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has escalated a political battle over a contentious redistricting plan, threatening to call continuous special legislative sessions that "could literally last years." The conflict began after more than 50 Democratic lawmakers fled the state to prevent a quorum, blocking a Republican proposal aimed at creating five new GOP-favorable congressional seats. Abbott has warned the absent Democrats will be arrested upon their return, while Democratic governors from other states have accused him of engaging in a "blatant power grab" at the behest of Donald Trump. The dispute highlights the intense national stakes surrounding gerrymandering ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to address crime and homelessness in Washington, D.C., warning the city's homeless population to leave "IMMEDIATELY" in a social media post. This comes as the administration ramps up a seven-day effort to counter crime in the capital, which includes an increased presence of federal law enforcement agencies. Trump's focus on D.C. crime rates is at odds with Justice Department data showing a 30-year low in violent crime for 2024. The president's forceful rhetoric and planned actions have sparked concern and criticism from the city's Democratic leadership.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has defended his government's decision to suspend exports of certain offensive weapons to Israel that could be used in a Gaza offensive. While affirming Germany's solidarity and commitment to Israel's self-defense, Merz stated his government could not supply arms for a conflict that could kill thousands of civilians. The policy shift has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative bloc and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who claimed Merz "buckled" under pressure. This move marks a significant change in Germany's stance as Israel faces increasing diplomatic isolation from its European partners.</p>

          <p>During a preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, Dallas Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb was involved in a bizarre incident despite not playing. While celebrating a teammate's play on the sideline, Lamb inadvertently collided with a sideline official who was running in the restricted area. Both individuals were helped up and appeared uninjured, but the contact resulted in a penalty against the Cowboys for sideline interference. The referee explained that because Lamb was in the restricted white border area, the contact was an automatic foul, adding an unusual moment to the preseason matchup.</p>

Many protesters argued the focus should be on freeing the approximately 20 living hostages remaining from the October 7th attacks. The event, which saw one arrest and minor scuffles, highlighted concerns within the Jewish community about rising antisemitism and the government's diplomatic strategy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing turmoil following its handling of a gene therapy drug from Sarepta Therapeutics for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The agency granted the $3.2 million treatment an accelerated approval in 2023 despite internal concerns about limited clinical data. However, after three patients died from acute liver failure, the FDA requested the company suspend distribution, causing Sarepta's stock to plummet. This case highlights the significant dilemmas the FDA confronts when balancing the need for rapid access to treatments for rare diseases against potential safety risks and the immense financial stakes involved.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire in Southern California, dubbed the Canyon Fire, has been largely suppressed after burning nearly 5,400 acres and prompting evacuation orders for thousands of residents. The blaze, which started along the Los Angeles and Ventura county line amid extreme heat, injured a firefighter whose truck rolled down a steep hillside. Favorable weather conditions allowed firefighters to make significant progress, leading to the lifting of all evacuation orders by Saturday evening. The incident is one of several active wildfires across California, a state increasingly affected by hotter, drier conditions that lengthen and intensify fire seasons.</p>

          <p>The official White House portraits of former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush have been moved from the prominent Grand Foyer to a less visible area. President Trump reportedly directed the move, placing the portraits at the top of the Grand Staircase, an area largely restricted to the first family and select staff. This breaks with the protocol of displaying the most recent predecessors' portraits in the main entryway for visitors and official guests.

          <p>The Japanese practice of 'forest bathing,' or shinrin-yoku, is gaining popularity as a method for improving focus and lowering stress. The mindfulness practice involves immersing oneself in nature and engaging all senses, which research shows can have significant mental health benefits. Certified guides lead sessions that encourage quiet reflection and disconnection from technology, but the practice can be done solo in any green space, even for short periods. Experts suggest that for those without easy access to nature, bringing plants indoors or listening to nature sounds can also provide some of the calming benefits.</p>

Wils, who had paid for the window seat specifically for the view, eventually asked the woman to stop, and they reportedly laughed about the incident. The clip amassed over 3 million views, with many commenters, including a flight attendant, affirming that control of the window shade belongs to the person in the window seat.</p>

          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan argues that developing a personal brand is a crucial tool for introverts to advance their careers, as it allows them to shape their professional narrative rather than being underestimated. Chan, a self-described introvert, built her own brand through consistent content creation on LinkedIn, which led to significant career opportunities. She advises that a personal brand is simply what people know you for and can be cultivated through small, consistent actions, both online and offline. Participating in hobby groups or networking events can also contribute, helping introverts showcase their unique talents and break out of their comfort zones.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark," examines the life of novelist Muriel Spark, focusing on her identity as one of modern Britain's most important religious writers, a fact often obscured by her reputation for comic wit. The article highlights how Spark's conversion to Roman Catholicism shaped her work, allowing her to explore themes of divine will, human fallibility, and final judgment through a darkly droll lens. Her narrative technique, particularly her use of prolepsis or "auto-spoilers," is presented as a way of playing God with her characters, forcing readers to focus on causality and fate rather than simple plot suspense.</p>

          <p>An environmental scientist on TikTok effectively dismantled a common climate change myth by explaining the difference between natural climate cycles and human-induced warming. In response to a comment, the scientist acknowledged that the Earth naturally goes through warming and cooling periods but emphasized that the current rapid warming is unequivocally influenced by human emissions. She shared charts from the EPA and other institutions showing that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and methane are far higher than in natural cycles. This accelerated warming is causing more extreme weather, threatening ecosystems, and projected to have staggering economic costs.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggests that her predecessor, the late Alex Salmond, might have been the source of a leak regarding a 2018 investigation into sexual misconduct claims against him. Allies of Salmond, who was later cleared of all criminal charges, have vehemently denied this, calling the claim a "fabrication" and "hypocrisy." The book excerpt reignites the bitter feud that fractured the Scottish National Party, with Salmond's allies highlighting the government's unlawful handling of the initial probe. The journalist who broke the original story also expressed skepticism about Sturgeon's theory.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huaraches made by Indigenous artisans, but the shoe was reportedly produced in China without partnership or credit to the Oaxacan community. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, who stated the government was exploring legal support for the artisans. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in a meaningful partnership with the community, and promotional images of the shoe have been removed.</p>
