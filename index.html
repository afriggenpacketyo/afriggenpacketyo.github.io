        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England is planning significant cuts to services, including diabetes care, rehab centers, and mental health therapies, to address a nearly Â£7 billion budget overspend. According to NHS Providers, staff reductions and the cessation of overtime for doctors are also under consideration, potentially impacting efforts to reduce hospital waiting lists. One hospital trust is contemplating shedding 1,500 jobs, while a mental health trust has ceased accepting new ADHD referrals for adults, with psychological therapy waits exceeding a year. These measures are being considered despite a Â£22 billion funding increase from the government, with health officials emphasizing the need to cut bureaucracy and improve productivity.</p>

          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, emphasized the importance of rebuilding the UK's trade relationship with the European Union to benefit the British economy. He noted the fall-off in goods trade with the EU since Brexit and suggested that improving trade relations could positively impact inflation and overall economic openness. Bailey highlighted the recent US-UK trade agreement as an example of the importance of trade deals and their potential to rebuild the world trading system, while underscoring the need to ensure Brexit decisions do not damage the UK's long-term trade position.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence is advising President Donald Trump not to raise taxes on wealthy Americans, cautioning against reversing the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Pence argues that increasing the top margin rate would disproportionately affect small business owners who reinvest their earnings into their companies. He advocates for making all the Trump-Pence tax cuts permanent to foster economic growth. Pence also credited Trump for his victory last November, securing the southern border, and restoring the military while expressing concerns about straying from conservative principles.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is facing a significant crisis due to ongoing conflicts with the Trump administration, which could lead to substantial cuts in research funding and personnel.

Harvard is currently challenging the funding freeze in court but acknowledges that the resolution may be lengthy and the funds may not be fully restored. University leaders fear that without its extensive research apparatus, Harvard could become more like a small, teaching-focused liberal arts college, impacting its long-term preeminence.</p>

This decision comes after the withdrawal of Ed Martin's nomination due to concerns over his connections to Nazi sympathizers and defense of January 6th Capitol rioters. Pirro, a former district attorney and judge, will terminate her Fox News contract as is standard practice when nominated for a government role. Pirro's nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, is accompanied by her involvement in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News by Smartmatic.</p>

          <p>President Trump has replaced his controversial pick for U.S. attorney in D.C., Ed Martin, with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, citing a lack of Senate support for Martin. Martin, a "Stop the Steal" activist, faced criticism for demoting prosecutors involved in January 6th Capitol riot cases. Senator Thom Tillis expressed concerns about Martin's nomination due to his views on the Capitol riot, leading to Trump's decision to withdraw the nomination. Pirro's appointment as interim U.S. attorney resolves a thorny dilemma for the president, who said hours earlier that he would withdraw his nomination to permanently install the interim U.S. attorney, Ed Martin, under pressure from Senate Republicans.</p>

          <p>A pro-China informer in Hong Kong, Innes Tang, reveals he has reported dozens of people to the police for alleged national security violations, contributing to a growing culture of informing. Since the implementation of the national security law (NSL), critics argue that free speech and press have been curtailed, with over 300 people arrested for national security offenses. The Hong Kong authorities have also established a national security hotline, receiving nearly 900,000 tip-offs since November 2020. This environment has led to self-censorship, fear of surveillance, and an exodus of Hongkongers, with an estimated 300,000 or more leaving the city in recent years.</p>

James has denied the allegations, calling them "baseless," and her attorney, Abbe Lowell, has criticized the investigation as political retribution.

          <p>Charges of sex trafficking against luxury real estate brokers Oren and Tal Alexander, along with their brother Alon, have been expanded to include six victims, including an underage girl, according to a superseding indictment filed by Manhattan federal prosecutors. The brothers are accused of using force, fraud, or coercion to traffic the women and girl, with the scheme dating back to 2009. The victims represent a fraction of the dozens of women the brothers allegedly lured, drugged, and sexually assaulted over two decades. The three men, who have pleaded not guilty, are awaiting trial in Brooklyn.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer can claim a limited victory with the new trade deal with America, though political opponents accuse him of over claiming and adopting Trumpian hyperbole. The deal mitigates recent tariff increases, rather than representing a broad free trade agreement, but offers better trading conditions than recent times. The UK avoided diluting its Digital Services Tax and questions about the NHS or food standards. As industries pore over the specifics, Starmer can highlight this agreement as positive news, even if limited, amid international and domestic political challenges.</p>

Scotland's representation has increased significantly compared to previous years. These changes highlight the waxing and waning fortunes of different nations in the rugby world. Andy Farrell, in his usual role as Ireland head coach, opted for 15 of those he coaches in his Lions squad.</p>

          <p>China and Russia have jointly accused the United States of escalating the risk of nuclear war through its security policies, including the expansion of alliances and the deployment of strategic weapons. In a joint statement issued after a meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, the two nations condemned US actions aimed at achieving military supremacy and undermining global strategic stability. They expressed concern over the aggravation of relations between nuclear-weapon states and the increasing risk of military clashes. The statement highlights the growing strategic alignment between Beijing and Moscow in response to perceived threats from Washington.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. will not intervene in the conflict between India and Pakistan, deeming it "fundamentally none of our business." While the U.S. will seek de-escalation through diplomatic channels, it will not force either side to lay down arms. Vance's remarks align with the Trump administration's "America first" foreign policy, signaling a retreat from the U.S. role as a mediator in foreign conflicts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for an "immediate de-escalation" and spoken with leaders of both countries. India has accused Pakistan of being behind a recent attack where gunmen killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in India-administered Kashmir.</p>

Josh Raffaelli, a former fund manager at Brookfield, alleges that the company mistreated investors and backtracked on pledges to invest in his funds. He claims Brookfield vetoed a $100 million investment from a major foreign conglomerate and reduced the amount one of his funds planned to invest in Musk's xAI. Brookfield denies the allegations, stating the suit is without merit. Raffaelli was fired shortly after filing a whistle-blower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

Schurr testified that he feared for his life during the incident. The killing of Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant, sparked widespread protests and highlighted racial injustice and policing issues. The mistrial comes a day after three former Memphis police officers were acquitted of murder in the killing of Tyre Nichols.</p>
