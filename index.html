          <p>Zhang, a pioneer in China's internet industry and founder of Sohu.com, is advising college graduates to prioritize starting businesses over pursuing graduate degrees. Drawing from his own experience, Zhang believes that practical know-how gained from working at a company is more valuable than postgraduate education when establishing a business. He suggested that graduates should consider starting their own ventures to acquire practical skills. Zhang obtained a PhD in physics from MIT and later founded Internet Technologies China, which became Sohu.com, the first mainland internet company to raise venture capital funding.</p>

          <p>President Trump cut short his trip to Canada for the G7 summit, citing escalating tensions in the Middle East, specifically the Israel-Iran conflict, and returned to Washington to address important matters. During the summit, Trump stated he had spoken with everyone regarding the situation and believed a deal between Israel and Iran would be signed. The president's sudden return occurred as Israel and Iran exchanged airstrikes and missile attacks, with Israel targeting Iran's nuclear program and Iran retaliating with missile and drone strikes on Israel. While the U.S. maintains it is not directly involved in Israel's strikes, it has assisted in intercepting Iranian missiles and has warned Iran against striking U.S. military bases in the region. The article provides context on the ongoing conflict and the U.S.'s stance. </p>

While critical of the Iranian government's policies, she stated that war would not bring democracy and blamed the regime's aggression for the country's predicament. The article includes perspectives from other Iranian activists who, while opposing the current regime, do not support the Israeli strikes due to concerns about safety, societal collapse, and the destruction of Iran's infrastructure.

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee has revealed its version of President Trump's tax bill, differing from the House-passed version, potentially leading to disagreements between the two chambers. Key differences include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid work requirements, and the child tax credit amount. The Senate bill proposes keeping the SALT deduction cap at $10,000, while the House bill offers up to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000 annually. The Senate version permanently extends the Trump 2017 tax cuts and includes a $5 trillion hike to the federal debt limit. (not investment advice)</p>

Kim denounced the failure as a "criminal act" and ordered immediate restoration and punishment for those responsible, demonstrating the regime's seriousness about building a nuclear-armed navy. Experts suggest that publicizing the capsizing was a deliberate political strategy to show the regime addressing problems and holding people accountable.

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear an appeal from Chevron, Exxon, and other oil and gas companies regarding lawsuits seeking compensation for coastal land loss and environmental degradation in Louisiana. The companies argue the cases should be heard in federal court because they began oil production during World War II as federal contractors. The plaintiffs, representing Plaquemines and Jefferson Parish governments, claim the appeal is a stall tactic to avoid accountability. A jury previously ordered Chevron to pay upwards of $740 million for coastal damage.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have released details on President Trump's tax bill, revealing differences from the House-passed version, particularly regarding Medicaid funding and the SALT deduction. The Senate proposes steeper cuts to Medicaid and permanently extends the $10,000 SALT deduction, while the House seeks to raise the deduction to $40,000 for certain incomes. The Senate version also aims to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while making Trump's first-term tax cuts permanent. Senate Majority Leader John Thune acknowledged the $10,000 SALT cap is a starting point for negotiation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict has been ambiguous, ranging from support for Israeli strikes to distancing himself from them. The article explores Trump's options, including escalating the conflict under pressure from Netanyahu, maintaining a middle ground, or pulling back due to domestic political considerations. Trump's unpredictability is sometimes viewed as strategic, with some advisers supporting a "maximum pressure" approach to coerce Iran.
