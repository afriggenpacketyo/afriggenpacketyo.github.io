          <p>This article discusses how women in South Korea, who played a significant role in the protests leading to the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, feel invisible again as the country prepares to elect a new president. The two main candidates have been largely silent about equality for women, and a third candidate with anti-feminist views is gaining popularity among young men. Many young women feel that their voices are being erased and that their concerns are not being reflected in the campaign pledges. They express disappointment with the lack of focus on improving structural discrimination against women in South Korean society, which ranks near the bottom on gender equality among developed countries. The anti-feminist sentiment among young men, fueled by a sense of reverse discrimination, further marginalizes women's issues in the political landscape.</p>

          <p>This article details how AVZ Minerals has paused its legal action against the Democratic Republic of Congo following encouragement from the US government, as the US seeks to challenge China's dominance in securing critical minerals. The US is backing KoBold Metals, a start-up funded by tech billionaires, to acquire AVZ's stake in the Manono lithium project. This move is intended to counter China's Zijin Mining, which controls the northern section of the project after Congo revoked AVZ's rights in 2023. The US government's involvement highlights Washington's increasing efforts to secure critical minerals in Congo, directly challenging China's influence in the region for resources vital to the green energy transition.</p>

Trump stated he would announce a new nominee who is "mission aligned" and will prioritize America in space. Isaacman, a billionaire private astronaut and ally of Elon Musk, expressed gratitude for the opportunity and support he received. The decision follows Musk's recent departure from his role as a special government employee leading the department of government efficiency, and it has sparked disappointment from Musk, who praised Isaacman's competence and character. One potential replacement being considered is retired US Air Force Lt Gen Steven Kwast, an early advocate for the US Space Force.</p>

The investigation, covered extensively by "48 Hours", details the circumstantial evidence against Chandler, including her history of stalking Sisco, inconsistent alibis, and recorded conversations where she expressed violent thoughts. Chandler maintained her innocence throughout, and her initial conviction was overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct.

California has lost roughly 40,000 film and TV jobs, and television production in the Los Angeles area has significantly decreased. The industry is moving to other states and countries that offer generous tax incentives, leading to a "triage situation" in California. Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to more than double the state's film and TV tax credits, but it remains uncertain whether this will be enough to offset the high costs of working in California.</p>
