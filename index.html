          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted by the government of Qatar, intending to retrofit it for use as the new Air Force One. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accepted the plane, valued at $400 million, amid concerns about bribery and national security risks. Experts estimate that converting the 13-year-old jet could cost over $1 billion and take years, potentially delaying the project further. Despite criticism, Trump defended the donation, stating it would be "stupid" to refuse a free jet, while Boeing continues to work on the original Air Force One conversion project.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a downturn after Target reported weaker-than-expected sales for the first quarter, citing declining consumer confidence and uncertainty related to U.S. tariffs. Target's sales fell by 2.8%, leading to a drop in its stock price and contributing to broader market declines, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Complex, and Nasdaq Composite all experiencing losses. Investors are also concerned about the potential impact of a Republican-backed tax and spending bill on the nation's finances, especially after Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, which has raised borrowing costs.

This decision contrasts with the Episcopal Church's choice to end its refugee resettlement partnership with the U.S. government rather than resettle Afrikaners.

This comparison highlights the president's selective application of principles related to property rights and government power.

          <p>A Trump loyalist leading the Justice Department's "weaponization" group plans to expose and discredit individuals deemed guilty, even without sufficient evidence for prosecution. Ed Martin, the self-described "captain" of the group, intends to name and shame targets, potentially violating ethical guidelines and procedural rules that mandate fair, evenhanded investigations. This approach marks a departure from traditional prosecutorial norms, which emphasize charging crimes, not people, and has raised concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration defended its deportation of eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records, claiming the flight's final destination was not necessarily South Sudan, despite lawyers' allegations. A federal judge deemed the attempted removals as a violation of a court order, but the administration maintained that due process was followed. Officials cited safety and operational concerns for not disclosing the flight's destination, while criticizing the judge's ruling. The controversy highlights the administration's push to deport migrants to third countries, even those with safety concerns.</p>

          <p>A Noise Within in Pasadena is presenting a revival of "A Man of No Importance," a musical based on the 1994 film about a Dublin bus conductor with a passion for Oscar Wilde. The musical, with a book by Terrence McNally and music by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, explores the life of Alfie Byrne, who attempts to stage Wilde's "Salome" with his amateur troupe. The production is praised for its simplicity, touching character portrayals, and ability to lift the spirits of everyday people through art.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed a bill that could exempt tip income from federal taxes, a move supported by both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. The bill, if enacted, would allow workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, requiring that tips be reported to qualify for the deduction. While proponents argue it would provide relief to hard-working Americans, analysts suggest it would primarily benefit moderate to middle-income workers in tipped occupations, such as those in restaurants, hotels, and courier services.

          <p>The UK is expected to experience downpours and thunderstorms, typical for spring, with a very low risk of tornadoes.

The showers and thunderstorms are expected to diminish during the evening, with drier conditions on Thursday and Friday. The weekend forecast includes cloudy skies, patchy rain, and strong winds, with Sunday offering a mixture of sunshine and showers, feeling cooler in the north and west but warmer in the south and east.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax cuts are heightening concerns about debt and deficits among bond investors, who influence interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5% due to these worries, impacting borrowing costs for households and businesses. Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern that volatility in the Treasury market could increase economic uncertainty. The president's tariff policies and the proposed tax bill are contributing to investor unease, with some suggesting a larger spike in yields may be needed to influence Washington decision-makers.</p>

          <p>California public school enrollment has declined for the seventh straight year and the number of students from low-income and homeless families has increased as many school districts throughout the state face financial pressures to downsize.  Statewide, perhaps the most stark figure is a comparison between enrollment in 12th grade â€” 488,295 students â€” and in 1st grade â€” 384,822. Thatâ€™s a more than 20% difference between the size of the class leaving school and the size of the class beginning its trek through the public school system. One encouraging note is the growing number of students in transitional kindergarten, a new grade that serves 4-year-olds.</p>

          <p>The UK rate of inflation rose by 3.5% in the year to April, a much bigger increase than expected. The jump was mostly fuelled by rises in household bills such as gas, electricity and, in particular, water. The minimum wage and some benefits were increased last month, but for many it does not cover their day-to-day costs. People have contacted the BBC through Your Voice, Your BBC News or spoken to us about the rising cost of living and how they are dealing with it.</p>
