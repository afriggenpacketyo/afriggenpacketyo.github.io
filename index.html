The article notes that Gauff will now compete against Aryna Sabalenka or Elina Svitolina for the title, marking a significant victory in her tennis career. Gauff attributed her success to aggressive play and capitalizing on what she perceived as Swiatek's less-than-optimal performance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and deport Venezuelan migrants in southern Texas. Judge Fernando Rodriguez, appointed by President Trump, stated that the administration's invocation of the AEA exceeded the statute's scope. The article clarifies that the ruling does not prevent the government from pursuing removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act, but specifically prohibits using the AEA to target Venezuelan migrants in the Southern District of Texas. The decision marks a setback for President Trump's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Chris Krebs, former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), had his Global Entry membership revoked after facing criticism from President Trump for defending the integrity of the 2020 election. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Krebs is under active investigation by law enforcement agencies, disqualifying him from the program. Krebs was fired in 2020 after refuting Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud, and the administration has since targeted him with investigations and revoked security clearances. The article also mentions similar actions taken against other Trump critics, including Miles Taylor, Kamala Harris, and Hillary Clinton.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has criticized AI startup Anthropic's claims regarding Chinese smuggling tactics used to circumvent U.S. chip export restrictions. Anthropic had argued for tighter controls, suggesting chips were being smuggled in "prosthetic baby bumps" and with live lobsters. Nvidia responded that American firms should focus on innovation instead of spreading "tall tales." The restrictions, known as the "AI Diffusion Rule," aim to prevent China from advancing in AI technology, with President Trump considering updates to the policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses a shift in public perception regarding Harvey Weinstein, with figures like Candace Owens and Joe Rogan questioning his guilt amidst a broader anti-Me Too movement backlash. Owens is producing a series of interviews with Weinstein aiming to exonerate him, while Rogan claims to have changed his mind about Weinstein's guilt after reviewing the case. The article argues this support signals a regression in how society understands sexual violence, despite the Me Too movement's initial success in challenging myths surrounding sexual assault. The article highlights that many of the women who accused Weinstein maintained friendly relationships after their attacks, which is extremely common among victims of sexual violence.</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Public Safety is treating the incident where a fan fell from the stands at PNC Park during a Pirates-Cubs game as accidental. The man, who fell 20 feet over the Clemente Wall, remains in critical condition. The incident occurred after an RBI double by Andrew McCutchen, and the game was delayed for about 10 minutes. Pirates Chairman Bob Nutting released a statement expressing sadness and support for the injured fan, while players and managers also shared their reactions.</p>

Critics argue the decision jeopardizes the preparation of new mental health professionals and undermines student well-being. The Department of Education asserts the funds were used to implement race-based actions unrelated to mental health.</p>

The plan would offer two repayment options: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years or an income-driven repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP). Under RAP, monthly payments would be a percentage of a borrower's income, ranging from 1% to 10%.

          <p>President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to a minimum of 145 percent is beginning to disrupt trade, with fewer ships arriving at American ports. Experts predict that consumers may soon see empty shelves and higher prices, potentially leading to a recession. The elimination of the "de minimis" treatment for Chinese goods is also expected to raise prices. Some companies are already halting expansion plans due to uncertainty, and economists suggest that a significant reversal of tariffs is needed to avoid major economic consequences.</p>
