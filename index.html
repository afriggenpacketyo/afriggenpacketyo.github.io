          <p>The UK Home Secretary plans to ban Palestine Action, designating it as a terrorist organization following a security breach at RAF Brize Norton. Pro-Palestinian activists broke into the base, spraying red paint on military planes, which prompted condemnation from Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The decision to proscribe the group will make membership illegal and necessitate new legislation. A security review is now underway at military bases across the UK in response to the incident, highlighting concerns about base security.</p>

          <p>CBS News examines how much a $100,000 annuity would pay a 65-year-old retiree, noting that while it won't cover all expenses, it can supplement retirement income. Factors influencing the payout include gender, the interest rate environment, the type of annuity, and optional features like cost-of-living adjustments. Men typically receive higher monthly payments due to actuarial tables indicating shorter life expectancies, and higher interest rates at the time of purchase result in larger payments. Immediate fixed annuities offer the same amount each month, providing predictability and peace of mind for those concerned about market swings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with limited access and geofenced areas. The initial rides will be in the Model Y, not the CyberCab, and remote drivers will monitor the vehicles. Elon Musk has long promised a driverless robotaxi, and analysts believe this service could significantly increase Tesla's market capitalization. The service is expected to launch with 10 vehicles circulating Austin, with plans for expansion to Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>

          <p>Nancy Pexton has been charged with the murder of her 69-year-old sister, Jennifer Abbott, who was found stabbed in her London home. Abbott was discovered by her niece and neighbors after family members had not heard from her for several days. A post-mortem examination revealed the cause of death as sharp force trauma. Police are investigating whether the murder is linked to a diamond-encrusted Rolex watch that was missing from Abbott's residence.</p>
