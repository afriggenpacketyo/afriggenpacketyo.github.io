          <p>Mazyar Azarbonyad, a 20-year-old personal trainer, has been sentenced to 14 months in a young offender institution after causing a pile-up of police cars on the A1 near Newcastle. Azarbonyad, who was driving home from a first date, reached speeds of up to 120 mph while fleeing from officers who had noticed a defective rear light on his BMW. Seven officers were injured and five police cars were damaged in the crash, which occurred after Azarbonyad slammed on his brakes, causing the pursuing police vehicles to collide. The judge called it a miracle that there were not multiple fatalities, given Azarbonyad's reckless driving and lack of a valid license. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union member states are expected to vote on restricting Chinese medical device manufacturers' access to the bloc's procurement markets. This action comes in response to China's refusal to open its own tenders to EU firms, marking the first use of the bloc's international procurement instrument (IPI). The European Commission investigation revealed that China unfairly limits access for EU medical device producers to its government contracts, specifically through "Buy China" policies. The EU probe noted that devices were among the 10 designated under the Made in China 2025 program, with targets for domestically produced products to account for half of all those used in county hospitals by 2020, 70 per cent by 2025 and 90 per cent by 2030. </p>

Scientists at The Two Frontiers Project are partnering with homeowners to collect samples from showerheads, dishwashers, and hot water heaters. They aim to identify extremophiles, microorganisms that thrive in unusual environments, for their potential to capture carbon or clean up hazardous waste. While reducing emissions remains the primary focus, the researchers believe these microbial discoveries could contribute to mitigating climate change. </p>

          <p>Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols has proposed a $100 million private trust to provide scholarships and housing assistance to descendants of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. The plan, framed as a "road to repair" rather than reparations, aims to revitalize the Greenwood district, which was destroyed by a white mob. The private charitable trust would be created with a goal to secure $105m in assets, with most of the funding either secured or committed by 1 June 2026. Nichols said the proposal wouldn’t require city council approval, although the council would need to authorize the transfer of any city property to the trust, something he said was highly likely. </p>

The defense plans include building 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines, boosting the manufacturing of drones, missiles, and munitions, and bolstering cyber warfare capabilities. The U.K.'s defense spending is set to rise to 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2027, with an "ambition" to increase that to 3% of GDP by 2034, contingent on economic and fiscal conditions. NATO wants its 32 members to commit to spending 5% of GDP on defense and security-related infrastructure by 2032 and is set to push for that target when it next meets on June 24-25.</p>

The study also suggests that perpetrators are drawing inspiration from anti-immigrant rhetoric.
