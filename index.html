          <p>Reports indicate the FBI is contemplating a "showy" arrest and perp walk for its former director, James Comey, following his indictment on charges of lying to Congress. This unusual plan for a white-collar defendant has reportedly caused internal friction, leading to the suspension of an agent who refused to participate. The move is viewed as a significant escalation in the long-standing feud between Comey and President Trump, who has publicly pressured the Attorney General to investigate his former adversary.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on a railway station in Shostka, Ukraine, has injured at least 30 people in an attack President Zelenskyy described as "savage terrorism." This incident is part of a broader Russian campaign targeting Ukraine's rail and power infrastructure ahead of winter. In response, Ukraine has continued its own drone attacks, reportedly hitting one of Russia's largest oil refineries near St. Petersburg and contributing to domestic fuel shortages. The conflict also recently claimed the life of a French photojournalist covering events on the front lines.</p>

          <p>China's military has revealed details of an incident from last year where a Chinese J-16 fighter jet intercepted and expelled two foreign stealth fighter jets over coastal waters. The pilot, Li, described performing aggressive maneuvers, including a barrel roll that brought him within 15 meters of one of the foreign aircraft. After these actions, he reportedly locked onto both jets with his targeting systems, prompting them to leave the area. The nationality of the foreign aircraft was not disclosed.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has postponed the swearing-in of Adelita Grijalva, a newly elected Democrat from Arizona, preventing her from taking office. Grijalva suggests the delay may be politically motivated, as her signature would be the final one needed on a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. A spokesperson for Johnson stated that Grijalva will be sworn in once the House returns to full session, which he claims is contingent on Senate Democrats allowing the government to reopen.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Highlights Alarming Rise in 'Pregnancy-Related Crimes' in Post-Roe America</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article raises concerns about the increasing prosecution of "pregnancy-related crimes" in the United States following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Citing research from Pregnancy Justice, the piece notes that hundreds of people, mostly low-income women, have been charged for actions like substance use during pregnancy. The author argues this trend reflects a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," leading to greater surveillance of pregnant individuals and potentially criminalizing a wide range of behaviors, drawing parallels to the aggressive policing of pregnancy in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's recent Supreme Court dissents argues she is issuing a stark warning about threats to the rule of law in the United States. The article highlights her writings, particularly a footnote in a case related to presidential power that cited a book on the legal structure of Nazi Germany, as an alarm bell. Despite facing criticism from the court's conservative majority, Jackson has become a prolific dissenter, using her opinions to challenge rulings she views as undermining America's democratic foundations and enabling unchecked executive authority.</p>

Her oncologist emphasized that the early detection was critical, as the five-year survival rate for her cancer is 99% at this stage but drops significantly if it spreads.

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that the UK will leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if the Tories win the next election. The decision follows a party legal review which concluded that remaining in the ECHR obstructs migration reform and harms military veterans. This major policy shift, announced on the eve of the party conference, aims to address pressure from the right-wing Reform UK party and has been criticized by Labour as a sign of weakness.</p>

          <p>A recently ousted high-ranking CDC official has raised alarms about the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., describing his approach as a "hostile takeover" of the agency. The former official, Debra Houry, claims Kennedy has avoided meetings with scientific experts, even during deadly disease outbreaks, while pushing for unprecedented changes to the childhood immunization schedule. This account adds to growing concerns that the administration is dismantling public health institutions and shunning scientific expertise.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics and writers are championing speculative and science fiction as a key tool for cultural soft power, aiming to offer alternative future visions to those dominated by Western narratives. At a recent conference, scholars argued that Western sci-fi often projects a bleak, dystopian future rooted in capitalist ideology. In contrast, they suggest that Chinese speculative fiction can present different possibilities and critiques of the present, staking a claim on how the future is imagined globally.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk's assassination, many Black, brown, and queer college students are expressing unease over his posthumous deification and the subsequent impact on campus environments. Students report feeling unfairly blamed for his death and are concerned about a rise in racist threats, disciplinary actions against those not mourning, and increased censorship. They worry the valorization of Kirk, whose rhetoric they found hateful, is being used to suppress dissenting views and justify a crackdown on free speech.</p>

          <p>A new progressive party in the UK, co-led by former Labour figures Zarah Sultana and Jeremy Corbyn, has been plagued by public infighting just as it began signing up members. A dispute over an "unauthorized" membership email led to public recriminations, with Sultana alleging a "sexist boys' club" and Corbyn's allies effectively shunning her. This internal chaos, combined with the UK's challenging first-past-the-post electoral system, raises serious questions about the party's viability and whether it will split the left-wing vote, potentially aiding right-wing rivals.</p>

          <p>Director Lou Ye's new film, "An Unfinished Film," has garnered international acclaim for its portrayal of a film crew quarantined near Wuhan during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review praises the film's courage in depicting sensitive events like anti-lockdown protests, which are censored in China. However, it also critiques the movie for its silence on the mass casualties that followed the abrupt end of "zero-COVID," arguing that it serves as an essential but incomplete processing of collective trauma, reflecting a broader societal reluctance to confront the pandemic's full toll.</p>

Bethan Roper, 28, was killed when her head struck a tree branch after she leaned out of a droplight window on a moving train. The rail regulator found that GWR was aware of the risks associated with these windows and had failed to implement safety measures identified in a risk assessment prior to the incident.
