          <p>Former President Trump has renewed his criticism of Harvard University's international student enrollment following a judge's decision to block the administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. Trump claimed that some of these students come from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and contribute nothing to their education, further stating that his administration wants to know the identities of these students. This attack follows a federal judge's temporary restraining order against the revocation, which Harvard argued was a First Amendment violation aimed at controlling the university's governance and ideology. International students comprise about 27% of Harvard's student body and are typically ineligible for federal financial aid.</p>

The crash occurred when a Cessna 550, en route to Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, went down in a residential area, causing multiple fires and leaving a significant debris field. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, noting a power surge at the airport that disabled the weather system and runway lights at the time of the accident.</p>

Max Verstappen, who had a disadvantage due to limited tire sets, finished fourth after Red Bull's strategy of delaying his final pit stop in hopes of a safety car intervention did not materialize. The race was relatively straightforward for the leaders, with only an early virtual safety car intervention after a crash for Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto.</p>

He argued that the bill will stimulate the economy by raising wages, incentivizing job creators, and promoting U.S. manufacturing, although Republican senators have expressed reservations about the soaring deficits and signaled plans to modify the bill.</p>

The Trump family and its business partners have amassed significant wealth through ventures such as a new cryptocurrency, overseas real estate deals, and an exclusive club in Washington. The acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar for the president's use has further fueled criticism, raising questions about the influence of foreign entities. Despite growing concerns, the administration has defended these actions, asserting that the president is abiding by applicable conflict of interest laws and that his prior success negates any suggestion of profiting from the presidency.</p>

          <p>Canada's invitation to King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament is being interpreted as a statement of sovereignty and independence against threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney's move is seen as a way to emphasize Canada's unique traditions and separation from the U.S., amid Trump's suggestions that Canada would be better off as a U.S. state. The visit also aims to strengthen ties with Europe and improve relations with Trump, who is known to admire the British monarchy; the King's visit will be his first to Canada as reigning monarch and is expected to include a throne speech marking a significant moment between the Head of State and the Canadian people.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Anne Tyler discusses her motivation for writing, which stems from a "selfish motive" to explore the lives of others and understand different perspectives. She emphasizes the importance of creating believable lies in her novels, allowing readers to experience another person's reality. Tyler, known for her Baltimore-based stories, also shares insights into her writing process, including her reliance on a "blue box" filled with overheard conversations and ideas, and discusses her latest book, "Three Days in June," highlighting the beauty in the acceptance people have over their own lives. Despite her success, Tyler expresses humility and a desire to keep writing, even if it means rewriting her next book indefinitely.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, resulted in the deaths of at least seven children of a local doctor, Alaa al-Najjar, with two more children missing and presumed dead, and her husband in critical condition. The Israeli military stated that it had struck a number of suspects in a structure near Israeli forces in Khan Younis but was checking if "uninvolved civilians were harmed." The Najjar family had remained in their home despite evacuation orders, feeling that they could not move their ten children into a crowded tent camp without adequate services; the incident has drawn attention to the rising civilian toll in Gaza amid renewed fighting between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, experts are questioning the current guidelines for prostate cancer screening, particularly for men over the age of 70. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 55 to 69 discuss the potential benefits and risks of PSA screening with their healthcare provider, but advises against screening for men over 70. Some medical professionals argue that this recommendation is flawed, citing the importance of early diagnosis and advancements in treatment options that minimize side effects; they suggest that men over 45 should have the screening regardless of age, as some men aged 70 and older are appropriate candidates for screening.</p>

          <p>The Labour government cannot promise cheaper train tickets despite renationalizing South Western Railway (SWR), with Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stating that the focus will be on improving services and infrastructure. While Alexander expressed a desire to lower fares, she noted that day-to-day train operations are already heavily subsidized by taxpayers. The Conservative Party criticized Labour for not delivering on promises of lower ticket prices, while members of the public questioned the purpose of renationalizing train operators if prices remain high. The government plans to renationalize nearly all passenger rail services in England by 2027.</p>
