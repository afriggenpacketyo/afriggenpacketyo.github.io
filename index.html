          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to resume trade negotiations amid escalating tariffs. The meetings, the first since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports, aim to de-escalate trade hostilities and prevent a global economic downturn. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, the fact that both sides are engaging in talks raises hopes for a potential reduction in tariffs. The negotiations are closely watched by economists and investors concerned about the impact of the U.S.-Chinese economic war on global growth and prices.</p>

          <p>China's strategic export controls on rare earth elements, essential for manufacturing military equipment, have sparked anxiety in the U.S. defense industry. These restrictions, implemented in retaliation for increased U.S. tariffs, impact the production of critical components for jet engines, radar, and electronic systems. China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, accounts for 90% of the global supply. The export controls have placed seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths on an export control list, raising concerns about the vulnerability of U.S. weapons production.</p>

          <p>The family of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, who was deported to Honduras with her mother, has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration. The family's attorney stated that they are taking a step back to fully discuss their options and ensure the safety and well-being of their children. A federal judge previously expressed suspicion that the administration deported the child without due process. The Department of Justice argued that it was in the minor's best interest to remain in her mother's custody, given that she is a U.S. citizen.</p>

          <p>The US and China have commenced tariff talks in Switzerland, signaling a potential easing of the trade war. Despite previous rhetoric, both sides have incentives to break the deadlock, with the tariffs hurting both economies. Factory output in China has taken a hit, while the US economy contracted due to tariff-related uncertainty. Both countries are feeling pressure to reassure increasingly nervous markets and domestic constituencies. The timing coincides with Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, projecting China's strength and alternative global leadership.</p>

          <p>The German government will cease publicly reporting details of military aid to Ukraine, Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced during a visit to Kyiv. This decision aims to achieve "strategic ambiguity" and prevent Russia from gaining strategic advantages. While Germany will reduce transparency, its commitment to supporting Ukraine in the fight against Russia's invasion remains unchanged. Germany will continue to expand its financial support to Ukraine.</p>
