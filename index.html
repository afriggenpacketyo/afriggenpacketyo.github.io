          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. The blockade was due to concerns over a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports by 2028, but Slovakia has now received guarantees regarding its future gas prices and supply security. The new sanctions, which require unanimous approval from all 27 member states, target Russia's energy and banking sectors. This includes a prohibition on using the Nordstream pipelines and a reduction in the oil price cap.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man, Raymond Boodarian, has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of residential burglary for the killings of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple was found shot multiple times in their Encino home after returning from the grocery store, with the discovery made during a welfare check four days later. Investigators used security footage and facial recognition to identify Boodarian, who was allegedly already inside the house when the couple arrived. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office will later decide whether to pursue the death penalty in this case.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is advancing a bill to rescind approximately $9 billion in government spending, a move requested by President Trump. The package, which narrowly passed the Senate, targets foreign aid programs and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. However, its progress in the House has been complicated by Democratic efforts to attach amendments related to the release of Jeffrey Epstein files, creating procedural hurdles. The House faces a tight deadline to pass the legislation, after which the funds must be spent as originally allocated.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common circulatory condition, after he experienced mild swelling in his legs. According to his physician, the condition is considered benign and affects the veins' ability to return blood from the legs to the heart, sometimes causing swelling or varicose veins. The White House press secretary stated the president remains in "excellent health," and treatment for CVI typically involves non-surgical methods like compression stockings and exercise. The diagnosis helps explain recent public speculation about the president's health.</p>

          <p>Air travel in the U.S. is experiencing a significant increase in disruptions this summer compared to the previous year, with the national flight cancellation rate up by 29%. Data analysis shows that while fewer flights were scheduled, a higher number have been canceled, and delays have become more frequent and longer. Airports on the East Coast have been hit particularly hard, with Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport seeing a 274% rise in its cancellation rate. In contrast, some airports, including Miami International and San Francisco International, have seen improved performance with fewer cancellations.</p>

          <p>In the Republican race for Georgia governor, Attorney General Chris Carr's campaign is questioning the legality of a $10 million loan made by his rival, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, to his own leadership committee. Carr's campaign has asked the state ethics commission for an advisory opinion, arguing that such loans are only permissible for candidate committees, not leadership committees which can raise unlimited funds. The move highlights the contentious nature of the primary and concerns that Jones is using his personal wealth and the committee structure to gain an unfair advantage.

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the "unlawful" termination of a key FEMA program for pre-disaster mitigation. The suit argues that the executive branch overstepped its authority by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a power that belongs to Congress. The states claim the move jeopardizes critical infrastructure projects designed to protect communities from natural disasters and disproportionately affects vulnerable areas.

          <p>Legal experts are expressing growing concern over the U.S. Supreme Court's frequent use of its "shadow docket" to issue emergency rulings with little or no explanation. This practice has become more prominent in cases involving the Trump administration, allowing major policies, such as the dismantling of the Department of Education, to proceed before their legality is fully litigated. Critics argue that this lack of reasoning undermines the court's transparency and legitimacy, creating an impression of politically motivated decisions rather than principled legal analysis.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that his country "deeply regrets" a strike that hit the Holy Family Church in Gaza City, killing three people who were sheltering inside. An initial inquiry by the Israel Defense Forces suggests that fragments from a shell fired during nearby operational activity mistakenly hit the church. The incident, which also injured several others, drew condemnation from Pope Leo XIV and a negative reaction from the White House. Israel has said the event is under review and remains committed to protecting civilians and holy sites.</p>

          <p>Mexican pop star Belinda has revealed that she made a costly deal with Disney to use a sample from the 1970 film "The Aristocats" in her recent song, "Heterocomía." While she doesn't expect to see much financial return from the track, she stated the catharsis was worth the price. The song, which features lyrics widely speculated to be about her past relationship with a billionaire heir, uses the whimsical intro to contrast with a darker story of deception. The track and its accompanying TikTok video have gone viral, with fans connecting the song's title and lyrics to her ex-partner's distinct eye condition.</p>

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that President Trump would not recommend the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case. This statement comes as the president dismisses the controversy surrounding his administration's handling of the matter as a "hoax" and criticizes Republicans who are calling for more transparency. The administration's stance has frustrated some of Trump's own supporters, who have been demanding the full release of government files related to the late convicted sex offender. The president has asserted that the interest in the case is a politically motivated effort constructed by Democrats.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to redraw his state's congressional districts in a bid to help Democrats, framing it as a direct response to a Republican plan to do the same in Texas. While Texas Republicans aim to add seats for their party at Donald Trump's request, Newsom is exploring ways to bypass California's independent redistricting commission, a body created by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The controversial proposal has been criticized by good-government groups as undermining the democratic process, even as Newsom argues that Democrats must play by the same "hardball" rules as Republicans.</p>

          <p>Netflix reported strong second-quarter financial results, beating analyst expectations with a 16% year-over-year increase in revenue to $11.08 billion. The company also raised its full-year revenue forecast, citing healthy membership growth, advertising sales, and favorable currency exchange rates. This marks the second quarter that Netflix has not released specific subscriber numbers, instead focusing on financial metrics like revenue and operating margin. Despite the positive results, the company warned of lower margins in the second half of the year due to higher costs, causing a slight dip in its stock price in after-hours trading.

          <p>Universities like Columbia and Harvard are implementing new initiatives to combat anti-Semitism on campus that closely mirror the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) frameworks of the past decade. These measures, which include new administrative roles and the adoption of specific definitions of anti-Semitism, are being created under pressure from the Trump administration. Critics argue this approach is ironic, as the administration is simultaneously working to dismantle DEI programs elsewhere. Concerns are being raised that these new bureaucracies may prove ineffective or lead to speech policing, repeating the perceived overreach of previous DEI efforts.</p>

That game became a major source of confidence, propelling him into a dominant second season where he has become a cornerstone of the team's rotation.
