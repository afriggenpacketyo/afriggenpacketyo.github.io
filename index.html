            <p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has presented DHS employees with voluntary options to leave the department, including buyouts up to $25,000. The "workforce transition program" encompasses deferred resignation, early retirement, and voluntary separation incentives. This initiative aims to provide flexibility for employees considering a change, with law enforcement officers generally exempt. Individual agencies are providing guidance on program applicability, and employees have until April 14, 2025, to apply, as the DHS intends to reshape its workforce.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong's stock index experienced a rise of 1.7% at the open, mirroring gains in Shanghai and Shenzhen, after Chinese state funds intervened to stabilize the market amidst a global sell-off.

The move comes as markets grapple with the economic fallout from reciprocal tariffs, with Central Huijin affirming its positive outlook on A shares.</p>

            <p>As the United States engages in a global trade war under President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs, Europe and China are increasing their engagement, offering a potential contingency plan for an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship. Despite past turmoil in Sino-European relations, a softening tone from European leaders and increased diplomatic visits to Beijing suggest a shift. Hong Kong can serve as a gateway between the world and mainland China, playing a role in this evolving dynamic, especially given the reciprocal tariffs that contradict comparative advantage in trade, prioritizing political strategy over economics.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 6-4 defeat to the Washington Nationals, marking their third loss in four games, primarily due to defensive miscues. Errors in the field led to unearned runs, while stellar defense from the Nationals prevented potential Dodgers rallies. Despite Shohei Ohtani's near-cycle performance, the Dodgers' inability to execute fundamental defensive plays proved costly, highlighting a growing concern in the early season after defensive struggles also contributed to a series defeat against the Philadelphia Phillies.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled 5-4 that the Trump administration can continue using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for rapid deportations of alleged gang members, but with the stipulation that deportees must be given an opportunity to challenge their removal. While the ruling is a win for the administration, it clarifies that deportees must be given an opportunity to challenge their removal. The court specified that challenges must be raised in Texas, where the migrants are confined, and not in Washington D.C., and conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett dissented with the court's three liberal justices.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, present during the announcement, reiterated the shared goal of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, suggesting a diplomatic resolution similar to the Libyan model would be ideal.</p>

            <p>With Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs looming, the world's economy faces uncertainty as nations react differently to the US president's high-stakes game of chicken. While some countries are attempting to negotiate and appease the White House, China has responded with retaliation. Trump's actions have caused market swings and concerns among allies, leading to questions about whether this is a negotiating tactic or a long-term strategy to restructure the global economy. The president remains committed to the tariffs, dismissing concerns and pushing ahead despite the economic turmoil.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use a wartime law to deport alleged members of a foreign crime gang, provided they are given the right to challenge the government's claim. By a 5-4 vote, the court set aside orders from lower courts, stating that appeals must be made in Texas, where the detainees are held. The court's majority emphasized that the detainees must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal, while dissenting justices expressed concerns about the government's conduct and the rule of law.</p>

            <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The administrative stay grants the Supreme Court more time to consider the matter. Abrego Garcia's deportation sparked outrage after the administration admitted it was an "administrative error," as a protective order should have prevented him from being sent to El Salvador, a country where he faced potential persecution.</p>

            <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has redeployed staff to address the measles outbreak in Texas, following recent layoffs. This comes after another unvaccinated child died from a measles-related illness. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that the CDC would be redeploying at the governor's request. The outbreak has driven U.S. measles cases to the highest levels since 2019, threatening the country's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus, with Kennedy also stating the "most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine."</p>

Ortega stated that the departure of Barrera and director Christopher Landon made the project unsuitable for her at the time. Kevin Williamson, the original screenwriter, will now direct "Scream VII" and Neve Campbell will return as Sidney Prescott. The decision to leave was based on the changes within the production team, impacting her career considerations.</p>

            <p>Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has stated that President Trump's extension of the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's US assets may violate the law. Warner also expressed concerns that the proposed deal would not sufficiently eliminate ByteDance's influence over TikTok's US operations, as required by a 2024 law. The reported deal involves spinning off TikTok's US operations into a new company majority-owned and operated by US investors.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's global trade war, marked by "Liberation Day" reciprocal tariffs, is a daring move with uncertain consequences. Despite Trump's campaign promises to impose tariffs on China, the extent of the new tariffs caught financial markets off guard. These actions are aimed at pulling the US back from decline, but the long-term effects remain to be seen. The president is willing to take the pain, despite many economists believing that tariffs are outdated and ineffective in an era of globalization.</p>
