          <h2>Astronomers Witness Earliest Stages of Rocky Planet Formation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 04:11:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using the James Webb and ALMA telescopes, astronomers have observed the earliest known signs of rocky planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,370 light-years away. The discovery provides a direct glimpse into a process similar to how Earth may have formed over 4.5 billion years ago, detecting silicate minerals condensing in the star's gas disk. This breakthrough suggests that the initial steps of planet formation could be a common occurrence in the universe. The findings, published in Nature, offer new opportunities to study how frequently Earth-like worlds might develop.</p>

          <p>The mother of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern fatally shot in Washington D.C., is urging police to apprehend the suspects, warning that such violence could affect any family. Tarpinian-Jachym was an unintended victim in a shooting on June 30, where individuals in a vehicle opened fire on a group of people. The FBI has joined the investigation, but no suspects are in custody for the murder, which occurred just a mile from the White House. His mother described him as a kind and compassionate young man who loved the city.</p>

          <p>South Africa is intensifying efforts to increase its exports to China as it faces a new 30% U.S. tariff set to begin on August 1. A high-level delegation visited Beijing to attract investment and diversify exports beyond commodities to higher-value products like pharmaceuticals and green energy technologies. Deputy President Paul Mashatile highlighted a significant trade deficit with China, which reached $9.71 billion in 2023, and stressed the need for a more balanced relationship. Observers note that while China is a crucial alternative market, it presents its own complexities and risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 14 people have been killed and 12 are missing in South Korea following relentless heavy rains that have battered the country's southern regions since Wednesday. The downpours triggered landslides and flash floods, destroying homes and forcing over 3,800 people to evacuate. The town of Sancheong was particularly hard-hit, with eight fatalities reported due to landslides. While the rain has subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted, the event highlights the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather, which scientists link to climate change.</p>

Pacquiao, who showed flashes of his former speed, believed he won the fight and expressed interest in a rematch.

She claimed she was attempting to "fan fire" the revolver like a cowboy when it discharged twice, killing him. After an initial mistrial, a second jury found her guilty, leading to a sentence of 40 years to life in prison.</p>

          <p>In a notable case of technology influencing a criminal investigation, a Wisconsin man was exonerated in his girlfriend's 2016 murder thanks to data from his Fitbit. Doug Detrie was initially the prime suspect in the death of Nicole Vander Heyden, but his fitness tracker data corroborated his alibi that he was home and mostly inactive when she was killed. Investigators then used DNA evidence and Google Dashboard location data from another man's phone to identify and charge George Steven Burch.

This moral relativism, personified by figures like Donald Trump, cripples peacemaking efforts and allows atrocities to continue.

          <h2>U.S. to Implement New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' for Most Visitors</h2>

          <p>The United States will soon require visitors needing nonimmigrant visas to pay a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and applies to tourists, business travelers, and international students. The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying. However, details on implementation are scarce, and experts advise travelers to treat the fee as nonrefundable due to the expected complexity of the reimbursement process. (not investment advice)</p>
