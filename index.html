          <p>Candy manufacturer Mars has announced a partnership with biotechnology company Pairwise to use CRISPR gene-editing technology to develop more sustainable and resilient cocoa plants. The collaboration aims to create cacao varieties that can better withstand diseases, heat, and other climate-related pressures that threaten the global chocolate supply. This move reflects a growing trend in the food industry to leverage biotechnology for supply chain security, similar to Starbucks' investment in climate-resilient coffee farms. The partnership will utilize Pairwise's Fulcrum platform to accelerate the development of desired crop traits more precisely than traditional breeding methods.</p>

          <p>Student loan borrowers seeking relief through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program are encountering significant new obstacles. A recent executive order from President Trump aims to narrow eligibility, potentially excluding employees of certain non-profit organizations, although the changes are not retroactive. Additionally, the shutdown of the SAVE repayment plan and processing backlogs for switching to other eligible plans have stalled progress for many applicants. Borrowers are also facing long delays with the "Buyback" program, designed to let them retroactively pay for months missed due to forbearance or deferment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking shoe on the shore of Fish Lake, Utah, has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing 28 years ago. Investigators linked the boot, manufactured in 1996, to his cold case from September 1997 when his empty boat was found on the lake. DNA testing confirmed the remains were a parental match to White's daughter with 99.9994% certainty. The discovery brings long-awaited closure to his family and the original search and rescue members who were involved in the case.</p>

The 30-year-old, who is originally from Cuba, signed with the Boston Red Sox as a high-profile international free agent in 2015 before being traded to the Chicago White Sox. Moncada has maintained his Cuban citizenship and even represented Team Cuba in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.

          <p>Investigators in St. Paul, Minnesota, solved the murder of nurse Alexandra Pennig by discovering a small, crucial piece of evidence at the crime scene. Matthew Ecker, Pennig's colleague, claimed she had taken her own life after locking herself in the bathroom, but detectives found a metal ring from the door's lockset underneath her body. This finding suggested the door was forced open before the fatal shot was fired, contradicting Ecker's account. The evidence indicated Ecker broke down the door during an argument and then shot Pennig, leading to his conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year prison sentence.</p>

India was the first to be hit with an additional 25% tariff for its purchase of Russian oil, which could raise prices on U.S. imports like iPhones manufactured there.

          <p>The Italian government has given its final approval for a €13.5 billion project to construct the world's longest suspension bridge, connecting Sicily with the mainland region of Calabria. The 3.3-kilometer bridge is designed to withstand major earthquakes, a key concern for the seismically active region. Proponents, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, champion the project as a major investment that will create jobs and boost the economies of two of Europe's poorest regions. However, the plan faces significant opposition over costs, environmental impact, and fears of mafia infiltration, with legal challenges from local groups potentially causing further delays.</p>

Known for his intelligence on the field and jovial personality, Müller is expected to bring invaluable experience and leadership to a young Vancouver squad. His contract runs through the end of the 2026 MLS season.</p>

          <p>Claire's, the popular tween accessories and ear-piercing retailer, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in seven years. The company is facing approximately $500 million in debt, along with intense competition from newer brands and a difficult retail environment. CEO Chris Cramer called the decision necessary and stated that stores will remain open as the company explores strategic alternatives, which could include finding a buyer to keep the business operating. Claire's previously emerged from bankruptcy in 2018 after eliminating $1.9 billion in debt, but now faces new challenges in a changed market.</p>

          <p>Alternative rock band Rainbow Kitten Surprise has announced their new album, "Bones," will be released on September 26. The 10-track collection is described as a rawer, more direct follow-up to their previous work, with frontwoman Ela Melo calling it a "spill-your-guts-out record." Many of the songs were written quickly and feature lyrics that touch on relationships, substance use, and the singer's own journey with sobriety. The band aimed for a sound that could be easily replicated in their energetic live shows, moving away from the more layered, synth-heavy production of past albums.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old British woman from Stevenage has been given a two-year suspended sentence in Germany for drug trafficking. Cameron Bradford was arrested at Munich airport in April while in transit from Bangkok after customs officials discovered 20kg of marijuana in her suitcase. The court heard that she had been working as an escort and was threatened by her handler, who coerced her into traveling to Thailand to retrieve the suitcase. Bradford told the court she was scared and did not know the contents of the locked case she was instructed to transport.</p>

          <p>The political standoff over Texas redistricting has escalated, with Democratic lawmakers who fled the state reporting a bomb threat at their Illinois hotel. The lawmakers evacuated to block a Republican-led effort to pass a new congressional map, which they argue is a racist gerrymander. This development follows Texas Governor Greg Abbott's emergency petition to the state supreme court to declare the top Democrat's seat vacant. Federal and state Republican leaders have called for the lawmakers to be returned to Texas, while the Democrats maintain they are fulfilling their constitutional duty by not participating in the vote.</p>

          <p>Despite nearly two years of war that has weakened its capabilities, Hamas is still managing to operate a cash-based system to pay salaries to thousands of civil servants in Gaza. Employees have reportedly received partial payments, amounting to just over 20% of their pre-war salaries, every 10 weeks. Amid severe food shortages and soaring inflation, the small payments are causing resentment, and the process of collecting the cash is dangerous due to Israeli strikes on distribution points. A senior Hamas source claimed the group had stockpiled hundreds of millions of dollars in cash before the war began.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted a raid on a Home Depot in Los Angeles, using a rented Penske truck as a disguise to approach and arrest day laborers. In what was dubbed "Operation Trojan Horse," agents jumped out of the back of the truck and chased people, arresting as many as 16 immigrants. The raid has revived fears of widespread immigration sweeps, despite a court order limiting such tactics. Penske Truck Rental stated it was unaware of and did not authorize the use of its vehicle for the operation, which it said violates company policy.</p>
