        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neurologists are cautioning against the consumption of three specific types of food due to potential risks to the nervous system. These include items from damaged or bulging cans, which may harbor the botulinum toxin, and large tropical reef fish like barracuda, which can contain ciguatoxin. Both toxins can cause severe neurological symptoms and are not destroyed by cooking. Additionally, experts advise against eating under-cooked pork from unregulated sources because of the risk of neurocysticercosis, an infection from tapeworm eggs that is a leading cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his nomination of Tammy Bruce, the current State Department spokesperson, to serve as the deputy U.S. representative to the United Nations. If confirmed by the Senate, Bruce, a former Fox News contributor, will hold the rank of ambassador. She would serve under Mike Waltz, who is Trump's nominee for the main U.N. ambassador role, though his confirmation has been stalled. The nomination positions Bruce to assume the duties of the U.N. ambassador in their absence, filling a key diplomatic post.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket tournament, Jonny Bairstow's explosive 86 runs off 50 balls were insufficient as his team, Welsh Fire, lost to London Spirit by eight runs. Despite a late surge from Bairstow, the Fire's early batting collapse proved too much to overcome in their chase of 164. In another match, the Oval Invincibles secured a commanding nine-wicket victory over the Manchester Originals. A powerful 114-run partnership between Will Jacks and Tawanda Muyeye allowed the Invincibles to easily chase down their target of 129, maintaining their perfect record in the competition.</p>

          <p>Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez has completed a transfer from Liverpool to the Saudi Pro League team Al-Hilal in a deal valued at 53 million euros. Nunez, who joined Liverpool in 2022 for an initial fee of £64 million, signed a three-year contract with the Saudi club. During his time with Liverpool, he scored 40 goals across 143 appearances but saw limited starting time in the Premier League last season. The move marks another high-profile player joining the rapidly growing Saudi Pro League, with Nunez immediately joining his new team for their pre-season training.</p>

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has publicly stated that Ukraine will not concede any territory, pushing back against suggestions that a peace deal might involve land swaps.</p>

          <p>A coalition of approximately 20 countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, has jointly condemned Israel's plan to launch a new military offensive to seize control of Gaza City. In a joint statement, the nations described the move as a "dangerous and unacceptable escalation" and a violation of international law. The plan has also prompted warnings from Israel's own army chief about the potential danger to remaining hostages. Meanwhile, the UK announced an additional £8.5 million in aid for Gaza, demanding that Israel allow more supplies to enter the territory securely.</p>

Masra, a prominent critic of President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, had briefly served as prime minister under a reconciliation deal before running against Deby in the presidential election.

          <p>A historical analysis of Bollywood films reveals a significant shift in the cinematic portrayal of Kashmir, moving from a romantic paradise to a conflict-ridden territory. Early films often used the region as a scenic backdrop for love stories, reflecting a post-independence optimism. However, following the rise of anti-India militancy in the late 1980s, the narrative changed to focus on themes of conflict, patriotism, and terrorism. Recent films like "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370" reflect the current government's political stance, indicating that Hindi cinema's lens on Kashmir continues to be shaped by the prevailing national narrative.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Mark K. Updegrove's book "Incomparable Grace: JFK in the Presidency" provides a detailed account of President John F. Kennedy's political standing and mindset in the days leading up to his assassination in November 1963. The passage describes a strategy meeting for his 1964 reelection campaign, where his team felt optimistic due to a strong economy and high approval ratings. It also recounts the political dynamics in Texas, the purpose of his fateful trip to Dallas, and the chilling moments of the assassination from the perspective of those in the presidential limousine and hospital.</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old suspect is in custody following a shooting in Times Square that left three people injured early Saturday morning. The incident reportedly began with a fight inside a restaurant that spilled onto the street, where gunfire erupted. A 19-year-old man, a 65-year-old man, and an 18-year-old woman were all hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Police recovered a handgun at the scene in the busy tourist area, which is designated as a gun-free zone. The shooting occurs as city crime rates and public safety remain prominent political issues.</p>

          <p>A crew of four astronauts, including two from NASA, one from Japan, and a Russian cosmonaut, has safely returned to Earth after a five-month mission on the International Space Station. Their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego. During their 148 days in orbit, the Crew-10 astronauts conducted numerous scientific experiments and maintenance tasks. This mission marked the first time a NASA-sponsored crew has landed in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure any discarded components fall into a remote ocean area.</p>

          <p>The police officer killed during a shooting near the CDC headquarters in Atlanta has been identified as 33-year-old David Rose. A former Marine and father of two with a third child on the way, Rose had joined the DeKalb County police force less than a year ago. The suspect, Patrick Joseph White, was found dead at the scene after reportedly firing on multiple CDC buildings. Investigators are probing a potential motive linked to the shooter's belief that he was harmed by the COVID-19 vaccine, a theory supported by neighbors' accounts.</p>

          <p>An anti-immigration protest drew hundreds of people to Nuneaton, England, for a march through the town center. The demonstration was organized after a local council leader claimed that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers. While police described the event as mostly peaceful, a 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of making threats. The protest was one of several similar demonstrations that took place across England, highlighting growing tensions around immigration issues in some communities, often linked to local crime concerns.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot in southern Lebanon has killed six Lebanese soldiers. The soldiers were reportedly inspecting the site and dismantling its contents as part of a broader effort to remove unauthorized weapons in the country. The depot was located in the Tyre district near the Israeli border, a region with a heavy Hezbollah presence. The incident occurs as the Lebanese government works to implement a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement that includes disarming the powerful Iran-backed group, a move that Hezbollah and its supporters in Iran have strongly opposed.</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is facing a convergence of severe environmental challenges, including plastic pollution, overfishing, and the impacts of climate change. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report dwindling catches, blaming industrial trawlers and pollution from sewage and plastic waste. In response, regional governments are proposing solutions such as restoring coastal ecosystems and reducing plastic use. However, with rising sea temperatures and international protection commitments yet to be fully realized, local fishermen and activists remain skeptical about whether these efforts will be enough to save their livelihoods and the fragile marine environment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical overview of how partisan gerrymandering has reshaped American politics, focusing on the Republican-led "Redmap" project after the 2010 census. This strategy used sophisticated data and mapping to draw legislative districts that locked in GOP majorities in key states and the U.S. House, even when Democrats won more votes. The analysis traces the subsequent grassroots reform movements and legal challenges, culminating in the 2019 Supreme Court decision that removed federal courts from adjudicating such cases. This ruling has intensified the practice, leading to the current cycle of retaliatory redistricting threats from both parties.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous Soviet-era award to a U.S. envoy, intended for the family of a senior CIA official whose son was killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The award, the Order of Lenin, was for Michael Gloss, the 21-year-old son of CIA deputy director Juliane Gallina. Gloss, who reportedly had mental health issues, had enlisted with Russian forces and was killed last year. This unusual diplomatic gesture occurred during discussions about the Ukraine war and ahead of a planned summit between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Newly filed documents in the New Orleans Roman Catholic archdiocese's bankruptcy case detail a point-based system for compensating survivors of clergy abuse. Under the proposed settlement, claims of sexual assault, such as rape, would be assigned 75 points, while other forms of abuse receive fewer points, with additional points awarded based on life impact. Hundreds of survivors will vote on the settlement, worth up to $235 million, but some attorneys are urging a 'no' vote, arguing for individual lawsuits. The final monetary value of each point remains uncertain until all claims are assessed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James, reportedly ordering her to testify about her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump. James's office successfully sued Trump's organization for fraudulently overvaluing properties, a judgment he is currently appealing. Her office, which has also been subpoenaed regarding its investigation into the NRA, condemned the move as a weaponization of the justice system. Critics of the administration view the subpoena as political retribution, part of a pattern of targeting perceived political enemies of the president.</p>
