          <p>President Trump declared the cessation of U.S. sanctions against Syria, aiming to foster stability and peace in the war-torn nation. Trump highlighted his administration's initial steps towards normalizing relations with Syria, which has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The move follows the toppling of the Assad regime in December 2024 and aims to support the transitional government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa. Aid organizations have been pushing for sanctions relief to facilitate humanitarian assistance and economic recovery following the devastating 2023 earthquake.</p>

          <p>Burberry announced organizational changes, including potential job cuts impacting around 1,700 roles globally, as part of its turnaround efforts. CEO Joshua Schulman's strategy aims to revive the brand, following £40 million in cost-cutting measures announced in November. Sales fell across all regions, particularly in Asia-Pacific, but slightly less than anticipated in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company flagged increased geopolitical tension as a key downside risk, with CFO Kate Ferry noting the U.S. tariffs' impact is very dynamic and the company will respond accordingly.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's policies, including proposed tariffs and budget cuts, are creating uncertainty for the renewable energy sector in the United States. While clean energy has seen significant growth in recent years, the administration's preference for fossil fuels and potential tariffs on imported components could hinder progress. Tariffs on Southeast Asia, in particular, could significantly impact solar energy development, as the region supplies critical inputs for solar module manufacturing. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, the unstable policy environment is causing concern among investors and developers.</p>

Aides allegedly worried about the political implications of Biden using a wheelchair during his campaign.

          <p>A charter plane carrying 59 white South Africans arrived in the U.S. as refugees, fast-tracked by President Trump due to claims of racist policies and a 'genocide' against white farmers. These claims are widely disputed, with critics arguing they are based on false narratives and propaganda. South African officials deny any persecution, emphasizing that crime affects everyone regardless of race. The move is seen by some as Trump positioning himself as a savior of white privilege and Christianity globally, further straining relations between Pretoria and Washington.</p>

The plan entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with potential oversight from international representatives.
