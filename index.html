          <p>A surge of visitors is flocking to Vladimir Lenin's mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square ahead of its scheduled closure for repairs until 2027. The renewed interest is less about Soviet nostalgia and more about a final opportunity to see the preserved body of the revolutionary leader, whose potential burial has been debated for years. This phenomenon highlights a unique intersection of history, science, and public curiosity in modern Russia, where a relic of the past continues to draw crowds. The temporary closure prompts reflections on the permanence of historical symbols.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger is set to receive his prison sentence for the 2022 stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students, following a plea deal that removed the death penalty as a possibility. The hearing is expected to feature statements from the victims' families, who have expressed frustration that the plea deal did not require Kohberger to provide a motive for the brutal crime. The deal stipulates consecutive life sentences for each murder, with Kohberger waiving his right to appeal. The case was built on a combination of surveillance footage, cell phone data, and DNA evidence from a knife sheath left at the scene.</p>

          <h2>EU Chamber of Commerce in China Calls for 'Rebalancing' of Economic Relationship</h2>

          <p>The president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China has stated that the EU-China economic relationship is at a critical juncture and requires a "rebalancing" to ensure more equitable benefits. Speaking on the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, the chamber president warned that intense pressure from Chinese competition leading to losses for European firms could undermine the partnership. This call for realignment comes amid a period of heightened global trade tensions, as both sides seek to maintain their long-standing collaboration while addressing growing economic friction.

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. fell by 2.7% in June, a larger drop than anticipated, as high mortgage rates continued to suppress buyer activity. Despite the slowdown in sales, the median home price climbed 2% year-over-year to a new record high of $435,300, driven by a persistent undersupply of available homes. The National Association of Realtors noted that first-time buyers remain a smaller portion of the market than historically, while all-cash deals continue to be elevated. This data reflects a housing market constrained by affordability challenges for many potential buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid rising household debt driven by high interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments, financial experts are highlighting several debt relief options. These strategies range from disciplined repayment methods like the debt snowball or avalanche, to consolidation using personal loans or balance transfer cards. For those with more severe debt, options include debt management plans (DMPs) through credit counseling agencies, debt settlement, or, as a last resort, bankruptcy. Experts emphasize that the best approach depends on an individual's specific financial situation and credit score, urging proactive measures to address debt problems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola will begin using cane sugar in the U.S., a move he championed, has put a spotlight on the sugar industry's significant political influence. This decision benefits U.S. sugar farmers, who are already protected by high tariffs, while potentially harming the corn syrup industry, a key agricultural sector. The move has puzzled some corn farmers, a traditional part of Trump's base, and raised questions about the influence of major political donors like the Fanjul family, who are sugar titans. Health experts note there is no significant nutritional difference between cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup.</p>

This is the latest in a series of cancellations for Gergiev, who has lost engagements at major venues since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Now 61 years later, inspired by the #MeToo movement, her case is being retried, with prosecutors issuing a formal apology and asking the court to overturn the original conviction.

          <p>Scientists from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre claim to have developed an innovative aircraft design platform that overcomes the "curse of dimensionality," a long-standing challenge in aviation. This new software allows designers to manage a vast number of variables without increasing the computational load. To illustrate its effectiveness, the researchers pointed to the canceled U.S. Navy X-47B drone program, which struggled with trade-offs between stealth, aerodynamics, and propulsion. The Chinese team asserts their system can achieve dramatic improvements by optimizing hundreds of variables simultaneously, potentially revolutionizing aircraft design.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sea slug Elysia chlorotica exhibits a remarkable biological feat by stealing chloroplasts from the algae it consumes and incorporating them into its own body to perform photosynthesis. This process of "creative borrowing," or symbiosis, allows the slug to sustain itself with light, blurring the lines between animal and plant. This creature serves as a compelling example for a broader scientific theory, championed by biologist Lynn Margulis, that symbiosis is a major driving force of evolution, not just random mutation. The study of such organisms is prompting scientists to reconsider how interactions between different species fundamentally shape life and evolution.</p>

Finch, who had planned to become a history teacher, has faced criticism from opponents about his lack of life experience, which he dismisses as "ageist." Since taking the role, Reform UK has become the largest party on the council, and Finch has already engaged in public disputes, including one over the display of a Pride flag at council headquarters. His appointment highlights the rising influence of Reform UK in local politics and its appeal to some younger voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement with Japan, which sets a 15% tariff on its goods imported to the U.S., is being seen as a tangible result of President Trump's aggressive tariff strategy. The deal provides Japan with a less severe outcome than the threatened 25% tariff and may serve as a model for other economic blocs like the EU. While this is a tactical win for the administration, questions remain about the broader economic impact, as U.S. consumers will likely bear much of the cost through higher prices. Furthermore, the strategy has coincided with a weakening U.S. dollar, which could further increase the cost of imports. (not investment advice)</p>

The article draws parallels to Martin Scorsese's "Taxi Driver," where the viewer is immersed in the perspective of a disturbed protagonist who sees himself as a hero. "Eddington" satirizes the extreme politicization and misinformation of the lockdown era, culminating in a chaotic and absurd showdown that questions the nature of justice and control.</p>
