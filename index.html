          <p>An advice column addresses a user's belief that their AI chatbot has become sentient, a concern shared by a growing number of people. Most AI experts assert that current large language models (LLMs) are not conscious but are sophisticated mimics, acting out roles based on vast training data that includes science fiction. These systems are designed to be engaging and can create persistent personas by remembering past chats, an illusion of consciousness that plays on human instincts to attribute intent to responsive entities. The article advises users to remain grounded, consult experts, and channel their empathy towards confirmed conscious beings experiencing real suffering.</p>

This score marked the highest ever in a T20 international at Christchurch's Hagley Oval. New Zealand's chase faltered despite a solid start, as they were bowled out for 171, with England's Adil Rashid taking four wickets.

          <p>Members of Congress have expressed outrage following reports of U.S. military veterans being arrested or injured by federal agents during protests. The incidents occurred amid demonstrations related to Donald Trump's policies, with eight cases identified where veterans faced prosecution or sought damages after being detained. Prominent lawmakers, including Senator Tammy Duckworth and Representative Jason Crow, condemned the use of excessive force against individuals who were peacefully protesting. One incident involved a 70-year-old Air Force veteran being knocked over by ICE agents, while another saw an Afghanistan veteran tackled and held in solitary confinement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the ancient Lycian city of Olympus, Turkey, archaeologists have unearthed a large and elaborate bathhouse attached to a bishop's residence, dating back to the 5th or 6th century A.D. The 2,150-square-foot complex is a rare find due to its size and features, including an advanced heating system. During this period, Byzantine bishops served as both spiritual and civic leaders, managing city wealth and public services. While connected to the bishop's home, the bathhouse was not exclusively private; it was opened to the public on certain days as a service for community health and cleanliness.</p>

          <p>Chinese loans have financed significant urban development projects in Angola, including the $3.5 billion Nova Cidade de Kilamba, built by Chinese firms as part of the nation's post-war reconstruction. Initially completed in 2012, the city struggled with low occupancy due to high prices and a lack of financing options, making it inaccessible for many Angolans. The government eventually intervened by lowering prices and introducing state-backed mortgages to attract residents. This situation highlights the complexities and potential downsides of such large-scale, foreign-funded infrastructure projects, as analysts remain cautious about the long-term costs and benefits for the local population.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced talks to hire Sean Dyche as their new manager, following the recent dismissal of Ange Postecoglou. Postecoglou was sacked just 17 minutes after a 3-0 loss to Chelsea, leaving the club in 18th place with only one win in eight league games. Dyche has emerged as the leading candidate, with the club hoping to finalize an agreement soon. A former youth player at Forest, Dyche has extensive managerial experience, notably a near-decade-long tenure at Burnley and a two-year spell with Everton. Other potential candidates have been considered but face contractual or financial hurdles.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris remained closed for a second day as police investigate a major heist where thieves stole priceless French crown jewels in broad daylight. The robbers used a vehicle-mounted lift to access a first-floor window of the Galerie d'Apollon, smashed display cases, and escaped on scooters with eight valuable items. The theft, which took only minutes, has stunned France and raised serious questions about security failures at the world-renowned museum. Officials described the stolen jewels as having "inestimable value," and investigators are now searching for at least four suspects believed to be part of an organized criminal group.</p>

Giuffre writes that she was 17 when she first met the prince, who has consistently denied all allegations and reached a financial settlement with her in 2022.

This marks a significant shift in the Labour government's rhetoric, which had previously been hesitant to emphasize the economic downsides of Brexit.

          <p>A federal watchdog report reveals that private insurers managing Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans often provide misleading information about their networks of mental health professionals. The investigation found that many listed providers were not actually available, creating "ghost networks" of practitioners who were retired, not accepting new patients, or not contracted with the plans. This discrepancy makes it difficult for vulnerable patients to access necessary mental health care, despite the government paying these companies billions to ensure adequate coverage. The report recommends increased oversight and the creation of a national, searchable directory to improve accuracy and patient access.</p>

The advice, which reversed decades of previous practice, was based on a landmark 2015 study showing that early exposure could reduce allergy risk by over 80%. A recent analysis of pediatric health records confirmed a significant real-world impact, with peanut allergy diagnoses in young children declining by more than 40% after the guidelines were widely adopted in 2017.

          <p>A relative of author Harper Lee has suggested that major unpublished works, including a potential prequel to 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and a true crime novel, might still exist among her papers. Lee's nephew, Dr. Edwin Conner, mentioned a manuscript titled 'The Long Goodbye,' which was written before her famous novel, but its fate remains unknown. Another mystery involves 'The Reverend,' a non-fiction book Lee researched in the 1970s about a series of murders in Alabama, which some claim was completed but has never been found. This speculation arises as a collection of Lee's previously unseen early short stories is set to be published.</p>

          <p>A collection of newly discovered short stories by Harper Lee, written before 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' is being published, providing a glimpse into the evolution of her writing. The manuscripts, found in one of her New York apartments after her death, are described by her family as "apprentice stories" that showcase her developing genius. Some stories feature early versions of characters like Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch and are set in the fictional town of Maycomb. Lee's relatives believe she would be delighted by their publication, as she had originally sought to have them published at the start of her career.</p>

With a GDP growth rate of nearly 3% in 2024, it surpassed the EU average and its largest economies, Germany and France. Since joining the EU in 2004, Poland's economy has doubled in size, driven by strong domestic consumption, a well-educated workforce, and effective use of EU funds for infrastructure development. Despite political divisions, the country has maintained its economic momentum, leading analysts to view it as a model of successful EU integration and a potential future economic powerhouse in the region.

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the United States could severely impact the global film industry, with Britain's sector being particularly vulnerable. The UK film and TV industry, which contributes billions to the economy, relies heavily on U.S. partnerships, with 65% of its production spending coming from American studios and streaming platforms. Industry leaders express concern that such a tariff would disrupt this crucial investment stream, making it much more difficult to produce British films. While some believe the complexity of modern filmmaking makes the tariff impractical, the threat alone creates significant uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery reveals the construction of a new, nearly 2,000-meter airstrip on Zuqar Island, a strategic volcanic island in the Red Sea off Yemen's coast. The project's purpose and backer remain unclear, though it is likely linked to forces opposing the Houthi rebels. Such an installation could enhance aerial surveillance over key shipping lanes that have been targeted by Houthi attacks. The United Arab Emirates, which has funded similar airstrips in the region, has not commented. Analysts suggest the airstrip could be used to counter Houthi weapons smuggling activities, as anti-Houthi forces have recently increased their interdiction efforts.</p>

          <p>Following a BBC investigation that revealed potentially avoidable deaths of dozens of babies and two mothers, the UK's Health Secretary has announced an independent inquiry into maternity services at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. The investigation will examine what were described as "repeated failures" and a "blame culture" at the trust's two main hospitals. The Care Quality Commission had previously downgraded the units to "inadequate," citing risks of avoidable harm to patients. Bereaved families, who had campaigned for the inquiry, expressed hope that it would uncover the truth and lead to lasting improvements in care.</p>

          <p>A couple in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has constructed a £150,000 eco-home under the unique One Planet Development (OPD) policy, which requires them to adhere to strict sustainable living standards. The policy grants planning permission in rural areas only if residents can demonstrate they can generate an income from the land and live with a minimal carbon footprint. The couple's lifestyle, including their food production and transportation, will be monitored for five years; failure to meet the requirements could result in eviction and the removal of their home.

          <p>A growing number of British students are opting to study medicine in Eastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria, due to the intense competition for limited places in UK medical schools. Universities like the Medical University of Plovdiv attract a significant number of UK applicants, who are drawn by English-language programs and an admissions process that heavily weighs an entrance exam over just A-level grades. While the degree is recognized by the UK's General Medical Council, students face potential future challenges, as the British Medical Association is advocating for UK graduates to be prioritized for training posts, which could disadvantage those who studied abroad.</p>

          <p>UK rail operator South Western Railway (SWR) estimates it is losing £45.5 million in revenue annually due to fare evasion. Data released through a Freedom of Information request shows that approximately 3.9% of passengers travel without a valid ticket. In response, SWR stated that its revenue protection teams are focused on deterring ticketless travel, which has reportedly decreased by 40% since 2017. The same data revealed that the operator also spent over £370,000 on hotels and taxis for passengers affected by delays and cancellations, and that over 7,000 trains ran with fewer carriages than planned in the last year.</p>

          <p>Using a groundbreaking high-speed, high-resolution imaging technology, scientists in China have successfully captured the dynamic process of communication between neurons. The team observed what they term the "kiss-shrink-run" process, where tiny synaptic vesicles transmit signals between brain cells. This achievement helps resolve a half-century-long debate in neuroscience about the precise mechanics of this fundamental process. The technology, developed by researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China and the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, allows for imaging at a nanometre resolution and on a millisecond timescale, overcoming previous technical limitations.</p>
