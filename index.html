          <p>The Trump administration has set a deadline for transgender troops to voluntarily leave the military due to the ban. Some transgender service members have chosen to accept the terms and leave, while others are determined to stay and challenge the ban. The administration's policy has faced legal challenges and widespread criticism for its discriminatory nature and impact on military readiness. The future of transgender service members remains uncertain as legal battles continue and the deadline approaches, causing significant personal and professional disruption for those affected.

          <p>Tesla's stock price has recovered some ground following a public disagreement between Elon Musk and President Trump, which had initially caused a sharp decline in share value. The stock rose by over 5% in morning trading after falling 14% the previous day due to Trump's threat to remove government contracts from Musk's companies. Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives remains optimistic about Tesla's future, citing the potential of its autonomous vehicle technology, despite the recent volatility caused by the spat. Musk's net worth decreased significantly due to the stock drop, but analysts believe the situation will stabilize as both parties need each other. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Michael Pratt, the owner of the pornographic website GirlsDoPorn and former FBI's Most Wanted Fugitive, pleaded guilty to sex trafficking charges. Pratt conspired to recruit young women through force, fraud, and coercion for videos produced between 2012 and 2019. He misled victims by promising their videos would not be released online or in the United States, and he threatened women who attempted to withdraw from shooting. Pratt fled the U.S. after being charged in 2019, living as an international fugitive until his arrest in Spain in 2022; he now faces sentencing in September. The resolution of this case hopefully brings some sense of justice to the victims.</p>

          <p>Alex Chiu, a 41-year-old aerospace engineer, died after falling 3,000 feet while climbing the West Buttress route of Mount McKinley in Denali National Park, Alaska. Chiu was ski mountaineering without being attached to a rope when the incident occurred, and his body was recovered by park rangers after high winds and snow initially hampered search efforts. Chiu's social media posts revealed his passion for mountaineering and his excitement about returning to alpine climbs after the pandemic. The accident serves as a reminder of the dangers associated with mountaineering, even for experienced climbers, in the challenging environment of Denali National Park.

          <p>A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memo outlines the use of National Guard troops for immigration enforcement activities, including night operations, rural interdiction, guard duty, and riot control at detention facilities. The memo requests 20,000 National Guard troops, with specific assignments such as locating fugitives, providing detention support, and transporting detainees, including unaccompanied children. The Pentagon has yet to approve the request, and legal questions remain regarding the deployment of troops from one state to another for immigration enforcement. The DHS asserts that the National Guard will help arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens, prioritizing the safety of American citizens, though concerns about the legality of the deployment remain.</p>

          <p>An international drug trafficking ring has been dismantled by police forces from several countries after using high-speed "narco boats" to smuggle cocaine from Brazil and Colombia to Spain's Canary Islands. The ring allegedly used 11 speedboats to pick up drugs from larger "mother ships" in the Atlantic, using an abandoned shipwreck as a refueling platform. Authorities arrested 48 people and seized nearly 3,800 kilos of cocaine, along with boats and cash. This operation highlights the ongoing efforts to combat drug trafficking networks operating between South America and Europe, although the underlying issues continue to fester.</p>

          <p>The public falling-out between Elon Musk and President Trump has exposed a significant divide within the contemporary right, particularly regarding fiscal conservatism versus nationalist conservatism. Musk's opposition to Trump's "big, beautiful bill" (BBB), driven by the elimination of tax credits for electric vehicles, clashed with Trump's priorities. This disagreement highlights a broader tension between traditional conservatives focused on fiscal rectitude and nationalist conservatives favoring state power. The feud has implications for Trump's legislative agenda, potentially impacting his ability to pass the BBB, and demonstrates how personal and business interests can fuel ideological conflicts within political movements.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to lift a court order that mandated the reinstatement of U.S. Department of Education employees who were terminated as part of efforts to dismantle the agency. The administration argues that the district judge lacked the authority to require the rehiring of the workers, who were laid off in March. The staff reduction led to the closure of civil rights enforcement offices and the elimination of the team supervising the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The administration's actions reflect its ongoing efforts to streamline the Department and shift responsibilities to the states, although these efforts face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban, targeting travelers from multiple countries, has been met with a muted response compared to the widespread protests in 2017. The lack of outcry illustrates how Americans have become habituated to the president's discriminatory policies, which are often justified by security concerns but appear to be motivated by ethno-religious biases. The ban targets countries with high visa overstay rates, but the logic is seen as arbitrary, with exceptions made for countries that align with Trump's preferences. This acceptance of discriminatory policies reflects a decline in democratic resistance to authoritarian tendencies.</p>
