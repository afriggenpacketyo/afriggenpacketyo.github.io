          <h2>Another 'China Shock' Could Bring Cooler Inflation Globally</h2>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is leading to a surge of cheap exports, causing concerns among other economies about being overwhelmed. However, this influx of low-cost Chinese goods may provide some relief to inflation-hit economies by lowering costs for consumers. This could allow central banks to ease monetary policy and cut interest rates, decoupling from the Federal Reserve's actions. For markets with limited manufacturing bases, like Australia, cheaper Chinese imports could alleviate the cost-of-living crisis.</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a significant cultural figure 150 years after his birth. His literary genius reflected a life of diverse experiences, particularly after fleeing Germany in the 1930s due to the Nazi regime. Mann's works, including "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," earned him global acclaim, while his political essays and radio speeches during and after the Nazi era addressed the German "catastrophe." Mann's unwavering stance against fascism and his commitment to democracy have left a lasting impact.</p>

The decision follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, but the RBI maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The RBI also shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative," indicating limited room for further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, citing the immediate and irreparable injury Harvard would sustain, and extended a previous hold on the administration's attempt to end Harvard's enrollment of international students.

          <p>A new report by PwC challenges common myths about AI's impact on jobs, finding that AI actually increases worker value. The report analyzed over 800 million job ads and company financial reports, revealing that AI is creating jobs and raising wages in AI-exposed occupations. Productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries positioned to adopt AI, and wages for workers with AI skills are significantly higher. The report suggests that workers need to adapt to new skills rather than fear job losses.</p>

These measures include suspending the asylum system, ending temporary legal residency for various groups, and restricting student visas. Experts note that these policies are creating layers of restrictions that disrupt immigration processes and separate families. The new ban faces potential legal challenges, but it is unlikely to cause the same level of chaos as the initial 2017 travel ban due to the existing state of disarray in immigration laws.</p>
