          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, previously deported to El Salvador due to an administrative error, has returned to the United States to face charges related to immigrant smuggling. A federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted Abrego Garcia on counts of illegally transporting undocumented migrants and conspiracy to commit that crime, alleging his involvement in a smuggling ring spanning nearly a decade. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked El Salvador's president for his cooperation in returning Abrego Garcia, while Abrego Garcia's lawyer claims the Trump administration abused its power and violated court orders. The administration alleges that Abrego Garcia is associated with the MS-13 gang, which he denies, and his attorney is demanding a fair trial before the same immigration judge who initially granted him protection from deportation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive approach to downsizing the bureaucracy, spearheaded by figures like Elon Musk, is rooted in a growing anti-managerial sentiment. This political ideology views the American system as being usurped by an unaccountable ruling class of managers and bureaucrats. The administration's efforts, though facing resistance, aim to transform institutions from government to universities and corporations. This initiative seeks to address long-standing frustrations with mainstream conservatives' perceived failure to deliver tangible results, reflecting a broader populist movement against overbearing bureaucratic control.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are scaling back on hiring due to increased costs driven by tariffs, leading to reduced profits and economic uncertainty. As expenses on imported goods rise, companies are seeking to cut costs, including labor, with some pausing hiring, reducing hours, or laying off staff. Shayai Lucero, owner of Earth & Sky Floral Designs, had to abandon plans to hire someone this summer because of increased wholesale flower prices. The share of small business owners planning to create new jobs fell in May, reflecting concerns about labor costs and the current economic environment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) access to personal information within Social Security Administration data systems while a legal challenge proceeds. This decision puts on hold a lower court's order that had restricted Doge's access to sensitive data, including medical and financial records, due to privacy concerns. The court's unsigned order did not provide a rationale, but the three liberal justices dissented, and the agency is a key player in Donald Trump's effort to reduce the federal workforce.

          <p>More than 5,000 veterans and their supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., to protest proposed cuts to veterans' programs, including job reductions at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and contract cancellations with community organizations. Protesters claim the Trump administration aims to dismantle the VA and replace it with a private voucher program, potentially compromising care quality. The administration's proposed budget includes a significant reduction in spending for medical services, offset by increased funding for private sector healthcare. Demonstrators argue that essential healthcare positions are being left vacant, impacting the quality of care for veterans, and the rally coincided with the 81st anniversary of D-Day, drawing inspiration from the 1932 Bonus Army march.</p>

          <p>The measles outbreak in West Texas appears to be slowing down, with no new cases reported in the latest update from the state's health services department. The total case count remains at 742, primarily concentrated in Gaines County, and Dr. Jennifer Shuford warns that vigilance is still necessary to prevent future outbreaks. The majority of cases have been reported in a Mennonite community with low immunization rates, and two unvaccinated children have died due to the disease. The state health agency continues to work with local officials to monitor and contain the spread.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mark Dybul, the architect of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), expresses concern over the program's future due to proposed budget cuts. President Trump has asked Congress to rescind $8.3 billion in foreign aid, including $400 million for PEPFAR, which could significantly reduce efforts to combat HIV and other infectious diseases. Dybul emphasizes the importance of continued support to maintain gains made in the fight against AIDS, and the cuts would undo efforts by the U.S Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The move could make it harder for countries to reduce the burden of treatment programs.</p>
