          <p>The UK Home Office is adding 15 countries to its "deport now, appeal later" scheme, aiming to expedite the removal of foreign nationals who commit crimes. This policy allows deportation before an appeal is heard, with hearings conducted via video link from the individual's home country. The government argues this will reduce strain on the prison system and prevent exploitation of immigration laws, though it faces political debate.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering a major overhaul of driving laws in England and Wales, which includes mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70. The proposed road safety strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's and introduce penalties for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These changes follow a coroner's report criticizing the current system as the "laxest in Europe" after several fatal accidents.</p>

For instance, in the case of Baby O, the prosecution's theory of impact-related liver injuries is contested by independent pathologists, while the defense's alternative theories have also faced scrutiny.

          <p>A Chinese state media outlet has labeled Nvidia's H20 AI chips as unsafe, urging a boycott due to fears of embedded "back doors" for U.S. surveillance. This comes as Nvidia faces growing distrust in China, despite the company's public denials of any such vulnerabilities in its products. The commentary highlights escalating tech tensions and a strategic push within China for domestic alternatives to American technology.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's first 100 days have been marked by political instability and harsh criticism, with many in the media labeling him a "dead man walking." He struggles to lead a difficult coalition government while facing pressure from the rising far-right AfD party, which seeks to undermine his administration.

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has clarified that his comments about the Philippines' inevitable involvement in a potential Taiwan conflict were "misinterpreted" by Beijing for propaganda. China had accused Marcos of "playing with fire," but he explained his primary concern is the safety of over one hundred thousand Filipinos in Taiwan.
