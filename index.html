          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to use its influence to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital global oil trade route. Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the strait for its oil imports, noting that Iran's potential closure of the waterway could have severe economic consequences. While Iranian state media reported parliamentary support for closing the strait following U.S. bombing of nuclear sites, the final decision rests with Iran's national security council. Analysts warn that the oil market may be underestimating the risk of prolonged shipping disruptions if Iran attempts to block the strait, potentially driving oil prices above $100 per barrel. Optimism regarding the situation remains low due to the potential for significant global economic disruption.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites on "Face the Nation," emphasizing that the strikes were a precise mission to degrade Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions, not an attack on the Iranian people or a move toward regime change. Rubio stated that the U.S. is open to diplomacy with Iran but will respond with consequences if Iran chooses a different path. He also addressed concerns about Iran's capabilities to respond and the potential threat to Americans in the Middle East, asserting that the U.S. is prepared to defend its personnel and interests. Rubio clarified that the U.S. would still allow for Iran to have a civilian nuclear program if it does not enrich on its own soil, emphasizing that the issue is Iran's weaponization ambitions and destabilizing activities in the region. </p>

          <p>A suicide bomber detonated himself inside a church in Dweil'a, Syria, killing at least 13 people and wounding dozens more. The attack, which occurred during a prayer service at the Mar Elias Church, is the first of its kind in Syria in years. No group has claimed responsibility, but the Syrian Interior Ministry stated that an extremist from the Islamic State group entered the church and opened fire before detonating an explosive vest. Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mostafa condemned the attack as a terrorist act, reaffirming the state's commitment to combating criminal organizations and protecting society. The attack underscores the ongoing security challenges in Syria and the vulnerability of religious minorities.</p>

Vance emphasized that the U.S. desires peace but insists that it must be within the context of Iran not possessing nuclear weapons. While White House officials have touted the success of the mission, the extent of the damage to the Iranian nuclear facilities remains unknown, with the US confident that they have substantially delayed their development of a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's claims that U.S. strikes had "totally obliterated" Iranian nuclear facilities, satellite images suggest a more nuanced reality. New images of Natanz reveal a new crater, but it's unclear if the attack breached the underground site. Images of Fordow show a support building remained undamaged. The IAEA has been unable to verify the location of Iran's near-bomb-grade uranium for over a week. Analysts warn the strikes have complicated tracking uranium and may incentivize Iran to take its program underground, making the IAEA's work significantly harder.</p>

Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's intervention might expedite the conflict's resolution. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major regional gainer. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's distancing from the conflict and calls for peaceful resolution have shielded it from significant short-term market impacts, with some anticipating a positive mid-term outlook due to the reduced Iranian threat.

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, the National Terrorism Advisory System has issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment in the United States." While there are no current specific threats, the bulletin cautions about potential low-level cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and possible attacks against U.S. networks by actors affiliated with the Iranian government. The advisory also notes the potential for violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to mobilize in response to the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict. U.S. law enforcement agencies are deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites as a precaution.</p>

          <p>New satellite photos reveal the aftermath of the U.S. military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, showing damage to the Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan sites. The images show craters and ash at the Fordo underground complex, as well as extensive building damage at Isfahan. At Natanz, a satellite image shows a hole directly over part of the underground military complex. Gen. Dan Caine said initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction. The U.S. military used decoys and deception in the attack to protect the B-2 bombers.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces a delicate diplomatic situation following the US airstrikes on Iran. Starmer's calls for de-escalation have been ignored by the White House, yet he has avoided direct UK involvement in military action. While the UK has not explicitly endorsed the US action, it supports the outcome of delaying Iran's nuclear weapons program. The UK was given advanced warning of the US action but was not asked to participate, possibly due to debates about the legality of any UK involvement. The US could request military support from the UK in the coming weeks, prompting further difficult decisions for the prime minister.</p>

          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure endorsing the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil transportation route, following U.S. airstrikes in Iran. The decision to block the strait, through which around 20% of the world's oil and gas flows, ultimately rests with Iran's Supreme National Security Council. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned against closing the strait, calling such a decision an escalation of conflict that would be a "suicidal move" for Iran. The potential closure of the strait raises concerns about rising fuel costs for global consumers.</p>
