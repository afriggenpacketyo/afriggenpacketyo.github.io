          <p>Former President Trump announced on Truth Social his intention to reopen and enlarge Alcatraz to house America's most violent offenders, citing frustrations with judges insisting on due process for deportees. The Bureau of Prisons stated it would comply with presidential orders, though the feasibility of such a project is questionable, given the National Park Service's current control of the island. Alcatraz, a former maximum-security prison, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs and is now a popular tourist attraction. Nancy Pelosi has dismissed the proposal as unserious, highlighting the island's current status as a national park.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has declared a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States, claiming it is a measure to protect the American film industry and combat foreign propaganda. He stated that other countries' incentives to attract filmmakers constitute a national security threat. This move intensifies existing trade disputes and is expected to raise prices on goods worldwide. The tariff announcement comes after China reduced the quota of American movies allowed into the country in response to previous tariff announcements.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump stated he would not seek a third term as president, acknowledging constitutional limits, though he mentioned some people desire him to do so. In an NBC interview, when questioned about upholding constitutional due process for all individuals in the United States, Trump responded that he is not a lawyer and does not know. He also discussed the possibility of using military force to control Greenland, stating he wouldn't rule it out for international security reasons, triggering widespread condemnation and unease both on the island itself and in the global diplomatic community.</p>

          <p>An exhibit at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) headquarters honoring victims of gun violence has been removed, according to the Department of Justice. The exhibit, which featured portraits and biographies of 120 people, including victims of mass shootings and domestic violence, was dedicated in April 2024 under the Biden administration. A DOJ spokesperson suggested that the ATF will continue to honor victims of violent crime, but not exclusively gun violence. Advocates view the removal as a political move by the Trump administration to diminish the reality of gun violence.</p>

          <p>In recent elections in Canada and Australia, right-wing parties that mirrored Trump's MAGA playbook faced defeat, while centrists experienced a resurgence. President Trump's policies, including tariffs and disrupted alliances, have had a ripple effect on domestic political battles globally. In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney campaigned against Trump's threats, while Australia's Anthony Albanese benefited from an anti-Trump sentiment. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong also saw support due to concerns about Trump's trade wars. However, Germany's Friedrich Merz and Britain's Keir Starmer have had mixed experiences with the Trump factor.</p>

          <p>As egg freezing becomes more popular, some experts caution against relying on it due to high costs and no guarantees of success. Vardit Ravitsky of the Hastings Center emphasizes the risks involved, including the possibility of eggs not surviving the thaw or resulting in abnormal embryos. She also points out the financial burden and the potential for companies to exploit women's desire to delay motherhood. Instead, Ravitsky suggests that companies should implement policies like paid parental leave to make it easier for women to have children younger.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular, offering women the option to delay motherhood and preserve fertility, but it comes with significant costs and is not a guarantee of success. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle. Dr. Tomer Singer predicts that egg freezing will become routine, but critics caution against relying on it and highlight the importance of discussing fertility options with gynecologists. The decision to freeze eggs is a personal one, with women needing to consider their age, attitude towards family building, and financial resources.</p>

          <h2>Egg Freezing Popularity Increasing Among Young Women to Preserve Fertility</h2>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming more popular among women to preserve their fertility, with procedures increasing sixfold from 2014 to 2023. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. It is seen as a way for women to delay motherhood and avoid compromising on their career or partner choices. However, experts caution that it is not a guarantee and can be expensive, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees. Some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, while others face criticism for potentially exploiting women's desire to delay motherhood.</p>

          <p>More than half of first-time home buyers received financial assistance from their families in the past year, with an average contribution of £55,572. This support, often referred to as the "bank of mum and dad," helps young buyers overcome high mortgage rates and rising rental costs. Savills estimates that 52% of first-time buyers received this type of help, totaling £9.6 billion. Lucian Cook of Savills noted that first-time buyers are leveraging family support to secure better mortgage deals amidst challenging financial conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed orders targeting several law firms connected to investigations or legal cases related to him, threatening their existence. These orders aim to bar attorneys from courthouses and federal agencies, and cancel contracts of their clients. Nine major firms reached an agreement with Trump, offering nearly $1 billion in legal services to causes supported by them and Trump. Critics argue that these actions undermine the rule of law and the right to legal representation, with some comparing it to a protection racket. Four firms are fighting the orders in court, citing constitutional rights violations.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity, but 60 Minutes reports that it is not a guaranteed path to motherhood. The process, which involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage, costs an average of $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees. Success rates vary depending on age and the number of eggs frozen, with younger women having better outcomes. Experts caution that women should be aware of the costs and risks involved, and that companies should provide better support for working mothers. Some fertility clinics are also facing scrutiny for prioritizing profits over patient care.</p>

The decision comes a month after OPEC+ surprised the market by agreeing to surge production in May by the same amount.
