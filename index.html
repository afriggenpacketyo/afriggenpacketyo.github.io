While these specific layoffs are expected to be rescinded, hundreds of other HHS employees will still lose their jobs. This comes as the U.S. faces multiple public health threats.</p>

The upcoming iteration is expected to focus on more tech-driven and people-centric projects, as officials seek to balance continued investment with addressing financial pressures and evolving societal demands.

Machado, barred from running, backed opposition candidate Edmundo González and believes Maduro's administration is a criminal structure destabilizing the region. She also thanked President Trump for recognizing the threat Maduro presents.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, though they remain under federal control. This ruling upholds a previous decision that found no substantial evidence of a "danger of rebellion" to justify their use in Chicago amid immigration protests. Democratic Senators expressed concern over being denied access to an ICE facility, suggesting a lack of transparency. This legal standoff mirrors similar situations in other cities where federal intervention has been met with state objections.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of five British army horses that bolted through London streets last year after being spooked, has been retired to a sanctuary. The 15-year-old black horse suffered a broken bone and serious bleeding during the incident, which saw horses collide with vehicles and injure several people. Major Thomas Stewart confirmed Quaker's inability to return to duties, leading to his retirement to The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire for his welfare.</p>

          <p>As the federal government shutdown continues, all Smithsonian museums, research centers, and the National Zoo are closing their doors starting Sunday. The institutions had relied on prior-year funds but these have now run out. While animals at the zoo will continue to receive care, public services like the beloved animal cams will be turned off. This closure highlights the widespread impact of the funding dispute on public services and cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in central London, a day after a Gaza ceasefire took effect. Organized by the Palestine Coalition, the demonstration proceeded from Victoria Embankment to Whitehall, where a rally was held. While acknowledging the ceasefire as a positive step, speakers called it "precarious" and vowed to continue protesting until Palestinians achieve full freedom. Police made 14 arrests, primarily for breaching public order conditions and a scuffle with counter-protesters.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's rapid ascent to a $500 billion valuation, driven by massive deals and product rollouts, is creating an unprecedented dominance in Silicon Valley. Unlike previous tech giants, OpenAI's private status and immense capital expenditure make its strategy opaque and challenging for startups to navigate. The company is investing across the AI stack, from data centers to consumer apps, leading to a "gold rush mentality" but also concerns about competition for niche players. This era is marked by extraordinary speed and capital exuberance, with OpenAI at its forefront. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scottish National Party (SNP) members have endorsed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to pursue a second independence referendum if the party wins a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election. Swinney emphasized this as the most realistic path, building on the precedent of the 2014 referendum. This decision comes despite Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's previous assertion that he cannot imagine a second independence vote during his premiership. Swinney's authority remains intact after this crucial vote.</p>
