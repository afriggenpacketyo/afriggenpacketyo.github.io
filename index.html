          <p>Meta is reportedly in talks to hire Daniel Gross, CEO of Safe Superintelligence, and Nat Friedman, former CEO of GitHub, as part of Mark Zuckerberg's ongoing AI talent acquisition efforts. This move follows Meta's unsuccessful attempt to acquire Safe Superintelligence, valued at $32 billion, and their recent $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI to bring on Alexandr Wang. The aggressive pursuit of AI experts highlights the intensifying competition among tech giants like Meta, Google, and OpenAI to develop advanced large language models and achieve artificial general intelligence. The hirings also involve Meta acquiring a stake in NFDG, a venture capital firm run by Gross and Friedman. Optimism surrounding Meta's future AI development remains cautiously high.</p>

          <p>Federal agents have been conducting immigration enforcement actions near Dodger Stadium and Winchell's Donut House in Los Angeles, raising concerns about the targeting of immigrant communities. State Representative Judy Chu criticized the actions as an abuse of power, noting that agents were masked and armed. The Trump administration's immigration policies have faced criticism for inconsistency, initially promising mass arrests before curtailing raids due to labor shortages. The article suggests that these actions may be a response to Trump's unfulfilled campaign promises and a show of force amid public dissent. The enforcement actions have sparked debate about the rights and treatment of immigrants in the United States.</p>

          <p>Colorado congressional Republicans are urging Governor Jared Polis to halt the enrollment of undocumented immigrants in the state's Medicaid program, Health First Colorado. They argue that prioritizing healthcare for those unlawfully present adversely impacts American citizens who need Medicaid the most. Citing similar reforms in California, Minnesota, and Illinois, the Republicans emphasize the financial strain and potential penalties from federal legislation reducing Medicaid funding for sanctuary states. A spokesperson for Polis' office countered that the proposed changes would negatively affect Coloradans' healthcare access and costs, while advocating for Senate revisions to the reconciliation bill. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between providing healthcare access and managing state budgets.</p>

The UK's involvement may depend on US actions, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear program.

          <p>The White House has stated that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in "a couple of weeks" upon receiving the order from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that Iran possesses all necessary resources to achieve nuclear weapon status, posing an existential threat to Israel, the United States, and the world. The statement comes amid ongoing debate over Iran's nuclear capabilities and the potential "breakout timeline." President Trump is considering military action against Tehran and will make a decision within two weeks, influenced by potential negotiations and his instincts. The situation remains tense as the US monitors Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>A nationwide listeria outbreak has led to the recall of ready-to-eat chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart. The outbreak, linked to products made by FreshRealm, Inc., has resulted in 17 illnesses, three deaths, and one fetal loss. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service is investigating the outbreak and urges consumers to discard or return affected products. FreshRealm initiated a voluntary recall, stating they have not received direct reports of illness associated with the product. The FDA reports that people in 13 states have become ill after consuming the meals, prompting widespread concern and caution.</p>

          <p>The Iran nuclear deal, or JCPOA, was a landmark agreement reached in 2015 between Iran and world powers to restrict Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. President Trump withdrew the US from the deal in 2018, reimposing sanctions and arguing the deal was defective. Since then, Iran has reduced its compliance with the deal, raising concerns about its nuclear ambitions. The conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified, with recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

          <p>Europe is increasingly concerned about China's overcapacity in various industries, fearing it could lead to economic disruption and job losses. Decades of overinvestment, state subsidies, and weak domestic consumption in China have created a surplus of industrial goods. The EU believes that China's excess production will flood global markets, particularly Europe, at discounted prices. European governments worry that this will decimate domestic industries and strengthen populist movements. The EU is urging Beijing to address the issue to avoid a backlash similar to the anti-China sentiment in the United States.</p>

The government's bill tightens criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit.
