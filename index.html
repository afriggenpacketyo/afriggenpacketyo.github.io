          <p>China and Vietnam will conduct their first joint army exercise this month in China's Guangxi region, focusing on joint border patrol training. This military collaboration signifies a deepening of practical cooperation between the two nations, marking the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties. The move comes as China, Vietnam's largest trading partner, seeks to strengthen regional alliances in the face of ongoing trade tensions with the United States. This closer relationship was also highlighted by the Chinese military's recent participation in Vietnam's annual celebration of the fall of Saigon.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat named Wonder Seas capsized in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay during a sudden storm, resulting in the deaths of at least 35 people, including eight children. The vessel was carrying 53 passengers, most of whom were Vietnamese families, when it was struck by torrential rain and hailstones. Rescue efforts were hampered by the severe weather, though ten people were pulled from the water alive, including a 10-year-old boy who survived in an air pocket. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the tragic accident.</p>

          <h2>Italian Bear That Fatally Attacked Jogger Relocated to German Wildlife Sanctuary</h2>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows extensive legal battles and protests from animal rights groups, which successfully overturned an initial order for the bear to be euthanized. The incident sparked a debate over human-wildlife conflict in Italy's Trentino region, where the bear population has grown significantly. JJ4 will now live in a specially designed, secure enclosure, and her arrival at the sanctuary was reported as calm and stable.</p>

          <p>The official X account for the Sesame Street character Elmo was recently compromised, with hackers posting hate speech and racist content to millions of followers. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the cybersecurity risks faced by trusted global brands, whose reputations can be damaged in minutes. Cybersecurity experts note that such hacks often result from credentials being stolen and sold on the dark web, rather than brute-force attacks. The article emphasizes the importance of robust security measures like unique passwords, multi-factor authentication, and regular security audits to protect social media accounts.</p>

          <p>A rare pterosaur fossil found in northeastern China is challenging previous assumptions about the diet of these ancient flying reptiles. The fossil of a Sinopterus atavismus contained stomach contents with phytoliths, which are microscopic mineral deposits from plants. Researchers also found small quartz crystals, likely gastroliths or "stomach stones" used to help grind tough plant matter, a feature seen in modern birds and lizards. This is the first time such evidence has been found in a pterodactyloid pterosaur, providing the first direct confirmation of herbivory in this group.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the first six months of a hypothetical second Trump term suggests that many of his ambitious foreign policy promises have not been achieved, despite his belief in his "force of personality." Pledges to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, halt Iran's nuclear program, and negotiate numerous trade deals remain unfulfilled. While there have been some achievements, such as increased NATO defense spending, the broader strategy of leveraging personal relationships has reportedly faltered with leaders like Vladimir Putin. Critics argue that Trump's approach, which views alliances as burdens and favors tariffs, undermines his ability to accomplish his goals on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Six months into a hypothetical second Trump presidency, California has become a central battleground for the administration's right-wing agenda, marked by immigration raids, legal challenges, and funding cuts. The federal government has targeted the state over its sanctuary policies, environmental regulations, and social issues, with officials vowing to "liberate" Los Angeles. In response, California has filed numerous lawsuits against the administration. While some California Republicans welcome the federal intervention as a necessary counterweight to state policies, Democratic leaders decry the actions as immoral, illegal, and politically motivated attacks on the state.</p>

Experts suggest that the government's shifting statements, such as promising and then denying the existence of an Epstein client list, have only deepened public suspicion.

          <p>A monument in Mexico City depicting Fidel Castro and Ernesto “Che” Guevara has been removed, sparking both praise and condemnation. The bronze sculpture, which commemorated the revolutionaries' first meeting in the city in 1955, was installed in 2017 and had long been a point of contention. The conservative borough president justified the removal by citing a lack of legal authorization and later called the figures harmful to human dignity. In response, Mexico's leftist president argued the monument represented a historic moment and should be relocated, highlighting ongoing ideological divisions in the region.</p>

Her defense argued she believed the gun was unloaded when she "fan fired" it, accidentally shooting her husband twice in the head.

          <p>The Sunbeam "Blue Bird," the car that Sir Malcolm Campbell used to first break the 150 mph land-speed barrier, will return to Pendine Sands in Wales to mark the 100th anniversary of the achievement. On July 21, 1925, Campbell set a new world record of 150.766 mph on the seven-mile beach, a feat that brought him international fame. The historic vehicle, now cared for by the National Motor Museum, will be present for a ceremonial start-up attended by Campbell's grandson, Don Wales, continuing a multi-generational family legacy of record-breaking.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Nearly Half of Hospital Toilet Users Do Not Wash Their Hands</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 02:06:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Surrey and a Danish hospital reveals that a significant number of people fail to wash their hands after using a hospital toilet. Researchers used sensors on pipes over 19 weeks and found that in 43.7% of cases, a toilet flush was not followed by handwashing at the sink. This behavior, which peaked at over 60% during some weeks, poses a direct risk to patient safety by potentially spreading illnesses. Researchers suggest that current visual reminders are insufficient and that more effective behavioral strategies are needed to improve hygiene habits in healthcare settings.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi was murdered in a mistaken-identity killing in Cardiff, his sister has made a public appeal to the fugitive suspected of ordering the attack. Mohammed Ali Ege, one of Europe's most wanted men, has been on the run since escaping custody in India in 2011. Aamir's sister, Nishat Siddiqi, urged Ege to hand himself in, stating that he is "not truly free" while constantly looking over his shoulder. Two hitmen were convicted for the murder, which occurred when they went to the wrong address to settle a dispute.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week in financial markets will be dominated by earnings reports from major European banks, including Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank, which are expected to show resilient performance. Market watchers are also keenly focused on the European Central Bank, which is anticipated to keep interest rates on hold. However, a major uncertainty looms with the U.S. threat of imposing 30% tariffs on EU imports. A decision on tariffs is expected by early September, and a move to implement them would likely trigger a sharp market reaction and a potential rate cut from the ECB. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The murder trial of George Burch for the 2016 killing of Nicole Vander Heyden heavily featured 21st-century technology, which both exonerated one suspect and convicted another. Initially, Vander Heyden's boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was the prime suspect, but data from his Fitbit device corroborated his alibi that he was home at the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify Burch, and data from his phone's Google Dashboard tracked his movements to the crime scene and other key locations. Burch was ultimately convicted of first-degree intentional homicide and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

The Dodgers' lineup, which has recently struggled, produced seven runs and ten hits, including back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning. However, this offensive resurgence was not enough to overcome a poor start from pitcher Emmet Sheehan and a bullpen that allowed three late runs.
