        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global spirit makers are facing a difficult situation due to tariffs, brand boycotts, and shifts in drinking habits. Rémy Cointreau, a French cognac maker, recently withdrew its sales targets due to economic and trade uncertainties, following similar moves by Diageo and Pernod Ricard. The company's full-year sales for its cognac business fell by 22% because of slowing U.S. consumption and complex market conditions in China, particularly impacting brandy varieties like Remy Martin. Jefferies noted that distilled spirits in the U.S. are undergoing a correction, with U.S. tariffs adding further uncertainty to the market. The situation is complex and requires careful navigation to maintain stability and growth.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, has returned to the U.S. to face federal charges after leaders and advocates called for his return. Abrego Garcia is accused of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people, with allegations of involvement in an alien smuggling ring including children and women. Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen emphasized that the case is about Abrego Garcia's constitutional rights and due process, not about the individual himself. The Trump administration initially resisted court orders to facilitate his return, but eventually complied, and Abrego Garcia will now have the opportunity to appear in court and consult with his lawyers.</p>

          <p>Chicago Police Officer Krystal Rivera was unintentionally shot and killed by a fellow officer during a chase in Chatham on Thursday night.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have doubled in the past year as police target employers who exploit undocumented migrants. Immigration officers arrested over 6,400 people during raids at businesses, a 51% increase from the previous year, while visiting more than 9,000 businesses to check paperwork and working conditions. The Home Office reported that migrants are often subjected to poor conditions, illegal hours, and below-minimum wages. The government is cracking down on illegal migration through tighter work visas and measures against overstaying, having returned nearly 30,000 people without the right to be in the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement, paving the way for US colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement allows schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provides $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players who were previously barred from revenue. This agreement professionalizes college athletics, impacting recruitment and potentially leading to program adjustments, with the NCAA relinquishing oversight to the major conferences. While it brings financial benefits to athletes, it also raises concerns about roster limits and the future of Olympic sports.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved the House v. NCAA settlement, ushering in a new era for college sports where athletes can be directly paid. Starting this fall, NCAA's top division colleges can pay athletes, capped at $20.5 million per school, with over $2 billion allocated to former athletes denied earnings during their school years. The settlement addresses the tradition of amateurism amid exponential revenue growth in college athletics. It also introduces a third-party clearinghouse to review NIL deals, aiming to regulate compensation, but this concept faces criticism and potential legal challenges, potentially impacting the future of college sports.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting Japan's rice policy amid rising prices and an upcoming election, seeking to reform the decades-old production adjustment system. Rice prices have doubled, prompting Ishiba to consider boosting production to counter opposition parties advocating for consumption tax cuts. While aiming to increase rice production, challenges remain, including the risk of price drops from oversupply. Ishiba's efforts include releasing reserve rice to lower prices and advocating for increased exports to prevent potential overproduction, though some critics caution against using rice policy for political gain.</p>

The ACLU is calling this a "runaway spying operation", with the county using drones equipped with high-powered cameras to find code violations on private property. The lawsuit claims that while the drones were initially used to track illegal cannabis cultivation, they have since been used over 700 times for other code violations, raising concerns about privacy and unreasonable searches. The ACLU argues that this violates the California Constitution and residents' right to privacy.</p>
