          <p>In an interview, Republican Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas defended HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s disruptive approach to the CDC, stating it aims to restore trust lost during the COVID-19 pandemic. Marshall, a former OB-GYN, argued for a more individualized approach to vaccinations, suggesting not every person needs every vaccine, including for Hepatitis B in newborns under specific circumstances. He asserted that this empowers parents and doctors to make informed decisions, contrasting it with what he described as a "one-size-fits-all" Democratic policy approach. The senator also addressed concerns about vaccine hesitancy and the operational difficulties in vaccine access.</p>

          <p>Leaders of major UK trade unions, including Unison, are warning the government against diluting the proposed Employment Rights Bill. Concerns have been amplified following a recent cabinet reshuffle and the departure of key supporters of the legislation, such as Angela Rayner. The bill aims to introduce significant protections for workers, including a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and enhanced rights against unfair dismissal. While unions vow to campaign fiercely against any changes, business groups like the Federation of Small Businesses see an opportunity to amend the bill.</p>

          <p>John L. Burton, a formidable and outspoken liberal force in California politics for over six decades, has passed away at the age of 92. Known for his pro-labor stance and colorful, expletive-laden communication style, Burton served in the Assembly, Congress, and as the powerful leader of the state Senate. His legislative legacy includes significant impacts on welfare, foster care, and gun control, and he was instrumental in the California Democratic Party's rise to dominance. After overcoming addiction, he returned to public service and later founded a nonprofit to advocate for foster youth.</p>

          <p>An assailant was shot and killed by police in Brooklyn after he entered the 73rd Precinct and attacked an officer. The man used a 14-inch butcher knife to slash a female officer in the face when she directed him to the public entrance. After fleeing the building, the suspect was pursued by several officers who ordered him to drop the weapon. When he failed to comply and lunged at another officer, police opened fire, fatally wounding him. The injured officer was treated at a hospital and is reported to be in good spirits.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced that approximately 300 of its citizens detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia will be released and flown home. The raid, part of the Trump administration's anti-immigration campaign, led to nearly 500 arrests and caused diplomatic strain between the two allies. South Korean officials expressed concern over the timing and handling of the raid, particularly the dissemination of images showing workers in restraints. The incident has prompted discussions about streamlining visa access for South Korean nationals working on investment projects in the US.</p>

Zelenskyy reiterated his call for increased international pressure on Russia, including a halt to European purchases of Russian energy, which he described as Putin's "weapon."

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its immigration enforcement efforts, launching an operation in Boston dubbed "Patriot 2.0" and continuing to threaten a major crackdown in Chicago. President Trump amplified his rhetoric with a social media post that referenced the film "Apocalypse Now," which drew criticism from Chicago's mayor. Despite data showing lower crime rates in Chicago compared to some cities in red states, Trump has defended his focus on the city.

          <p>A Guardian editorial criticizes the Trump administration's recent military strike that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers from Venezuela, arguing it turns the failed "war on drugs" metaphor into a dangerous reality. The article contends that such extrajudicial killings set a precedent for military action without congressional approval, similar to the expansion of executive power seen during the "war on terror." The piece warns that these actions are counterproductive, undermining due process and hindering international cooperation with countries like Mexico. It frames the policy as a misguided spectacle rather than an effective strategy.</p>

In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually, a figure potentially influenced by reduced access in rural areas.

          <p>New Zealand's Black Ferns delivered a commanding performance to defeat Ireland 40-0 and secure the top spot in Pool C of the Women's Rugby World Cup. Teenage winger Braxton Sorensen-McGee was a standout player, scoring a hat-trick of tries in the decisive victory. Both teams had already qualified for the quarter-finals, but the reigning world champions demonstrated their class and avenged a loss to Ireland from the previous year. Ireland will now face the winner of the France vs. South Africa match in the next round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren sound and vibrated for approximately 10 seconds on Sunday as part of a national test of the emergency alert system. The drill, which took place around 3:00 PM, was deemed a success by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who called it an important step for public safety. The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening events such as severe weather or public safety emergencies. Various public events, including sporting matches and theatre performances, paused or made announcements to accommodate the test.</p>

As companies adopt AI and flatten their organizational structures, the path from a starting role to executive leadership, once a cornerstone of corporate culture, may become obsolete. Data shows a significant decline in hiring for recent graduates in the tech sector, suggesting the first rung of the ladder is already disappearing. Experts believe this will force a shift in how talent is developed, requiring new workers to acquire advanced skills independently.</p>
