          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert known for his work on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, has pleaded guilty to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000. The charges stem from his failure to disclose knowledge or suspicion that a business associate was involved in financing a proscribed group. The Met Police stated that the alleged offences occurred between October 2020 and December 2021. This prosecution marks the first of its kind, highlighting the importance of reporting potential terror financing activities.</p>

          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have reached a trade agreement, but it includes tariffs, signaling that President Trump's tariff policies are likely to remain in place. While the UK secured some exemptions for its auto, steel, and aluminum sectors, a 10% baseline tariff will apply to most other goods imported from the UK. Analysts interpret this deal as a sign that other countries and trading blocs can expect similar tariff conditions. The agreement allows the UK to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% rate, with additional vehicles facing higher duties, indicating a cap on market share for some British automakers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ended nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps grants, significantly reducing the agency's budget and forcing thousands of volunteers to halt their work. The cuts have impacted programs in disaster recovery, education, environmental stewardship, and public health. The administration cited a failure to align with AmeriCorps' priorities as the reason for the cuts, while a White House spokeswoman referenced past audit failures. The article highlights the impact on both volunteers and communities, as well as legal challenges filed against the administration's decision.</p>

          <p>Republican plans for President Trump's tax, immigration, and energy agenda are being threatened by divisions over Medicaid cuts. GOP lawmakers from swing districts are resisting proposals that would strip benefits, while conservatives are pushing for deep spending cuts, including restructuring Medicaid. The debate centers on finding $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the cost of extending Trump's tax cuts. The article explores various options under consideration, including potential caps on spending, work requirements, and adjusting the Medicaid enrollment period, and their potential impact on coverage and access to care.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is working with the Israeli government on a plan to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza and end Israelâ€™s two-month blockade on food and fuel deliveries. The plan involves establishing a handful of distribution zones to serve hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, with the Israeli military stationed outside the perimeters. However, the United Nations has raised serious doubts about the plan, citing concerns that it would force civilians to walk longer distances to access aid and may be a means of forcibly displacing civilians in northern Gaza.</p>
