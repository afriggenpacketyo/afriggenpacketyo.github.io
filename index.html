          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting aims to accelerate a peace process, with Trump seeking at least a ceasefire and Putin aiming to prevent further NATO expansion and secure territorial gains. The choice of Alaska is described as a logical location where the two nations' interests converge, though both sides hold starkly different objectives for the conflict's resolution.</p>

          <p>Almond growers across Central California are grappling with a massive rat infestation that has spread across more than 100,000 acres of orchards. The rodents are causing significant economic damage by consuming nuts, destroying trees, and damaging irrigation systems, with estimated losses ranging from $109 million to $311 million. Growers are employing various expensive and labor-intensive methods to control the pests, as scientists advise on more targeted strategies to manage the surging populations.</p>

          <h2>Bay Area Man Used Aliases and ‘Dummy Books’ to Steal Rare Chinese Manuscripts from UCLA, Feds Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 21:08:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Bay Area man has been charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts valued at $216,000 from the UCLA library in an alleged scheme involving fake aliases and replacement books.\n\nJeffrey Ying of Fremont allegedly used three fake names to check out the valuable antique manuscripts from UCLA in a possible five-year string of robberies, with some of the stolen books dating back to the 13th century, according to investigators.\n\nYing, arrested Wednesday before an alleged attempt to flee to China, was charged by the U.S. attorney’s office with theft of major artwork, a felony punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison, and is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles in the coming days, the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles said Thursday.\n\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, 38-year-old Ying rented manuscripts in groups, abusing a recently new system at UCLA that allowed users to request library cards and rent books without showing an official ID. He would then return “dummy books” in place of the actual manuscripts.\n\nThe “dummy books” were often blank or low-value manuscripts with computer-paper-printed labels and asset tags to mimic those of the actual books.\n\nSince 2020, Ying allegedly requested books from the Southern Regional Library Facility (SRL), a remote UCLA library storage space meant to house rare or delicate books. In response to his request, a box containing manuscripts would be transported to a reserved reading room at the Charles E. Young Research Library of UCLA. Ying would review and replace the manuscripts with his “dummies,” taking the originals with him as he left, according to an FBI affidavit.\n\nLibrary staff told The Times that the official policy is to have an attendant present in the reading room at all times as someone reads special collections books.\n\nWhen the material was returned to the library, the university had no policy requiring a thorough review of the items to ensure they were not replaced with dummy manuscripts, according to officials.\n\nThe director of UCLA Library Special Collections received notice from the head of the university’s East Asian Library that three rare Chinese books were missing after being last checked out by someone named “Alan Fujimori.”\n\nAccording to the FBI affidavit, security camera analysis from library staff revealed that Fujimori, Austin Chen, and Jason Wang, who had all checked out valuable manuscripts over the years, were all aliases for one person— Ying.\n\nThrough a travel record investigation, FBI officials said they discovered that Ying traveled back and forth from China within several days of the alleged robberies, presumably to sell or transport the books.\n\nHowever, as of yet, the FBI said it has not confirmed whether Ying sold or traded any of the manuscripts. The FBI affidavit also lists every book stolen by Ying as “never returned,” which may mean that authorities have not found them.\n\nWhile the official number of stolen books is unconfirmed, affidavit testimony suggests at least 10 are missing, each valued between $274 to $70,000.\n\nOver the course of October to December of last year, federal investigation detailed in the FBI affidavit found that Ying checked out six books under the alias “Jason Wang.” On Aug. 5 of this year, Ying requested eight more books as “Austin Chen.” The next day, Ying planned to board a previously booked flight to China. UCLA police were already tipped off of suspicious behavior — by the time Ying arrived to pick up his eight books before his flight, authorities were called and promptly arrested him.\n\nWhile the arrest and affidavit records primarily focused on the robberies of the past year, they also allege that in 2020, Ying, under the name Alan Fujimori, stole two UCLA manuscripts from the 13th and 16th centuries valued at a combined $132,386.\n\nHis record could go back even further. The FBI affidavit mentions that the alias ‘Alan Fujimori’ is associated with a known book thief who was on the run after similar thefts at the UC Berkeley library.\n\nAt his arrest, Ying was found with a card for Hotel Angeleno, located three miles away from the UCLA library, according to FBI and UCLA police’s investigation detailed in the affidavit. The document also detailed that later in the day of the arrest, officers and detectives searched Ying’s room at Hotel Angelino with a search warrant. They discovered blank manuscripts, printed tags, and fraudulent IDs that matched past aliases.</p>

          <h2>Newsom Welcomes Texas Democrats Who Fled to Foil Trump’s Redistricting Plan</h2>

          <p>California became center stage for the national political fight over House seats Friday when Gov. Gavin Newsom welcomed Democratic lawmakers from Texas who fled their home state to foil President Trump’s plans to redraw congressional districts.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers plan to respond with their own plan to gerrymander districts to favor Democrats and neutralize any Republican seats gained in Texas in 2026, with a proposed map expected to become public next week, Newsom said at a news conference after meeting with the lawmakers.\n\n“Make no mistake, California is moving forward,” the governor said. “We are talking about emergency measures to respond to what’s happening in Texas, and we will nullify what happens in Texas.”\n\nHe noted that while Democrats still support the state’s independent redistricting commission, they must counter Trump’s plan in GOP-led states to give their party a better chance in next year’s midterm election.\n\n“They drew first blood,” he later added of Republicans.\n\nAsked about the gathering, a Trump administration spokesperson said Newsom was seeking the limelight to further his political ambitions.\n\n“Gavin Newsom is a loser of the highest order and he will never be president, no matter how hard he prostitutes himself to the press,” said the spokesperson, Steven Cheung.\n\nFriday marked the second time in two weeks that Texas Democrats have stood next to Newsom at the California governor’s mansion and warned that Republican efforts to draw a new map in their state would dilute the power of Black and brown voters.\n\nThe Texas Democrats hoped that their departure would leave the state Legislature with too few members present to change the map in a special session. They face $500 fines for each day of absence, as well as threats of arrest and removal from office by Gov. Greg Abbott and other Texas GOP officials. Some of the Democratic lawmakers were evacuated from a Chicago hotel where they were staying after a bomb threat Wednesday.\n\n“We are now facing threats — the threat that we’re going to lose our jobs, the threat of financial ruin, the threat that we will be hunted down as our colleagues sit on their hands and remain silent, as we all get personal threats to our lives,” said Texas state Rep. Ann Johnson, one of six Texas Democrats at the news conference, who was among those evacuated from the Chicago hotel. “We as Democrats are standing up to ensure that the voices of every voter is lifted up in this next election, and that the next election is not stolen from them.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco); Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San José), chair of the California Democratic congressional delegation; California Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg); state Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) and other elected officials joined the meeting in a show of unity as California Democrats attempt to convince their own state’s voters to fight back.\n\nPelosi noted that the state’s congressional delegation is united in backing the redistricting proposal to counter Trump.\n\n“The president has paved over the Rose Garden. He’s paved over freedom of speech. He’s paved over freedom of education, [an] independent judiciary, the rule of law,” Pelosi said. “He’s gone too far. We will not let him pave over free and fair elections in our country, starting with what he’s trying to do in Texas.”\n\nShe countered an argument some have made — that two wrongs don’t make a right.\n\n“This is self-defense for our democracy,” she said.\n\nThe California plan calls for the state Legislature to approve a constitutional amendment establishing new congressional voting districts crafted to make GOP members vulnerable.\n\nPassage of the bill would result in a special election on Nov. 4, with California voters deciding whether the state should temporarily pause the congressional boundaries created by an independent redistricting commission in 2021 and adopt new maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nIf approved by voters, the measure would include a “trigger” specifying that it would take effect only if Texas or other Republican-led states follow through with redrawing their maps to boost GOP seats before the midterm election. California would revert to its existing redistricting law after the next census and before the 2032 election.\n\nAt least so far, California voters appear uncertain about whether they want to swap Newsom’s plan for the independent redistricting system they previously adopted at the ballot box.\n\nAn Emerson College poll found support for redrawing California’s congressional map at 33% and opposition at 25%. The survey of 1,000 registered voters, conducted Aug. 4 and 5, found that 42% were undecided.\n\nNewsom has expressed confidence that California voters will back his plan, which he is casting as a rebuttal to Trump’s efforts to “rig” the midterm elections.\n\n“I’m confident we’ll get it when people know what it is and what it’s not, and I think, at the end of the day, they understand what’s at stake,” Newsom said Thursday.\n\nNewsom argues that California’s process is more transparent than Trump’s because voters here will see the map and decide whether the state should go forward with it.\n\nTo fulfill Trump’s request for five additional seats, Abbott is attempting to redraw House districts in Texas through a state legislative process that does not require voter approval. It’s unclear what will happen in Austin, with Democrats determined to block the effort and the governor and other Texas Republicans insisting they will keep pressing it.\n\nThe current special session ends Aug. 19. But in an interview with NBC News on Thursday evening, Abbott vowed “to call special session after special session after special session with the same agenda items on there.”\n\nIn addition to arrest on civil warrants, the Democrats are facing threats of being removed from office. Direct-deposit payments to the legislators have been curtailed, forcing them to pick up their checks in person at the state capitol in Austin or go without the money.\n\nThe redistricting fight has strengthened Newsom’s national platform as a potential 2028 presidential contender and bolstered his reputation as a Democrat willing to take the fight to Trump and his allies.\n\nSince Trump took office in January, Newsom had been walking a fine line between calling out the president and working with him in hopes of being able to join together to rebuild from the California wildfires.</p>
