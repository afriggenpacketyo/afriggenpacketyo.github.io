        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ExxonMobil announced second-quarter earnings that, while lower than the previous year, exceeded analyst predictions. This outperformance was largely driven by a significant increase in production, which reached its highest level since the Exxon and Mobil merger over 25 years ago, effectively offsetting the impact of declining global oil prices. The company's refining business also saw a substantial profit increase due to higher margins, and Exxon returned $9.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.

He acknowledged that while Soto had a slow start to the season, his performance leading up to the break was deserving of recognition and predicted he would still have a very successful season. </p>

          <p>A recent poll reveals that a majority of Americans hold the Trump administration and corporate interests responsible for their financial struggles and the rising cost of living. Six in ten respondents blame the administration for increased costs, with particular concern over grocery prices and the potential impact of tariffs on everyday goods. The survey highlights widespread financial anxiety, with many Americans worried about affording basic necessities, skipping meals to make ends meet, and fearing an impending economic recession.

The discussion occurred during a forum addressing the unprecedented hostile environment for jurists, with several participants describing direct threats, swatting incidents, and harassment after ruling on contentious political issues, a climate they feel is being intensified by political leaders.</p>

          <p>Low-income workers and experts are expressing alarm over the Trump administration's significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), predicting a rise in poverty and hunger. The changes shift greater administrative costs to states and expand work requirements, which could disqualify millions of families from receiving benefits. With food prices having risen over 23% in the last four years, many low-wage workers, including single mothers and employees at large corporations like Walmart, describe their increasing reliance on the program and their fear of the dire consequences of the impending cuts.</p>

          <p>A new peer-reviewed study suggests that a mass die-off of monarch butterflies in Southern California in early 2024 was likely caused by exposure to pesticides. Researchers analyzed hundreds of dead or dying butterflies found near a wintering site, noting symptoms consistent with neurotoxic poisoning. Tests on a sample of the insects revealed an average of seven different pesticides in each, at levels suspected to be lethal, providing rare direct evidence of how pesticides impact wild monarch populations and contribute to their long-term decline.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a new anti-money-laundering regulation targeting the precious metals and gems trade to close a significant loophole. Under the new rule, dealers must now report any cash transactions exceeding 100,000 yuan (approximately US$13,870) to the country's financial crime watchdog within five working days. This marks the first time China has extended such supervision beyond traditional financial institutions to a specific non-financial sector, aiming to curb illicit financial flows that exploit the high value and portability of jewels and precious metals.</p>

          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having an emergency fund acts as a crucial "security blanket" for retirement savings by reducing the likelihood of early 401(k) withdrawals. The study found that investors with at least $2,000 in emergency savings are significantly less likely to take out 401(k) loans or make hardship withdrawals to cover unexpected expenses. This is particularly important for hourly workers with volatile incomes, as so-called "leakage" from retirement plans can severely impede long-term financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Increasing global temperatures are making mountaineering more dangerous, as evidenced by the conditions surrounding the recent death of German athlete Laura Dahlmeier in Pakistan. Climate change is causing glaciers and snowpack to melt, which destabilizes rock formations and increases the risk of rockfalls and avalanches on high-altitude peaks in regions like the Karakoram and Himalayas. Experienced climbers report that mountains are changing rapidly, forcing expeditions to adjust their schedules to climb earlier in the season or at night to avoid the most hazardous conditions.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, which is expected to hit the country on Monday with strong winds and heavy rain. It is the fifth named storm of the season and the first since January, with forecasts predicting the most disruptive winds will affect the northern half of the UK. Exposed coastal areas, particularly in Scotland, could experience gusts up to 85 mph, while inland areas may see gusts of 40-45 mph, posing a risk of travel disruptions and damage to trees and temporary structures.</p>

With a vast network of up to 200,000 informal collaborators and 90,000 full-time employees, the Stasi used wiretaps, mail interception, and intimidation to suppress any form of dissent. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the preservation of millions of Stasi files revealed the shocking extent of the surveillance, often showing that friends and family members had been acting as informants.</p>
