          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, world leaders have reacted with a mix of condemnation and calls for de-escalation. Iran has vowed to respond, reserving all options to defend its sovereignty, while Israel has praised the U.S. action as a historic moment. The UN Secretary-General warned of a dangerous escalation, and the EU urged a return to negotiations, highlighting the precariousness of the situation and the need for diplomatic solutions. Saudi Arabia expressed concern, and the Houthi militant group denounced the U.S. action, reflecting the diverse reactions across the globe. The international community is closely monitoring the situation as tensions rise in the Middle East, with concerns over regional stability and the potential for further conflict. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, claiming the facilities were "obliterated." Iranian officials confirmed the attacks but denied suffering a major blow, stating that the sites had been evacuated previously. The U.S. reportedly used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators to target Fordo, while Tomahawk missiles struck Natanz and Isfahan. The Iranian Foreign Minister warned of "everlasting consequences" and reserved the right to defend Iran's sovereignty, raising concerns about potential retaliation. Amidst the conflicting reports, the international community is assessing the damage and potential ramifications of the strikes.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, with the stated objective of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. Trump warned Iran against retaliating, stating that any retaliation would be met with far greater force, while also urging Iran to seek a peace deal with Israel. The U.S. reportedly used B-2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles in the strikes, and the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency stated there was no increase in off-site radiation levels. The strikes have drawn mixed reactions from U.S. lawmakers, with some Republicans supporting the action and Democrats criticizing the lack of congressional authorization.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, wounding at least 21 people. Iranian missiles impacted multiple sites across Israel, including Haifa and Tel Aviv, causing serious damage to buildings. The Israel Defense Forces reported that Iran launched approximately 30 missiles, and searches were underway for people trapped under rubble. This attack occurred hours after President Trump announced U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, further escalating the conflict between the two nations. Since the beginning of Israel's "Operation Rising Lion" against Iran, Iran has fired over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel.</p>

Possible outcomes range from a revolution led by Iranians to an internal coup or military dictatorship.

The pandemic accelerated the shift, with the FDA easing regulations, allowing telehealth for medication abortion, although some states still restrict it. Despite medical acceptance, self-managed abortion faces political challenges, including states restricting access to mifepristone and lawsuits against telehealth providers.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: How Will Iran Respond to the Changed Course of Conflict?</h2>

          <p>Following the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, the trajectory of the war has changed, and the question is how Iran will respond. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu praised President Trump for the decision, while Iran says it had already moved its nuclear material out. The B2 bombers have undoubtedly changed the course of the war, and whether it escalates further will depend on Iran's and its allies' response. Last week, Iran's supreme leader vowed to hit back at the US were it to enter the war.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik reported her husband Bob missing and was later convicted of his murder, largely based on blood found in their bedroom.

After years of appeals and new evidence, her conviction was overturned, and charges were dropped. Dorotik maintains her innocence and argues that authorities focused on her from the beginning, failing to follow other leads.</p>

Research indicates that “shielding” islet cells could improve their survival after transplantation into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. The spleen could be engineered into a transplant hub with the help of nanoparticles. China has the highest number of adults with diabetes in the world, and type 1 diabetes is a genetic autoimmune disorder.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has taken significant risks by ordering strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, gambling that the facilities have been "completely and totally obliterated" and that Iran will not retaliate effectively. He hopes moderates in Iran will recognize their strategic defeat and seek dialogue, but the situation could spiral if Iran manages to hit a US base. Trump is also betting his supporters will support his decision, despite his campaign pledge not to involve America in foreign wars.</p>
