Raleigh, who remains focused on the team's goal of ending their division title drought, expressed humility despite making baseball history.

          <p>The FBI arrested Adeeb Nasir, 58, and Adil Justice Ahmed Nasir, 31, in Utah after an incendiary device was discovered under a FOX 13 News vehicle in Salt Lake City. The device, which was lit but failed to detonate, posed a significant threat to public safety, according to officials. Investigators traced the suspects to a Magna residence, where they found hoax weapons of mass destruction, firearms, bomb-making equipment, and illegal drugs, leading to neighborhood evacuations. The two men face charges including threat of terrorism and possessing explosive devices.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, expressing confidence in his leadership to address city challenges like affordability and public safety. Despite past disagreements, Hochul believes Mamdani shares her commitment to a safer and more opportunity-rich New York, and a firm stance against Donald Trump's agenda. This endorsement from a moderate governor is significant for Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has recently softened some previous positions. The move aims to unify the Democratic party ahead of the mayoral race.</p>

          <p>Florida's Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo's initiative to end vaccine mandates, including for schoolchildren, is causing alarm among parents of immunocompromised children and medical experts. Critics, including Florida's former Surgeon General, warn of potential outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses and overcrowding in hospitals. While some parents support the right to choose, a majority of Florida and US parents favor vaccine requirements. This policy push aligns with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s national efforts to reshape vaccine policy, drawing significant backlash from the scientific community.</p>

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy argues that Manchester United's recurring problems stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 system. Despite tactical improvements in team compactness, individual mistakes continue to cost them points. Murphy highlights Bruno Fernandes playing out of his natural attacking role in central midfield, leading to defensive lapses. Similarly, Luke Shaw's placement in a back three, rather than his usual left-back position, contributes to defensive vulnerabilities. Murphy suggests that until personnel are better utilized within the system, United's struggles are likely to persist.</p>
