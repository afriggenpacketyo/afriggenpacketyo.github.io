          <p>Oak View Group CEO Tim Leiweke faces a federal criminal conspiracy charge for his alleged role in rigging the bidding process for the University of Texas' Moody Center arena. The indictment accuses Leiweke of conspiring with a competitor to have them drop their bid in exchange for lucrative sub-contracts, a promise he allegedly later broke. As part of the case, Oak View Group and Legends Hospitality are expected to enter non-prosecution agreements and pay substantial penalties totaling over $16 million.</p>

          <p>According to newly obtained audio, former President Donald Trump told campaign donors in 2024 that he had threatened to "bomb the s--- out of Moscow" to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. The article, citing a forthcoming book, notes he made a similar, though less credible, threat to Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding a potential invasion of Taiwan. These remarks, made at a private meeting, underscore Trump's often candid and aggressive rhetoric behind closed doors regarding foreign policy.</p>

Health experts attribute the resurgence of the highly contagious virus, which was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, to declining childhood vaccination rates that have compromised herd immunity.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who served as President Joe Biden's physician, declined to answer questions during a closed-door deposition with the House Oversight Committee, citing doctor-patient privilege and his Fifth Amendment rights. The Republican-led committee is investigating Biden's health and mental acuity during his time in office. The move was criticized by the committee's chairman as a "cover-up," while Democrats defended it as a necessary precaution given a parallel Justice Department investigation ordered by President Trump.</p>
