          <p>Communities along the Mississippi River south of New Orleans are grappling with increasing saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico, a problem exacerbated by drought, sea-level rise, and dredging. The intrusion is contaminating drinking water, devastating the seafood industry, and corroding water supply pipes, costing Plaquemines Parish an estimated $200 million to fix. While the Army Corps of Engineers has built underwater barriers, the intrusion continues to threaten New Orleans' fragile water infrastructure, prompting calls for more permanent solutions like desalination facilities and strengthening the river's flow. Residents and officials urge preparedness and infrastructure upgrades to mitigate the ongoing crisis.</p>
