          <p>A D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel has placed limits on the Trump administration's policy of summarily expelling migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying standard asylum applications, it ruled that the government cannot ignore U.S. laws requiring consideration for other humanitarian protections. Specifically, migrants must still be allowed to apply for "withholding of removal" and protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture, which have a higher legal standard but are mandatory if met. The ruling represents a partial setback for the administration's sweeping border crackdown.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area based on factors like race or language. The ruling affirms that agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals and cannot base arrests solely on ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or being in a particular location. This decision is a setback for the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, which critics argued led to unconstitutional racial profiling. The court found that such broad factors do not meet the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures.</p>

          <p>Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton described his own performance as "useless" after a disappointing qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he secured 12th place. In contrast, his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc captured a surprise pole position, the team's first of the season. Hamilton expressed frustration with his driving, stating it had "nothing to do with the car," and congratulated Leclerc on his achievement. Leclerc's pole was unexpected, as he credited a sudden change in wind conditions and recent car upgrades for the improved performance, which allowed him to outperform the dominant McLaren drivers.</p>

Despite being down 9-0 early and later 15-6, the Rockies mounted a sustained offensive effort throughout the game. The comeback culminated in a dramatic ninth inning, where a two-run walk-off home run by Brenton Doyle sealed the win. According to Elias Sports Bureau, this victory marks one of the few times in modern MLB history a team has won after allowing nine or more runs in the opening frame.</p>

The U.S. Forest Service issued the advisory after water quality tests confirmed the contamination, prompting the resort to locate and repair the leak. While no illnesses have been reported, the public is advised to stay out of the water in the affected area, which stretches from Jameson Beach to the Valhalla Boathouse.

          <p>An investigation has reportedly uncovered over 50 fraudulent signatures, including those of deceased individuals, on New York City Mayor Eric Adams's petition to run as an independent candidate. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far exceeding the 7,500 required, the findings raise questions about the practices of contractors hired to collect them. The campaign stated it expects contractors to follow the law and will conduct its own review. The discovery adds another layer of complexity to a crowded mayoral race featuring multiple independent candidates alongside the major party nominees.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced that Hamas's Beit Hanun Battalion in northern Gaza has been defeated, with a group of its terrorists surrendering to IDF troops. The militants emerged from a tunnel and, during on-site questioning, revealed they had planned to flee after another operative was killed in a clash. They led soldiers to a nearby weapons cache containing firearms, grenades, and vests. The IDF is currently examining the tunnel network in the area, which had been a base for threats against nearby Israeli communities like Sderot.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Erika McEntarfer, has drawn sharp condemnation from several senior Republican lawmakers. Senators Cynthia Lummis, Thom Tillis, and Rand Paul all questioned the move, which followed a disappointing jobs report, warning that it undermines the credibility of objective government data. William Beach, a former BLS commissioner appointed by Trump, called the firing "totally groundless" and a "dangerous precedent." Critics from both parties argue that politicizing the agency could destroy public trust and harm economic decision-making.</p>

          <p>A new memoir by a former rural mail carrier in Virginia highlights the vital role postal workers play in maintaining a sense of order and predictability, especially in an increasingly fragmented society. The book explores the challenges and rewards of the job, reinforcing the idea that the daily act of mail delivery is a form of quiet heroism. Whether serving the most remote communities in America or helping areas recover from natural disasters, the consistency of the postal service provides a crucial link to normalcy. This work underscores the human connection and reliability inherent in the federal service.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that past hostile comments from Sean "Diddy" Combs make the prospect of a presidential pardon "more difficult." In a recent interview, Trump acknowledged that he considers Combs "sort of half-innocent" following his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, but acquittal on more serious counts. However, he referenced Combs's past statements, in which the music mogul called for Trump to be "banished" from office, as a complicating factor. Trump admitted that while he tries not to let such things cloud his judgment, it is hard to ignore when making such a decision.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals a stark contrast in the amount of apartment space a renter can get for $1,500 per month in major U.S. cities. In Manhattan, that budget secures an average of just 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, it can afford a spacious 1,329 square feet. The data highlights the extreme housing affordability gap between expensive coastal markets like Boston and San Francisco and more affordable cities in the Midwest and South. This disparity is driven by factors like housing supply, zoning laws, and land availability, creating vastly different living standards for renters nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his new HBO Max special, "Panicked," comedian Marc Maron continues to blend his signature cantankerous and ruminative style to tackle both catastrophic current events and personal anxieties. The article describes the special as part of a loose trilogy where Maron confronts everything from climate change and political decline to his father's dementia and his own childhood trauma. Rather than seeking simple entertainment, Maron uses comedy as a vehicle for recursive self-reflection and emotional excavation. His style remains consistent, offering a raw and unflinching look at a world that provides little solid footing.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has found Tesla partially responsible for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot technology, ordering the company to pay over $240 million in damages. The case involved a driver who, while distracted, crashed into a parked vehicle, killing one person and injuring another. The plaintiffs' lawyers successfully argued that Tesla's technology failed and that the company misled consumers with the "Autopilot" name, while also accusing Tesla of hiding key data evidence. This verdict could set a significant precedent for future lawsuits against the automaker regarding its driver-assist systems.</p>

          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has surged to €3,248, a figure that is becoming unsustainable for many retirees whose average pensions are much lower. This dramatic increase is driven by rising wages for nursing staff and higher maintenance costs, placing a heavy financial burden on residents and their families. German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform of the country's long-term care insurance system, as the gap between income and expenditure widens. With an aging population, experts warn the current system is on the verge of collapse without significant structural changes. (not investment advice)</p>
