        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal of the president's order is pending. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing that the majority undervalued the devastating consequences of upending the lives of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are still being considered. She added that the court-ordered stays exist to minimize harm to litigating parties, not to maximize it, and that the government seeks a stay to inflict maximum pre-decision damage. This decision allows the Trump administration to proceed with its immigration policies while the legal challenges continue. The ruling has ignited debate over the rights and treatment of immigrants in the United States.</p>

          <h2>Millennials' Hesitation Towards Parenthood Examined</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 11:08:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times opinion piece explores the reasons why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children. The author suggests that a redefinition of "harm," "abuse," and "trauma" has led to nearly impossible standards for parenting. Adult children are more likely to cut off contact with parents, citing emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, or issues like clashing values and feeling unsupported. This cultural shift contributes to a heightened expectation for parents to ensure their children's career success and mental well-being into adulthood, making the prospect of parenthood daunting for many millennials.</p>

          <p>The Orleans Parish District Attorney and Sheriff are embroiled in a dispute following a massive jailbreak involving 10 inmates. District Attorney Jason Williams criticized the sheriff's office, suggesting it had been compromised, while Sheriff Susan Hutson filed a lawsuit seeking to bar Williams from investigating the jailbreak. The Louisiana Attorney General's office will now lead the investigation into the escape, which occurred on May 16, as two inmates remain at large. The conflict highlights the tensions between law enforcement agencies in New Orleans and the challenges in addressing systemic failures that led to the jailbreak.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Health Forum estimates that removing fluoride from public drinking water supplies in the US would lead to an additional 25.4 million cavities in children over five years.

The study contradicts claims made in a recent report led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which downplayed the protective effects of fluoride.

While Beijing has denounced the move as "discriminatory" and lodged diplomatic protests, its response has been notably restrained compared to previous accusations of "regime change." Observers suggest that China's measured approach stems from its focus on trade negotiations with the Trump administration and a belief that the policies will ultimately harm the US.

          <p>President Trump lashed out in response to the viral "TACO trade" meme, which stands for "Trump always chickens out." The phrase, coined by a Financial Times columnist, mocks the president's back-and-forth on tariff policies. The sentiment behind the phrase is that Trump repeatedly pushes back deadlines, lowers tariff percentages, and backs off from initial demands. When asked about the meme, Trump defended his decision to slash tariffs on China and push back deadlines for tariffs on European Union countries, appearing agitated and calling the question "nasty." The legality of Trump's sweeping tariffs is currently in limbo after a court ruling.</p>

The plan, included in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," proposes repayment terms of up to 30 years, which is longer than most current repayment plans. Under the proposed changes, borrowers would have only two repayment options: a fixed payment plan over 10 to 25 years or an income-driven repayment plan with loan forgiveness after 30 years. While supporters argue that the plan ensures borrowers pay down their principal, critics fear it will burden individuals with debt for an extended period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for children, stating that kids with no underlying health conditions "may receive" the vaccines, replacing a broad recommendation for all children. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children and most adults. The agency has also deleted a statement that the guidance had been recommended by a committee, approved by the CDC, and backed by outside medical groups.</p>

The Amazon Fire Stick is identified as a major enabler of piracy, allowing access to illegal streams.
