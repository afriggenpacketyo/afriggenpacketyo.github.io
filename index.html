          <p>President Trump announced another 75-day delay in enforcing the TikTok ban, citing ongoing negotiations for a potential sale of the platform's US operations.  This follows previous delays and a proposed deal involving American investors, but ByteDance's statement indicates unresolved issues and the need for Chinese government approval.  The situation highlights the complexities of balancing national security concerns with the platform's popularity and the involvement of Chinese law.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court temporarily allowed the Trump administration to cancel millions in federal education grants, citing a lack of lower court jurisdiction and the states' ability to recover funds later.  The 5-4 decision paused a lower court order requiring the reinstatement of grants, which funded diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
