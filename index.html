          <p>Frontier Airlines is offering its annual "GoWild!" all-you-can-fly pass for a promotional price of $299 before it increases to $599. The pass, valid for 20 months through April 2027, allows for unlimited flights with significant restrictions, including limited booking windows and numerous blackout dates during peak travel periods. This strategic move is viewed by industry experts as an opportunity for Frontier to gain market share while other budget airlines face financial difficulties. Additional fees for extras like seat selection and checked bags still apply to passholders.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his administration will ask the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to overturn a federal appeals court decision that deemed most of his tariffs illegal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the authority to impose such tariffs is a power vested exclusively in Congress. Trump argued that the tariffs are essential for the nation's financial stability and claimed the stock market was down due to the ruling. The administration plans to file its appeal quickly, seeking a decision before the lower court's stay expires.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted a strike on a boat originating from Venezuela that was allegedly carrying drugs in the southern Caribbean Sea. President Trump announced the action, stating the military had "shot out" the vessel, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio later described it as a "lethal strike" on a boat operated by a narco-terrorist organization. This event occurs amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela's government and follows a recent U.S. Navy deployment to the region for an anti-drug cartel mission. Details about the vessel's operators remain limited.</p>

          <p>England's one-day international cricket team, under new captain Harry Brook, suffered a significant defeat against South Africa at Headingley. After Brook's run-out, England's batting lineup collapsed, losing seven wickets for just 21 runs and finishing all out for 131. The loss highlights potential issues with player fatigue and a lack of preparation, as the team transitions between different formats with a packed schedule. While Brook framed it as a "bad day," the performance raises concerns about the team's current form and management ahead of upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruling that President Trump's tariffs are illegal has created significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and raises the possibility of refunding billions of dollars in collected duties. While the decision is stayed until October 14 pending a likely Supreme Court appeal, logistics professionals report that shippers are currently maintaining a "wait and see" approach. The article explores the complexities of a potential refund process, which could be an enormous administrative challenge. Despite the legal setback for the administration, experts believe trade volatility will remain the new normal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has approved a plan to send up to 600 military and civilian lawyers to the Department of Justice to serve as temporary immigration judges. The move, requested by the Justice Department, is intended to address a massive backlog of approximately 3.5 million cases in the nation's immigration courts. This deployment will effectively double the current number of immigration judges, a figure that has dwindled due to firings and resignations. The lawyers will be sent in groups of 150 for initial terms of up to 179 days.</p>

          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by credit card debt, debt consolidation offers a potential path to financial relief, primarily through two different methods: loans and programs. A debt consolidation loan involves taking out a new, single loan with a lower interest rate to pay off multiple existing debts, simplifying payments. In contrast, a debt consolidation program is a service offered by a debt relief company that negotiates with creditors on the borrower's behalf, often involving a structured payment plan. The best option depends on an individual's credit score, financial situation, and comfort level with managing the process independently.</p>

Experts advise against shopping around for the perfect rate for too long, as banks may preemptively lower their offers, making it crucial to lock in a high rate quickly. Another mistake is failing to monitor the rate climate closely, as changes can happen before the Fed's official announcement. Finally, savers with maturing CDs should avoid letting them automatically roll over into a new account, which will likely have a lower interest rate.</p>

          <p>The Trump family's net worth has increased by approximately $5 billion on paper following the public trading launch of a cryptocurrency token from their venture, World Liberty Financial. The token, known as $WLFI, began trading on major exchanges, giving a market valuation to the significant holdings of the president and his family. The venture, launched during the presidential campaign, has drawn criticism regarding potential conflicts of interest as the administration shapes crypto regulations. While early investors can sell a portion of their holdings, the Trump family is reportedly barred from selling their tokens.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie has filed a discharge petition in an attempt to force a full House vote on legislation compelling the Department of Justice to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by Democrat Ro Khanna, would require the release within 30 days. A discharge petition is a procedural tool that can bypass leadership to bring a bill to the floor if it gains 218 signatures. The move comes as House Republican leadership scheduled a different, less direct bill related to the Epstein investigation, which Massie criticized as a meaningless political cover.</p>

          <p>U.S. lawmakers have returned to Washington with only 14 legislative days to pass a funding bill and prevent a government shutdown before the September 30 deadline. A short-term continuing resolution is expected, but securing bipartisan support will be challenging amid deep divisions over spending levels for fiscal year 2026. Democrats have already denounced proposed Republican cuts to health, research, and education programs. The tense fiscal negotiations are further complicated by other pressing issues, including debates over the release of the Epstein files and the federal response to crime in major cities.</p>

          <p>An international coalition of more than 85 climate experts has released a detailed review criticizing a recent Department of Energy report on greenhouse gases as being "full of errors" and not representative of current climate science. The experts argue the DOE report, authored by individuals selected by a former fossil fuel executive, misrepresents scientific literature and cherry-picks data to downplay the economic damage of warming. The critique asserts the government report is biased and unfit to inform policy, reflecting a broader concern among scientists about the politicization of science under the current administration.</p>

The article suggests that new investors should not be deterred by the high per-ounce price, as there are more affordable entry points like gold ETFs, stocks, or fractional gold bars and coins. It also recommends a dollar-cost averaging approach, where a fixed amount of money is invested at regular intervals, to build a position over time without a large initial outlay.

          <p>In an open letter, nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have condemned President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position. The signatories argue that this action threatens the central bank's crucial political independence and undermines trust in the U.S. financial system. The letter comes after the president publicly accused Cook of "mortgage fraud" and cited it as cause for her removal. The economists assert that the Federal Reserve was designed to be insulated from daily politics and that the attacks on Cook are based on unproven accusations.</p>

The modest crypto gain was overshadowed by a significant rally in gold, which surpassed $3,500 an ounce for the first time, reinforcing its traditional safe-haven status amid economic uncertainty. The broader market sell-off was linked to concerns over the legality of global tariffs and their potential financial repercussions. While Bitcoin benefited from some of the same themes driving gold, its performance has recently been tempered by a market rotation into other crypto assets like Ethereum.</p>
