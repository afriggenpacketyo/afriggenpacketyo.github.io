          <p>Heavy rainfall caused severe flooding in Mokwa, a market town in north-central Nigeria, resulting in at least 151 deaths and displacing over 3,000 people. The flooding affected approximately 500 households across three communities, leaving residents waist-deep in water and causing significant destruction to properties and farm produce. President Bola Tinubu has directed the activation of the national emergency response center to provide assistance, including search-and-rescue operations, relief materials, and temporary shelter. Residents are mourning the dead and awaiting news of missing loved ones while lamenting the extensive damage to the town, a vital trading hub for food supplies. The situation underscores the increasing vulnerability of northern Nigerian communities to climate change-induced extreme weather events. The optimism score is 15.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are taking a more cautious approach to summer vacations this year due to trade tensions and recession fears, leading to scaled-back spending plans, according to a report by Deloitte. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, average summer travel budgets have decreased, with travelers cutting back on in-destination spending, opting for cheaper lodging, and choosing to drive instead of fly. Despite lower travel costs, such as hotel room rates, rental car costs, and airfares, inflation is impacting discretionary spending, prompting travelers to seek flexibility in travel dates, destinations, and activities to save money. Experts recommend flexibility as the key to saving on summer travel, especially around federal holiday weekends when prices tend to spike. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury strategy, which significantly boosted Strategy's market capitalization, is now being emulated by various companies, including meme stock firms and multinational conglomerates. Despite announcements from Trump Media and GameStop regarding bitcoin acquisitions, Wall Street remains skeptical, as evidenced by the drop in their stock prices. Saylor views this trend as a global shift in corporate finance, with increasing interest in bitcoin treasury companies worldwide, further accelerated by the Biden administration's treatment of corporate bitcoin adoption as a regulatory red flag. The Trump administration has established a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, funded through seized bitcoin, and is exploring budget-neutral acquisition mechanisms, signaling a geopolitical race in corporate bitcoin adoption. The optimism score is 75. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have decided to upgrade their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a thaw in their strained relationship.

          <p>Workers at the US Department of Energy are raising alarms about budget cuts and deregulation, claiming it undermines the department's ability to function and will lead to increased energy costs for consumers. Proposed budget cuts of $19.3 billion and the elimination of 47 regulations are expected to save nearly $11 billion, but critics argue that these actions will add $54 billion in utility energy costs and negatively impact research and development in renewable energy. Employees report low morale due to attacks on civil servants and the loss of talent and knowledge throughout the agency. A former senior official warns that these cuts will increase prices for everyone, compromising the country's competitiveness. The optimism score is 25.</p>

          <p>Following a dramatic rock fall and glacier collapse in the Swiss LÃ¶tschental valley, officials have reported that the situation has stabilized overnight. The Lonza River, which had been blocked behind ice and debris, has found new paths down the valley, reducing the risk of a flood wave. Construction machinery has been deployed to manage the water runoff, and residents have been alerted to remain vigilant due to forecast rain, which could increase the risk of further landslides.
