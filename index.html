          <p>The Trump administration announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which reportedly includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports and significant purchases of American goods. President Trump stated Indonesia committed to buying $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. However, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto confirmed a positive discussion but did not verify the specific terms of the agreement. This development follows a similar pattern to a recent trade announcement with Vietnam, where details remained unconfirmed by the foreign government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Inflation Rate for June Exceeds Expectations, Reaching 3.6%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 02:47:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's annual inflation rate unexpectedly rose to 3.6% in June, surpassing economists' forecasts of 3.4% and increasing pressure on consumers. The Office for National Statistics attributed the rise primarily to motor fuel prices, while food price inflation also continued to climb. This data complicates the Bank of England's upcoming interest rate decision as it balances fighting persistent inflation with addressing lackluster economic growth. Despite the high inflation, many economists still anticipate a rate cut in August to support the contracting economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Sir Ben Wallace has defended his decision to seek an injunction preventing media from reporting on a major data leak, stating it was to protect individuals at risk, not a cover-up. The breach exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK relocation, potentially endangering them under Taliban rule. The information, including the creation of a new £850m resettlement scheme for those affected, was only revealed after a High Court judge lifted the gagging order, sparking criticism about the lack of parliamentary oversight.</p>

          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, driven by strong demand for AI-related chips. However, the company issued cautious guidance, forecasting third-quarter revenue below estimates and expressing uncertainty about its growth prospects for 2026 due to macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. ASML, a critical player in the global chip supply chain, narrowed its 2025 sales growth forecast to 15%. The mixed outlook reflects the broader industry's struggle with uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A farmer in Jones, Oklahoma, was killed after being attacked by two water buffaloes he had recently purchased. Police reported that the victim, Bradley McMichael, became trapped in the animals' enclosure while tending to them.

The second animal also became agitated and was dispatched for safety reasons, with evidence confirming the buffaloes were responsible for McMichael's fatal injuries.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent shift to supply Ukraine with anti-missile systems and threaten Russia with tariffs appears driven by financial persuasion rather than a change in strategic outlook. European allies have successfully framed their support for Ukraine in transactional terms, including creating a co-owned investment fund and pledging to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP. This approach has convinced Trump that Europe is paying its share, making him a more willing, albeit still unreliable, ally.

          <p>The National League won the MLB All-Star Game after it ended in a 6-6 tie, forcing the event's first-ever home run swing-off to determine a victor. The American League had rallied from a 6-0 deficit to tie the game in the ninth inning. In the tiebreaker, Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs on three swings to give the NL a 4-3 edge, securing the win and earning him the MVP award. This dramatic conclusion, implemented in 2022 to avoid games running out of pitchers, provided a memorable end to the contest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's imports of naphtha, a key petrochemical feedstock, are forecast to hit a record high this year, driven by the launch of new plants and caution regarding U.S. propane and ethane supplies. Analysts predict imports could reach 16 to 17 million metric tons as cracker operators diversify their supply chains away from the U.S. amid trade war uncertainties. This surge in demand from the world's largest petrochemical producer is expected to provide significant support for Asian refiners' margins for the feedstock throughout the rest of the year.

Prosecutors allege that Craig, who was having an affair and facing financial difficulties, murdered his wife of 23 years for a life insurance payout. They presented evidence of his internet searches on how to make a murder look like a heart attack. The defense argues the evidence is insufficient and suggested the victim, described as "broken" by her husband's infidelity, may have taken her own life.</p>
