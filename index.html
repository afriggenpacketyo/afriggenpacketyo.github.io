          <p>The Trump administration has ended a program crucial to the search for an HIV vaccine, marking the latest in a series of cuts to HIV research and prevention programs. This decision raises concerns among health experts about the potential impact on efforts to combat the disease. The program's termination could hinder progress in developing a vaccine and implementing effective prevention strategies, potentially leading to setbacks in the fight against HIV. The move reflects a broader trend of reduced funding for public health initiatives under the current administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting that the U.S. would maintain control of the steelmaker while Nippon invests $14 billion in U.S. facilities. Trump announced a plan to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% and promised no layoffs or outsourcing, with U.S. Steel maintaining full capacity for at least 10 years. He portrayed himself as a skilled dealmaker, claiming he rejected previous offers from Nippon until realizing their commitment to investing in America.

The proposal includes evaluating the value of a person’s primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund, and is projected to save millions of dollars annually.

          <p>The CDC has updated its vaccine schedules, recommending COVID-19 vaccines for children based on shared clinical decision-making between doctors and patients. This change follows a directive from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., removing the routine recommendation for COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. Professional medical groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, continue to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for children and pregnant women. Public health experts are concerned about the closed-door process used to make these changes, which could impact vaccine accessibility and insurance coverage.</p>

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that targets public broadcasting. The lawsuit accuses the administration of unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and violating the First Amendment. PBS argues that the executive order is viewpoint discrimination and an infringement of press freedoms. The Trump administration claims that NPR and PBS have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars, which the networks vehemently deny.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while decreasing reliance on China. Trump also said that $14bn would be invested into the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel. Details on the partnership are still unclear and both companies have yet to confirm a deal.</p>

Critics suggest that class prejudice may be a factor in the sport's lack of recognition compared to rugby union. Rugby union, often seen as having more middle-class roots, has received knighthoods for more than 100 years.</p>
