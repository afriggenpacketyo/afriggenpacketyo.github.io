            <p>President Trump and Speaker Johnson are pushing for the Senate's budget resolution, crucial for extending Trump's tax cuts, despite House Republican opposition citing insufficient spending cuts. Johnson is attempting to sway GOP holdouts, though some claim they weren't invited to related meetings. The resolution is the first step in reconciliation, bypassing the Senate's 60-vote threshold. However, disagreements on spending cuts remain unresolved, potentially leading to future confrontations. The Senate plan relies on a 'current policy' budget scoring method, while House Republicans argue for deeper cuts.</p>

            <p>A public feud has erupted between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro, with Navarro claiming Tesla is merely a car assembler relying on foreign parts, while Musk vehemently denies this, asserting Tesla manufactures the most American-made cars. Fact-checking reveals Tesla is more vertically integrated than most automakers, building its own batteries and even a lithium refinery. While tariffs on car parts are expected to disrupt the auto industry, analysts believe Tesla will be less affected than its rivals. Government data indicates that 75% of parts for Tesla's Model 3 Long Range are sourced from the U.S. or Canada.</p>

The appeals panel questioned the breadth of the judge's order, with concerns that it effectively took over control of the VA campus.

            <p>Hannah Hampton and Mary Earps are competing for the starting goalkeeper position for England at the Women's Euros. Earps, a two-time FIFA goalkeeper of the year, has been the preferred choice, but Wiegman has favored rotating her goalkeepers since the beginning of 2024, selecting Hampton in six of England's past 10 matches. Hampton has been selected in three of England's four Women's Nations League matches, including the win over world champions Spain. Hampton is eight years younger than 32-year-old Earps, is this a sign that Wiegman and England are looking to the future?</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that three-quarters of young academy footballers in England suffer from gum disease, leading to training disruptions for some. The study identifies factors such as poor hygiene habits, sugary drink consumption, and stress as contributing to the problem. Researchers recommend a multi-factor approach, including education on cardiovascular risks linked to oral diseases and routine dental care for players. The study highlights the importance of recognizing the connection between oral health and overall physical performance.</p>

            <p>Jim Cramer stated that the market is struggling to react to President Trump's ever-changing statements and policies, leading to volatile trading. Stocks initially surged before plunging into the red following confirmation of tariffs on China. Cramer noted that the short-term outlook is 'awful' due to Trump's tariff policies, which are vexing investors. He believes that investors will regain confidence once the pace of policy changes slows and actions are more carefully considered. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Atlantic discusses President Trump's focus on due process for himself while seemingly wanting to strip it from others. The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to continue deporting people under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, while Justice Sotomayor warned that this distinction was only somewhat meaningful: “Individuals who are unable to secure counsel, or who cannot timely appeal an adverse judgment … face the prospect of removal directly into the perilous conditions” at a notorious Salvadoran prison. In the documents case, Trump filed multiple requests and repeatedly won favorable and erratic rulings from Judge Aileen Cannon. The article argues that Trump's exploitation of due process is in contrast to his attempts to deny it to others.</p>

            <p>After his programme of global tariffs knocked some US$10 trillion off worldwide markets since last week, US President Donald Trump sowed more diplomatic and trade confusion on Tuesday as he focused on China. A day of dizzying geopolitical swings ended with the White House announcing that additional 50 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports would go into effect on Wednesday. Most economists say the programme risks fuelling inflation in the US as well as a highly destructive global trade war.</p>

Sheinbaum emphasized Mexico's stance against intervention and interference, advocating for coordination and collaboration instead. While agreeing to increased surveillance flights, military strikes would likely cross a red line and damage U.S.-Mexico relations. Sheinbaum has won praise for her handling of tariff negotiations and stepped-up actions against organized crime, but rejects assertions that Mexico is run by cartels.</p>

Americans seeking retirement or survivor benefits from the Social Security Administration will no longer be able to apply over the phone, starting on Monday.

            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House cannot exclude Associated Press reporters from events open to other journalists, citing First Amendment violations. The ruling follows the White House's decision to restrict AP's access after the news agency declined to adopt the administration's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America'. The judge's decision requires the White House to restore AP's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other spaces. The White House has been given until Sunday to appeal the ruling.</p>
