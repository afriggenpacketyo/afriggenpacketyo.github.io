          <p>The White House announced a trade deal with China, but details remain scarce. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent mentioned "substantial progress" in Geneva trade talks, hinting at a de-escalation in the trade war that has affected the global economy since President Trump's tariff announcement in April. The Chinese officials also spoke positively, suggesting that a statement would be released soon. This potential easing of tensions could offer relief to the global economy, which has been strained by ongoing trade disputes. Optimism that this trade deal will be beneficial to all parties is high, but there is still much to be seen.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) criticized a Worcester, Massachusetts city council member for allegedly inciting chaos during the arrest of a "violent criminal alien" by ICE agents. According to the DHS, Councilor Etel Haxhiaj obstructed law enforcement, leading to a tense situation where a crowd protested the arrest. The Worcester Police Patrol Officers’ Union echoed these concerns, stating that Haxhiaj assaulted officers and incited aggression. An ethics investigation into Haxhiaj’s behavior is now being requested, while another individual was arrested for assaulting police officers during the incident. This event highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the role of local officials.</p>

          <p>The initial group of White South Africans, known as Afrikaners, who were granted refugee status by the U.S. departed from Johannesburg for Washington, D.C. following President Trump's executive order to resettle Afrikaners facing "government-sponsored race-based discrimination". The South African government denies these claims, viewing the resettlement as politically motivated. This initiative contrasts sharply with the Trump administration's broader refugee policies, which have largely restricted refugee admissions. The resettlement has strained relations between South Africa and the United States, raising questions about the fairness and consistency of U.S. refugee policies.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is reportedly donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane, raising ethical questions and prompting a Government Accountability Office investigation. While Qatar's Media Attaché acknowledged the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use, they disputed reports of an immediate gift. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres has urged an ethics review, citing potential violations of federal ethics regulations and the Emoluments Clause. The plane, estimated to be worth $400 million, would be donated to the future Trump presidential library after he leaves office, and if Trump accepts the plane, the gift would be a new precedent.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "Thunderbolts" and Ryan Coogler's "Sinners" continued to lead the North American box office charts this weekend, despite facing competition from new releases. "Thunderbolts" secured the top spot with $33.1 million, while "Sinners" followed closely behind. The overall box office performance has seen a boost, with year-to-date figures rising approximately 16% compared to last year, driven by successes like "A Minecraft Movie," "Sinners," and "Thunderbolts." However, the cumulative box office remains more than 32% lower compared to 2019, which shows a need for improvement.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian president stated his readiness to meet with Russia’s leader in Turkey, while insisting on an immediate truce before negotiations can begin. President Trump urged Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks, rather than insist on a cease-fire first. European leaders had set a deadline of Monday for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire, or face additional sanctions. Mr. Zelensky added a new twist to the diplomatic brinkmanship, saying he would personally attend negotiations, but did not clarify whether his participation would depend on Russia first accepting a cease-fire.</p>

          <p>This article argues against the simplistic narrative that the artificial intelligence (AI) race is solely between the United States and China. The author contends that such a binary view neglects the agency and interests of other countries, multinational organizations, and powerful corporations. Unbridled AI development poses significant risks, including the loss of human control over autonomous weapons systems. While AI model training is resource-intensive, model performance is only one aspect of the broader equation, and focusing solely on a US-China competition overlooks the complex global landscape of AI development and its potential consequences.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Sir Keir Starmer, is considering plans to tighten English tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependents as part of an overhaul of the immigration system. Migrants may have to wait 10 years to apply to settle in the UK, instead of automatically gaining settled status after five years. The move is part of a wider effort to "tighten up" what the prime minister called a "broken" immigration system. The changes will also end automatic settlement in the UK after five years. Most migrants will need to stay at least ten years before they can apply for settle status and begin the path to gaining full citizenship.</p>

The incident highlights the starkly different visions of Israel's future held by settlers like Sharvit, who believe the West Bank was given by God to the Jews, and activists who advocate for peaceful coexistence with Palestinians. The UN's top court ruled last year that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is against international law and that all settlement activity is illegal.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-funded charter plane carrying white South Africans, who claim discrimination in their home country, has departed for the United States, where the Trump administration is welcoming them as refugees. This move comes as the administration halts virtually all other refugee admissions. The Afrikaners say they have been denied jobs and targeted by violence because of their race. South African officials have criticized the refugee initiative, calling it a politically motivated attempt to discredit the country. This program has deepened tensions between South Africa and the United States.</p>

          <p>Hamas says it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, as a part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. Hamas said it was also intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid. The Israeli prime minister's office said it had been informed by the US of the Hamas intention to release Alexander "as a gesture towards the Americans" and that the move was expected to lead to negotiations on further hostages. Hamas has in the past said it will only agree to a deal that includes the end of the war, something that has been repeatedly rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar to use as Air Force One, a move likely to raise legal and ethical questions.

A statement from Qatar acknowledged it had held discussions with the US about “the possible transfer” of a plane to be used temporarily by Trump as his presidential aircraft, usurping Air Force One. Assuming Trump accepts the plane as planned, the jumbo jet would first be transferred to the US air force so the military branch could configure the aircraft to meet the specifications required for presidential travel.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reported that the United States and China have made “substantial progress” in trade talks after a weekend of meetings in Geneva, with additional details to be announced on Monday. Any indication of a trade truce between the world’s two largest economies would lift financial markets and ease concerns among companies, investors and economists that the global economy was poised for a sharp downturn. Mr. Trump has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax. Economists have warned that the trade dispute will slow global growth and fuel inflation, potentially tipping the United States into a recession.</p>
