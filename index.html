        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain's Cameron Norrie experienced his seventh consecutive loss to 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in the US Open fourth round. Despite Djokovic battling a lower back injury in the early sets and requiring a medical time-out, he ultimately secured a 6-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 6-3 victory. Norrie, who briefly led in the third set, admitted to being "a little overconfident" after breaking serve. This defeat ends British singles interest at the season's final major, though Norrie remains positive about his career trajectory following recent form improvements. Djokovic's powerful serve, including a US Open match-high 18 aces, proved decisive in the nearly three-hour contest.</p>

          <p>South Korea has officially indicted its former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, on serious charges of bribery and market manipulation. She is accused of accumulating over 1 billion won (approximately $720,000) through a stock manipulation scheme between 2010 and 2012, and illegally obtaining 270 million won in opinion poll data, alongside 80 million won in bribes from the Unification Church in 2022. These indictments follow the impeachment of her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, earlier this year for a short-lived martial law bid. The legal actions are part of broader investigations into Yoon's administration, which he had previously attempted to block.</p>

          <p>Russia initiated a "massive attack" on Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region early Saturday, with explosions reported in the cities of Dnipro and Pavlograd. Regional Governor Sergiy Lysak urged residents to seek immediate shelter, noting that two people had tragically died in previous overnight Russian attacks. While Dnipropetrovsk has largely been spared heavy fighting since the February 2022 invasion, Kyiv recently confirmed the presence of Russian troops in the region. This intensified aggression occurs as the European Union considers establishing a military training mission inside Ukraine, and the White House continues to advocate for ceasefire and peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>China has strongly condemned Japan's anticipated deployment of the US-made Typhon intermediate-range missile system during upcoming joint military exercises with the United States. The Chinese foreign ministry stated that such a move in Asian countries would "further undermine the legitimate security interests of other countries," urging both nations not to introduce the system. Japanese media reported that the Typhon system would be deployed at the US Iwakuni base in Yamaguchi prefecture during September's large-scale field training, which considers China as a notional enemy. Analysts view this deployment as a strategic signal against Beijing, particularly in the event of a conflict over Taiwan.</p>

The dismissal, effective immediately, underscores the department's firm stance on supporting law enforcement, as publicly reiterated by DoJ spokespersons. This incident occurs amidst President Trump's controversial deployment of hundreds of National Guard members to Washington and other major US cities, including Los Angeles, citing a crime emergency. The federal takeover of the city's police department and the broader presence of federal agents have drawn criticism despite official data showing declining violent crime.</p>

          <p>California and Texas are at the epicenter of an intense national political battle over congressional redistricting, a struggle poised to significantly impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. Texas's Republican-majority legislature recently redrew maps to create five new Republican-leaning congressional seats, prompting California's Democratic lawmakers to swiftly counter with their own efforts to boost Democratic representation by an equivalent number. Missouri has since joined the fray, aiming to add another Republican seat, as President Trump actively encourages loyal statehouses to reshape district lines. This unusual mid-decade gerrymandering, though legal, aims to influence the closely contested US House ahead of next year's midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a significant ruling blocking the Trump administration's expanded use of fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, across the United States. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb cited serious due process concerns for migrants, pausing a January directive that extended expedited removal beyond traditional border areas to anywhere in the country and to individuals who arrived within the past two years. This decision, a major setback for the administration's mass deportation efforts, mandates that affected individuals must be afforded due process, including an opportunity to see an immigration judge. While the ruling is expected to be appealed, it temporarily upholds critical protections.</p>

Cunningham, recognized as the first Navy fighter ace in Vietnam, served eight terms in the House of Representatives before his career ended in disgrace.

Sentenced to eight years in prison, his corruption case contributed to the establishment of the Office of Congressional Ethics. Cunningham, who later expressed regret for his plea, received a pardon from Donald Trump in 2021.</p>

Repairs, totaling approximately $7.9 million, included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and advanced drainage systems.

Essex Police reported two officers sustained non-serious injuries and enforced a dispersal order, urging peaceful protest amidst mixed local sentiments. Epping Forest District Council, which obtained the injunction, is now considering an appeal to the Supreme Court, while the government emphasizes its aim to close asylum hotels "in an orderly way."</p>

          <p>Millions of dollars in political TV ads are scheduled to begin airing for California's November ballot measure, Prop. 50, which aims to redraw congressional boundaries to favor Democrats and counter President Trump's agenda. Opposition to the rare mid-decade redistricting has already booked over $10 million in airtime, with supporters committing at least $2 million, a figure expected to grow significantly. This expensive campaign seeks to influence control of the U.S. House, following Texas's Republican-favoring redistricting and California Governor Gavin Newsom's counter-campaign. The measure challenges the state's independent redistricting commission, raising concerns about partisan influence overriding voter-approved processes.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Cuts Billions in Approved US Foreign Aid Using "Pocket Rescission"</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unilaterally canceled $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid funding, informing Congress of the cuts to 15 international programs. The administration utilized a "pocket rescission," a little-known procedure that bypasses traditional congressional approval by allowing funds to expire before lawmakers can act within a mandated 45-day timeframe. This controversial move, last employed nearly 50 years ago, has drawn strong opposition from Democrats and some moderate Republicans, who deem it illegal and a clear violation of Congress's power of the purse. Critics warn the action could increase the likelihood of a federal government shutdown and undermine US standing on the world stage.</p>

          <p>A unique mentoring program, pairing anxious teenagers with toddlers from local nurseries, is demonstrating success in helping to increase school attendance and engagement among adolescents. Participants like 13-year-old Siena, who previously struggled with anxiety and school avoidance, reported significant improvements in communication and confidence, with her attendance more than doubling. The Power2 charity, which runs the scheme in London and Manchester, believes that giving disengaged teens responsibility for younger children in a controlled setting fosters accountability and positive role modeling. This innovative initiative addresses the rising issue of school absence, which has nearly doubled since the pandemic, by building healthy relationships and boosting self-esteem.</p>

          <p>CVS and Walgreens are currently limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines in several states, either requiring a prescription or not offering them at all, in order to comply with state guidelines that mandate specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approvals. While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax for seniors and for younger adults with health conditions, state-specific laws are creating a patchwork of access. CVS, for example, cannot vaccinate even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico.

          <p>A new study led by Stanford Medicine and published in JAMA Network Open reveals that young children (ages 3-5) diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently prescribed medication too quickly, often bypassing recommended behavioral interventions. The study, which examined nearly 10,000 health records, found that approximately 68% of these children received medication before age seven, with a significant 42% prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis. Clinical guidelines typically advocate for behavioral intervention as the first line of treatment due to potential side effects from stimulants, such as irritability and aggressiveness. Researchers are now calling for further investigation into the appropriateness of such early medication use.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has delivered a significant ruling, determining that President Trump exceeded his authority under federal economic emergency laws by imposing sweeping tariffs on numerous countries. The 7-4 decision largely upheld a lower court's finding that Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs and other levies on China, Mexico, and Canada were not legally permissible under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). While the ruling does not immediately block existing tariffs, it marks a substantial setback for Trump's signature trade strategy, with the administration vowing to appeal to the Supreme Court. The court emphasized that the power to levy tariffs is fundamentally a "core Congressional power." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris will now receive protection from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) after President Trump controversially revoked her Secret Service security detail. Trump signed a memorandum ending Harris's protection, despite a prior order from then-President Biden that had extended her coverage until July 2026. California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, have strongly condemned the move as an act driven by "erratic, vindictive political impulses" that directly endanger the former Vice President.

Newsom's remarks were part of a broader critique of President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to predominantly blue states, suggesting a political motive rather than a genuine focus on crime suppression.

Kennedy, a known vaccine critic without a medical degree, has implemented funding cuts and policy changes that have angered public health experts and led to calls for his resignation from several Democratic senators.

Kehoe's proposed map specifically targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's Kansas City-area district by stretching it eastward into rural Republican-leaning areas.

Reports indicate Harry's team has met with the King's communications secretary, a development previously considered unthinkable. Although Harry recently lost a court case over his UK security, which strained relations, his public statements express a clear desire for reconciliation. His visit for the WellChild awards may offer the best opportunity for father and son to find a long-absent peace away from public scrutiny.</p>
