          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, falling short of analysts' expectations and indicating ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Despite this, industrial output saw a stronger-than-expected increase of 6.1%, suggesting that the impact of U.S. tariffs was not as significant as anticipated. Fixed-asset investment also expanded, though slightly below forecasts, while the urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1%. The statistics bureau acknowledged the presence of unstable external factors, emphasizing the need to further consolidate the foundation for sustained economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House Budget Committee reconvened to push forward President Trump's domestic policy bill after conservative Republicans initially blocked it due to insufficient spending cuts. The bill aims to extend tax cuts from Mr. Trump's first term while increasing military and border security spending, offset by reductions in Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Conservatives are pushing for stricter work requirements for Medicaid recipients and an end to clean energy subsidies, while some Republicans from blue states are demanding a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. Mr. Trump urged the holdouts to finalize the bill, as Speaker Johnson aims to bring it to the House floor before Memorial Day.</p>

          <p>The South Solon Meeting House in Maine holds a unique secret: its interior is adorned with 70-year-old fresco murals, leading some to call it "the Sistine Chapel of Maine." Painted by artists in the 1950s, the murals have gained renewed attention thanks to a website created by Colby College students. The meeting house, built in 1842, served as a church until the 1940s and was later revitalized by Margaret Day Blake, who invited young artists to create the frescoes under the supervision of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. Today, the meeting house is a community space open to the public, hosting gatherings and artistic events.</p>

          <p>Federal and local agencies are investigating the collision of a Mexican tall ship, the Cuauhtémoc, with the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in two fatalities. The ship's masts struck and snapped against the bridge as it was departing for Iceland, leading to sailors dangling from wires. Preliminary reports indicate the ship lost power, causing it to drift backward into the bridge. Senator Schumer is questioning whether cuts to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may have contributed to the incident, specifically regarding the functionality of the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service. The NTSB has dispatched a go-team to investigate the incident.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is facing growing criticism for accepting a $400 million luxury plane from Qatar, with prominent Democrats and even some Republicans expressing outrage. Critics are calling the gift the "definition of corruption" and a contradiction of Trump's promise to "drain the swamp." Trump defended the gift, claiming it was for the U.S. and not for him personally, but this assertion has been challenged. Meanwhile, lawyers are forming law firms to challenge the Trump administration's efforts to cut funding and punish civil servants, as the president intensifies his attacks on the justice department and major law firms.</p>

While the cancer is Stage 4, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris issued supportive statements, as experts note that while the cancer cannot be cured, patients can live for many years with treatment.</p>

The researchers have struggled to determine the distance to Teleios, with estimates ranging from 7,175 to 25,114 light-years, which significantly impacts its estimated size and age. One of the biggest puzzles is the lack of X-ray emissions, which are typically associated with Type Ia supernovae remnants.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, prompting discussions about the disease, its symptoms, and treatment options. The diagnosis was made after Biden reported urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a prostate nodule. His cancer has a Gleason score of 9, indicating an aggressive form that has spread to his bones. While prostate cancer is often curable if detected early, the goal in Biden's case is to manage the disease, slow its progression, and preserve his quality of life.</p>

          <p>Investigators have identified 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. The FBI believes Bartkus, who is presumed dead in the blast, had "nihilistic ideations" and intentionally targeted the in vitro fertilization clinic. Authorities are examining Bartkus' writings and social media posts, including a possible manifesto, and believe he attempted to livestream the bombing. The explosion shattered windows and scattered debris, injuring four people, all of whom have been released from the hospital.</p>

The agreement, deemed fair and fiscally responsible, includes a series of concessions related to work rules that will help offset the cost of the wage increases sought by the union.

However, China must deepen its financial markets so foreigners can better access yuan-denominated stocks, bonds and other assets, as well as new yuan-backed asset classes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's aspirations to become a global manufacturing hub could be undermined by a trade "reset" between the US and China. A recent agreement between Washington and Beijing has lowered import taxes on goods traded between the two countries, potentially diverting manufacturing investment away from India. While Apple is shifting production to India, there is a risk that manufacturing investment could either stall or head back to China. Analysts believe that despite the trade "reset," a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run.</p>
