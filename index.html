          <h2>Japan's Exports Decline for Second Consecutive Month Amid US Trade Tensions, Sparking Recession Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 21:46:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year and missing economists' expectations. The decline is largely driven by a significant drop in shipments to major partners, including a 4.7% decrease to China and an 11.4% fall to the United States. These figures are exacerbated by a new 25% U.S. tariff on Japanese imports, particularly impacting the crucial automobile sector where exports to the U.S. plunged by 26.7%. Analysts warn that these ongoing trade pressures could push Japan's export-reliant economy into a technical recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Seven & i Holdings Stock Plummets After Canadian Firm Couche-Tard Withdraws $47 Billion Takeover Offer</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares in Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings plunged over 9% after Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion acquisition bid. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. In response, Seven & i expressed disappointment and disputed the Canadian firm's statements. Analysts suggest that Japanese protectionism and the classification of Seven & i as a company 'core' to national security made the deal highly unlikely from the start, demonstrating the significant hurdles foreign firms face in acquiring major Japanese corporations.</p>

          <p>A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning and evacuations in some coastal communities like Seward. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory before being canceled entirely by the National Weather Service. The earthquake occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point at a shallow depth, but officials stated that large, widespread waves were not expected. While the quake was felt across the Alaska Peninsula, there was no danger to Anchorage, and the event concluded with no reports of significant damage or injuries.</p>

          <p>Internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data obtained by CBS News shows that the Trump administration's deportation efforts have primarily targeted immigrants without violent criminal records. Of the over 70,000 convicted criminals deported in the first half of the year, the majority of infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses. Homicide convictions accounted for only 0.58% of deported criminals, while sex offenses made up 1.8%, challenging the administration's public focus on removing the "worst of the worst." The data indicates a significant gap between the rhetoric of targeting violent offenders and the reality of who is being removed from the country.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit filed by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders has gone to trial, seeking to hold them accountable for the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The plaintiffs allege that Facebook officials failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse and violated a 2012 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. Shareholders are demanding that Zuckerberg and others reimburse Meta for over $8 billion in fines and legal costs stemming from the fallout. The trial is expected to feature testimony from Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg, focusing on the company's privacy disclosures.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has called on the Trump administration to release all government files related to the investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein. In an interview, Pence stated that "the time has come" for transparency, while emphasizing that the names of victims must be protected. His remarks stand in stark contrast to President Trump, who dismissed the entire matter as a politically motivated "hoax" started by Democrats. Pence's push for disclosure highlights a significant division within the Republican party over handling the controversial case and its associated records.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's claim of widespread "waste, fraud, and abuse" as the reason for clawing back $7.9 billion in foreign aid is facing intense scrutiny. The former inspector general for USAID, Paul Martin, stated that the administration has provided little to no proof for its claims and that the examples he was aware of were "completely made up." Anonymous officials reported that the review process was a superficial search for politically charged keywords like "gender" or "climate," rather than a thorough investigation into program effectiveness. This raises questions about whether the cuts were politically motivated rather than based on evidence of misuse.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad is increasingly focused on the actions of the plane's captain, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Citing sources familiar with the inquiry, the report states that a cockpit recording indicates the captain moved the fuel switches to the "cutoff" position moments after takeoff. The first officer was reportedly heard on the recording asking why the fuel was cut, to which the other pilot denied doing so. This evidence suggests pilot error may have led to the loss of engine thrust that caused the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to crash, killing all 260 people on board.</p>

          <p>The average cost for a child to attend a holiday club for the full six-week summer break in Britain has risen to £1,076, according to research from the charity Coram. Prices have increased due to high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run activities, with some regions seeing price hikes of up to 13% since last year. The rising costs place a significant financial burden on working parents who rely on this form of childcare. The report also highlights a lack of sufficient places for older children and those with special educational needs, compounding the challenge for many families.</p>

          <p>Thousands of UK flat owners are planning a class-action lawsuit against the companies that own their buildings, known as freeholders, over alleged secret commissions on insurance policies. A legal firm representing 2,500 leaseholders claims that freeholders received undisclosed fees from insurers, which were then passed on to residents through inflated service charges. As insurance costs have soared since the Grenfell Tower fire, these percentage-based commissions have also increased, allegedly enriching freeholders. The companies involved deny any wrongdoing, but new regulations now require the disclosure of such commission payments.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are warning that any attempt by President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell would be "significantly negative for markets." A research note from Wolfe Research predicted such a move could trigger an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields, creating a "mess" for the economy. The analysis came amid reports that Trump intended to fire Powell, which the president later denied. Legal experts and economists believe a firing would likely be challenged in court and would undermine the critical independence of the central bank, which is seen as essential for economic stability.

The report notes that while tariff rates have fluctuated, they have remained high on nearly all imported goods.
