Activists argue that deep-seated patriarchal norms contribute to this dangerous environment, where women's visibility is often perceived as a threat to cultural and religious values.

          <p>Japan has successfully conducted the 50th and final launch of its H2A liquid-fuel rocket, concluding the vehicle's 24-year service career.

          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarus are planning to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland intend to use land mines as part of a new "Iron Curtain" to deter a potential attack. This controversial move is criticized for the long-term danger mines pose to civilians, though proponents argue it is a necessary defensive measure against an "existential threat."</p>
