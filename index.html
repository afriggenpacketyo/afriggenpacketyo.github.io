          <p>President Trump's proclamation targeting Harvard University's enrollment of international students has drawn attention to broader measures affecting US schools. This move followed a federal court injunction against the Department of Homeland Security's attempt to limit Harvard's ability to host international students. The administration has also threatened Columbia University's accreditation, alleging antisemitism on campus. While Trump has made comments suggesting Chinese students are welcome, his administration's policies have created uncertainty for international students, particularly those from China and Hong Kong, due to national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of one count of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley in his retrial, while the jury remained undecided on a charge of third-degree sexual assault involving Jessica Mann. The jury acquitted Weinstein on a count of criminal sexual assault regarding accuser Kaja Sokola after days of tense deliberations marked by infighting among jurors. The trial, which began in April 2025, involved accusations from Haley, Mann, and Sokola, who testified about incidents dating back to 2006 and 2013. The guilty verdict provides some closure for Haley and represents a significant moment for the #MeToo movement, though deliberations continue on the remaining charge.</p>

          <p>The State Department is ordering the departure of nonessential staff from the U.S. embassy in Baghdad due to increased security risks in the region.

Separately, the Defense Secretary has authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the Middle East as tensions between Israel and Iran escalate.</p>

          <p>Small retailers are facing challenges due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, with many describing their situation as a "vacation from hell." Despite a temporary truce and reduced tariff rates, uncertainty remains about the future, causing businesses to delay inventory orders and new product development. Some retailers have been forced to raise prices to offset higher import costs, while others are considering discontinuing lower-margin items. The situation is further complicated by accusations of trade agreement violations and shifting policy decisions, leaving small businesses in a state of paralysis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced plans to revoke a key rule that limits carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the Trump administration aims to both protect the environment and grow the economy, arguing that the Biden-era rules were stifling economic growth. The agency will also repeal updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, despite data showing the rule's effectiveness in reducing mercury air emissions. Critics argue that the rollbacks could have dangerous health and economic consequences, while the EPA estimates the proposed rules will save the power sector roughly $1.2 billion a year in regulatory costs.</p>

          <p>A new Syrian Committee for Civil Peace, founded by Syriaâ€™s new leaders, is facing criticism for cooperating with former supporters of Assad to promote stability. This collaboration has sparked a backlash from the government's support base, who are demanding justice for past grievances. The committee's efforts to foster reconciliation are seen by some as a betrayal of the sacrifices made during the conflict. The situation highlights the challenges of achieving peace and reconciliation in a country deeply divided by war.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Scottie Scheffler has deleted his Venmo account after receiving unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance.

          <p>A draft trade agreement with China, announced by Donald Trump, addresses concerns from top US military suppliers regarding rare-earth metals crucial for defense production. The agreement aims to ensure a stable supply of these metals and magnets, essential for manufacturing items from smart bombs to fighter jets. China's export restrictions on rare earth elements had previously threatened to disrupt the US defense industrial base. Samarium, a rare-earth metal used in military-grade magnets and entirely controlled by China, is of particular importance.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced plans to build 1.5 million new homes this parliament, committing Â£39bn over 10 years for social and affordable housing in England. This investment has been described as a game-changer by social landlords and housing charities, given the acute shortage of affordable and social housing in many areas. While the government says this is significantly higher than previous spending, details on where the homes will be built and how much funding will be allocated to socially rented homes are still awaited. For families like Danielle's, who have experienced homelessness, the announcement feels "too late" but offers hope for future generations.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that 45% of American homeowners have regrets about buying their current home, with the most common complaint being the high cost of maintenance and hidden fees.

These charges, such as internet bills, property taxes, and maintenance, are often overlooked during the purchasing process.
