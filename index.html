          <p>A cyber-security incident at a Ministry of Defence sub-contractor has exposed the personal data of up to 3,700 Afghans who were resettled in the UK. The breach at Inflite The Jet Centre, a ground-handling service at London Stansted airport, potentially compromised names, passport details, and relocation policy information. This event raises serious safety concerns for the affected individuals and their families, some of whom fled the Taliban after assisting British forces. The incident follows a similar, larger data leak in 2022, prompting criticism and calls for the government to enhance data security for vulnerable refugees.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Air Force and Space Force have implemented new, standardized guidance for separation boards concerning service members who no longer meet military requirements, including those impacted by changes to transgender service policies. According to an internal memo, the new rules centralize the process under a single authority to ensure uniformity and require boards to recommend separation once a member is confirmed to meet the policy's criteria. Supporters argue this change enhances military readiness and provides clarity in disciplinary actions, aligning with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's focus on restoring a "warrior ethos" and enforcing stricter standards across the armed forces.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska ended without a formal agreement to end or pause the war in Ukraine. In brief remarks, Trump described the three-hour meeting as "very productive" but acknowledged that "there's no deal until there's a deal," taking no questions from the press. Putin's comments suggested his core demands regarding Ukraine remain unchanged, leaving European and Ukrainian leaders uncertain about the future. The summit was seen by some analysts as a symbolic victory for Putin, who was granted a high-profile meeting on U.S. soil after years of international isolation.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of murder and sexual assault, spent six months meticulously planning his escape from a state prison. Hardin stated that lax security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform to simply walk out of the facility. The report details how two employees were fired for procedural violations that enabled the escape, including a guard who opened a gate without verifying Hardin's identity. The incident has prompted legislative hearings and calls for systemic security reforms within the state's correctional institutions.</p>

In a Fox News interview, Trump stated that while progress was made, a few significant sticking points remain and that his advice to the Ukrainian leader would be to "make a deal." These comments have heightened anxiety in Kyiv and European capitals, which fear a potential agreement being brokered without their direct input or consideration of their security interests. Trump also mentioned his intention to help arrange a direct meeting between Putin and Zelensky to resolve the conflict.</p>

Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, rather than being replaced by the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. A revised directive now positions the DEA administrator as an intermediary between the White House and the Metropolitan Police Department. The legal battle continues over the administration's attempts to override the city's "sanctuary" policies regarding cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p>

The suspect, Kalel Jorell Martínez Bristol, turned himself in to police and is accused of firing a gun during the altercation, which also injured two local residents.

This development comes a year after the city pioneered legislation to allow such sales, aiming to create a new, more affordable path to homeownership. Officials hope this ADU condominium, located near the city's downtown, will serve as a model for other cities and help address the state's severe housing crisis by introducing a new type of starter home. ADUs now account for a significant portion of California's new housing, but their overall impact is still being assessed.</p>

          <p>A recent study finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea accounts for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, authorities have focused on costly dust-control projects around the lake to combat high rates of asthma and respiratory illness in the region. The report, authored by the Pacific Institute, suggests that pollution sources are far more varied, including agricultural chemicals, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. Researchers now recommend a strategic pivot from source control to "exposure control," such as improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools to better protect public health.</p>

One eight-week study showed that adults with type 2 diabetes who ate 250g of mango for breakfast saw improvements in key metabolic health markers, including fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Researchers emphasize that moderation is crucial, but the findings suggest the fruit can be incorporated into a balanced diabetic diet.</p>

Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah ultimately secured the victory for the reigning champions in a dramatic and emotionally charged start to the new season.</p>

          <p>The global bubble tea market is experiencing explosive growth, projected to expand from $2.83 billion in 2025 to nearly $4.8 billion by 2032, largely driven by Chinese chains like Mixue Group. These companies are utilizing a franchise-heavy model to expand at a staggering pace, with Mixue now operating more stores worldwide than McDonald's. This rapid growth has attracted significant investor interest, with three major chains recently listing in Hong Kong. However, the industry faces significant challenges, including market saturation and intense price wars, raising questions about its long-term sustainability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California's Democratic-led legislature is advancing a controversial plan to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move that could give their party up to five additional U.S. House seats. Governor Gavin Newsom intends to put the new maps before voters in a November special election, bypassing the state's independent redistricting commission. This action is framed as a direct response to similar Republican-led gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas, with Democrats arguing they must "fight fire with fire." The proposed map targets several Republican incumbents, a strategy that could prove pivotal in determining control of the House of Representatives after the 2026 midterms.</p>

Semenyo, who went on to score two goals after the incident, later posted on social media about receiving further racist abuse online.

The gallery ultimately covered artists' names and references to these regions with black paint. The incident is being condemned by human rights advocates as an act of transnational repression, highlighting China's influence in silencing critical voices abroad.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is pitching a simple, customizable, American-made pickup truck it claims can sell for about half the average vehicle price in the U.S. The company's strategy is to offer a barebones, two-seat base model and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate's main selling point has been its low price, though the recent rollback of federal EV tax credits may push its starting cost closer to $28,000. This higher price point could challenge its competitiveness against other vehicles in that range, such as the Ford Maverick.</p>

The lawmakers, including Representative Jamie Raskin, argue that Trump has not demonstrated the "special conditions of an emergency" required by law to justify such an unprecedented takeover. The resolution asserts that the president's move is a "lawless" attack on D.C.'s autonomy, motivated by political purposes rather than a genuine public safety crisis. This legislative action represents a formal challenge to the president's controversial use of executive power over the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Scottish jazz pianist Fergus McCreadie initially dismissed calls and emails from acclaimed film director Spike Lee as spam before realizing the offer to work on a new film was genuine. Lee had discovered McCreadie's music and flew to Edinburgh to see him perform before inviting him and his trio to New York to record for the crime thriller "Highest 2 Lowest." The director incorporated McCreadie's track "Stony Gate" into the film's main score. For the Mercury Music Prize-nominated pianist, the surreal experience of collaborating with the Oscar-winning director was a "dream come true" and has opened new possibilities for his career.</p>
