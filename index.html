However, he has retreated from his original July 4 deadline for passage, as the legislation encounters significant obstacles in the Senate.

          <p>A classified intelligence briefing on the U.S. strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities has exposed a sharp partisan divide among senators. Following the session with top national security officials, Republicans largely supported the administration's claim that the program was "obliterated." In contrast, Democrats expressed strong skepticism, criticizing what they see as a lack of a coherent long-term strategy. The briefing's initial postponement had already fueled Democratic complaints about the administration stonewalling Congress on the military action.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly declared a victory over Israel and claimed to have dealt "a big slap in the face" to the United States. However, his claims of inflicting significant damage are contradicted by reports that Iran's missile attacks were largely intercepted. Meanwhile, U.S. and Israeli intelligence suggest their retaliatory strikes severely set back Iran's nuclear program by years. The defiant rhetoric comes as Iran halts cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, escalating international tensions.</p>

          <p>Newly obtained data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reveals that the majority of immigrants arrested since October have not committed serious crimes. Of the 185,000 individuals taken into custody, 120,000 had no serious criminal history. This data supports on-the-ground reports from Southern California showing that day laborers, farm workers, and street vendors are among those being detained. The figures provide crucial context for the human impact of the administration's ongoing immigration enforcement operations.</p>
