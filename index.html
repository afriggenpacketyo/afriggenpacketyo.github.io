          <p>Researchers in China have created a more efficient and less energy-intensive system for sorting data, a critical process for AI and scientific computing. The new method utilizes memristors, electronic components with memory capabilities, to overcome the "Von Neumann bottleneck," which limits data transfer speeds between memory and processing units. A hardware prototype has successfully demonstrated its effectiveness in tasks like route finding and neural network inference, promising significant improvements over traditional computing architectures. The development could address a major performance bottleneck in many data-heavy applications.</p>

          <p>A family in California that supported Donald Trump's immigration policies is now feeling "blindsided" after the Canadian-born mother was detained by ICE during her permanent residency interview. Cynthia Olivera, who was brought to the U.S. without permission as a child, had lived in the country for decades, paid taxes, and has three U.S.-born children with her American husband. Despite having no criminal record and a valid work permit, she was detained under the administration's intensified immigration crackdown, which the family had supported, believing it only targeted dangerous criminals. She is now in a detention center awaiting deportation to Canada.</p>

          <p>Bobby Jenks, a former two-time All-Star pitcher for the Chicago White Sox, has passed away at the age of 44 due to a rare form of stomach cancer. Jenks was a key member of the 2005 World Series championship team, which ended an 88-year title drought for the franchise. He is famously remembered for throwing the final pitch in the series-clinching game against the Houston Astros. White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf released a statement mourning the loss of an "iconic member of the White Sox family."</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that over 1.4 million pensioners in Germany are still working, with nearly 375,000 of them in jobs that are more than minor side employment. The data, requested by the Left Party, has sparked debate about the adequacy of the country's pension system. Critics, like Dietmar Bartsch of the Left Party, point out that Germany's pension level is significantly below the EU average, suggesting many older individuals work out of financial necessity rather than choice. The report has led to calls for a major pension reform in Germany. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial involving children and adults. The research, published in *Nature Medicine*, detailed how delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear led to significant hearing improvements in all 10 participants. One seven-year-old girl regained nearly full hearing within a month of the treatment. The therapy, which was found to be safe, targets a specific genetic mutation causing a deficiency of the otoferlin protein, and researchers are hopeful it can be adapted for other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>A shop owner in Durham, UK, who personally stopped a man from stealing a crate of beer, is frustrated with the lack of legal deterrent for the crime. The thief was dealt with through a "community resolution," which involved paying for the stolen goods and being banned from the store, but resulted in no criminal conviction. The shopkeeper, Andrew Board, argues this sends the wrong signal and fuels a growing shoplifting problem, a sentiment that reflects a national trend where most reported thefts do not lead to charges.

          <p>Monasteries and convents across Germany are facing a significant decline, with dozens closing each year due to a dwindling number of members. The number of nuns in Catholic orders has plummeted from over 26,000 in 2004 to under 9,500 in 2024, leading to the sale of historic properties like St. Erentraud's Abbey. Experts attribute the trend to secularization, smaller family sizes, and more professional opportunities for women outside religious life. This decline has broader societal impacts, as religious orders have historically run many schools and hospitals, which are now being handed over to other organizations.</p>

The team also established a connection between brain criticality and cognitive functions, suggesting they share a common genetic foundation. These findings open new avenues for understanding brain function and the biological basis of mental ability.</p>

          <p>Chilean tennis player Nicolas Jarry is preparing to face Britain's Cameron Norrie in the fourth round of Wimbledon after a challenging year marked by significant health issues. Just over a year ago, Jarry was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, a condition affecting balance and vision, which caused his world ranking to drop from the top 20 to 143. He described the emotional and physical toll of the illness, which has required ongoing rehabilitation. His successful run at Wimbledon, his favorite tournament, marks a significant and emotional return to form for the 29-year-old.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 2023 television interview, Barry Morphew, who was previously charged with the murder of his wife Suzanne, maintained his innocence and accused authorities of having "tunnel vision." The interview came after prosecutors dropped the charges against him just before his trial was set to begin, citing the need to find Suzanne's body. Morphew, supported by his two daughters, stated he had "done nothing wrong" and believed his wife was abducted. At the time, prosecutors had been sanctioned for failing to turn over evidence, including DNA linked to unsolved sexual assault cases in other states.</p>

          <p>In a surprising turn, prosecutors in April 2022 dropped all murder charges against Barry Morphew just days before his trial for the disappearance of his wife, Suzanne, was to begin. The motion to dismiss, filed without prejudice, stated that investigators believed they were close to finding the victim's body but could not proceed in good faith without it. The decision also followed severe sanctions imposed on the prosecution by the judge for repeatedly failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense. Morphew's attorneys asserted his innocence and criticized the prosecution for manufacturing a case without physical evidence.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time and indicted on first-degree murder charges in the death of his wife, Suzanne, following the discovery of her remains in September 2023. The new indictment reveals that her body was found in a shallow grave and had likely been moved at least once after she decomposed elsewhere. Crucially, tests on her bone marrow found a mixture of tranquilizer chemicals that only Barry Morphew had access to in the area. This new evidence led to the renewed charges, adding another major twist to the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>A review of the timeline leading up to the deadly Texas floods shows that the National Weather Service (NWS) issued escalating warnings hours before the Guadalupe River inundated the area. A flood watch was in place more than 12 hours ahead of the event, and a "particularly dangerous situation" alert was sent three hours before the river began its rapid rise. Despite these warnings, the pre-dawn deluge caught many residents and campers by surprise, leading to catastrophic results. The article includes the story of a teenage boy who survived by being caught in barbed wire, highlighting the harrowing experiences of those affected.</p>

          <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, made his first public appearance since the recent 12-day war with Israel, attending a religious ceremony in Tehran. His absence during the conflict had fueled speculation that he was in a secure bunker, especially after the U.S. bombed key Iranian nuclear sites. The war, which Israel initiated over fears of Iran's nuclear program, resulted in significant casualties and damage in Iran. In response, Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, further escalating tensions over its atomic program, which had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels.</p>

          <p>Japan is planning to export six used Abukuma-class navy destroyers to the Philippines in a move to bolster deterrence against China's maritime activities. This plan, reported by the Yomiuri newspaper, marks an increase in military cooperation between the two U.S. allies, who both face challenges from Beijing's assertive actions in the region. The deal was reportedly agreed upon by the two countries' defense ministers last month. To navigate Japan's pacifist constitution, the transfer will be structured as a joint development project, allowing for the export of military equipment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations is facing a severe funding crisis as the Trump administration reviews its contributions to all international organizations, with a decision expected next month. The U.S. is the UN's largest donor, and a proposed 87% reduction in funding would gut key agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Programme, which are already struggling. The article argues this move threatens the entire multilateral, rules-based international order, which is already weakened by nations like Russia and China ignoring international law.

          <p>The UK's High Court has ruled that internal and external investigations into MI5 providing false evidence were "deficient" and has ordered a new, more robust inquiry. The case stems from the Security Service repeatedly and falsely telling courts it had not confirmed the identity of an abusive neo-Nazi agent to a BBC journalist. Newly revealed material shows MI5 continued to provide misleading information during the inquiries and attempted to conceal evidence that contradicted its claims of memory lapses. The judgment is a major blow to the credibility of MI5 and its handling of a violent state agent.</p>

This trend is part of a broader boom in China's cruise market, appealing to a younger demographic that sees it as a novel and social alternative to traditional group travel options like road trips or renting apartments.

The initiative aims to support an additional 500,000 children in disadvantaged areas, building on the model of the previous "Sure Start" centres.
