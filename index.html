          <p>President Trump posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot last month. During a White House ceremony on what would have been Kirk's 32nd birthday, Trump praised him as a "fearless warrior for liberty" and credited him with mobilizing young voters. Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, accepted the award, which recognizes his decade-long alliance with Trump and his influence on conservative youth. Prosecutors in Utah have charged a 22-year-old with aggravated murder in Kirk's death, seeking the death penalty.</p>

          <p>New York Jets legend Nick Mangold publicly announced his need for a kidney transplant due to chronic kidney disease, a condition he has managed since 2006. The 41-year-old former center, who played his entire 11-year NFL career with the Jets, is seeking a donor with type O blood as family members are currently unable to donate. Mangold expressed gratitude for his support system and remains positive about his recovery, hoping to return to full strength. He was inducted into the Jets' Ring of Honor in 2022.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has revealed credible intelligence indicating Mexican drug cartels are offering a tiered bounty system for attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers. Bounties range from $2,000 for intelligence gathering to $50,000 for assassinations of high-ranking officials. This report emerges amid a legal dispute over deploying National Guard troops to protect immigration enforcement, which a judge temporarily blocked citing lack of rebellion evidence and potential civil unrest. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned these actions as an "organized campaign of terror" against federal personnel.</p>

Haliburton, who grew up near Milwaukee, has been seen wearing jerseys of teams playing against the Brewers, including the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers.

          <p>The City of Foley, Alabama, has approved the purchase of over two acres of property on East Violet Avenue, with plans for a new civic center or a museum. Mayor Ralph Hellmich stated the current civic center, built in the 1970s, no longer meets the city's needs, necessitating a larger facility capable of holding around 800 people. The museum would commemorate Foley's designation as an American World War II Heritage City, highlighting its involvement with naval aviation during the war. An additional parcel of land was also donated by the property owners.</p>

          <p>Aviation experts reassure travelers that air travel remains safe during the U.S. government shutdown, despite flight delays attributed to air traffic controller shortages. While controllers and TSA officers are working without pay, safety standards are not compromised, and delays are a precautionary measure to maintain safety. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed that traffic is slowed to ensure safety, acknowledging controllers' frustration. Experts note that pilots ultimately have the final say on flight safety, and the risk of accidents is not higher, though inconvenience from delays and cancellations is.</p>

          <p>A family has filed a lawsuit against popular online gaming platform Roblox and chat platform Discord, alleging their son was targeted by an alleged sexual assault offender who used the platforms for grooming.

The family asserts that despite parental controls, these platforms enable such predatory behavior. Kentucky and Louisiana attorneys general have also filed similar lawsuits against Roblox, highlighting concerns about child exploitation and the companies' alleged failure to adequately protect minors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement for next year will be delayed due to the ongoing government shutdown. The delay stems from the Bureau of Labor Statistics postponing the release of September Consumer Price Index data, crucial for calculating the COLA. While the announcement is now expected on October 24, the new COLA will still take effect on January 1, 2026, without further delays. Estimates suggest the 2026 COLA could be around 2.7%, slightly higher than the previous year, influenced partly by the Trump administration's tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. controversially suggested a link between circumcision, Tylenol, and autism during a Cabinet meeting, citing unverified studies. Medical experts strongly refute these claims, highlighting that the cited studies suffer from issues like correlation not equaling causation, confounding variables, and lack of peer review. Experts emphasize that there is no credible scientific evidence supporting a causal relationship between circumcision, acetaminophen, or vaccines and autism. Organizations like the UK's National Autistic Society have condemned Kennedy's statements as "dangerous anti-science" that could jeopardize public health.</p>
