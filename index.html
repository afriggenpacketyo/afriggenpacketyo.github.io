          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal and the immediate implications of the court's ruling are unclear, as the case needs to go through the appeals process. The ruling has boosted global financial markets, with major stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar gaining ground against safe-haven currencies.</p>

Russell emphasizes the importance of allowing UNICEF and its partners to deliver essential supplies through a functioning UN-led aid pipeline, urging respect for international humanitarian law and a durable cease-fire.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher US tariffs on imported cars. Global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota plans to absorb the tariff costs, analysts believe the company may face pressure to pass them on to consumers in the long term. The automaker anticipates a significant drop in net profit for the business year due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggests that increased purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit, potentially serving as a bargaining chip in ongoing tariff negotiations. While acknowledging the differing logic between security matters and trade talks, the negotiator indicates a willingness to explore this option. Japan seeks the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, steel, and aluminum, but the U.S. has been reluctant to fully comply. Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba plans to support the U.S. in reviving its shipbuilding industry amid increasing Chinese dominance.</p>

          <p>A US Court of International Trade has ruled President Trump's sweeping tariffs unlawful, dealing a significant blow to his economic agenda. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the authority to impose such broad tariffs without congressional approval. The ruling, which the Trump administration is appealing, has created uncertainty in global trade and deepened the divide between the administration and the judiciary. The decision has been welcomed by stock markets and businesses, but it undermines Trump's negotiating strategy and revenue generation plans.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. government will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields," while also enhancing scrutiny of future visa applications. This move is expected to create anxiety across U.S. university campuses and could lead to retaliatory actions from China. The phrase "critical fields" likely refers to research in the physical sciences, reflecting concerns about the Chinese government recruiting U.S.-trained scientists.

          <p>The UK government is contemplating sanctions against two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to rising concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The decision is complicated by a recent deadly shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, but momentum for sanctions has grown following Britain's condemnation of Israel's expanded military operations in Gaza. The UK is also debating when to recognize an independent Palestinian state, with pressure mounting from within the Labour Party and human rights lawyers to take action. Britain now seems likely to wait to see if Israel will allow a measurable increase in aid to Gaza, according to officials.</p>

          <p>Despite legal guarantees and reforms, racial segregation remains a reality for Roma children in Slovakia's schools, with over 60% attending schools where they are in the majority. Roma children are often separated into "Roma schools" or "Roma classes," which are frequently overcrowded and have lower academic expectations. The Slovak government had previously denied discriminatory treatment, but finally acknowledged the existence of segregation in 2020. Reforms have been introduced, but often reinforce segregation rather than address it, and the EU's target to reduce segregation by only 50% by 2030 is seen as insufficient.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a series of pardons and commutations, benefiting political allies, a rapper, and the co-founder of a Chicago gang, Larry Hoover. Among those pardoned are Michael G. Grimm, a former New York representative convicted of tax evasion, and Julie and Todd Chrisley, reality television stars convicted of tax fraud. The commutations included Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Gangster Disciples, and Imaad Zuberi, a venture capitalist convicted of campaign finance violations. These actions highlight Trump's tendency to use clemency to reward supporters and incentivize loyalty, rather than following the Justice Department's formal process.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex-trafficking and racketeering trial continued with a motion for a mistrial from the defense team, which was promptly denied by the judge. The motion stemmed from testimony regarding the alleged firebombing of Kid Cudi's Porsche and fingerprint evidence that was later destroyed. The trial also featured testimony from Deonte Nash, a friend of Cassie Ventura, who described witnessing physical and verbal abuse by Combs. The trial's focus remains on allegations that Combs used his wealth and influence to run a criminal enterprise, coercing women into sexual acts.</p>

          <p>Despite recent tariff cuts, remaining duties on imports from the US could force Chinese buyers of Boeing jets to pay millions of US dollars more than before, and along with worldwide delivery delays, contribute to a sharp slowdown in the growth of China’s aviation capacity, analysts said. China’s civil aviation passenger capacity is likely to grow by an average of 3.1 per cent a year until 2028, far below the 15.4 per cent average annual rate in the decade to 2019.
