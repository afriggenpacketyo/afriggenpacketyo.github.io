          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of non-citizen convicts to the African nation of Eswatini, despite it not being their country of origin. The deported individuals, from countries like Cuba, Jamaica, and Yemen, have convictions for serious crimes including murder and sexual assault. This action is part of a broader, controversial U.S. policy to send deportees to third-party countries, a practice that has faced legal and humanitarian challenges. The administration recently gained a Supreme Court victory expediting such deportations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that a group of House Republican holdouts have agreed to support key cryptocurrency regulation bills after a meeting at the White House. The legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, had unexpectedly failed a procedural vote earlier when 13 Republicans sided with Democrats. The quick reversal highlights Trump's significant influence over the Republican conference, with a new vote expected soon to advance the bills. Crypto-linked stocks saw a dip following the initial failed vote.</p>

Huang's comments highlight the ongoing "brain drain" occurring amid deteriorating U.S.-China relations and its potential impact on American innovation and competitiveness.</p>

The board resisted the command, which came shortly after President Trump sided with a country music star's campaign against a proposed TVA gas plant. Sources suggest the move may be part of a larger strategy to install a more politically aligned CEO and potentially privatize the New Deal-era federal entity.

By introducing genes from the more resilient Honduran corals, researchers hope the new "Flonduran" hybrid will be better equipped to survive future marine heatwaves.

          <p>Some migrants in the U.S. are using mobile applications that crowdsource and display the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to avoid potential arrest. The article profiles an immigrant worker who uses an app called Coqui to navigate safely while on the job, highlighting the fear and anxiety within migrant communities amid the administration's crackdown. ICE officials have expressed concern that such apps are dangerous and could be used to impede law enforcement efforts, while the app's creator says it was developed to help people get to work safely.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Prosecutor-General has formally urged the Supreme Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup following his 2022 election loss. The prosecutor's filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to "violently overthrow the democratic order." The charges are linked to his unfounded claims of voter fraud and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison for his role in the affair.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market, according to the World Gold Council. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, avoiding the need to spend foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. Proponents say the practice is cheaper, supports local industry, and can help formalize and improve conditions for small-scale miners. This trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire to hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

He celebrated correctly anticipating a surge in Nvidia's stock but expressed disappointment with negative market reactions to BlackRock and Wells Fargo's reports.

          <p>Los Angeles County has agreed to a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Torres was convicted in 2001 despite having a strong alibi and evidence suggesting his innocence, including shaky witness testimony. His conviction was overturned in 2021 after a review by the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and a judge declared him factually innocent in 2022. The settlement resolves his civil lawsuit, which alleged that sheriff's detectives had failed to disclose exculpatory evidence.</p>

          <p>A Tampa, Florida woman spent six days in jail after a dispute with her homeowners association (HOA) over lawn care and other minor violations escalated. The woman, Irena Green, was taken to court by her HOA, and when she missed a subsequent hearing, a judge held her in contempt and issued an arrest warrant. The case highlights the significant power HOAs can wield and serves as a cautionary tale for homeowners. Legal experts noted that while jail time in such civil cases is rare, it is crucial to comply with court orders.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, also calls for standardized uniforms and for associates not to be responsible for diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow concerns over patient safety and a lack of clarity about the roles, which were introduced to support doctors. The changes are intended to more clearly define the scope and limitations of these healthcare positions.</p>

          <p>The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, has announced a major £50 million renovation of its historic Palm House, which will require the building to close for five years starting in 2027. The project involves repairing the corroded ironwork, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and carefully relocating 1,300 tropical plants. A key goal of the ambitious makeover is to make the Victorian-era glasshouse, which requires constant heating, net-zero in emissions by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps. The planning permission has been submitted, and the complex process of moving the plant collection has begun.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an ad for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims, including that its ingredients can "help you feel calm" and reduce anxiety. The watchdog found that the ad for the cucumber and mint-flavored drink, which contains magnesium and other supplements, implied benefits that are not permitted on the official register for food and drink marketing. The ASA ruled that the ad breached codes by suggesting the drink could treat or cure human disease and must not appear again in its current form.</p>

Smith, who served as chief whip under Theresa May, described the period as "disastrous" and believes the critical issues should have been foreseen and addressed during the campaign.</p>
