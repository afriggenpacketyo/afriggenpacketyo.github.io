          <p>A federal judge in California issued a temporary restraining order, compelling the reinstatement of legal aid for unaccompanied migrant children.  This action followed the Trump administration's termination of a contract with the Acacia Center for Justice, which provides these services.  The judge cited concerns about potential violations of a 2008 anti-trafficking law and emphasized the importance of legal representation for vulnerable children in the immigration system. The order is temporary, lasting until April 16th.</p>
