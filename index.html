        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ABC News decided not to renew Terry Moran's contract after he posted a social media message criticizing President Donald Trump and Stephen Miller, calling them "world-class" haters, which violated the network's policies. Moran, who had been with ABC News for 28 years, was previously suspended for the post, which drew condemnation from Trump administration officials. The network emphasized its commitment to objectivity and fairness in journalism. This decision follows a $15 million settlement ABC paid to Trump over allegedly defamatory comments made by George Stephanopoulos related to a sexual assault trial involving E. Jean Carroll. The settlement money was intended for a presidential library and museum for Trump. The article focuses on the consequences of Moran's remarks and ABC's response.

          <p>General Motors announced a $4 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing plants, which includes shifting or increasing production of Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox vehicles from Mexico to the United States. This decision comes as trade talks between the Trump administration and Mexico show little progress, with tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts already implemented. The investment will allow GM to assemble over two million vehicles annually in the U.S. by 2027. The move is seen as a potential win for President Trump's policies aimed at boosting American manufacturing. The investment reflects GM's commitment to American innovation and job creation, giving customers a wider range of vehicle choices. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>

Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat who previously ran as a Republican and independent, is also a strong supporter of Israel, which may have influenced his decision given the rise of progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani.

          <p>US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which issues government recommendations on immunizations.

Doctors and health experts have criticized this decision, calling it "norm-breaking" and worrying that it will further fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses. Kennedy claimed that the committee has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.
