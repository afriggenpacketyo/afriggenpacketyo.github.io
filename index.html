          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck southeastern Afghanistan near the border with Pakistan late Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's epicenter was 22 miles north of Bāsawul with a shallow depth of 6.2 miles. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from this specific event. The region is seismically active, and this quake follows a devastating 6.3 magnitude earthquake in October 2023 that resulted in thousands of fatalities, highlighting the area's vulnerability to natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev has voiced his disagreement with a $3,000 fine he received for using foul language during a US Open match. Rublev argued that players should not be penalized for profanity directed at themselves in moments of high stress, distinguishing it from abusive language aimed at officials or opponents. He stated that expletives are a normal part of high-stakes sports and reflect the intense pressure of competition. The fine comes as fellow Russian player Daniil Medvedev also received a significant fine for an outburst.</p>

Police had implemented a dispersal order and set restrictions on the demonstration, which was attended by about 200 people. One man was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred, while a man and a woman were arrested for breaching protest orders. The unrest follows charges of sexual assault against an asylum seeker housed at the hotel, a case that is currently proceeding through the courts.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced that Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, was killed in an aerial attack on Gaza City. Israel's Defence Minister praised the operation, though Hamas has not yet confirmed the death. The strike targeted a residential building in the al-Rimal neighborhood, where local sources also reported numerous civilian casualties. Obeida was a well-known, masked figure who delivered propaganda statements for the al-Qassam Brigades, and his death would mark a significant development in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton will face a five-place grid penalty at the upcoming Italian Grand Prix in Monza. The penalty was issued after he failed to sufficiently slow down under double yellow flags before the start of the Dutch Grand Prix. This incident adds to a challenging weekend for the Ferrari team, which saw both Hamilton and his teammate Charles Leclerc crash out of the race in separate events. The penalty means Hamilton will start no higher than sixth for his first race at Monza as a Ferrari driver.</p>

The 7-4 ruling stated Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping tariffs.

The article suggests that this diplomatic chaos allows Russia to grind down its adversaries while Trump chases headlines, with the real costs being borne by Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Archdiocese of Los Angeles is facing scrutiny following a scandal at Bishop Montgomery High School that led to the firing of its football coach and co-athletic director, Ed Hodgkiss. The school had to forfeit a major game after several transfer students were declared ineligible by the Southern Section governing body for providing false information. Critics suggest the archdiocese should have recognized the warning signs of a program trying to rapidly improve with shortcuts, drawing parallels to a similar scandal at St. Bernard High School in 2020.</p>

          <p>A man shared a strange story on Reddit about a "super flirty" woman he met on a flight who gave him her number and made plans to meet for a drink. He said the woman, who was not wearing a wedding ring, was very forward during the flight. However, upon landing, he was surprised to see her holding hands with a man and wearing a wedding ring. The bizarre encounter concluded later that night when he saw the couple at the same hotel bar, where she continued to make flirty eye contact from across the room without approaching him.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has secured its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership will create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, significantly bolstering NATO's security capabilities in the North Atlantic. The deal was seen as a major victory for the UK defence industry over competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed the death of an infant from whooping cough, marking the first such fatality in the UK this year. The baby's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during her pregnancy. This tragic event highlights government warnings about declining vaccine uptake and the dangers of the bacterial infection for newborns. Health officials are re-emphasizing the importance of the maternal whooping cough vaccine, which is key to protecting infants in their first weeks of life before they can receive their own jabs.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore addressed his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump over crime in Baltimore, stating he has "no interest in fighting with the president, but I have an interest in fighting for my communities." Trump recently renewed threats to send the National Guard to the city, calling it a "hellhole." Moore criticized the president's "arrogant criticism and cynicism," arguing that Baltimore is a "great American turnaround story" and that deploying troops who are not trained for municipal policing is not a serious solution to the city's challenges.</p>

          <p>During an informal meeting in Copenhagen, EU foreign ministers brainstormed new approaches to bolster support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas discussed were the possibility of secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms companies on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Ukraine. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission onto Ukrainian territory in the event of a ceasefire.</p>

The article notes that while Rangers showed resilience and organization, a welcome change for manager Russell Martin, they still recorded their worst league start since 1983. Celtic's performance was particularly feeble, with manager Brendan Rodgers lamenting his team's lack of creativity and failure to generate any significant attacking threat. Both teams face considerable pressure to improve.</p>

          <p>An article from The Economist suggests that Donald Trump is increasingly focusing on America's public universities as a political target. The piece frames this as part of a broader culture war, noting the shift from campus protests over the Gaza war to a more tranquil summer atmosphere at institutions like UCLA. It implies that this calm may be temporary as political scrutiny and potential policy changes from a Trump administration could significantly impact these centers of education and research. This focus is presented as a key element of his political strategy.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto has announced that political parties have agreed to reduce some state-funded perks for politicians to help quell nationwide anti-government protests. The demonstrations, which have turned violent in several cities, were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers. In response, the government will rein in some allowances and impose a moratorium on overseas trips for officials. The unrest escalated after a ride-sharing driver was killed during a protest, inflaming tensions over police conduct and economic inequality.</p>

          <p>A major kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has achieved remarkable success by removing nearly 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins. Over the past 13 years, divers have cleared 80 acres of "urchin barrens," allowing the vital kelp forests, known as the "sequoias of the sea," to regrow. The proliferation of urchins, caused by an ecological imbalance, had decimated the kelp, which provides critical habitat for hundreds of marine species. The project is now being viewed as a potential model for kelp restoration efforts worldwide.</p>
