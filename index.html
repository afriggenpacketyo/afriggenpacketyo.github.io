          <p>A recent Japanese government survey indicates that approximately half of respondents believed false information encountered on social media. The survey, conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, examined reactions to false claims, such as mass beaching events signaling impending earthquakes. Internal affairs minister Seiichiro Murakami emphasized the importance of enhancing media literacy to combat the spread of unsourced online information. The survey highlighted a gap between recognizing the need for media literacy and actively improving understanding, as many respondents had not taken steps to verify online content before believing it.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally-ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been considered. The legislation requires two doctors to assess a patient's mental fitness before they can receive medical assistance to end their life. First Minister John Swinney and other prominent figures have expressed opposition, raising concerns about potential coercion and the definition of terminal illness. Supporters argue the bill provides necessary safeguards and respects individual choice, addressing vulnerabilities faced by terminally-ill individuals who might otherwise take matters into their own hands.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a preliminary injunction sought by nonprofit groups to prevent the IRS from sharing immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for identifying and deporting individuals in the U.S. illegally. The lawsuit argued that undocumented immigrants paying taxes are entitled to the same privacy protections as citizens and legal immigrants. The judge stated that the agreement doesn't violate the Internal Revenue Code, but clarified that ICE must already have the name and address of the person, and can only access information obtained through audits, not directly from tax returns, with the exception of taxpayer identity information.</p>

          <p>Following a surprise trade agreement between the U.S. and China, several investment banks are increasing their China GDP growth outlooks. The agreement involves reducing mutual tariffs from 125% to 10% for 90 days, leading UBS to predict China's 2025 GDP growth could reach 3.7% to 4%, up from a previous estimate of 3.4%. Morgan Stanley also anticipates a potential increase in China's second-quarter GDP, expecting companies to expedite exports to capitalize on the lower tariffs, while ANZ Bank now sees potential for China's GDP to come in higher than 4.2% this year.</p>

Experts suggest that technological advances alone may not be enough to overcome these economic imbalances.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following trade talks between the United States and China, tariff rates imposed since April have been reduced, but a complex web of duties remains. While new duties have been lowered, previous tariffs from Trump's first term are still in effect, resulting in a baseline rate of about 50% for Chinese exporters. The 90-day suspension of tariffs provides some relief, potentially mitigating product shortages for the U.S. Christmas season, but pre-existing tariffs will remain in place. UBS estimates the total weighted average U.S. tariff rate on Chinese products is now around 43.5%, including pre-existing duties.</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms, which benefited from interest rate hikes in 2022, now face a critical test as interest rates decline. Fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo saw increased profits due to higher net interest income, but falling rates raise concerns about the sustainability of this revenue stream. Experts suggest that fintechs with diversified revenue streams, such as Revolut's crypto and share trading offerings, are better positioned to adapt. ClearBank's shift from interest income to fee-based income signals the potential impact of lower rates on the sector.</p>

          <p>Avelo Airlines, a budget carrier, has begun federal deportation flights for ICE out of Arizona, sparking controversy and criticism. The airline signed an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security and will use three Boeing 737-800 planes for the flights. The move has inspired an online boycott petition and criticism from the flight attendants union, citing safety concerns. Protests have been held outside airports in Arizona and Connecticut, urging Avelo to reconsider its involvement in deportation efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A China-led international team of researchers suggests that liquid water may be present just a few kilometers beneath the surface of Mars. Using data from NASA's InSight lander, the team analyzed seismic waves from marsquakes and meteorite impacts. The presence of water-saturated rock could account for the planet's missing water, matching what scientists believe has escaped into space, become locked into rocks, or remains as ice and vapor. This discovery could reshape understanding of Mars' water cycle and potential for habitable environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses how German companies, which invest heavily in the United States, are reevaluating their strategies due to trade tensions. While thousands of German companies already have factories in the U.S., recent surveys indicate a pullback in new investments and a more pessimistic outlook. Trump's tariffs are cited as a major factor, leading German firms to consider keeping investments at home, especially with a new government in Germany focused on reducing bureaucracy and energy prices. The automotive sector is particularly affected, with BMW and Mercedes-Benz seeking to ease tariffs.</p>

          <p>The second Trump administration is facing increasing criticism for its disregard of ethical norms and legal guardrails, with examples including accepting a luxury jet from Qatar and the sale of access through meme coins.

The administration's approach is emboldened by Supreme Court rulings and Trump's strong hold on the Republican Party, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the leveraging of public office for private benefit.</p>

          <p>President Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has created a diplomatic challenge for India. India has historically opposed third-party mediation, particularly in the Kashmir conflict, which dates back to 1947. While Pakistan has welcomed Trump's offer, India views Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and rejects external interference. The situation is complicated by India's recent actions in Kashmir and ongoing tensions with Pakistan over cross-border terrorism.</p>

While the collection reached $272 million, it fell short of pre-sale estimates. A Mondrian painting, the top lot, sold for $47.6 million, but failed to spark a bidding war.
