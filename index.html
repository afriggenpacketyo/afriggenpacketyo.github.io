          <p>President Trump downplayed his feud with Elon Musk, referring to him as someone who has "lost his mind" and expressing a lack of interest in further communication. This exchange followed Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and immigration bill, leading to Musk's endorsement of impeachment calls and unsubstantiated claims about Trump's involvement in the Epstein files. Trump responded by suggesting the termination of Musk's government contracts and subsidies. Despite the heated rhetoric, some close to Trump suggested he was more saddened than angered by the falling out, while Vice President Vance voiced support for Trump amidst the dispute.</p>

          <p>According to a Labor Department report, hiring slowed in May, with employers adding 139,000 jobs, a decrease from the previous month. Job gains in March and April were also revised downward. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, but the workforce decreased by 625,000 people. Federal government job cuts contributed to the slowdown, while factories also experienced job losses, partly attributed to the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the manufacturing sector. Average wages increased by 3.9% year-over-year, potentially outpacing price increases.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from detaining Yunseo Chung, a Columbia University student and lawful permanent resident, who faces deportation after participating in an anti-Israel demonstration. The judge's order restricts Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from arresting Chung without prior court approval, ensuring her freedom while her legal case proceeds. Chung's attorneys argue that the government's actions infringe upon her First Amendment rights. The Trump administration contends that her protest involvement poses adverse foreign policy implications for the U.S., while Chung's legal team asserts she was merely a participant expressing shared concerns over the Gaza conflict.</p>

Despite this, the central bank emphasizes that monetary policy will remain tight to achieve its 4% inflation target. Russia's economy has faced significant strain due to its invasion of Ukraine and subsequent economic re-orientation, with GDP growth slowing in the first quarter of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK has shifted its stance to endorse Morocco's autonomy plan for Western Sahara, describing it as the "most credible" position, aligning with other Western countries. This move marks a change from the UK's previous support for a UN-led referendum to determine the territory's future. Morocco views this as a significant contribution to finding a mutually acceptable solution, while Algeria, a regional rival backing the Polisario Front, condemns the proposal. Experts suggest the UK's position allows for flexibility compared to France's more assertive endorsement of Morocco's plan, reflecting the growing significance of Morocco as a gateway to Africa and a production location.</p>

          <p>Health experts are warning families traveling abroad this summer about a significant rise in measles cases across Europe and other regions, including Pakistan and Nigeria. Measles infections in Europe have reached a 25-year high, while childhood vaccination rates in the UK remain below the recommended 95% uptake. The UK Health Security Agency advises travelers to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccinations, stressing that it is never too late to get vaccinated. The increase in cases is attributed to declining vaccination rates, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic, making it essential for families to take preventative measures before traveling.</p>

The timeline includes key events such as Musk's endorsement of Trump after an assassination attempt, his role in the Department of Government Efficiency, and the eventual fallout over policy differences and personal accusations.

          <p>Wes Anderson's new film, "The Phoenician Scheme," is about a tycoon, Zsa-zsa Korda, played by Benicio del Toro, whose character was inspired by old-fashioned European magnates but also reflects the preening foolishness of today's mega-rich. The film follows Korda's madcap dash across the globe to save his dwindling fortune, prodding at the foolishness of today's mega-rich land barons. Anderson acknowledges that real-world issues are filtering into his storytelling, transforming them through his signature style. The film explores themes of familial relationships and the meaning of life.</p>

          <p>An article in Vox discusses the increasing threat to digital privacy posed by artificial intelligence, highlighting how AI can gather personal information from seemingly innocuous online content. The author shares an example of how OpenAI's o3 pinpointed her family's vacation location from a single beach photo. AI's ability to automate tasks that previously required significant human effort means that personal information is more easily accessible to those with malicious intentions. The article also touches on the potential for AI to report users to authorities under certain circumstances, raising concerns about government surveillance and the need for stronger regulations.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis reveals that the Glazer family's acquisition of Manchester United in 2005 has cost the club approximately Â£1.2 billion.

          <p>The Trump administration's push to cut funding for public radio and television is posing a significant threat to rural America, where these services often serve as a vital source of news and information. With the decline of local newspapers, many rural communities rely on public media, particularly NPR's network of member stations, for credible local reporting. Critics argue that these cuts would disproportionately harm smaller communities, impacting their access to essential news, cultural programming, and emergency alerting services. Supporters of public media are urging Congress to reject the proposed cuts and maintain funding to ensure these critical services continue.</p>
