          <p>Swiss food giant Nestlé has dismissed CEO Laurent Freixe after an investigation confirmed he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate. The inquiry was reportedly initiated via the company's whistleblowing channel and found a conflict of interest. Freixe, who had been with the company for nearly 40 years and CEO for one, will not receive an exit package. Philipp Navratil has been appointed as his successor, with the company stating its core strategy will remain unchanged.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced he will award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. The decision comes shortly after Giuliani, his longtime political ally and former lawyer, was hospitalized following a serious car crash. The announcement highlights Giuliani's controversial public image, contrasting his celebrated leadership as New York's mayor after 9/11 with his later disbarment and criminal charges for efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He has denied all wrongdoing in those cases.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis to be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom in the coming days. This rare opportunity is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which enhances solar winds interacting with Earth's magnetic field. While northern regions typically have the best views, the lights could potentially be seen as far south as the Midlands. Visibility will depend on clear, dark skies, with experts advising people to move away from city light pollution for the best viewing experience.</p>

          <p>The recent transfers of Alexander Isak to Liverpool and Yoane Wissa to Newcastle have ignited a debate over the growing power of players to force moves away from their clubs. Both players refused to train and issued public statements demanding transfers, which ultimately proved successful. This contrasts with the case of Marc Guehi, whose potential move to Liverpool collapsed despite his professionalism. Commentators are divided, with some condemning the players' actions as disrespectful, while others argue it is a necessary response to clubs that often show little loyalty themselves.</p>

Analysts suggest this hesitation is driven by two key strategic factors. First, Trump reportedly still hopes to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine and take credit for it. Second, there are concerns in Washington that completely isolating Russia would push it further into a strategic alliance with China, potentially strengthening Beijing's global position by granting it greater access to Russian resources and military technology.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The movie explores a crisis point in Kerr's life in 1997, when his first professional loss sent him into a spiral of substance abuse and personal turmoil. The film, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, also features Emily Blunt as Kerr's girlfriend, Dawn. Johnson's performance is noted as a powerful depiction of the fighter's vulnerability, though the film is seen as a solid but not groundbreaking entry in the sports drama genre.</p>

          <p>At least 54 people were shot, seven of whom died, during a violent Labor Day weekend in Chicago, according to police reports. The incidents included a drive-by shooting that wounded seven people in the Bronzeville neighborhood. This surge in violence occurred as President Donald Trump renewed threats to deploy federal agents or the National Guard to the city, a move strongly opposed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. The mayor signed an executive order to protect the city from what he termed federal overreach.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on pharmaceutical companies to publicly justify the success of their COVID-19 drugs and vaccines, stating he wants an answer "NOW." His comments come amid significant leadership turmoil at the CDC, including the recent firing of its director, and new FDA limits on vaccine eligibility. Trump referenced his administration's Operation Warp Speed initiative while also acknowledging the public debate over vaccine efficacy, a topic championed by his HHS Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He urged drugmakers to release their data to "clear up this MESS."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data reveals a significant decline of 1.2 million immigrant workers in the United States from January through July. This trend reflects the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, which have slowed the flow of both legal and undocumented immigrants into the country. Economists note that this reduction could impact sectors heavily reliant on immigrant labor, such as agriculture, construction, and services. The decline may also complicate labor market analysis and affect regional economies that depend on this workforce to fill shortages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Emigrant Fire in Oregon's Lane County has expanded to nearly 22,000 acres and remains 0% contained as of Labor Day. The fire, started by lightning, grew rapidly through a previous burn scar. Fire officials are bracing for critical weather conditions, including high temperatures and potential thunderstorms, which are expected to increase fire activity this week. Due to its size and the challenging conditions, the fire is expected to continue burning until seasonal rains arrive in the fall. Recreation closures are in effect in the surrounding areas.</p>

          <p>The UK government is temporarily halting new applications for its refugee family reunion program, which previously allowed refugees to bring family members to the country without conditions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the change aligns the UK with other European nations and addresses pressures on local councils, which often face homelessness cases from these families. Under the temporary rules, refugees must meet the same income and accommodation requirements as other migrants. The government plans to outline further reforms to the system later this year.</p>

          <p>A plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen experienced significant GPS disruption, believed to be caused by Russian interference, as it approached Bulgaria. While the flight landed safely using alternative navigation methods, Bulgarian authorities suspect intentional jamming by Russia. The incident highlights a growing trend of GPS interference and spoofing, particularly in Eastern Europe near Russian territory, which aviation authorities warn could pose serious safety risks. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the incident, calling the information incorrect.</p>
