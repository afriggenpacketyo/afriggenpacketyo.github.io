          <p>Former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams was awarded €100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC regarding a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and online article. The report alleged that Adams sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, which Adams denies. The court found the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith, and Adams stated the case was about holding the BBC accountable, while the Donaldson family called for a public inquiry into the murder. The BBC expressed disappointment and warned the decision could hinder freedom of expression, emphasizing the extensive evidence and journalistic diligence applied to the program. Optimism surrounding this news is low, considering the sensitive nature of the case and its implications for both the parties involved and freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring alternative methods for imposing tariffs following a federal court ruling that challenged its use of emergency powers. The administration is committed to addressing trade deficits, despite the legal roadblock, with White House officials indicating that the president will utilize all available tools to advance trade policies. Options include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 and 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, each with varying degrees of authority and limitations. The situation remains fluid, with the administration appealing the court's decision while also considering more targeted approaches to trade policy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Army has circulated guidelines for the expulsion of transgender troops, instructing personnel to address transgender soldiers by their sex assigned at birth and outlining criteria for identifying soldiers with gender dysphoria. The guidance contradicts previous assurances of dignity and respect for transgender service members, and it has drawn criticism for potentially violating transgender social norms. One transgender Army officer facing separation condemned the policy as worse than 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' citing the open service of transgender troops since 2016 without adverse impacts. The Army maintains that it will treat all soldiers with dignity and respect, but the policies align with President Trump's executive order, which views transgender service as inconsistent with military cohesion.</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging his executive order to cut off federal funding to the organization. PBS argues that the order violates the U.S. Constitution and federal telecommunications law, accusing Trump of retaliating against the broadcaster over perceived political slights in news coverage. The lawsuit claims that Trump's actions infringe on speech and press freedom, and it seeks to protect PBS's editorial independence and the autonomy of its member stations. The White House defended the order, stating that the CPB was creating media to support a particular political party on taxpayers' dime, and that the president is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding.</p>

          <p>Stephen Stanko, a death row inmate in South Carolina, has chosen lethal injection as his method of execution after previously considering death by firing squad. This decision comes after concerns arose about the potential for a botched execution by firing squad, following an autopsy on another inmate that suggested he may have experienced excruciating pain. Stanko had been sentenced to death twice for two separate murders, including the sexual assault and attempted murder of a teenage girl. South Carolina resumed executions in September after a 13-year break, due to a shortage of lethal injection drugs.</p>

The gallery's collection of presidential portraits included text about Trump's impeachments and his historic comeback in the 2024 election.

          <p>The F/A-18s from the carrier Harry S. Truman returned to Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach after an 8 1/2-month deployment. The aircraft carrier and its strike group spent more than five months defending merchant mariners and military vessels from Houthi drones and missiles in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The air wing lost three F/A-18s during the deployment, but no crew members were harmed. Despite the incidents, the air wing was described as persevering.</p>

          <p>California is challenging its designation as a sanctuary jurisdiction by the Trump administration, arguing that state law does not obstruct federal immigration enforcement. Governor Gavin Newsom's office requested that California be removed from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions. The Department of Homeland Security issued the list in accordance with an executive order President Trump signed in April that directs federal agencies to identify funding to sanctuary cities, counties and states that could be suspended or terminated. California's sanctuary policies limit local law enforcement coordination with immigration authorities, but state officials maintain they do not prevent federal enforcement.</p>
