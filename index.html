          <p>A top White House economic adviser has indicated that the Trump administration may delay imposing new tariffs on countries that are negotiating trade deals in good faith. As the deadline approaches, this suggests a potential shift for nations making progress in talks, while those not cooperating could face higher tariffs. The official remained optimistic about securing several new deals, though specifics on which countries might receive an extension were not provided. This contrasts with criticism from former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who warned of higher consumer prices and reduced competitiveness from the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economists are calling for more decisive action from Beijing to combat China's persistent deflationary pressures and sluggish domestic demand. The country's GDP deflator has been negative for over a year, and consumer prices continue to fall, signaling a worrying economic trend. Analysts argue that previous efforts to address the issue by reducing overcapacity have been insufficient. They identify weak consumer and business confidence, stemming from downturns in the property and financial sectors, as the root cause that requires more robust government intervention.

          <p>After making landfall as a tropical storm, Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression but continued to bring heavy rainfall and flash flooding to North Carolina and Virginia. The storm prompted numerous water rescues and caused significant flooding, with some rivers cresting near record levels. While no injuries were immediately reported, authorities issued flood watches for several mid-Atlantic states as the system moved northeast. The event underscores NOAA's prediction for an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, with dangerous surf and rip currents expected to persist along the coast.</p>

          <p>Researchers in the U.K. have created small robots, known as "Pipebots," designed to navigate inside underground water pipes to identify and potentially fix leaks without costly and disruptive excavation. These robots use cameras and acoustic sensors to travel through the pipe network, sending real-time data to engineers. This innovation is part of a broader effort to modernize aging water infrastructure, reduce water waste, and prevent pollution from damaged pipes. The technology could offer a more efficient and affordable solution for maintaining critical infrastructure globally.</p>

Reich compares these moves to Viktor Orbán's methods in Hungary, suggesting the administration is using issues like DEI and antisemitism as pretexts to assert power over higher education. He concludes that this attack on education is an attempt to create a less-informed populace, which is more susceptible to authoritarian rule.</p>

          <p>The long-standing American model of accommodating population growth through suburban sprawl is showing signs of failure, even in historically affordable Sunbelt cities. Urban economists have found that housing construction in these regions has slowed dramatically, causing prices to surge and threatening to create an affordability crisis similar to those on the coasts. This article argues that restrictive zoning laws, which often ban anything other than single-family homes, have frozen neighborhoods in time and prevented necessary densification. This paralysis suggests a fundamental rethinking of American suburbs is needed to address the national housing shortage.</p>

          <p>A paramedic in Scotland has been sentenced to over ten years in prison for secretly administering an abortion drug to a woman, causing her to miscarry their unborn child. Stephen Doohan, who was married at the time, injected the woman with the drug after learning she was pregnant with his baby. He pleaded guilty to assault, sexual assault, and causing an abortion. The judge described his actions as an appalling betrayal of trust that left his victim with a lifetime of pain and loss, imposing a lengthy jail sentence and an indefinite non-harassment order.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented move, the Trump administration has deported a group of eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a conflict-ridden country where none of them are citizens. The men, originally from countries in Latin America and Asia, were sent to South Sudan after their home countries refused to accept them. The deportation followed a contentious legal battle, with human rights advocates arguing the act is punitive and unconstitutional, potentially exposing the men to torture or other harm. The administration hailed the move as a victory for its immigration enforcement agenda.</p>

          <p>Oscar Black, a 15-year-old from Northern Ireland, has set a new record as the youngest person to swim the North Channel solo, from Northern Ireland to Scotland. The grueling swim took him 16 hours and 38 minutes, during which he battled strong currents that extended his journey to 46km and endured numerous jellyfish stings. Despite the immense physical and mental challenges, which at times made him question his endeavor, Black persevered to complete the record-breaking feat. He described the accomplishment as a difficult but ultimately rewarding experience.</p>

          <p>Amid a national trend toward tougher policies on homelessness and drug addiction, Los Angeles County is embracing a harm reduction approach with its new Skid Row Care Campus. The facility provides essential services like housing and treatment, but also offers clean syringes, pipes, and naloxone to help people use drugs more safely, aiming to prevent overdoses and the spread of disease. This strategy, which meets individuals where they are without demanding immediate sobriety, is supported by public health experts but remains controversial. It stands in contrast to the Trump administration's focus on forced treatment.</p>

          <p>A debate is raging over the health impacts of seed oils like canola and soybean, with some wellness influencers and public figures claiming they are toxic and drive inflammation. However, many nutrition researchers argue that these claims are overblown and that the science does not support them. While seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, clinical trials have not shown that they increase inflammation in the body; in fact, they can help lower bad cholesterol. Experts largely agree that the greater health concern is the overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, where these oils are prevalent.</p>

          <p>A significant environmental problem exists across the U.S. in the form of hundreds of thousands, and possibly over a million, undocumented and unplugged "orphan" oil and gas wells. These defunct wells can leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and other toxins into the air and water, but finding them is a major challenge. A multi-billion dollar federal program is now funding efforts by states, tribes, and researchers to locate these wells using historical records, drones, and fieldwork. However, the cost of properly plugging them is immense, and policy changes are needed to prevent currently active wells from being orphaned in the future.</p>

The conflict has dominated the co-op's meetings and recent board elections, turning the normally community-focused grocer into a microcosm of the broader geopolitical debate.

          <p>The Trump administration is set to formalize new tariff rates this week, following a period of uncertainty after a temporary 90-day pause on higher taxes. Having secured only a few bilateral deals instead of the promised ninety, the administration is moving forward with its unorthodox trade policy, which economists warn will likely pass costs onto U.S. companies and consumers. The approach prioritizes bilateral negotiations and uses the threat of high tariffs to pressure trading partners. This strategy marks a significant departure from previous administrations' multilateral trade agreements. (not investment advice)</p>
