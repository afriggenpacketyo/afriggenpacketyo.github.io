          <p>A 3-year-old cat named Pudge became a social media star during a Bowling Green Falcons football game, where the team secured its first win of the season. The cat belongs to the team's long snapper, who brought him to the facility to boost morale, and has since become an unofficial mascot. Pudge's popularity soared after a TikTok video went viral, leading to an NIL deal for merchandise and gaining attention from professional sports teams, overshadowing the game's athletic achievements.</p>

The deal for Jackson includes a substantial loan fee and a purchase option, while Nkunku's sale further bolsters the club's finances. These moves are part of Chelsea's strategy to comply with UEFA financial regulations by balancing their spending on new signings with income from player sales this summer.</p>

          <p>American far-right extremist groups are reportedly studying the use of commercial and homemade drones as weapons for potential domestic attacks against the US government and critical infrastructure. Citing online chatter and a recent plot by a neo-Nazi to bomb a power station, security analysts express concern that these groups are emulating tactics used by international terrorist groups and drug cartels. The FBI is particularly worried about accelerationist sects recruiting military-trained individuals with drone operation skills.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece contends that the University of California system should sue the Trump administration over the illegal suspension of hundreds of millions in research funds, rather than negotiate a settlement. The author, a co-counsel in a similar successful lawsuit by Harvard, argues that capitulating would set a dangerous precedent and betray the university's values. The piece frames the administration's actions as politically motivated extortion using allegations of antisemitism as a pretext for advancing an ideological agenda.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed connections between several major sportswear brands, including Nike, Li-Ning, and Anta, and forced labor programs involving Uyghur and other ethnic minorities from China's Xinjiang region. These brands, which have lucrative sponsorship deals with prominent NBA players, are linked to factories participating in government-run labor transfer schemes. The report highlights the NBA's complex financial relationship with China and the ethical dilemmas faced by athletes and corporations profiting from these endorsements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has declared that President Trump's global "reciprocal tariffs" were illegally imposed, ruling that he overreached his emergency powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant a president the authority to levy such taxes, a power that constitutionally belongs to Congress. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for a potential appeal to the Supreme Court, creating significant uncertainty for the U.S. economy and international trade.</p>

          <p>An interview with author Dan Wang discusses his book "Breakneck," which posits that China's rapid development stems from it being an "engineering state," while the U.S. is a "lawyerly society."

The analysis also touches on the downsides of China's approach, including social engineering and repression, while highlighting lessons the U.S. could learn about fostering abundance.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing significant political hurdles with his "autumn of reform" agenda, aimed at overhauling the country's welfare state and boosting the economy.

          <p>This article argues that direct cash transfers remain one of the most effective tools for alleviating poverty, despite recent studies suggesting limited secondary benefits like improved health or employment. It counters that the primary goal—giving people money to escape poverty—is consistently achieved, and that decades of research confirm long-term positive effects, especially for children. The author suggests recent pilot programs may show muted results due to the unique economic context of the pandemic and the rising cost of living, which cash alone cannot solve.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has signed 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a club record fee of up to £69 million. The six-year contract for the 6ft 6in forward surpasses the previous record set by Alexander Isak's transfer. Woltemade, who had a breakout season with Stuttgart and was the top scorer at the Under-21 Euros, is seen as a key addition to Newcastle's attacking options, especially amid uncertainty over Isak's future at the club.</p>

          <p>The UK prison service has been deeply affected by the murder of former officer Lenny Scott, who was shot and killed by a drug dealer in a planned revenge attack. The killer, Elias Morgan, targeted Scott four years after Scott had exposed Morgan's illicit affair with a female officer while he was incarcerated. The murder has horrified the profession and highlighted the dangers officers face, with a union leader stating the unprecedented nature of the killing has damaged morale and made staff reconsider their careers.</p>

          <p>Finland is set to become the first country to implement a permanent solution for nuclear waste by burying spent fuel rods in a deep underground facility called Onkalo. The project, developed over two decades, will store all the high-level waste from the country's nuclear power plants in copper canisters encased in clay, deep within stable bedrock. This pioneering approach to long-term waste management is being hailed by international agencies as a significant step forward for the safety and sustainability of nuclear energy.</p>

          <p>Since 2017, Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been issued over half of all administrative fines levied against political parties by the parliament, totaling approximately €1.1 million. The penalties relate to violations such as accepting illegal donations, misusing parliamentary funds, and providing false information in financial reports. A party spokesperson attributed the issues to "inexperience" in its early years, while other major parties in the Bundestag have incurred significantly smaller cumulative fines during the same period.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece argues that President Donald Trump's economic policies represent a significant departure from the Republican party's traditional free-market principles, moving toward a more interventionist model dubbed "Trumpalism." The article cites examples such as the government taking a stake in chipmaker Intel, demanding a cut of firms' overseas sales, and directly intervening in corporate decisions, from takeovers to logo changes. This approach, where the president acts as a "chairman of the economy," prioritizes personal leverage over a consistent ideological framework. (not investment advice)</p>

The discovery of hundreds of juvenile steelhead is a major encouragement for conservationists, as the species is listed as endangered at both the state and national levels. To protect the resurgent population from potential threats like overfishing, state officials have since relocated the fish to a safer, undisclosed location.</p>

The FDA has only formally "approved" the updated shots for those 65 and older or with high-risk health conditions, meaning younger, healthy individuals may now need to consult a healthcare provider to get vaccinated. This shift, which critics call a barrier to public health, could make obtaining the vaccine more difficult depending on state-specific regulations regarding pharmacists' authority to administer shots "off-label."</p>
