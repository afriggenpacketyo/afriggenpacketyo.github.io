          <h2>Chinese Think Tank Research Center Ceases Operations Amid Loyalty Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top Chinese think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), has shut down its public policy research center due to ideological reinforcement and loyalty concerns. The center's activities are now deemed illegal, and its research projects have been transferred to the Institute of Economics. Researchers affiliated with other departments have returned to their original institutions, while others have been dismissed. This move signals a significant shift within CASS towards greater adherence to the ruling Communist Party line, following investigations into economists critical of China's economic policies.</p>

          <h2>Economists Warn of Potential Stagflation Crisis in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are raising concerns that the United States may be headed for a stagflation crisis, characterized by stagnant growth, rising inflation, and elevated unemployment. This risk is largely attributed to President Trump's imposition of tariffs on foreign imports, which could undermine the supply side of the economy. Stagflation presents a difficult challenge for policymakers, as measures to combat unemployment could worsen inflation, and vice versa. While some economists believe the US can avoid a prolonged crisis, the tariffs have already triggered market sell-offs, reflecting investor uncertainty.</p>

Road congestion is expected to be heavy on routes to Channel ports and popular holiday destinations, with motorists urged to ensure their vehicles are in good condition.

          <p>Global share prices have fallen due to new tariffs announced by President Trump, raising concerns about the impact on personal finances. While many people may not directly invest in the stock market, pension savings are often invested by pension schemes, and their value is influenced by market performance. Falling share prices can negatively affect pension savers, especially those nearing retirement who may use their pension pot to buy an annuity. Prolonged declines in share prices could also lead to job losses as companies cut costs to address investor concerns.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, due to fears that President Trump's global tariffs will trigger a recession. Worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, slowing down economic activity and ultimately hurting demand for oil.

          <p>The UK government is easing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry, which is facing trade tariffs from the US. While a ban on producing new petrol and diesel cars will still take effect in 2030, manufacturers will have more flexibility on annual targets and face lower fines. The changes are intended to help the car industry in the face of trade tariffs from the US. Smaller British firms like Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep making petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline.&#x20;</p>

          <h2>American Business Owners Grapple with the Impact of Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Many American shop owners are feeling like collateral damage in the global trade war, as President Trump's new tariffs on all imports disrupt supply chains and eat into profit margins. Business owners are facing difficult decisions, such as raising prices, shrinking selections, freezing hiring, and pausing advertising or new product development. The key argument President Trump makes in favor of tariffs is that they would jump-start American manufacturing, forcing more companies to source their products domestically. U.S. manufacturers often cannot tackle the scale of orders or cannot compete with prices from overseas.</p>

          <p>Big-time college sports are on the cusp of a major legal settlement that could revolutionize the industry by allowing schools to share revenue with student-athletes. The case, known as House vs. NCAA, also proposes roster limits and a third-party clearinghouse for marketing deals. A federal judge is set to hold a final approval hearing, after which schools in the power conferences will be able to distribute tens of millions of dollars in direct payments to players. The settlement aims to give the NCAA and power conferences greater oversight over NIL deals.</p>

          <p>The Arizona trial of Lori Vallow Daybell, dubbed the "Doomsday mom," is underway, focusing on a charge of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Vallow Daybell, already sentenced to life in prison in Idaho for killing her children, is representing herself at the trial. Charles Vallow was shot and killed by Lori Vallow Daybell's brother, Alexander Lamar Cox, in 2019. The trial is expected to last until mid-May, and if found guilty, Vallow faces life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years.</p>

          <p>Paige Bueckers has secured her legacy as a college basketball great, even before UConn's victory in the national championship game against South Carolina. Her extraordinary resume, including a National Player of the Year award as a freshman, speaks for itself. Despite injuries and the rise of other stars like Caitlin Clark, Bueckers has consistently demonstrated her talent and leadership. The championship win further cements her place among the all-time greats, although her performance in the game itself was not her best.</p>

          <p>With global temperatures exceeding 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, scientists are advocating for the exploration of extreme climate solutions, including techniques to thicken sea ice and brighten marine clouds. These approaches, while controversial, should undergo rigorous research and assessment to determine their feasibility and potential risks. The longer we delay, the fewer options remain on the table and the more likely that deployment will happen without the proper due diligence at a point of desperation. The question remains: if not now, then when?</p>

          <p>Librarians are facing increased challenges under the Trump administration, including burnout, book bans, legislation pushed by right-wing groups, and providing essential resources to fill gaps in the U.S.’s social safety net. Many librarians are describing Trump’s policies as “catastrophic” to accessing information and the libraries themselves. These policies include those affecting different community partners and customers that are represented in some of the executive orders. Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” recently gutted the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which the American Library Association noted greatly affects the important services they offer.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has condemned law firms that have made deals with the Trump administration, accusing them of "selling out their soul" for money. Sanders criticized the "absolute cowardice" of these firms, which had represented political rivals of Trump but capitulated after he issued orders threatening to cripple them. He argued that the US has become a “pseudo-democracy” because of Trump’s actions, such as tasking Elon Musk with slashing the size as well as funding of various federal government agencies and services.</p>

          <p>Kenya has announced that a new funding structure proposed by China will allow the country to revive a stalled Standard Gauge Railway extension bordering Uganda. A consortium of Chinese companies will provide 40 per cent of the funding for the US$5.3 billion railway line from Naivasha to Malaba, and will operate the railway and charge toll fees for some years to recoup their investment. Some 30 per cent of the project funding was expected to come from the Export-Import Bank of China (China Exim Bank) in the form of loans.</p>
