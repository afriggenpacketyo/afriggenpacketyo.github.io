        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has overturned the more than $454 million civil fraud judgment against Donald Trump, his family, and his company. The original ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron found them liable for a decade of fraud by inflating asset values to secure better business deals, imposing a penalty that grew with interest. Trump's legal team successfully argued on appeal that the case involved a misapplication of the law and other procedural violations, leading to the reversal of the significant financial penalty. This decision marks a major legal victory for the former president in the high-profile case brought by New York's Attorney General.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams has publicly shared her experience using GLP-1 weight loss medications, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, to overcome a weight-loss plateau after having children. In a campaign for the telehealth company Ro, Williams revealed she lost 31 pounds in eight months and aims to destigmatize the use of these drugs, stating it is a form of self-care, not an "easy way out." She joins other public figures like Oprah Winfrey in openly discussing their use of these popular but controversial medications. The article also notes the potential side effects and ongoing lawsuits related to the drugs' gastrointestinal risks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts regarding the Russia-Ukraine war suggests his primary motivation is to secure a Nobel Peace Prize rather than to broker a specific geopolitical outcome. This desire requires the cooperation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, making a simple concession of Ukrainian territory to Russia unlikely, as it would not be celebrated by the Nobel committee. The article argues that historical analogies like Munich or Yalta are misplaced, as Ukraine and its European allies hold more leverage than commonly perceived against a weakened Russia. Trump's approach is characterized as being driven by personal ambition, which paradoxically may prevent a complete betrayal of Ukrainian interests.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against the operators of L.A.

The FTC details how opaque in-person and mail-in cancellation methods create significant barriers for consumers trying to end their memberships. In response, Fitness International stated the allegations are without merit and that it has taken steps to improve its processes for members.</p>

Eze, a boyhood Arsenal fan who was once in their academy, reportedly made an easy decision to join the Gunners once their interest was formalized, a move prompted by a potential injury to Arsenal's Kai Havertz. The transfer is seen as a major victory by Arsenal supporters, not only for acquiring a talented England international but also for intercepting him from their North London rivals. Eze is expected to provide a new creative dimension to Arsenal's attack.</p>

Additionally, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing at least $600 billion in the American economy, aiming to rebalance transatlantic trade. This agreement provides clarity for businesses and marks a significant step in defining the economic relationship between the two powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that homeowners can strategically use home equity loans to save money, particularly in the current high-interest-rate environment. Two primary beneficial uses are consolidating high-interest debt, such as credit cards, and financing value-adding home improvements, the interest for which may be tax-deductible. With home equity at record highs, these loans offer a lower-cost borrowing alternative to personal loans. However, experts caution against using them for luxury purchases or daily expenses and advise that they are best suited for those with stable income, good credit, and at least 20% equity remaining in their home.

While the immediate financial savings for borrowers may be modest, financial analysts view it as a symbolic turning point that could boost buyer confidence and increase competition among lenders. The drop provides welcome news for hundreds of thousands of homeowners whose fixed-rate deals are set to expire this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, who was sentenced to 31 months in prison for inciting racial hatred, has been released after serving part of her sentence. Connolly pleaded guilty after posting an inflammatory message on the social media platform X, calling for mass deportations and for supporters to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers, following a deadly stabbing attack in Southport in 2024. Her case has become a focal point in the UK's free speech debate, with critics like Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch arguing her punishment was disproportionately harsh compared to those who engaged in physical rioting after the attack.</p>

The retail giant reported a nearly 5% rise in second-quarter sales to $177.4 billion, though its earnings per share fell short of analyst expectations due to one-time expenses. Company executives noted that costs from U.S. tariffs are rising and that some of these costs have been passed on to consumers, particularly affecting lower-income households. Despite this, Walmart's focus on value continues to attract shoppers, with comparable sales in the U.S. growing by 4.6%. (not investment advice)</p>

However, experts argue that Beijing's resource constraints and historical precedent of avoiding such entanglements make its participation improbable. China is not expected to take a high-profile role in future discussions, maintaining its more cautious diplomatic stance on the conflict.</p>

          <p>The recent termination of a 24-year-old Texas law that granted in-state tuition to undocumented students is causing confusion and forcing many to alter their educational plans. The policy was ended after the state attorney general and the Trump administration argued it discriminated against out-of-state U.S. citizens. As a result, affected students now face tuition costs that are nearly three times higher, making four-year universities unaffordable for many and pushing them toward community colleges with more limited programs. Immigration advocates worry that the unclear implementation of the new rule will also harm students who are lawfully present but may be incorrectly charged higher rates.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July from the previous month, defying analyst expectations of a slight decline. The rise is attributed to a brief dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also saw a significant increase, rising 15.7% from the same time last year to its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw a minimal year-over-year increase of 0.2%, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point toward greater affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

The ACLU's filing contends that his imprisonment violates the First and Fifth Amendments, as it is based on his journalism and serves no legitimate objective.

          <p>Financial advisors suggest that age is a critical factor in determining whether an annuity is a suitable retirement investment. Generally, they are not recommended for individuals under 50 due to early withdrawal penalties and the long-term growth potential of other investments. Conversely, for those over 80, the high fees and surrender charges may outweigh the benefits, as there is less time for the guaranteed income to offset the costs. Annuities are most beneficial for those seeking to cover essential living expenses not met by other sources, but may be a poor choice for individuals with major health issues or those who need to maintain liquidity.

The review praises the performances of Qualley, Aubrey Plaza, and Chris Evans, as well as some witty dialogue, but criticizes the shaggy and unfocused plot. Ultimately, the film is described as an affectionate in-joke for its creators, a deliberately messy and sleazy noir that offers style and some laughs but lacks a compelling narrative rhythm.</p>

The move is a direct response to Texas Republicans passing new maps at President Trump's request, which could secure five additional GOP seats.

Experts note that job growth has been significantly weaker in industries that heavily rely on immigrant labor, such as construction and hospitality. A sustained decline in the labor pool could slow economic growth, exacerbate labor shortages, and put upward pressure on wages and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
