          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born before the Civil War, will finally receive a headstone 101 years after his death. Despite his international renown and founding several newspapers, he was buried in an unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York, in 1924. A new black granite headstone, funded by private and public efforts, will soon be installed to honor his significant contributions to preserving Black history and culture. Organizers noted that his fame did not translate to wealth, and plans for a monument likely fell through due to historical circumstances like the Great Depression.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under a sweeping Trump administration asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to those crossing the border illegally, a measure credited with a significant drop in migrant apprehensions. The court ruled that while the government can pause asylum access, it cannot ignore other laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face persecution or torture. This directive reopens humanitarian protection pathways, though migrants will likely remain detained while their claims are processed.</p>

          <p>A Michigan man, Joshua Taylor, is leading an effort to make adult changing tables more common in public spaces to serve teenagers and adults with disabilities. Taylor, who experiences incontinence due to a genetic condition, highlights the indignity and difficulty caregivers and individuals face, often resorting to changing on dirty bathroom floors or in cars. He argues that the lack of accessible facilities forces many people with disabilities to stay home, limiting their participation in community life. Working with the national organization Changing Spaces USA, he is successfully advocating for installations across Michigan to address this essential need.</p>

Anderson was convicted of intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse, and arson after Robinson's dismembered remains were found in multiple locations, including a beach in Waukegan, Illinois. During the emotional sentencing, Robinson's family delivered powerful impact statements detailing their profound loss and trauma. Despite Anderson maintaining his innocence, the judge cited his lack of remorse before imposing the life sentence, ensuring he will never be released.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that the stock market's recent recovery is primarily driven by the strong earnings reports from major technology companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Despite a weak labor report and concerns over new tariffs that initially caused a downturn, the market rebounded sharply, with the Nasdaq surging nearly 2%. Cramer highlighted impressive growth in cloud services for Microsoft and user engagement for Meta as key factors. He suggested that the financial strength, diverse revenue streams, and controlled expenses of these tech giants make them resilient forces in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

The new rules, which apply from August 5, require two character references for shotgun certificate applications instead of one and mandate police to consult with applicants' partners to check for signs of domestic abuse. The changes were also influenced by other fatal shootings, including the 2021 Plymouth incident. Ambler expressed emotional relief and hope, stating the changes signify that victims' voices have been heard and could prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Dr. Lisa Carchedi, a psychiatrist in Maryland, gave her older sister, Gina Warsaw, the gift of life by donating a kidney. The transplant took place on April 1, the anniversary of their father's death, who had always emphasized the importance of family. Warsaw had been suffering from kidney failure and undergoing dialysis before her sister was found to be a match. The kidney was removed using a minimally invasive, single-port robotic surgery, a technique that reduces scarring and recovery time. Both sisters are recovering well, celebrating their strengthened bond on National Sisters Day.</p>

          <p>As Texas Democrats remain out of state to block a Republican-led redistricting vote, legal and political experts are scrutinizing Governor Greg Abbott's threats to remove them from office. While the Texas House Speaker has signed civil arrest warrants, these are not enforceable outside of Texas. Abbott has cited a nonbinding 2021 attorney general opinion suggesting lawmakers could be removed for abandonment of office, but experts note the only established methods are expulsion by a two-thirds vote or at the ballot box. The standoff continues as Democrats deny Republicans the necessary quorum, halting legislative proceedings on the controversial maps.</p>

          <p>In an interview following the sentencing of Bryan Kohberger, Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson discussed the immense pressure of the high-profile case. He defended the decision to accept a plea deal that spared Kohberger the death penalty but did not require a full confession, calling it a "judgment call." Thompson explained the legal team concluded that securing guilty pleas and a waiver of appeal provided the best path to finality for the victims' families, expressing doubt that Kohberger would ever provide a truthful account. He described the crimes as brutal and stated that seeing the crime scene is something he will never erase from his memory.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. employment report has raised concerns about the health of the economy, showing weaker-than-expected hiring in July and sharp downward revisions for the previous two months. Experts suggest the labor market is wobbling under the pressure of tariff uncertainty and other economic shifts, leading many businesses to delay hiring. While not seeing mass layoffs, the stagnant growth makes it harder for the unemployed to find work. The report revealed job losses in manufacturing and minimal gains in key sectors like hospitality, indicating a slowdown that contrasts with the administration's more optimistic portrayal of the economy.

          <p>In a surprising development, a former girlfriend of Sean "Diddy" Combs, who was slated to testify against him as "Victim-3," has written a letter to the judge advocating for his release on bail. Virginia "Gina" Huynh, who had dropped out of the case before trial, stated in her letter that she does not view Combs as a danger and believes he has not been violent in years. The letter was included in the defense's latest, unsuccessful attempt to secure Combs' release ahead of his October sentencing for prostitution-related convictions. This contrasts with other witnesses who pleaded for him to remain incarcerated, fearing for their safety.</p>

          <p>The Hollywood Bowl's recent production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" was highlighted by a divine performance from Cynthia Erivo in the title role. Her portrayal of Jesus as a queer Black woman was described as magnetic and heaven-sent, anchoring a show that leaned into its rock-opera concert roots. The production, directed by Sergio Trujillo, also featured strong performances from Adam Lambert as Judas and Phillipa Soo as Mary Magdalene. Erivo's powerful vocals, particularly in "Gethsemane," and her generous stage presence created a performance that was hailed as both modern and timeless, earning widespread worship from the audience.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated that Democrats will move forward with a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, but only as a direct response to a similar effort by Texas Republicans. The plan involves a "trigger" mechanism: if Texas proceeds with its gerrymandering to add five GOP seats, a measure will go before California voters in November to temporarily allow the legislature to draw new maps for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections. The high-stakes political maneuvering could determine control of the U.S. House, as California Democrats aim to counter the potential gains for Republicans in Texas.</p>

The order was issued by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the trial against Bolsonaro for allegedly leading a coup attempt after his 2022 election loss. The justice stated that Bolsonaro violated previous court-imposed measures, including a ban on using social media, after his allies broadcast a live call with him at a rally. The new order also bans him from receiving most visitors and comes as his supporters have been protesting, calling for his amnesty.</p>

While Western nations are making diplomatic efforts to diversify their sources, they lack the investment and technical expertise to quickly shift away from Chinese dependency.

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a process to reverse a Biden-era policy that allows the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the veteran's health. In a federal filing, the administration called the current policy "legally questionable" and aims to block VA hospitals from offering or counseling on the procedure, even in states where it is otherwise banned. While care for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies would continue, critics argue the move robs veterans of essential healthcare and bodily autonomy, forcing them to navigate restrictive state laws for life-threatening conditions.</p>
