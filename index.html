          <p>President Trump has barred most international students from studying at Harvard University, escalating a feud with the Ivy League school. The proclamation suspends entry of foreign students unless deemed in the national interest and directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking existing visas. The administration accuses Harvard of failing to report disciplinary records and having ties to researchers in China. This action follows previous attempts to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students and cut off federal funding, which Harvard argues is retaliation for First Amendment-protected speech.

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen to sign key presidential documents, alleging a conspiracy to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. The memo cites executive actions by Biden and questions the decision-making process and Biden's awareness of these actions.

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation barring travel and immigration from twelve countries and restricting entry from seven others, citing national security concerns.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which enabled early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The research team conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study emphasizes that an essential feature of bird evolution was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift.

          <h2>Pregnant Women Warned Against Using Weight-Loss Jabs</h2>

          <p>Pregnant women are being advised to stop using weight-loss jabs if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Drug safety experts in the UK say it's not known whether taking medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro could harm an unborn baby. The advice already appears in patient information leaflets, but there are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely. The UK drugs regulator advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant. The optimism score is self-contained.</p>
