          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has stated that the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is not cooperating with authorities. The 22-year-old alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, remains in custody with formal charges expected soon. Cox also confirmed reports that the suspect had communicated on Discord after the shooting and that his roommate is cooperating with the investigation. Officials have not yet identified a motive, though they are exploring the suspect's reported indoctrination with leftist ideology as a potential factor in the politically charged killing.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is visiting Israel to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza as Israeli forces continue to destroy residential buildings in Gaza City. The visit follows an Israeli strike in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders, an action which President Trump was reportedly unhappy about. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted that U.S.-Israeli relations have "never been stronger," while Qatar, a key U.S. ally, condemned the attack and urged the international community to punish Israel. The situation remains tense as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are believed to remain in Gaza City despite evacuation orders.</p>

          <p>In a joint television appearance, Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and James Lankford (R-OK) addressed the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the broader issue of escalating political violence in the United States. Both senators condemned the killing and pointed to the internet and social media algorithms as major accelerants of extremism and division. They discussed the increasing security threats faced by public figures and their families, which they believe weakens robust national debate. The senators expressed hope that Congress would approve additional funding for security and pass bipartisan legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act to mitigate online harms.</p>

          <p>NASCAR driver Austin Dillon explained his team's decision to feature a decal honoring the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk on their vehicles. Dillon expressed that the tribute was motivated by his admiration for Kirk's heroism in standing for his religious beliefs and his ability to engage in debate without personal attacks. He described Kirk's assassination as a tragic event that motivates him to deepen his own study of the Bible and spread his faith. This tribute is one of several from the sports world, including a moment of silence at an NFL game and a dedication from another race winner.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham describes the current state of American democracy as being in a "dangerous place" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Meacham argues that political violence historically erupts in the U.S. when there is a fundamental, existential debate over who qualifies as an American and who is included in "We the people." He contends that the nation is currently in such an era, debating not just political methods but the very purpose of its politics. Meacham urges leaders to reaffirm the American covenant of peaceful debate and dissent to avoid breaking faith with the nation's founding principles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this commentary, veteran journalist James Fallows reflects on the recent wave of political violence in America, including the killing of Charlie Kirk, drawing parallels to the turbulent 1960s. He warns that cycles of political violence are deeply damaging and self-reinforcing, cautioning against loose talk of "civil war." Fallows offers two lessons from history: first, leaders and citizens must actively remind themselves of their real-world connections to counteract online polarization. Second, he urges a wary approach to immediate reactions, advocating for generosity and quoting Robert F. Kennedy's impromptu speech on the night of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination as a model for navigating such crises.</p>

Starmer emphasized that while peaceful protest is a core value, assaults on police and intimidation will not be tolerated.

          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago is offering a fresh perspective on the work of Gustave Caillebotte, often considered one of the lesser-known French Impressionist painters. While the museum has long housed his most famous piece, "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the show explores his broader portfolio, which notably focused on male subjects in a way that was unusual for his time. Some of his works, like "The Floor Scrapers" and a painting of a nude man bathing, were considered scandalous by the 19th-century art establishment. The exhibition aims to reintegrate Caillebotte into the Impressionist narrative and allow for modern interpretations of his unique artistry.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the new U.S. law making tips tax-free, while seemingly beneficial for some workers, ultimately enables a flawed tipping culture and absolves employers of the responsibility to pay a living wage. The author contends the tax benefits are temporary, expiring in 2028, and exclude many deserving workers like postal carriers and teachers while including questionable categories like "digital content creators." The article suggests that instead of incentivizing tips, the U.S. should follow the example of other countries by banning the practice altogether.

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are experiencing heightened fear following a Supreme Court ruling that allows federal agents to conduct warrantless raids and profile individuals. The ruling overturned a temporary restraining order that had slowed such operations in Southern California. Now, with the Department of Homeland Security vowing to "flood the zone," many undocumented residents face a difficult choice between risking deportation by going to work or staying home and facing eviction. Community organizers and volunteer groups are increasing their efforts to monitor for raids, inform residents of their rights, and provide support to a community on edge.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Child Health Report Criticized for Omitting Nicotine and Smoking</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's "Make Our Children Healthy Again" report is facing criticism from health advocates and parents for its notable omission of the words "smoking" and "nicotine." While the 20-page strategy aims to combat childhood chronic disease, it only mentions tobacco once in passing and focuses its substance use recommendations on campaigns against alcohol, controlled substances, and vaping. Critics, including a former FDA tobacco chief, argue that ignoring tobacco control, the leading cause of preventable death, undermines the entire effort. This approach also contrasts with President Trump's previous focus on youth vaping prevention during his first term in office.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived in Israel for diplomatic talks as tensions rise over a recent Israeli airstrike in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders. The visit aims to balance U.S. criticism of the strike on its ally Qatar with overall support for Israel, especially as several other Western nations are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The Netanyahu government has downplayed any rift with Washington, defending the strike as necessary to eliminate terrorist leaders. Meanwhile, Israel is intensifying its military campaign in Gaza City, defying mounting international condemnation and calls for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has revealed that Europe's Ryder Cup team is using a novel training method to prepare for the hostile crowd expected at Bethpage in New York. Captain Luke Donald has provided players with virtual reality headsets that simulate the sights, sounds, and abusive comments they might face from American fans. McIlroy stated he encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want" to desensitize the team as much as possible before the event. This unusual preparation tactic underscores the team's detailed approach as they aim to secure their first Ryder Cup victory on American soil since 2012.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) campaign, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is creating additional stress and labor for parents trying to feed their children, this article argues. The movement condemns a wide range of foods, including seed oils and ultra-processed items, pushing parents into a time-consuming and expensive search for approved products. Critics point out that while the campaign aims to improve children's health, its policy proposals offer little systemic support for families, especially those with low incomes. This leaves mothers, in particular, to bear the psychological and financial burden of navigating the complex and often scientifically unsupported dietary guidelines.</p>

Other top contenders include the Las Vegas Aces, who ended the regular season on a 16-game winning streak, and the defending champion New York Liberty, who have battled injuries.

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually abused her. In a television interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that every person, regardless of royal status, must be held accountable under the law and that the Prince has not faced sufficient consequences. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, alleged that Epstein introduced her to Prince Andrew, who she said abused her three times. The Prince has denied all claims and reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022 without any admission of liability.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in the U.S. media landscape indicate a growing influence of right-wing and pro-Trump figures on major news organizations, raising concerns about press freedom. CBS News recently installed a Trump ally as its ombudsman shortly after control of its parent company, Paramount, was secured by the Trump-friendly Ellison family. Paramount is now reportedly pursuing a purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN, potentially bringing another major network under its influence. These moves, along with a settlement solidifying the Murdoch family's conservative direction for Fox News, suggest a broader trend of capitulation to right-wing pressure.</p>

          <p>The recent fatal shooting of activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has brought renewed attention to a state law that permits individuals with concealed-carry permits to have firearms on college campuses. Passed in August, the bill added to Utah's already permissive gun legislation, which includes permitless carry. While it is unclear if the suspected shooter legally possessed the rifle used, the timing of the event has pushed the campus carry law into the national spotlight. Gun rights advocates in Utah argue such laws deter crime, but critics contend they are inadequate against politically motivated violence and create complex security challenges for universities.</p>
