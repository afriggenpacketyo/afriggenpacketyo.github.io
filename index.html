        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Comcast has announced that Versant will be the name of its spun-off NBCUniversal cable network portfolio. CEO Mark Lazarus stated the name was chosen to highlight the company's versatility and broad subject knowledge, and that Versant will include networks such as USA, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel, as well as digital assets like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. Versant is expected to spin out from Comcast before the end of 2025, with assets generating around $7 billion in revenue last year. The corporate strategy will focus on individual brand interaction with users rather than the holding company itself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its ban on transgender military service members, lifting a lower court injunction. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, while the court did not provide detailed reasoning for its decision. The Trump administration argued for broad deference in military matters, citing concerns about unit cohesion and lethality due to gender dysphoria. Advocacy groups have called the ruling a devastating blow, arguing that the ban is discriminatory and unrelated to military readiness. The ruling means the military can begin discharging transgender service members and cease enlisting transgender people.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Diamondback Energy, Travis Stice, warns that U.S. onshore oil production has likely peaked and will decline due to plunging crude prices. Stice noted that current oil prices, adjusted for inflation, are near historic lows, excluding the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. He believes this price environment will jeopardize the nation's position as the world's largest fossil fuel producer and threaten energy security.

The Houthis began targeting shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, prompting retaliatory strikes from the U.S. The US military says it has struck 1,000 targets in Yemen since March.

          <p>U.S. stocks traded lower Tuesday afternoon as investors eyed rising volatility and digested fresh trade data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 300 points, and the S&P 500 also slid. The U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in March, rising to $140.5 billion. Ford and Mattel were the latest companies to pull forecasts, attributing the move to deepening uncertainty over tariffs and global regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>If a debt collector rejects a settlement offer, it doesn't necessarily mean you're out of options. The rejection could be due to the offer being too low, the debt being too fresh, or the collector believing you can pay more. Strategies to improve the chances of settling include doing your homework, offering proof of hardship, working with a debt relief expert, and being patient but persistent. Debt collectors aren't legally required to settle accounts for less than what's owed, so it's important to have a plan.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares dropped about 14% Tuesday despite the data analytics and artificial intelligence software company showing ongoing revenue growth acceleration. CEO Alex Karp defended the company, saying Palantir is "pretty happy." Many Wall Street analysts attributed the post-earnings move to a decline in international revenue and a failure to reach a high bar on growth. Despite the drop, Palantir topped revenue expectations and lifted its revenue guidance for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The vote stunned environmentalists, who are concerned about the impact on the country's transition to cleaner vehicles. The California ban, adopted by 11 other states, was expected to help shift the country toward cleaner electric vehicles.</p>

Trump's administration’s budget and personnel cuts have also signaled a retreat from diplomacy.
