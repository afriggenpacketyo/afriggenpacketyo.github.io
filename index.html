          <p>The summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without any concrete agreements or a ceasefire for the war in Ukraine. The meeting drew mixed reactions globally, with sharp criticism from Democrats like Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who accused Trump of being played by Putin. Conversely, some Republicans, such as Senator Lisa Murkowski, expressed cautious optimism about potential future talks, while Ukrainian officials voiced frustration over the lack of immediate de-escalation. The outcome leaves the diplomatic situation largely unchanged, with future steps, including a potential trilateral meeting, remaining uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a phone call with President Trump after the Alaska summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he will travel to Washington D.C. for a meeting on Monday. The announcement comes as Trump, in a Fox News interview, offered few details about his talks with Vladimir Putin but urged Zelenskyy to “make the deal” to end the war. Trump suggested that while progress was made, significant items remain unresolved, placing the onus for final negotiations on Ukraine and European allies. This development shifts the focus of peace efforts to the upcoming discussions in Washington.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all of its operations, grounding approximately 500 flights per day and disrupting travel for an estimated 130,000 daily passengers as cabin crew begin a 72-hour strike. The union, representing over 10,000 flight attendants, is demanding higher salaries and compensation for ground time, rejecting the airline's latest offer as insufficient. The industrial action follows a near-unanimous strike vote and a breakdown in negotiations, with both sides publicly blaming each other for the failure to reach an agreement. The Canadian government had urged a return to the bargaining table to avert the disruption.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors have significantly reshaped Athens' real estate market by becoming the predominant participants in Greece's 'golden visa' program, which offers residency for investment. According to Greek government data from June 2025, Chinese citizens account for nearly half of all first-time permit holders and over 60% of those who have renewed their visas. This influx of investment has led to the purchase of thousands of apartments across the Greek capital. The trend highlights a key avenue through which Chinese capital is influencing European urban centers.</p>

Despite a warm reception and carefully choreographed pageantry, the leaders emerged after less than three hours with no tangible breakthrough announced. Putin maintained his position that the “root causes” of the conflict must be addressed, indicating no change in Russia's demands. Trump acknowledged that while progress was made, they “didn’t get there” on the most significant sticking points, deferring next steps to talks with Ukrainian and European leaders.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China are publicly voicing concerns over the sustainability of the U.S. national debt, recommending that Beijing gradually reduce its holdings of American government bonds. This call for diversification comes as China has already trimmed its U.S. Treasury holdings for three consecutive months, reaching its lowest level since 2009. The article suggests a strategic shift towards increasing national reserves of gold and other key resources to mitigate financial risks associated with U.S. dollar assets. The researchers' warning highlights growing apprehension about the stability of formerly rock-solid investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis piece posits that Vladimir Putin was the unequivocal winner of the Alaska summit, gaining international legitimacy and a propaganda victory without offering any concessions on Ukraine. The article argues that Donald Trump, by contrast, appeared to be a clear loser, having failed to secure a ceasefire despite the high-profile meeting. For Ukraine, the summit is framed as a significant disappointment, as the lack of a deal means the conflict and suffering will persist. The author suggests the event was an elaborate ruse for Trump to avoid imposing tougher sanctions on Russia.</p>

This new-generation superheavy launcher is central to China's ambitions of landing astronauts on the moon by the year 2030. The test verified that the 21 YF-100K engines, which will power the rocket's first stage and two boosters, can operate in unison. The Long March-10 is designed to deliver a 27-tonne payload to a trans-lunar orbit, enabling separate launches of the crewed spacecraft and lunar lander.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government is proposing stricter residency regulations for mainland Chinese spouses, citing national security concerns amid escalating threats from Beijing. The proposed amendment would require applicants to provide notarized proof that they have renounced their household registration and passport in mainland China. This policy, championed by President Lai, aims to eliminate dual-status ambiguities that the administration believes could be exploited for infiltration. The move marks a significant shift in cross-strait policy and has been criticized as an "attack" on families with ties to both sides.</p>
