          <p>President Trump has barred most international students from studying at Harvard University, escalating the administration's conflict with the Ivy League school. The proclamation suspends entry for foreign students or exchange visitors planning to attend Harvard unless deemed in the "national interest." The order accuses Harvard of failing to report student disciplinary records and criticizes its ties to researchers based in China. This action follows previous attempts by the Trump administration to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students, impacting a significant portion of the student body. The Department of Homeland Security previously tried to revoke Harvard's certification in the student visa database, but a judge halted the policy. The optimism score reflects the potential disruption and uncertainty this policy creates for international students and the university. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation barring travel and immigration from a dozen countries and restricting entry from seven more, citing national security concerns. The ban fully restricts entry from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and several other nations, impacting both legal immigrants and temporary visa holders. Partial restrictions apply to Burundi, Cuba, Laos, and other countries, primarily affecting prospective immigrants. Trump justified the restrictions due to terrorism concerns, inadequate vetting, and lack of cooperation on deportations, while critics are likely to challenge the ban as discriminatory, similar to previous travel bans. This action follows an attack in Boulder, Colorado, by an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa, prompting Trump to emphasize the dangers posed by improperly vetted foreign nationals. The optimism score is low given the sweeping nature of the ban and its potential to disrupt lives and international relations.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber sheds light on the evolution of flight feathers, which enabled birds to surpass dinosaurs in conquering the skies. The study examined 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, providing insights into feather development during this era. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlighted the importance of feathers in generating thrust and lift for birds. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly, though some could glide or achieve powered flight.

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents, including pardons. Trump claims this was a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and abuse presidential signature power. The investigation will examine whether Biden's aides conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise presidential authorities. Presidents have used autopens for decades, but Trump suggests Biden's alleged use could be illegitimate, potentially invalidating numerous executive actions. The optimism score is low due to the politically charged nature of the investigation and its potential to further divide the country.</p>

Bifidobacterium longum, in particular, appeared to have a protective effect, with babies carrying this species being less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections.

          <p>Health experts are advising women using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or breastfeeding. There are concerns about the potential harm these medicines could cause to an unborn baby.

This caution comes amid the growing popularity of these drugs, with concerns that many women are not using them safely or receiving adequate medical advice.
