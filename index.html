        <p>President Duda of Poland renewed his 2022 request for the US to deploy nuclear weapons in Poland as a deterrent against Russia.  His advisor, Wojciech Kolarski, supported this, emphasizing improved security for Poland.

        <p>Amidst claims of Russian troop gains in the Kursk region, President Trump's envoy arrived in Moscow to discuss a proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine.  President Putin's visit to Kursk commanders and his statement regarding the region's full recapture suggest a lack of immediate willingness to cease hostilities.  The situation is further complicated by recent progress between US and Ukrainian officials on ending the conflict, and the Kremlin's opposition to Western forces deploying in Ukraine.</p>
