          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer challenges the view that upcoming tariffs will harm the stock market, particularly high-value tech stocks. He presents ten reasons for optimism, including strong corporate earnings, the economic stimulus from proposed tax cuts, and massive private spending on data centers and the electrical grid. Cramer argues these domestic economic drivers will outweigh the impact of trade disputes, potentially leading to a continued market boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to address a significant retirement savings gap, warning that people retiring in 2050 may be worse off than today's pensioners. New analysis from the Department for Work and Pensions reveals that nearly half of working-age adults, especially low earners, the self-employed, women, and certain ethnic groups, are not saving enough. The commission will seek a national consensus on strategies to encourage greater private pension contributions and tackle these systemic shortfalls.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has declined, with a majority now believing it targets more than just dangerous criminals. The survey also reveals widespread desire for the administration to focus more on lowering prices, as most Americans feel the recently passed 'One Big Beautiful Bill' will primarily benefit the wealthy. Overall approval for the president has slipped, driven by growing disapproval outside of his core political base on issues of immigration and the economy.</p>

The analysis concludes that building major infrastructure on a 'small, highly populated, property-owning, democratic island' presented unique challenges that were not adequately addressed, leading to massive budget and schedule overruns.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is set to shutter its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific arm that provides expertise for environmental regulations. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader plan to downsize the federal government and reduce the EPA's staff by 23%. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, arguing it will cripple the agency's ability to use science to protect public health and the environment.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child for a successful life is 'self-connection.' This refers to the ability to tune into one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article provides several practical strategies for parents to foster this skill, such as validating feelings and allowing for age-appropriate autonomy, to support their child's long-term mental health.</p>
