          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations due to an air traffic controller shortage and recent equipment failures. The union representing air traffic controllers reports that several members are on trauma leave after an equipment malfunction caused a temporary loss of communication with pilots. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to announce an overhaul of the nation's aging air traffic control system, but staffing and equipment issues are expected to persist for several days. United Airlines is offering free ticket changes for affected passengers as officials work to address the underlying problems in the system.</p>

          <p>US and Chinese officials are scheduled to meet in Switzerland to discuss de-escalating the ongoing trade war between the two countries. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly conducting raids targeting businesses and restaurants in Washington, D.C., prompting concern from Mayor Muriel Bowser. Activist groups had warned of the planned enforcement, stating that ICE would be using President Trump's executive order aimed at the "beautification" of the U.S. capital as justification. The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington expressed deep concern about the raids, highlighting the significant role of immigrants in the restaurant workforce and the potential economic impact of disrupting restaurant staffing.

          <p>A new bill is being introduced to Parliament in England and Wales that would allow judges to impose an additional two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. The bill aims to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions and provides a moment of recognition and reparation for victims' families. The families of Sabina Nessa, Zara Aleena, and Jan Mustafa, whose killers did not attend sentencing, have campaigned for the change in the law. Justice Minister Alex Davies-Jones thanked the families for their tireless efforts to ensure criminals face their victims.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 5-4 extra-innings loss to the Miami Marlins, highlighting the strain on their overworked bullpen. Despite a solid start from Tony Gonsolin and strong offensive contributions from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' bullpen fatigue became a costly problem. Manager Dave Roberts was forced to use lower-leverage relievers due to workload concerns, ultimately leading to a walk-off single by JesÃºs Sanchez in the 10th inning. The loss underscores the need for the Dodgers to manage their bullpen effectively throughout the season.</p>
