          <h2>Ketamine Smuggling Exploits European Legal Loopholes</h2>

          <p>Criminal organizations are exploiting loopholes in European regulations to smuggle ketamine, a drug with legitimate medical uses, into the black market. The BBC reports that the inconsistency in classification across countries—where some regulate it as a medicine and others as a narcotic—allows smugglers to transport it across multiple borders, making detection difficult. In one instance, a consignment of ketamine was swapped for salt between Amsterdam and Brussels, highlighting the elaborate methods used. The UK has seen an 85% increase in ketamine consumption between 2023 and 2024, with a rise in related deaths and health issues, prompting European police forces to collaborate with Indian authorities to address the problem.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to combat soaring prices, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. This move aims to alleviate shortages and lower costs for consumers, with the released rice consisting of harvests from 2020 and 2021. The government hopes to make the rice available in stores at a reduced price of 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms, targeting smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops. This action follows previous releases and direct contracts with retailers, marking a rare step to address distribution shortages and public frustration over doubled rice prices, with suspicions of hoarding among wholesalers and farmers.</p>

          <p>Israeli authorities are deporting a group of activists, including Greta Thunberg, who were detained on a Gaza-bound aid boat. The yacht, carrying 12 people and humanitarian aid, was intercepted by Israeli forces and towed to Ashdod. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition stated the activists were being processed for deportation, aiming to raise awareness of starvation conditions in Gaza and deliver aid despite the Israeli naval blockade. Israel maintains the blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas fighters, while the FFC argues it is illegal. This incident follows a history of confrontations, including a 2010 incident where Israeli commandos killed 10 Turkish activists on a similar aid flotilla.</p>

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an 'unprecedented decline' in world fertility rates, indicating that many people are unable to have their desired number of children due to financial constraints and lack of suitable partners. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people in 14 countries, finding that one in five have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents as a barrier to parenthood, with the highest response in Korea (58%).

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk for those aged 20 to 29. Data from the CDC shows a drop from over 31,000 deaths in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this trend to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens. While the improvement is dramatic, challenges remain for those with severe addiction, and potential cuts to addiction services by the Trump administration pose a risk to sustaining this progress.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's order to send National Guard troops to Los Angeles. The lawsuit argues that local law enforcement was capable of handling the situation and could have requested support from state partners if necessary. This legal challenge underscores the ongoing conflict between the state and federal government over immigration enforcement and the use of military forces in civilian affairs. The suit claims that Trump's actions violate the US Constitution, reflecting broader tensions over states' rights and federal overreach.</p>
