          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk, formerly close allies, have engaged in a public feud stemming from Musk's criticism of Trump's proposed tax bill. Trump responded by questioning Musk's sanity and threatening to terminate government contracts with his companies. Musk, in turn, accused Trump of ingratitude and linked him to Jeffrey Epstein. The dispute led to significant market volatility for Tesla stock, highlighting the intertwined nature of politics and business in the current environment.
