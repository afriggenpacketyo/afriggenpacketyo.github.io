The article highlights his interactions with cast members like Sarah Sherman, who often uses her appearances to mock and challenge Jost's perceived outdated views. By willingly serving as a target for jokes, Jost has become a pressure-release valve for cultural anxieties and a more sympathetic figure on the show.</p>
