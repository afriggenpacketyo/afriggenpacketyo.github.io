          <p>A severe geomagnetic storm may cause the Northern Lights to be visible as far south as Alabama on Sunday night into Monday morning. This rare event offers a chance for many across a large portion of the country to witness the colorful streaks of light typically seen only in more northern regions. The intensity of the storm is expected to increase the visibility range, making it an exceptional opportunity for skywatchers in areas where the aurora borealis is not commonly observed. This celestial event is a reminder of the dynamic interactions between the Earth and the sun.</p>

          <p>David Challen successfully campaigned to free his mother, Sally Challen, who killed his father after enduring decades of coercive control. A law passed in 2015, recognizing psychological manipulation as domestic abuse, aided in her release after she was initially jailed for murder in 2011. David has written a book, "The Unthinkable," about their family's experiences and advocates for greater protection for victims of domestic abuse. He emphasizes the importance of having language to describe non-physical violence, which had previously robbed them of the ability to protect themselves. He hopes his story will prevent similar events from happening to others.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the U.S.-China trade dispute will be resolved following a conversation between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This comes after Trump accused China of violating their trade agreement. Bessent acknowledged that China is withholding critical minerals, essential for high-tech products, which may be intentional or a glitch in the Chinese system. He emphasized the U.S. is trying to de-risk rather than decouple from China, but noted China's actions are affecting industrial supply chains in other countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in Gaza resulted in the deaths of more than 30 people and numerous injuries, according to Gaza health officials, while the Israeli military denied involvement. Witnesses reported being fired upon from multiple directions as they approached the aid site. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) reported delivering aid "without incident," dismissing reports of casualties. The incident occurred amid stalled ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, with each side blaming the other for the impasse.</p>
