          <p>Researchers in China have created a bionic underwater drone that mimics the appearance and movement of a jellyfish. The "underwater phantom" is designed for covert surveillance, ecosystem monitoring, and inspecting underwater structures due to its silent operation and low power consumption. Made from a transparent hydrogel, the compact device is nearly invisible in water, representing a significant advancement in stealth reconnaissance technology for military and scientific applications.</p>

          <p>As a U.S. government shutdown continues, an air traffic controller named Jack Criss has taken a second job as a DoorDash driver to cover his daughter's tuition. With federal employees expected to miss their first full paychecks, many are facing severe financial strain in high-pressure, safety-sensitive jobs. Criss highlighted the immense stress of the situation, noting that even with the extra work and a short-term loan, he is struggling to make ends meet.</p>

The gap is partly attributed to the decision to sell a significant portion of its stake in Apple, which has since surged to record highs. This move has resulted in Berkshire leaving an estimated $50 billion in potential profits on the table, a decision Buffett has previously linked to expectations of future capital gains tax hikes.

Despite headlines of luxury sales, the median price per square foot for condos has remained largely flat over the past decade, a stark contrast to real estate trends in the rest of the country. While the high-end market of properties over $10 million has seen profits, the broader market's stagnation is attributed to factors like tax law changes and pandemic-related migration.

          <p>Voters in Ivory Coast are heading to the polls for a presidential election in which 83-year-old incumbent Alassane Ouattara is seeking a controversial fourth term. The election has been marked by tension and protests after two of his main political rivals, Tidjane Thiam and former president Laurent Gbagbo, were barred from running. Ouattara is campaigning on a record of economic growth and stability, but concerns remain about the fairness of the election and the potential for unrest.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) claims that far-left terrorist plots outnumbered those from the far right in the first half of 2025. However, the study has ignited a debate among extremism researchers, who criticize its small sample size and subjective methodology for categorizing incidents. The controversy highlights the broader challenges and complexities involved in collecting and analyzing data on domestic political violence in the United States.</p>

          <p>China's near-total control over the mining and processing of rare earth elements is a growing concern for Western nations, especially as Beijing tightens export controls. These materials are critical for high-tech industries, including defense, renewable energy, and consumer electronics. The U.S. and EU are actively seeking to diversify their supply chains, but face significant environmental, technical, and economic challenges in developing new mining and refining capacities to reduce their strategic vulnerability.</p>

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey indicates that 45% of investors are interested in owning alternative assets such as private equity, real estate, and commodities. As consumer interest grows, financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can provide a practical and liquid way to gain exposure to these typically complex and illiquid markets. This trend intersects with a record-setting year for ETF inflows, as investors seek to supplement traditional stock and bond portfolios with different types of holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime suggests that Russian mercenaries in Mali, formerly of the Wagner Group, have been systematically using military equipment intended for the Malian armed forces. This includes armored vehicles, heavy machine guns, and drones sourced from countries like China and Turkey. Such a diversion of military hardware could constitute a violation of the international Arms Trade Treaty, which governs the transfer of conventional weapons.</p>

          <p>Residents in the rural South, particularly in states like Louisiana that expanded Medicaid, are expressing deep concern over impending federal cuts and new work requirements for the program. A new law is projected to cause millions nationwide to lose their health coverage, with disproportionate effects expected in impoverished regions like the Mississippi Delta. Local healthcare providers and residents fear that the changes will reverse recent gains in insurance coverage and further strain already struggling communities.</p>
