          <p>Brooklyn Peltz Beckham and his wife Nicola recently renewed their wedding vows in a ceremony that highlighted Nicola's family but was notably missing Brooklyn's parents, David and Victoria Beckham. The absence has intensified ongoing rumors of a rift between the Peltz Beckhams and the famous couple, who were reportedly vacationing in France at the time. Nicola wore a repurposed version of her mother's wedding dress for the intimate event, while Brooklyn expressed his deep affection, stating he could renew his vows with her daily. This development follows previous speculation about family tensions, including Nicola's choice not to wear a Victoria Beckham design for her original wedding.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has officially acknowledged that France employed repressive and violent measures in Cameroon during the nation's fight for independence in the 1950s and beyond. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for actions that cost tens of thousands of lives, including the killing of independence leaders. This admission follows a 2022 historical report commissioned by France, which detailed the use of forced displacement and support for brutal militias by colonial troops. The acknowledgment is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial legacy in Africa, though some critics argue these gestures do not go far enough.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that any negotiations about Ukraine's future conducted without its participation are unacceptable. His comments come ahead of a scheduled summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. While acknowledging a recent signal from Russia suggesting a potential willingness to end the war, Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine will not be pressured into withdrawing its forces from the occupied Donbas region. He argued that such a retreat would only serve as a Russian springboard for future aggression, making it clear that a sustainable peace cannot be achieved without Ukraine's direct involvement.</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave with temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F) is fueling dozens of wildfires across southern Europe, resulting in at least three deaths and forcing thousands to evacuate. Countries including Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, and Greece are battling extensive blazes exacerbated by strong winds. In Spain, an equestrian worker died from severe burns near Madrid, while thousands have been evacuated from homes and tourist areas. Greece is contending with over 150 wildfires, with mass evacuations on the island of Zakynthos as authorities warn that conditions may worsen in the coming days, stretching emergency services to their limits.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the European Union have publicly appealed to President Trump to defend Europe's security interests during his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They expressed concerns that a peace deal for Ukraine could be outlined without their input, potentially compromising regional stability. In a joint statement, the leaders emphasized that a just and lasting peace must respect international law and Ukraine's sovereignty, stating that the path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement. This plea reflects widespread European anxiety that concessions to Putin could embolden further Russian aggression, threatening the continent's security architecture.</p>

          <p>Health experts are warning of an increased risk of infections from Vibrio vulnificus, a so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria, as rising ocean temperatures create more favorable conditions for its growth. The bacteria, which thrives in warm coastal waters, can enter the body through open wounds and cause severe, rapidly spreading infections that are fatal in one in five cases. While historically concentrated in areas like the Gulf Coast, cases are now being reported further north in the Carolinas, Connecticut, and New York. Microbiologists state that climate change and more frequent severe storms are expanding the bacteria's habitat, heightening the public health threat during hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Shares of Spirit Airlines' parent company fell dramatically after the budget carrier issued a warning about its ability to continue operations over the next year. In a regulatory filing, Spirit cited "substantial doubt" due to adverse market conditions, including weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which have persisted despite its recent emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The airline has struggled with profitability since the pandemic, facing rising costs and significant debt. Despite cost-cutting measures like pilot furloughs, the company stated it needs more liquidity and may be forced to sell off assets to sustain its business.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced a significant rally, with major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq moving towards all-time highs. This investor optimism was fueled by a July inflation report indicating that consumer prices rose by 2.7% annually, slightly below economists' expectations. The data has increased speculation that the Federal Reserve may have sufficient justification to implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming September meeting. Such a move would lower borrowing costs, potentially stimulating further economic activity and investment across various sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An active-duty Army sergeant, Quornelius Radford, has been charged with multiple counts of attempted premeditated murder and domestic violence following a shooting at Fort Stewart, Georgia. The 28-year-old is accused of using his personal weapon to open fire on his colleagues, wounding five soldiers. One of the victims was reportedly Radford's intimate partner, leading to the domestic violence specification in the charges. Officials credited the quick actions of other soldiers, who rendered first aid and restrained the gunman, with saving lives.

          <p>California peach farmers are facing a significant decline in their harvest this year, with some reporting up to a 30% reduction in fruit. The issue is attributed to warmer-than-usual winter temperatures, which disrupted the essential 'sleep cycle' that stone fruit trees require to regulate nutrients and produce a healthy crop. This phenomenon, linked to climate change, has woken trees at inconsistent times, leading to poor yields for many growers in the Central Valley. The reduced supply is beginning to impact consumers, who are now paying higher prices per pound for both yellow and white peaches across the country.</p>

A pioneer in consumer photography, Kodak has faced immense challenges adapting to the digital era, leading to a 2012 bankruptcy.

          <p>A U.S. State Department annual report has accused the United Kingdom of having "significant human rights issues," specifically citing restrictions on free speech and a rise in antisemitic violence. The report, published as Vice President JD Vance holidays in the UK, claims that human rights in the country worsened in 2024. It highlights concerns over limits on political speech deemed hateful or offensive, public space protection orders, and the Online Safety Act. This criticism echoes previous comments from Vance and others, though the UK government maintains it proudly upholds freedoms while ensuring citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors have filed two new corruption charges against City Councilman Curren Price, adding to an existing case involving allegations of embezzlement, perjury, and conflict of interest. The original charges from 2023 alleged Price voted on projects that financially benefited his wife's consulting firm. The new charges claim he also improperly voted on city grants and motions that directed funds to agencies from which his wife was receiving substantial payments. Price's attorney has dismissed the new counts as an attempt to bolster a weak case, asserting the councilman was unaware of the alleged conflicts when he cast his votes.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of workers and immigrant advocates gathered in MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, to protest the Trump administration's recent immigration raids in the city. Labor groups, including the SEIU, organized the rally to demand an end to the raids, the release of detained immigrants, and a halt to the expansion of private detention centers. The park has become a symbolic location after federal agents conducted a major operation there in July. Speakers at the protest called for boycotts of major companies they claim are not doing enough to protect their immigrant employees from federal enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a plan to conduct a comprehensive review of exhibitions and materials at several major Smithsonian museums. The stated goal is to ensure the content aligns with President Trump's directive to celebrate "American exceptionalism" and remove what it calls divisive or partisan narratives. According to a letter sent to the Smithsonian's secretary, the review will examine public-facing content and curatorial processes at eight museums, including the National Museums of American History and African American History and Culture. The Smithsonian responded that its work is grounded in scholarly excellence and the accurate presentation of history.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The location is historically significant, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. The summit follows Trump's unsuccessful efforts to broker a peace deal and comes after he set a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not expected to attend in person but will meet virtually with Trump and European leaders. The White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise," while Ukraine remains firm that it will not cede territory for peace.</p>

          <p>The ongoing conflict between Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has escalated, with Musk now threatening legal action against Apple over alleged antitrust violations. Musk claims Apple's App Store unfairly favors OpenAI's ChatGPT over his own xAI's Grok chatbot, making it impossible for competitors to reach the top ranking. Altman publicly retorted, suggesting Musk manipulates his own platform, X, to benefit his companies and harm competitors. This new chapter in their feud drags Apple into the contentious battle between the two AI titans, turning a personal and business rivalry into a broader dispute over platform fairness and market power.</p>

Despite the strong performance and an expansion of business with major clients like OpenAI, the stock slid by 9%. The company noted that its growth continues to be constrained by capacity as demand for its AI computing services still outstrips its available supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal trial in California is examining the legality of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops for civilian law enforcement in Los Angeles. The state of California argues that the deployment, used to support immigration raids, violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from domestic police actions. This case has become a critical test of the limits of presidential authority, as the administration claims a constitutional exception to the law. The trial unfolds as the White House signals intentions to use troops in other U.S. cities, raising concerns about the erosion of the rule of law and the militarization of domestic policing.</p>

This event, described by some as the first major EW clash between great powers, provided a unique opportunity for Chinese observers.

His nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous BLS commissioner over claims the jobs data was "rigged."

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that a key aspect of Donald Trump's political strategy is forcing his opponents into choosing between bad options, thereby testing their commitment to democratic norms. From Democrats considering gerrymandering to counter Republican efforts, to prosecutors weighing the political fallout of charging a former president, those who resist Trump often face difficult judgment calls. These dilemmas, such as whether to defy presidential orders or acquiesce to his demands, create situations where any choice can set a perilous precedent. This dynamic puts defenders of democratic institutions in a constant state of reacting to crises, often forcing them to adopt extreme measures themselves.</p>
