          <p>Tesla's profits experienced a steep decline of 71% in the first quarter of 2025, falling short of analyst expectations amidst slumping sales and stock performance. This downturn coincides with global protests against CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Tesla acknowledges that shifting political sentiments could impact demand, while shareholders are urging Musk to prioritize Tesla over his government role. The company faces growing competition from Chinese firms and uncertainties related to trade policies, with analysts questioning if Tesla is facing an existential crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers visited Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, two students detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for participating in pro-Palestinian protests. The lawmakers accuse the Trump administration of intentionally instilling fear and cruelty in communities by deporting the students, who were detained separately in March. Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, was told he was being deported for protesting the war in Gaza, while Öztürk, a Tufts University student, was detained outside Boston. Legal teams argue that choosing a Louisiana jail was a deliberate attempt to keep them away from their homes, with the lawmakers demanding answers from Homeland Security and ICE regarding the decision to move Öztürk.</p>

          <p>A jury has ruled that The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial that she claimed damaged her reputation. The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control that incorrectly linked Palin's political action committee to the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. The Times issued a correction less than 14 hours after publication, and the former editorial page editor apologized to Palin during the trial. The jury concluded that the Times did not act with 'reckless disregard' for the truth, reaffirming the principle that publishers are not liable for honest mistakes.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under fire for allegedly sharing military attack plans on his private phone with unauthorized individuals, potentially violating security protocols. Experts claim the shared details were likely classified, raising concerns about the element of surprise and national security. While Hegseth defends his actions as informal media coordination, critics argue that his conduct sets a dangerous precedent and undermines military morale. Democrats and a Republican lawmaker have called for his resignation, and the White House is reportedly considering replacements, though Trump publicly supports Hegseth.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced plans to phase out eight artificial food dyes and colorings from America’s food supply by the end of next year. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary cited concerns about the increasing exposure of American children to synthetic chemicals and potential links to health conditions like ADHD and cancer. The agencies are looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in various food products, while also authorizing four new natural color additives. The move follows growing concerns about the health effects of artificial dyes, prompting states to consider similar bans in school lunches and beyond.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax, an idea he previously floated during his presidential campaign. Economists are skeptical, calling it an unrealistic proposal.

          <p>A divided Supreme Court appeared likely to require a Maryland school board to provide parents with the ability to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation. The case centers on whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction that violates the families' religious beliefs. The court's conservative majority seemed ready to side with the families, questioning why opt-outs are not feasible, while the liberal justices raised concerns about the potential for widespread opt-outs based on religious objections.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a major rebound on Tuesday, with the Dow rising over 1,000 points, after investors pushed past President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The rebound suggests a more bullish attitude among investors who had rushed to sell shares following Trump's remarks, which caused a major market slump. The potential Fed shakeup and uncertainty about trade policy had sent the Dow tumbling, but factors such as the potential for a US-India trade deal and support for Fed independence from key Republicans contributed to the recovery. Despite the positive day, the IMF's World Economic Outlook cited the escalating trade war and high policy uncertainty as reasons for a reduced U.S. growth forecast.</p>
