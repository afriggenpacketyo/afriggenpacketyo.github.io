          <p>China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a new international agreement to address Iran's nuclear program, emphasizing the need for strict supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and the risk of a "nuclear disaster," following recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian facilities. Beijing is positioning itself as a key mediator, intensifying its criticism of the US and Israel while advocating for a diplomatic resolution. Wang stressed that negotiations should be accelerated to place Iran's nuclear activities under comprehensive international safeguards.</p>

          <p>The Women's Euro 2025 draw has placed England and Wales in what is being called the most difficult group, alongside formidable opponents France and the Netherlands. This "group of death" features three teams ranked in the top 11 globally, creating a highly competitive early stage for the tournament. Experts and team managers acknowledge the challenge, with data from Opta suggesting a 37% chance that the eventual tournament winner will emerge from this group. While England are the defending champions and the Netherlands won in 2017, they face a French team on an eight-game winning streak and a determined Welsh side making their tournament debut.</p>

          <h2>A Cultural Reflection on Joey Chestnut's Return to Competitive Hot Dog Eating</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 03:01:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut has reclaimed his title at the Coney Island hot dog eating contest, an event this article frames as a uniquely American spectacle of excess and determination. The piece delves into Chestnut's rigorous training regimen, which includes yoga, neck exercises, and developing a specific mental state of "anger and calm" for competition. Beyond the sport itself, the article explores the event as a cultural touchstone, reflecting America's complex relationship with food, abundance, and freedom. It presents the contest as an honest, if grotesque, distillation of consumer culture and a spectacle that is both absurd and deeply serious.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming, a legacy project from the 2024 Olympics. Three supervised swimming zones, complete with amenities like changing rooms and lifeguards, have been established near landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral. The ban, in place since 1923 due to pollution, was lifted after a €1.4 billion investment to improve water quality, including building a massive wastewater storage tank. While the river hosted Olympic events, officials will continue to monitor water quality and enforce safety measures due to strong currents and boat traffic.</p>

          <p>The football world is in mourning following the death of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash at the age of 28 along with his brother. Former Wolves captain Conor Coady paid a moving tribute, describing Jota as a "fantastic human being" and an "incredible footballer." Jota was instrumental in Wolves' promotion to the Premier League and their subsequent success before his £41 million transfer to Liverpool in 2020. Coady recalled Jota's tenacity, quiet leadership, and the immense pride he felt watching his former teammate succeed at one of the world's biggest clubs.</p>

The report also details a sexual assault at a cathedral event and highlights significant safeguarding and governance failures.

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's proposed "liberation day" tariffs is set to expire, raising concerns about a potential trade assault on dozens of countries and its impact on the US economy. While a few narrow agreements have been reached with nations like the UK and China, the administration has not achieved its goal of "90 deals in 90 days." Businesses and economists are bracing for the possibility of steep new tariffs, which could add significant costs for companies and consumers already dealing with inflation. Analysis suggests that even existing tariff levels are creating a substantial financial burden on US firms. (not investment advice)</p>

A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network found that over 85 Pride organizations have seen reduced corporate funding, with some experiencing revenue drops of over 50%. This has forced some events to be canceled, scaled back, or to introduce admission fees for the first time. Organizers attribute the funding crisis partly to a shift away from diversity and inclusion initiatives by some global corporations, creating an uncertain future for these vital community celebrations.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by discovering a "genetic switch" that allowed them to restore damaged ear tissue in mice. The research, published in the journal *Science*, found that the inability of mice to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating a dormant genetic pathway, the team achieved complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage. While human application is still a distant goal, the findings offer hope by proving that the mechanism for organ regeneration can be switched back on in mammals.</p>

The author criticizes the conflation of criticism of the Israeli military with antisemitism, pointing out that this framing ignores the context of the conflict, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed. The piece contends that this "Vylanising" of the discourse is a strategy to delegitimize pro-Palestinian sentiment.

Critics argue that the government is honoring the ROC's victory over Japan while simultaneously downplaying its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before the KMT's retreat to Taiwan in 1949. This reflects the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's broader political stance, which emphasizes a distinct Taiwanese identity separate from the mainland.

          <h2>Opinion: Parallels Drawn Between Trump's Governance and Cold War-Era African Dictatorships</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that to understand President Trump's style of governance, one should look to the postcolonial dictatorships of Cold War-era Africa, many of which were supported by the U.S. The author draws parallels between Trump's actions—such as deploying troops against domestic protesters, using patronage, and his anti-intellectual rhetoric—and the methods of leaders like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin. The article suggests that these authoritarian tactics, once fostered abroad by the U.S. as a bulwark against communism, are now being mirrored at home. It concludes that this historical lens is both alarming and instructive for understanding the current political climate.</p>

          <h2>President Trump's False Claim About Wind Farms in China Draws Immediate Fact-Checks</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump made a false claim during a renewed attack on renewable energy, stating he had "never seen a wind farm in China" and questioning if the country uses wind power. The statement was immediately fact-checked on social media, as China is the world's leading producer of wind energy, with significantly more capacity than the United States. This claim comes as Trump's new tax and spending bill is set to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar power. Critics, including trade unions and columnists, have described the move as strategically self-harming and a major job-killer for the renewables industry.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' front office has indicated that their trade deadline plans will not be significantly altered by the recent knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy. While the initial collision looked severe, Muncy escaped with only a bone bruise and is expected to miss about six weeks, allowing for a potential return before the playoffs. General manager Brandon Gomes stated the team is content to rely on internal options to fill the position in the interim. The team is comfortable with the recovery timeline and believes Muncy will have sufficient time to regain his form for the postseason run.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in Queens, New York, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple sharks were spotted swimming very close to shore. Drones operated by NYC Emergency Management confirmed the sightings near Far Rockaway, leading lifeguards to clear the water as a safety precaution. The city's deputy mayor for public safety noted that technology like drones is crucial for monitoring the waters and ensuring the safety of beachgoers. The closures come as New York state officials have been increasing shark surveillance measures along Long Island beaches ahead of the busy holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has denied an emergency request to stop the deportation of eight immigrants to South Sudan, clearing the way for their removal by the Trump administration. The men, who have been convicted of serious crimes, were scheduled to be flown out despite arguments from their lawyers that they would face perilous conditions in the war-torn country. This ruling is the latest development in a legal battle over the administration's high-profile deportation campaign. The judge stated that the Supreme Court required him to deny the bid, as the claims were substantially similar to ones he had previously ruled on.</p>

          <p>On Independence Day, President Donald Trump signed his administration's major tax and spending legislation into law, a bill he described as "big, beautiful." The new law introduces significant tax cuts, increases defense spending, and provides more aggressive funding for immigration enforcement. While the president and his supporters claim the measures will stimulate economic growth, Democrats have strongly criticized the bill. They warn that it will primarily benefit the wealthy and corporations while negatively impacting low-income earners, calling its passage a "dark day" for the country. (not investment advice)</p>
