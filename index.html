          <p>Gold prices have exceeded $3,000 per ounce, marking a significant increase from $1,800 since mid-2023, driven primarily by central bank buying. Experts suggest that existing gold owners should consider their initial investment goals before selling, while new investors shouldn't be deterred by the high price, as gold can serve as a hedge against equities and bonds. Financial advisors recommend allocating 5-10% of a portfolio to gold for diversification. The article advises consulting with a financial advisor for personalized investment decisions.

Paul criticized Trump's use of a "national emergency" declaration to justify the tariffs, emphasizing the need for Congress to reassert its authority over foreign trade.

There are three levels: a 7% drop halts trading for 15 minutes (if before 3:25 PM ET), a 13% drop triggers another 15-minute halt (if before 3:25 PM ET), and a 20% drop suspends trading for the remainder of the day.

          <p>While measles outbreaks typically affect children, a growing number of adults are contracting the disease due to waning vaccination rates and a higher susceptibility to severe complications with age. Unvaccinated adults face a greater risk of pneumonia and encephalitis, requiring hospitalization more frequently than children. Measles can also cause "immune amnesia," weakening the immune system's ability to fight off other diseases.

          <p>White House trade advisor Peter Navarro stated that an offer from Vietnam to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports is insufficient to warrant lifting the new levies announced last week, citing concerns over non-tariff cheating, such as Chinese products being routed through Vietnam and intellectual property theft. Navarro's comments indicate the Trump administration's focus on addressing broader trade practices beyond just tariff rates. He also noted the value-added tax as a point of contention in trade negotiations with the EU. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Business groups and conservative lawyers are preparing a legal challenge to President Trump's tariffs, arguing that he lacks the legal authority to impose them. The challenge centers on the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which does not explicitly mention tariffs. Legal experts argue that Congress, not the president, has the power to regulate trade, raising constitutional questions about the tariffs' legality.</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of tariffs marks the end of American free trade, potentially harming families, companies, and investors. The policy undermines American global power and isolates the country, creating opportunities for other nations. Experts warn that tariffs will lead to higher prices, slower growth, and retaliatory measures from other countries. The policy also opens opportunities for Beijing to portray itself as a responsible global leader.</p>
