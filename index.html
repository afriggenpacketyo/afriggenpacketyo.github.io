            <p>A small, single-engine Cessna 180 crashed in Trilla, Illinois, killing all four people on board after hitting power lines. The victims, two men and two women from Menomonie, Wisconsin, were identified as Ross Nelson, Michael Morrow, Raimi Rundle, and Courtney Morrow. Witnesses reported hearing a loud boom and seeing smoke after the crash, which caused a temporary power outage in the area. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days; Governor Pritzker expressed condolences and thanked first responders.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelan deportees from the United States in exchange for the release of an equal number of political prisoners held in Venezuela. Bukele addressed the proposal to Nicol√°s Maduro via social media, listing family members of opposition figures, journalists, and activists allegedly detained for opposing Maduro. This comes amid scrutiny of El Salvador's detention of deportees in a "mega-prison", and criticism from the archbishop who urged Bukele to not make the country an 'international prison'.</p>

            <p>Professor Yan Anlin, a Taiwan studies expert and advisor to Beijing, believes that complete reunification between mainland China and Taiwan is still in the early stages and will likely take another five to ten years to achieve peacefully.

Yan Anlin highlights the ongoing phase of quantitative change rather than a qualitative shift in cross-strait relations, suggesting continued efforts are needed to build momentum toward reunification.</p>

            <p>Former Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava is reportedly expected to transfer to UCLA following a dispute with Tennessee over NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) negotiations. ESPN reports that the UCLA coaching staff has informed its quarterbacks of Iamaleava's impending arrival, marking a significant upgrade for the Bruins' football program. Iamaleava's departure from Tennessee was allegedly due to his seeking a $4 million NIL deal, which the university resisted, leading to his entry into the transfer portal. The move brings the former five-star prospect back to Southern California, where he was heavily recruited out of high school.</p>

            <p>Tyler Glasnow, Dodgers' starting pitcher, left Sunday's game against the Texas Rangers after four innings due to lower leg cramping. While the Dodgers secured a 1-0 victory, Glasnow's early exit raised concerns given his history of injuries. The team has already placed Blake Snell on the injured list, and reliever Blake Treinen is dealing with a forearm sprain. Glasnow's diagnosis suggests the cramping is not serious, but any physical issue for the pitcher is a cause for concern, considering his past injury struggles.</p>

His family provided his birth certificate and social security card after discovering his detention at the Florence Correctional Center.
