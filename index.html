          <p>Several countries have condemned the Israeli military for firing warning shots near a diplomatic delegation visiting the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military stated that the group deviated from an approved route in Jenin, leading troops to fire warning shots into the air. The Palestinian Authority accused Israeli forces of deliberately targeting the delegation, which was there to observe the humanitarian situation and document violations against Palestinians. Israel has stated it will investigate the incident and update the nations involved, while many countries, including Spain, Egypt, France, Turkey, Ireland and Italy, have condemned the actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with South African President Ramaphosa at the White House, where Trump presented videos and articles alleging a "genocide" against white South African farmers. Ramaphosa disputed these claims, asserting that the speakers in the videos represented fringe political groups and that criminality affects all South Africans, not just white individuals. Elon Musk, present at the meeting, has also amplified claims of "white genocide." Trump's administration has fast-tracked Afrikaner refugee applications under an executive order citing land seizures without compensation, a claim Ramaphosa disputes by saying those resettled in the U.S. do not fit the definition of a refugee. The meeting underscored tensions between the two nations, despite Ramaphosa's efforts to focus on trade and economic investment.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin briefly surpassed its January record, reaching $109,857 before falling back due to rising Treasury yields and a drop in stocks. Antoni Trenchev of crypto exchange Nexo attributes Bitcoin's new high to factors like softer U.S. inflation numbers and a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Cumulative inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded $40 billion, with regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments expected to further drive prices. The Senate is also advancing legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and Coinbase recently joined the S&P 500.</p>

This decision contrasts with the Episcopal Church, which ended its refugee resettlement partnership with the U.S. government due to concerns about racial justice. The Trump administration fast-tracked Afrikaners for resettlement, citing persecution, a claim disputed by many.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses how market distractions, such as presidential announcements, debt downgrades, and tax bill battles, create buying opportunities for investors. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on companies with strong fundamentals and trustworthy CEOs, rather than being swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Cramer notes that current market conditions, including a volatile 10-year Treasury yield and an overbought S&P Oscillator, warrant caution, but also present opportunities to acquire quality stocks at lower prices.

          <p>President Trump's criticism of South Africa's land seizures from white farmers contrasts with his own administration's use of eminent domain to build the border wall. Trump has accused South Africa of systemic persecution of Afrikaners, while his administration has seized private land in Texas for wall construction. This has created discontent among landowners like Richard Drawe, who reluctantly agreed to allow the government to build on his land. The situation highlights Trump's willingness to employ government-sanctioned land grabs despite his opposition to similar policies in other countries.</p>

          <p>California public school enrollment has declined for the seventh consecutive year, while the number of students from low-income and homeless families has increased. The most notable statistic is the significant difference between 12th-grade enrollment (488,295 students) and 1st-grade enrollment (384,822 students). Stanford University's Thomas Dee attributes the decline to lower birth rates and families migrating out of California. Despite the overall drop, transitional kindergarten enrollment is growing.
