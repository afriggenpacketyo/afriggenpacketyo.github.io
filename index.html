        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating releasing approximately 600,000 tons of stockpiled rice to stabilize prices that have surged due to supply shortages, considering an additional release of 300,000 tons over three months through July. This measure follows an earlier auction of 321,000 tons between March and April, aiming to address record-high rice prices and concerns about hoarding by wholesalers and farmers anticipating further price increases. The proposed release would significantly reduce the government's rice reserves, potentially raising concerns about future responses to natural disasters or poor harvests. Lawmakers are also considering relaxing buyback requirements for rice distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions and alleviate supply pressures.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian representatives convened in Istanbul for their first direct talks since the early stages of Russia's invasion in 2022, with the absence of Presidents Putin and Trump casting uncertainty over the negotiations. The talks aim to build upon the Istanbul Communiqué from March 2022, which proposed Ukraine's neutrality in exchange for security guarantees, although emerging evidence of alleged Russian war crimes undermined those initial efforts. Despite low expectations for an immediate breakthrough, the renewed dialogue signifies a potential shift in diplomatic efforts, with President Trump urging both sides to engage constructively. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that a diplomatic resolution is essential to end the conflict and prevent further loss of life, highlighting the importance of building rather than destroying.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, driven primarily by the services sector, according to official figures. This growth rate surpassed analyst forecasts and marked a significant improvement from the previous quarter, although analysts cautioned that this momentum may not persist due to upcoming import tariffs and increased employer taxes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasized the strength and potential of the UK economy, highlighting its faster growth compared to other major economies, while opposition figures raised concerns about downgraded growth forecasts and the impact of rising employer taxes.</p>

          <p>Children with hearing impairments in Kosovo are struggling in schools due to limited resources and institutional support, with some parents reluctant to teach them sign language, fearing it will hinder speech development. Many deaf individuals in Kosovo rely on sign language as their primary form of communication, but its limited use and the misconception that it impedes spoken language acquisition pose significant challenges. The lack of sign language instruction in schools and the exclusion from the labor market further exacerbate the difficulties faced by individuals with hearing disabilities, leading to potential psychological effects such as anxiety and isolation. Efforts are being made to improve education for deaf students, but a concrete plan to integrate sign language into the curriculum is still lacking.</p>

          <p>A columnist in the Los Angeles Times argues that President Trump's acceptance of a $400 million jet from Qatar reveals his unprecedented pursuit of wealth and its trappings, suggesting it makes his corruption easier for Americans to grasp. The columnist criticizes the hypocrisy of a populist president accepting such a lavish gift from a foreign government, especially given Trump's past criticisms of Qatar. The article contends that Trump and his family are openly leveraging presidential influence for personal enrichment, particularly through cryptocurrency and real estate ventures, and exploiting the presidency for self-gain, despite the turmoil in Gaza and Yemen.</p>

          <p>Three Māori Members of Parliament in New Zealand are facing potential suspension for performing a haka in protest during a parliamentary session last year. The parliamentary committee deemed the haka potentially intimidating to other lawmakers and recommended suspensions for the MPs. The Māori Party has criticized the recommendations as a warning to conform, while Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, who is also Māori, described the MPs' actions as disruptive. The proposed suspensions will be voted on, amidst ongoing debates about the country's founding treaty with Māori people.</p>

Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit, Carlos Kuriyama, emphasized that the current environment, characterized by tariff hikes and retaliatory measures, is not conducive to trade and is weighing on business confidence.

          <p>Alabama lawmakers have passed legislation providing enhanced legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans stated that the bill aims to support law enforcement, while Democrats voiced concerns that it could enable police misconduct, particularly against Black individuals. The legislation allows for an immunity hearing to determine if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties, and requires law enforcement departments to track use of force complaints.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, largely attributed to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate this year, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not anticipated to be a major contributing factor. The IMF reports that Denmark's economy grew 3.7% in 2024 but forecasts a slowdown to 2.9% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026 due to anticipated weakness in export growth. However, Denmark's reliance on a "merchanting and processing" system, where most of the value of medicines is in intellectual property and production is contracted to other countries, shields it from direct impacts of U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>A version of the Magna Carta held by Harvard University has been identified as an original from 1300, rather than a copy as previously believed, according to British experts. The "Great Charter," originally dating from 1215, is a key document in the history of legal systems and constitutions. Experts from King's College London and the University of East Anglia based their conclusion on an analysis of the document's size and handwriting. The discovery comes as Harvard University has been barred from receiving new federal grants by the Trump administration, which many critics see as violating some of the key principles enshrined in the Magna Carta.</p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has issued a decree curbing immigration, drawing parallels to the immigration restrictions implemented by the Trump administration. The decree tightens restrictions on citizenship, requiring immigrants to spend two uninterrupted years in Argentina or make a significant financial investment. It also makes it easier to deport migrants who enter the country illegally or commit minor crimes, and charges foreigners for access to public health care and education. Critics worry that the new rules would challenge Argentina's tradition of openness to immigrants.</p>
