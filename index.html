          <p>A powerful explosion occurred at the Accurate Energetic Systems military explosives plant in Tennessee, resulting in multiple fatalities and leaving 18 people unaccounted for. The blast, which happened Friday morning, completely destroyed one of the buildings on the campus, scattering debris and rattling homes miles away. Humphrey County Sheriff Chris Davis described the scene as one of the most devastating he has ever witnessed in his career. Federal agencies, including the FBI and ATF, are investigating the cause of the explosion, a process that is being slowed by the instability of the site and small, smoldering fires.</p>

          <p>A drone strike, attributed to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has killed dozens of people, including many children, at a displacement shelter in el-Fasher, Sudan. The city has been under siege by the RSF for 17 months as it is the last major urban center in the Darfur region held by the Sudanese army. Eyewitnesses described scenes of chaos as rescuers pulled bodies from the rubble, and overwhelmed local hospitals struggled to treat the wounded. The attack has been condemned by the UN, which warned that continued strikes on civilian areas may constitute war crimes amid a devastating national conflict.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson has confirmed that former President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation and hormone therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. The diagnosis was first announced in May 2025 after a nodule was discovered on his prostate, which had metastasized to the bone. According to a person close to the former president, he is responding well to the treatment, which began several weeks ago in Philadelphia. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men, with age being a primary risk factor.</p>

Zelenskyy urged Trump to help broker an end to the war with Russia, expressing hope for a resolution. The conversation also covered Ukraine's need for enhanced air defense systems following recent Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. This call signals a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who have met multiple times recently to coordinate support.</p>

          <p>Chinese airlines could face significant financial repercussions if a proposed U.S. ban on using Russian airspace for flights to and from the United States is implemented. The U.S. Department of Transportation argues that using Russian airspace gives Chinese carriers an unfair advantage with shorter flight times. Analysts suggest that if the ban is enforced, Chinese airlines may have to absorb higher costs by rerouting flights and increasing ticket prices, or potentially cancel routes altogether. This could lead to losses from canceled ticket sales and disruptions to long-term capacity planning.</p>

Critics argue that this "MAGA-fication" of sports is leading to a noticeable increase in brutishness and coarseness in public forums, aimed at weakening collective norms and boundaries in both sports and politics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its tenth day with no resolution in sight, as Democrats and Republicans remain locked in a bitter standoff. Democrats are refusing to fund the government until concessions are made on issues like healthcare tax credits, while Republicans accuse them of holding the country hostage for political gain. The situation escalated when the White House began issuing layoff notices to over 4,000 federal workers, a move Democrats condemned as "deliberate chaos." Both sides are digging in, with progressive groups encouraging Democratic leaders to stand firm on their demands.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters has drawn criticism for bizarrely speculating that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez "wants to sleep with" White House aide Stephen Miller. The comments came after AOC mocked Miller's height in an Instagram video, urging people to laugh at MAGA figures. This article argues that while mocking someone's appearance is not clever, humor is an effective tool against authoritarian figures who cannot stand to be laughed at. The intense reaction from several Fox News hosts and a White House communications director to AOC's joke is presented as evidence of their thin skin.</p>

          <p>Archbishop Gregory Aymond of New Orleans testified under oath for the first time in the archdiocese's long-running bankruptcy case, which is tied to hundreds of clergy sexual abuse claims. The deposition was held in a confidential session as the church moves toward a proposed settlement with survivors valued at over $230 million. The archbishop's testimony had been delayed for years, most notably by the archdiocese's bankruptcy filing in May 2020, which halted numerous pending abuse lawsuits. The settlement is currently awaiting a vote from the abuse claimants.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old Uber driver, Jonathan Rinderknecht, has been arrested and charged with igniting the Palisades fire, the most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles history. Federal investigators allege he started a small blaze on New Year's Day that smoldered for nearly a week before reigniting and spreading catastrophically. Digital evidence revealed the suspect had a fixation on fire, using ChatGPT to generate dystopian images of destruction and confiding his obsession. The fire ultimately burned over 23,000 acres, killed 12 people, and destroyed thousands of structures, causing billions in damages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While President Donald Trump cultivates an image of being a champion for the American worker, critics argue his policies have had a detrimental effect on their economic well-being. The ongoing government shutdown, which has led to mass firings of federal employees, is cited as a recent example of this disconnect. Analysts point to the administration's broad tariffs, which raise consumer costs, and changes to guest worker programs that drive down wages in sectors like agriculture. They contend that despite the pro-worker aesthetics, the administration's actions ultimately favor corporations and the wealthy over the working class.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian-American writer reflects on the complex and guilt-ridden nature of mourning a personal loss—the death of her grandmother—while witnessing the immense suffering and mass casualties in Gaza. This experience of "disenfranchised grief" involves feeling that one's own sorrow is unearned or indulgent when compared to a larger, public tragedy. The article explores how the constant stream of devastating images from Gaza via social media recalibrates what feels worthy of grief. Ultimately, the act of cooking her grandmother's traditional recipes becomes a form of defiance and a way to honor her heritage and humanity amidst overwhelming sorrow.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Regret is an unavoidable emotional consequence of having free will, but it doesn't have to be a purely negative experience. Instead of wallowing in past mistakes with thoughts of "what if," it's possible to use regret as a tool for present-day self-discovery. By allowing oneself to feel the sadness, disappointment, or guilt associated with a past decision, one can gain valuable insights. This process can transform regret from a refusal to accept the past into a learning opportunity that informs future choices and a better understanding of oneself.</p>

          <p>The race to become the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is shaping up to be a verdict on Prime Minister Keir Starmer's performance. The two main candidates, Lucy Powell and Bridget Phillipson, represent different approaches to the role within a party currently facing internal dissatisfaction. Powell, recently sacked from the cabinet, is campaigning as a critical voice who will speak out, while Phillipson, a current cabinet member, pitches herself as a loyal insider who will argue for change from within. With many party members disgruntled, the election of Powell is seen by some as a potential rebuke to Starmer's leadership.</p>

          <p>The world is projected to produce a record amount of grain this year, a testament to decades of agricultural progress that has made widespread famines far rarer than in the past. Advances like the Green Revolution, synthetic fertilizers, and improved irrigation have tripled cereal yields since the 1960s, creating a global food system of abundance. However, challenges remain, as billions still cannot afford a healthy diet, and modern famines, like those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily caused by political failures and conflict rather than crop failures. Climate change also poses a significant future threat to this progress.</p>
