          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, has been sentenced to 45 years in prison for the depraved-heart murder of his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, after providing her with habit-forming surgical anesthetics like propofol and ketamine. Harris, who was more than twice Ryan's age, had been his patient for wisdom teeth removal before they began a relationship, during which Ryan supplied her with drugs he took from his office. Texts revealed Ryan administered the drugs to Harris while she was asleep, without monitoring, leading to her chemical dependency and eventual overdose, with the prosecution arguing Ryan recklessly disregarded her life. The case highlights the dangers of power imbalances in relationships and the misuse of prescription drugs.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, primarily due to reduced oil prices and production levels. The company's net income for the quarter reached $26 billion, slightly surpassing analyst expectations, while free cash flow decreased to $19.2 billion, signaling financial strain amid sluggish crude prices and global demand. Aramco reduced its performance-linked dividend payout for both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 to $200 million, though the base dividend saw a 4.2% increase to $21.1 billion.

          <p>In this guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, challenges the notion of perfect motherhood and encourages mothers to embrace their flaws. She argues that striving for perfection is harmful and that children learn valuable lessons about accepting imperfections from their flawed mothers. The article highlights the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and offers a lighthearted quiz to reassure mothers that being imperfect is perfectly fine, and that mothers should give themselves some slack.</p>

The aerobatic flight, as the name suggests, involves high-risk manoeuvres that require unstable postures – movements rarely executed in conventional flight operations for most aircraft. Gao Fei, an associate professor at Zhejiang University, said that “This biological wisdom – transforming ‘high-risk manoeuvres’ into ‘high-survival rewards’ – holds the key to redefining traditional drone flight paradigms,”.</p>
