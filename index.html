          <p>During President Trump's second state visit to the UK, the British government aims to achieve more than just business deals, seeking to leverage the occasion for strategic gains amidst domestic political turmoil. Key objectives include refining the existing US-UK trade deal, with a particular focus on eliminating the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum exports, a critical issue for Britain's precarious steel industry. The visit is also seen as a crucial opportunity to boost confidence in the UK's economic outlook, especially given recent tax rises and a major cabinet reshuffle. This article underscores the UK's desire to strengthen its "special relationship" with the US, aiming for deeper economic cooperation and a renewed sense of stability and global influence.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani was strategically removed from a game after an impressive five no-hit innings and only 68 pitches, a decision by manager Dave Roberts aimed at preserving Ohtani's health following his second Tommy John surgery. Despite Ohtani's dominant performance against the division-leading Phillies, the Dodgers' relief pitchers subsequently faltered dramatically, surrendering six runs in the sixth inning. The bullpen's continued struggles ultimately led to a 9-6 loss, overshadowing Ohtani's efforts, which included hitting his 50th home run of the season. This article highlights the delicate balance between player management and game outcomes, revealing the team's ongoing challenges and the frustration among fans regarding relief pitching.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell, a Labour deputy leadership contender recently dismissed from Sir Keir Starmer's cabinet, has criticized the government for "unforced errors" regarding welfare policies. She specifically highlighted attempts to cut disability benefits and winter fuel payments, arguing these actions make voters question the party's alignment and commitment to supporting vulnerable populations. Powell urged Labour leaders to be clearer about their desire to scrap the two-child benefit cap and move out of a "defensive crouch" on the issue. She also dismissed claims that her deputy leadership bid is a proxy for other male politicians, emphasizing her independent political stance. This article focuses on internal party dynamics and policy disagreements within the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has denied the Menendez brothers' petition for a new trial, ruling that the newly presented evidence would not have altered their initial murder convictions. The petition claimed new evidence, including a 1988 letter from Erik Menendez detailing alleged abuse by his father and a declaration from a former bandmate alleging sexual assault by Jose Menendez. However, the judge found this evidence not "particularly strong" and deemed it redundant to abuse allegations already considered by the jury during their original trial.

          <p>A 29-year-old man sustained significant but non-life-threatening injuries to his chest and left arm after being attacked by a bear while hiking alone on the Turbid Lake Trail in Yellowstone National Park. The incident occurred despite the hiker deploying bear spray, and park officials suspect the animal was a grizzly bear, given its size and behavior. The park has since closed the trail for investigation, but no management action will be taken against the bear, as the encounter was determined to be a defensive reaction.

          <p>Celebrated Canadian children's author Robert Munsch, known for beloved books like The Paper Bag Princess and Love You Forever, has been approved for medically assisted dying in Canada. Diagnosed with dementia in 2021 and also suffering from Parkinson's disease, Munsch stated he would choose the timing "when I start having real trouble talking and communicating." Canada's law, updated in 2021, allows assisted dying for people with serious and chronic physical conditions, even if not immediately life-threatening. This article highlights Munsch's personal decision, influenced by his brother's struggle with ALS, and the ethical considerations surrounding medically assisted dying in Canada.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted by a smaller-than-expected 0.1% year-on-year in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline but showing a significant improvement from July's 2.6% fall. This milder contraction was primarily driven by a rebound in shipments to Asia, which climbed 1.7%, and Western Europe, despite a steeper 13.8% decline in exports to the US due to tariffs. The country's political uncertainty, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba set to step down, adds another layer of complexity to the economic outlook.

          <p>Syria is experiencing its worst drought in 36 years, severely impacting wheat harvests and pushing millions of people to the brink of a widespread food crisis. Wheat harvests have been slashed by 40%, and the UN estimates a shortfall of 2.73 million tonnes, equivalent to the annual dietary needs for 16.25 million people in a country where 90% already live in poverty. Farming families are selling livestock and reducing daily meals, with rising malnutrition rates among children and pregnant women.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong should actively seek to co-host China’s proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, challenging Beijing's early preference for Shanghai. The author suggests that Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" framework, with its independent legal system and international credibility, could effectively assuage Western skepticism towards a China-led AI center. While Shanghai boasts robust AI infrastructure, including over 1,100 core AI companies and substantial government backing, Hong Kong's unique position could facilitate broader international participation and influence in shaping global AI standards.

The bill aims to ban "no-fault" evictions, give tenants greater rights to challenge rent increases, and prohibit discrimination against prospective tenants on benefits or with children. While these changes are widely welcomed by renters, some landlords express fear that the legislation will lead to a contraction of the private rental sector and ultimately push rents up.
