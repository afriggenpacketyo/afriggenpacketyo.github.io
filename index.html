          <p>American Airlines has significantly scaled back its 2025 profit outlook, now forecasting an adjusted per-share result ranging from a 20-cent loss to an 80-cent profit, a steep reduction from its earlier estimates. The airline's third-quarter forecast also disappointed investors, projecting a loss between 10 and 60 cents per share, which is worse than analyst expectations. While its second-quarter revenue slightly exceeded predictions at $14.39 billion, the lowered future guidance reflects concerns about potential macroeconomic weaknesses and a volatile domestic travel market.

          <p>Police in India have arrested a man accused of running a fake embassy near New Delhi to defraud people with promises of overseas employment and diplomatic influence. The suspect, Harshvardhan Jain, allegedly impersonated an ambassador for non-existent micronations like "Seborga" and "Westarctica," using luxury cars with fake diplomatic plates to enhance his credibility. During a raid, authorities recovered counterfeit passports, fake government seals, and approximately $52,000 in cash. He is now facing charges of forgery, impersonation, and illegal money laundering.</p>

          <p>A registered dietitian suggests that pure, 100% agave tequila can be a "reasonable choice" for health-conscious drinkers due to its naturally lower sugar content and lack of additives compared to other liquors and sugary cocktails. However, the expert emphasizes that no alcohol is truly healthy or hangover-proof, as all alcoholic beverages are classified as Group 1 carcinogens. The article recommends moderation, avoiding sugary mixers, staying hydrated, and eating a balanced meal before drinking to mitigate negative health effects. This information is presented as general guidance for consumers.</p>

The company is facing intensified competition from lower-cost EV manufacturers in key markets like China and Europe, and it did not provide official guidance for the remainder of the year.

The order specifically requires companies to certify that their AI chatbots are politically neutral and free from what it defines as "ideological agendas," including concepts like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and critical race theory. This move aims to ensure that AI used by the government does not promote a particular worldview, though critics argue it could allow the tech industry to self-regulate.</p>

          <h2>News Agencies Raise Alarm Over Journalists Facing Starvation in Gaza</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BBC News and three major international news agencies have issued a joint statement expressing desperate concern for local journalists in Gaza, who they say are now facing starvation. As Israel does not permit foreign media access, the world has relied on these independent Gaza-based reporters for on-the-ground coverage of the conflict. The agencies state that these journalists now endure the same dire circumstances as the population they cover and urge Israeli authorities to allow adequate food supplies and journalist access to the territory.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a new interview with the Department of Justice, a 2022 sentencing memorandum from federal prosecutors provides a stark assessment of Ghislaine Maxwell's character. The document, from her 2021 conviction, describes her as engaging in a "significant pattern of dishonest conduct" and showing an "utter failure to accept responsibility" for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation. This official assessment casts doubt on her credibility as the DOJ now seeks her cooperation to learn more about others potentially involved in Epstein's crimes.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has launched an investigation after data revealed that payment cards issued to asylum seekers were used for gambling. A Freedom of Information request showed over 6,500 attempted payments in gambling settings over the past year using Aspen cards, which are provided for food and essentials. While online attempts were blocked, some transactions were successful at physical locations like casinos and lottery retailers. The government has pledged to take urgent action to prevent future misuse of the taxpayer-funded cards.</p>

          <p>Despite death being a universal experience, many Americans find it to be the most difficult taboo topic to discuss, ranking it lower than money, sex, or religion. This cultural avoidance has tangible consequences, as less than half of U.S. adults have a will or a living will, which can lead to confusion and conflict for their families. The article explores the historical roots of this silence, from the rise of the for-profit funeral industry to the use of euphemisms, and suggests that open conversations about death can be life-affirming and empowering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary discusses a recent study published in The Lancet Global Health, which estimates that broad economic sanctions, primarily imposed by the U.S., kill approximately 564,000 people each year. The author argues that these sanctions devastate economies, food systems, and hospitals, disproportionately affecting children under five. The article posits that sanctions are used as a weapon because their deadly toll is less visible than military action, and it calls for an end to this form of "economic violence," which it deems illegal and inhumane.</p>

          <p>A preliminary NTSB report on the tragic Lake Tahoe boating accident in June found that none of the eight people who died were wearing life jackets when their boat capsized in a sudden storm. The two survivors were found with personal flotation devices. The report details how a pleasant day quickly turned severe, with 8-foot waves, hail, and snow, yet only one survivor managed to don a life jacket and distribute others before the boat overturned. Investigators found no evidence of a hull leak or grounding, highlighting the critical role of safety equipment.</p>

          <p>In South Korea, the ideal of homeownership is overwhelmingly centered on large, high-rise apartment complexes, known as 'apateu,' rather than single-family homes. This model, which houses 64% of the population, emerged from government policies in the 1960s to address a housing crisis and has since become a symbol of middle-class aspiration. These complexes function like miniature towns with extensive amenities, offering a convenient, high-density lifestyle that contrasts sharply with the suburban, car-dependent model prevalent in many U.S. cities like Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The state of California is suing Tesla for false advertising, alleging the company misled consumers into believing its vehicles are fully autonomous. The Department of Motor Vehicles lawsuit argues that marketing terms like "Autopilot" and "Full Self-Driving Capability" are deceptive because the vehicles cannot operate without active driver supervision. The state is seeking to suspend Tesla's sales in California for at least 30 days. Tesla defends its language as aspirational and qualified by user warnings, but faces a significant challenge in a key market.</p>

          <p>Researchers are developing a form of artificial blood that could be stored as a powder and reconstituted with water in emergencies, potentially saving thousands of lives lost to hemorrhage. Scientists at the University of Maryland are working on a product called ErythroMer, which uses hemoglobin enclosed in a synthetic cell to safely deliver oxygen. This innovation could be transformative for military medics and first responders, as real blood cannot be routinely carried due to its short shelf life and need for refrigeration. Human trials could begin within two years.</p>
