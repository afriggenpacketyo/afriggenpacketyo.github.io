          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers secured a decisive 34-7 victory over the Detroit Lions in the NFL's preseason Hall of Fame Game. Quarterback Trey Lance, competing for the backup position, delivered a strong performance, throwing for 120 yards and two touchdowns. The Chargers' defense also contributed significantly, forcing turnovers that led to scores, including an early interception that set up a touchdown. The Lions struggled with mistakes, including multiple fumbles on special teams, providing an early look at areas needing improvement for both teams as the preseason continues.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, postponing the terminations until at least November. In her decision, Judge Trina Thompson stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the administration's actions were preordained and potentially motivated by racial animus, citing controversial remarks made by President Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), announced an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion and slightly exceeding analyst expectations. Despite leading the cloud market, AWS faces growing pressure from competitors Microsoft and Google, both of which reported higher cloud growth rates. AWS remains a major profit driver for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the company's focus on security and noted that supply constraints, particularly for power, continue to be a challenge in meeting the rising demand for AI services.

          <p>Asian countries have responded to the Trump administration's revised tariff schedule, which brought relief to some nations with lower-than-expected rates. Cambodia's prime minister celebrated a reduction from 49% to 19%, while Thailand's finance minister noted the new 19% rate reflects a close partnership with the U.S. Conversely, Taiwan faces a 20% temporary tariff, down from a threatened 32%, but continues negotiations for further reductions. The announcement of a 40% tariff on transshipped goods adds another layer of complexity for regional trade and supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

Opposition lawmakers decried the move as the death of democracy in the country, warning of an accumulation of power and corruption.

The original $21 billion fund was created in 2019 to shield utilities from bankruptcy after their equipment sparked catastrophic fires, but its rapid depletion has necessitated this urgent call for more capital.

          <p>A study published in the journal Cell proposes that the modern potato evolved from an ancient tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event. Researchers found that the potato inherited a crucial gene from the tomato that enables the formation of starch-rich tubers. This gene, combined with another from a wild potato species, created the vegetable known today. By analyzing hundreds of genomes from both wild and cultivated potatoes, scientists believe they have finally solved the long-standing puzzle of the potato's origins, highlighting how inter-species breeding can generate new traits.</p>

These tankers engage in ship-to-ship transfers in international waters, often with their identification transponders turned off to avoid detection. The trade, which primarily occurs off the coast of Malaysia, is estimated to have generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, propping up its regime and funding its nuclear program.

          <p>In a landmark federal trial, plaintiffs are seeking $345 million in damages from Tesla over a 2019 crash in Florida that resulted in a fatality. The lawsuit alleges that the company's Autopilot system has dangerous defects and was marketed with false statements that encouraged driver over-reliance. The crash occurred when a Model S owner, believing Autopilot would brake for obstacles, accelerated through an intersection, killing one person and severely injuring another. Tesla's defense argues that driver error was the cause and that a verdict against the company would stifle life-saving technological development.</p>

          <p>Two senior U.S. officials, special envoy Steve Witkoff and ambassador Mike Huckabee, are scheduled to make a highly unusual visit to a food distribution site in Gaza. The visit reflects growing American concern over the severe humanitarian crisis, which aid workers have described as a "politically manmade famine." President Trump has expressed frustration that aid is not reaching Palestinians, blaming Hamas for stealing supplies, though U.S. analysis has not found evidence of systemic theft. The visit comes as international pressure mounts on Israel to allow more aid into the territory.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected second-quarter revenue and profit, with sales rising 13% to $167.7 billion. However, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading due to investor disappointment with the modest revenue beat from its cloud unit, AWS, and a mixed forecast for the third quarter. While AWS growth of 18% was solid, it trailed the performance of rivals Microsoft and Google. CEO Andy Jassy noted that the primary constraint on further AI-driven growth is access to power, a challenge that will take several quarters to resolve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing trend among teenagers using caffeine pouches, which deliver a rapid stimulant hit when placed in the mouth, is causing concern among health experts. These small, discreet pouches can contain as much caffeine as two cups of coffee, and their use is being promoted by some social media influencers. Experts worry that young people have a lower tolerance for caffeine and could easily consume too much, leading to adverse effects like rapid heart rate and anxiety. The trend raises concerns about normalizing stimulant use and the potential for dependency among adolescents.</p>

          <p>The White House has formalized a significant shift in U.S. trade policy, issuing an executive order that sets new tariff rates for dozens of countries and hikes duties on Canada to 35%. While the Canadian tariff is effective immediately, most other nations are granted a seven-day grace period before rates ranging from 10% to 41% are applied. The order also establishes a new 40% tariff on any goods found to be transshipped to evade duties, a move that significantly alters the global trade landscape and introduces considerable uncertainty for importers.

          <p>The mosquito-borne illness Chikungunya is experiencing a surge in China, with over 5,000 cases reported since last month, primarily in the southern Guangdong province. This has prompted the U.S. CDC to consider issuing a travel notice for the country. The Chikungunya virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and most commonly causes fever and severe joint pain, though symptoms can also include headaches, muscle pain, and rashes. While the disease is rarely fatal, the joint pain can be debilitating and persist for months or even years in some patients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two major economic engines in China's southern Guangdong province, are reporting underperforming GDP growth, signaling a potential slowdown. Analysts attribute the trend to a combination of weakening global demand, which has hurt exports, and a domestic property downturn that has dampened investment. In Shenzhen, fixed-asset investment dropped nearly 11% and real estate development fell over 15%, reflecting poor investor confidence. The simultaneous slowdown in these critical hubs has prompted calls for stronger government action to revive business activity and stimulate domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

In a social media post, the 44-year-old singer explained that the diagnosis helped him understand the severe nerve pain and fatigue he was experiencing on stage. He chose to continue the tour to demonstrate his mental tenacity despite the physical challenges.

          <p>Social media companies like X and Reddit are blocking a wide range of content for UK users who have not verified their age, in an effort to comply with the new Online Safety Act. While the law targets harmful material like pornography and content promoting self-harm, an investigation found that posts about the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and even parliamentary debates, are being restricted. Experts warn that companies, fearing large fines, may be over-applying the law and stifling legitimate public debate, raising concerns about the act's impact on freedom of speech.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that its main civil service internship scheme for university students will be exclusively available to those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves. Eligibility will be determined by parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will also be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program for Whitehall. The move is part of a broader effort to increase working-class representation in government and diversify its talent pool.</p>
