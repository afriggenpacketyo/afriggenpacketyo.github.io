        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla shares experienced a 4% drop following Elon Musk's strong opposition to President Trump's spending bill, a notable shift from his previous stance during his time as part of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Musk has threatened to challenge lawmakers supporting the bill, labeling it an "abomination." This decline contrasts with Tesla's 22% rally in May, despite facing weak sales figures. Walter Isaacson, Musk's biographer, noted that Musk's strong convictions often lead him to take decisive and outspoken positions on issues he cares about, which is evident in his recent criticism. The stock is down more than 20% this year. Optimism surrounding Tesla's stability is currently wavering.</p>

          <p>This article explores the pressure and expectations surrounding the concept of having a "best friend," particularly among young people. While close friendships offer numerous benefits, the article emphasizes that kids don't necessarily need a single best friend to thrive. Instead, having a diverse network of supportive friends, each fulfilling different needs, can be just as valuable. Experts suggest focusing on building a repertoire of reliable individuals rather than fixating on the label of "best friend," as different friends can provide support in various aspects of life. The article encourages a broader understanding of friendship, emphasizing the importance of reliable connections over rigid definitions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's freeze on $114.5 million in funding for the USAID Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Program threatens the delivery of nearly a billion dollars' worth of donated medicines. This program, recognized as a cost-effective intervention in global health, relies on partnerships with pharmaceutical companies that donate drugs, with USAID covering distribution costs. Advocates fear that the funding freeze could lead to a collapse in the NTD donor space, potentially halting drug production and reversing progress made in eliminating these diseases. The USAID NTD Program has delivered over 3.3 billion treatments to more than 1.7 billion people, helping 14 countries eliminate at least one NTD.</p>

          <p>Senator Joni Ernst faced criticism after responding to a constituent's concern about Medicaid cuts by stating, "Well, we all are going to die." The remark was made during a town hall meeting in Iowa, prompting backlash for its perceived insensitivity to the potential consequences of healthcare policies. Ernst later issued an apology video, filmed in a cemetery, but doubled down on her stance, linking her position to Christian values. This incident highlights the current political climate where apologies are often avoided, and controversial statements are sometimes reinforced with appeals to religious beliefs. The controversy underscores the heated debate surrounding healthcare access and the role of government.</p>

          <p>President Trump has enacted a new travel ban impacting 12 countries, with a significant focus on African nations, citing national security concerns. Seven of the affected countries are in Africa, including Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan. The order prohibits entry for individuals from these nations, while also imposing restrictions on nationals from Burundi, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba, Laos, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Trump stated the measures aim to protect Americans from foreign threats, but critics argue the ban is discriminatory, while Somalia pledged to work with the U.S. to address security issues.

          <p>Imports to the United States experienced a significant decline in April, reflecting the impact of tariffs on international trade.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson delivered the opinion, stating that Ames had been unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled against Mexico in its lawsuit against American gun manufacturers, shielding the companies from liability for the illegal trafficking of firearms to drug cartels. The court overturned a lower court decision that had allowed the lawsuit to proceed, citing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which generally protects gun companies from liability for crimes committed with their products. Mexico had argued that the companies deliberately maintained a distribution system that facilitated gun sales to cartels.

          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's new travel ban appears designed to avoid the legal pitfalls that plagued his initial attempt during his first term. The revised ban, impacting 12 countries, includes more clearly defined exemptions and is wider in scope than its predecessor. While similarities exist in the countries targeted, the new order does not explicitly target Muslim-majority nations, addressing a key criticism of the original ban. Legal experts note the revised ban is more legally robust and likely to withstand court challenges, drawing lessons from the previous legal battles.</p>

The accelerated snowmelt, coupled with staffing and budget cuts initiated by the Trump administration, creates a dangerous scenario. Flash flood warnings have been issued, and lower-elevation areas are already snow-free, the earliest on record. Federal fire crews are short-staffed due to retirements and budget constraints, potentially overwhelming incident management teams.

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has implemented its eighth interest rate cut in the past year, reflecting concerns about the impact of the ongoing trade war on the European economy. This move extends the ECB's divergence from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has maintained steady interest rates since the end of last year. The rate cut aims to stimulate economic activity in the Eurozone, but it also highlights the challenges faced by the region due to global trade tensions and economic uncertainty. The decision underscores the ECB's commitment to supporting economic growth despite external pressures.</p>

The ban, set to take effect on June 9, impacts legal immigrants and those with temporary visas from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and several other countries. Exemptions exist for U.S. permanent residents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens, and athletes participating in major sporting events. The administration based the decision on factors including terrorist presence, visa security failures, and high rates of visa overstays.

          <p>This article examines how tariffs could affect the prices of goods like shoes and sweaters, particularly those imported from China and Vietnam. Retail consultancy AlixPartners created pricing models to estimate the potential price increases under President Trump's tariff proposals. The models show that tariffs could raise the price of a men's cotton sweater and a pair of men's shoes made in China by about 19% under current tariffs and up to 90% under a 145% tariff. Retailers are exploring strategies to offset these costs, but consumers may still see significant price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

Justice Elena Kagan stated that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gun manufacturers aided and abetted unlawful sales. Mexico argued that U.S. gunmakers turned a blind eye to the illegal trafficking of high-powered weapons. The gun industry countered that every sale by a licensed retailer is approved by the federal government and requires a background check. The Supreme Court agreed with the gun industry, ending Mexico's attempt to hold U.S. companies accountable for gun violence in Mexico.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, a drug commonly used for medication abortions. The review comes amid concerns about the drug's safety, fueled by a report from an advocacy group. Mifepristone was initially approved by the FDA in 2000, and periodic reviews have not identified new safety concerns. Experts argue that concerns about the drug's safety are misguided and that the review may be influenced by political factors. Medication abortions account for more than half of all abortions in the United States.</p>

While some presidents have been secretive about its use, the autopen has become a standard tool for signing high volumes of letters and certificates.
