          <p>Chinese tech firm Baidu saw its Hong Kong shares soar after announcing a significant AI partnership with state-owned China Merchants Group. The collaboration will focus on applying large language models and "digital employees" to real-world business scenarios. To further its AI ambitions and reduce reliance on foreign chips, Baidu also launched a $56.2 million offshore bond offering, signaling what analysts call an "all-in AI pivot" for the company. The move aims to secure a competitive edge in China's burgeoning AI sector.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has rejected Erik and Lyle Menendez's request for a new trial, ruling that their newly presented evidence was not compelling enough to have altered the original verdict. The brothers, who are serving life sentences for the 1989 murders of their parents, submitted a letter and a declaration from a former bandmate of their father to support their claims of sexual abuse. The judge stated the evidence was not "particularly strong" and did not add significantly to what the jury had already considered during the initial trial.</p>

          <p>National Public Radio is preparing a balanced budget for the upcoming fiscal year but plans to trim over $5 million in response to the recent congressional vote to end all federal funding for public media. While listener contributions have increased, the financial future for many local member stations remains uncertain, with some already announcing layoffs or dropping their NPR affiliation. NPR CEO Katherine Maher is offering $8 million in fee relief to the hardest-hit stations, but many, like those in Florida, argue it's insufficient to prevent programming cuts.</p>

          <p>The massive Yiwu wholesale market, known as the "world's supermarket," is experiencing a noticeable shift in its customer base, mirroring a broader Chinese economic pivot away from the United States. U.S.-China trade tensions and tariffs have led to a decline in American buyers, with merchants now catering more to customers from the Middle East, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. This trend is reflected in national data, which shows China's exports to the U.S. have dropped while shipments to emerging markets have surged, though often for lower profit margins.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times, accusing the newspaper of publishing "false and defamatory" content about him. Following the filing, Trump stated on his social media platform that he intends to stop the "radical left media" from "destroying" the country. A spokesperson for the Times dismissed the lawsuit as meritless and an attempt to stifle independent reporting through intimidation tactics. This legal action is the latest in a series of multibillion-dollar lawsuits the president has launched against major U.S. media outlets.</p>

          <p>A man from Norfolk, UK, has waived his anonymity to share his story of bringing his attacker to justice two decades after he was sexually assaulted in 2004. Dan Cooper, now 39, said serving on a jury in an unrelated case in 2018 inspired him to re-report the crime to the police. His attacker was convicted of two counts of sexual assault and one count of assault by penetration and sentenced to eight years in prison. Cooper, who was diagnosed with complex PTSD, now shares his experience on social media to help other survivors.</p>

          <p>House Republican leadership has introduced a short-term continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown, aiming to fund federal agencies at current levels until November 21. The proposed bill also includes additional funding for lawmaker security in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The measure faces an uncertain path, as Democratic leaders have criticized it for failing to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies and are pushing for bipartisan negotiations. Securing passage before the September 30 deadline will be challenging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A number of landlords in the UK are selling their rental properties in anticipation of the new Renters' Rights Bill, which will introduce significant changes to the private rental sector. The legislation aims to ban "no-fault" evictions, give tenants more power to challenge rent increases, and make it illegal to discriminate against those on benefits. While renters' unions have welcomed the changes for providing greater security, some landlords express concern that the new rules will make it harder to manage their properties, potentially contracting the rental market and pushing rents higher.</p>

In previous major parades in 2015 and 2019, dozens of generals marched alongside their soldiers, a move that was officially described as setting an example and also provided a rare glimpse into the People's Liberation Army's leadership. The lack of senior commanders in this year's event has led to speculation and analysis regarding potential shifts in PLA protocol, political messaging, or personnel changes within China's opaque military structure.</p>
