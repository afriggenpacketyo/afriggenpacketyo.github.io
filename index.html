          <p>The Trump administration has officially announced plans to impose steep tariffs on imports from at least 14 countries, set to take effect on August 1. The new rates include a 25% tariff on goods from Japan and South Korea, and up to 40% on imports from Laos and Myanmar. This move follows a 90-day pause on previously announced tariffs, and the administration has warned against retaliatory measures from the affected nations. The announcement caused US financial markets to decline, reflecting concerns over potential trade disruptions and the failure to secure new trade deals as previously suggested.

          <p>Tesla's stock price dropped by 6.8% after CEO Elon Musk announced the formation of a new political entity, the "America Party," over the weekend. The move, which followed a public disagreement with President Trump over a major policy bill, has renewed investor concerns about Musk's political activities distracting from the company's operations. Analysts suggest that Musk's deeper dive into politics is viewed negatively by shareholders, especially as Tesla faces challenges like declining sales in key markets. The announcement comes at a critical time for the electric vehicle manufacturer as it navigates a competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a local environmental group is tackling the "Urban Heat Island" effect with an innovative "cool block" project. The initiative uses solutions like planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat and lower temperatures in a densely developed neighborhood. This urban laboratory, a partnership with the city, aims to provide a life-saving template for other cities as climate change intensifies heat waves. Researchers are studying the project's effectiveness, noting that such green infrastructure can significantly reduce peak urban temperatures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced it will remove the Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from its list of foreign terrorist organizations. This decision comes months after the group's leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, led an offensive that overthrew the Assad regime and established a new interim government in Syria. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited the new government's positive actions and commitment to combating terrorism as the reason for the change. The move follows President Trump's earlier decision to lift sanctions on Syria, signaling a significant shift in U.S. policy toward the war-torn nation.</p>

The plaintiffs argue this guidance contradicts scientific evidence showing pregnant women are at high risk from the virus and undermines public trust in science.

          <p>After five consecutive weeks of decline, average 30-year mortgage rates have dipped, offering a slight reprieve for prospective homebuyers. However, whether this downward trend will persist through July remains uncertain. The future direction of rates will likely be influenced by the upcoming inflation report and signals from the Federal Reserve, which has so far kept its key interest rate paused. Experts suggest that lenders may begin adjusting their rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts, even if none are imminent. Potential buyers are advised to monitor the market closely to capitalize on any brief opportunities for lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For individuals facing aggressive debt collection, wage garnishment is a serious possibility that can last until a debt is fully paid, which could take years. The duration and amount of garnishment depend on the type of debt and state laws, with federal law generally capping it at 25% of disposable income for consumer debts. Debts like federal student loans and back taxes operate under different, often stricter, rules that don't always require a court order. This article outlines the process and explains potential options for stopping or reducing garnishment, such as challenging it in court or negotiating with the creditor.</p>

          <p>As it faces a September 17 deadline to sell its U.S. operations or face a ban, TikTok is reportedly planning to release a new, separate app for its American users. This move is seen as an attempt to address national security concerns raised by U.S. officials over the company's Chinese ownership by ByteDance. The new app could launch as early as September, with the existing app eventually being phased out for U.S. users. This strategy unfolds as potential buyers, including Oracle and Amazon, are considered for an acquisition that would require approval from both the U.S. and Chinese governments.</p>

          <p>AI-focused cloud provider CoreWeave has announced it will acquire data center infrastructure company Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion. The deal is expected to significantly expand CoreWeave's access to power and real estate, giving it ownership of Core Scientific's U.S. data center footprint. CoreWeave, which went public in March, stated the acquisition will enhance operating efficiency and eliminate future lease obligations. The move allows CoreWeave to either convert Core Scientific's cryptocurrency mining sites for AI workloads or divest them, strengthening its competitive position against major cloud providers.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, has become the target of a barrage of racist, anti-immigrant, and Islamophobic attacks from politicians and pundits across the country. This article analyzes the rhetoric, which includes calls for his deportation despite his U.S. citizenship, and connects it to the normalization of hate speech in the Trump era. The piece argues that the attacks are fueled by Mamdani's Muslim background and his vocal support for Palestinian rights, which is often conflated with antisemitism. The author suggests this bigotry is likely to intensify as the election approaches.</p>

          <p>A new tax law, part of President Trump's "one big beautiful bill," includes an additional $6,000 deduction for seniors, but tax experts say it will not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. This contradicts a recent, potentially misleading communication from the Social Security Administration. The deduction, which is income-dependent, will primarily benefit middle-income seniors by reducing their adjusted gross income, which may in turn lower the portion of their benefits subject to tax. However, it does not change the underlying formula for taxing benefits and is projected to slightly worsen Social Security's long-term funding shortfall. (not investment advice)</p>

This "road trip" is a key step for Waymo as it evaluates new locations for its paid ride-hailing service, Waymo One.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly defended Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt, calling the prosecution a "WITCH HUNT." In a social media post, Trump praised Bolsonaro as a strong leader and urged authorities to "LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE." The comments prompted a sharp response from Brazil's current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who stated that his sovereign nation would not accept foreign interference and that no one is above the law. The exchange highlights the ongoing political tensions in Brazil and Trump's alignment with right-wing populist leaders.</p>

The education secretary's plans, which may alter the system of Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs), have already caused anxiety among rights groups and MPs. The article argues for a more consultative, transparent, and less rushed process to build consensus and trust, which has been eroded by past policy failures. It also highlights the severe financial strain on local councils from rising SEND costs, suggesting a need for national funding reform.</p>

It recounts a typical workday using exaggerated, trend-focused language, rebranding sleep as a "Microdeath" and a lunch break as a "Microvacation." The piece playfully mocks terms like "quiet quitting" by describing normal activities such as breathing ("Lung Bathing") and using the restroom ("Microspa") as new, alarming phenomena. Through its witty narrative, the article highlights the absurdity of over-analyzing and pathologizing the routine actions of younger employees in the workforce.</p>
