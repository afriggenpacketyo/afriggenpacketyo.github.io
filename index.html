          <h2>NBA Sponsorship Revenue Sees Significant Increase Due to Jersey Patches and New Stadium</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 09:32:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA teams have experienced an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue, reaching $1.62 billion this season, driven largely by the introduction of sponsor patches on team jerseys and the opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. Jersey patch deals, which have become increasingly popular since their introduction in 2017, more than doubled year over year, contributing significantly to the league's revenue. The Intuit Dome's opening also added substantial sponsorship revenue, equivalent to adding three new teams to the league in terms of revenue generation. Brands in construction, alcohol, and technology sectors have shown the most growth in NBA sponsorships, with Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase leading in spending. Optimism is moderate given the continued financial growth of the NBA.</p>

Approved users can access websites like Google and Wikipedia without additional costs, aiming to boost Hainan's ambition to become a global free-trade port.

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Thursday amid an ongoing trade war between the two countries, according to Chinese state media. The call, initiated by Trump, follows accusations from both sides regarding violations of a previous agreement to roll back tariff rates. White House officials indicated that the discussion would address concerns about slow-rolled export licenses for rare earth materials, while Chinese leaders have expressed worries about U.S. restrictions on tech exports and student visas. This conversation is a significant development as both nations attempt to navigate their complex trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Proposed tariffs by President Donald Trump could substantially raise the prices of goods like clothing and shoes imported from China and Vietnam, according to pricing models created by AlixPartners. Under a current 30% tariff, the price of a men's cotton sweater and shoes made in China could increase by about 19%, while a suspended 145% tariff could cause prices to spike by roughly 90%. Similarly, current and proposed tariffs on goods from Vietnam could raise prices by 8% and 35%, respectively. Retailers are exploring strategies to offset these costs, but consumers could still face significant price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

Silver's rally has closed some of the gap between the two precious metals, as silver has both industrial uses and is considered a defensive investment.

Women are urged to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, and to consult with their healthcare provider about the risks and benefits.

          <p>Harvard University has condemned President Donald Trump's proclamation to block foreign students from attending the university as another "illegal retaliatory step." Trump's proclamation, citing the Immigration and Nationality Act, prohibits noncitizens from entering the U.S. to study at Harvard for at least six months, arguing that the institution is no longer a trustworthy steward of international students. The proclamation also directs the secretary of state to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already in the U.S. to study at Harvard.

          <p>Older Americans are filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, possibly driven by growing anxiety about the system's stability amid cutbacks under the Trump administration. The number of people claiming Social Security jumped 17% through May compared to last year, with new filings on track to reach 4 million for the federal fiscal year. Concerns stem from staffing cuts at the Social Security Administration and fears about the program's long-term solvency, with the trust fund projected to be depleted by 2035. While claiming early may seem prudent to some, it results in a permanently lower monthly benefit.</p>
