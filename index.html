          <p>A second individual has been arrested in Miami in connection with the theft of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's purse, which occurred while she was dining with her family on Easter. The suspect is believed to be an accomplice to Mario Bustamante Leiva, an illegally present Chilean national already in custody, who is suspected of a series of similar thefts in the D.C. area. Noem expressed gratitude to law enforcement for their swift action, while authorities emphasize that the theft appears to be opportunistic rather than targeted, motivated by the value of the bag itself, which contained cash, identification, and personal items.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations flared up in Brooklyn near the Edmond J. Safra Synagogue, where a pro-Palestinian protest clashed with both police and counter-protesters. The unrest occurred amid the expected visit of Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, whose scheduled talk at a nearby synagogue was eventually canceled. As tensions escalated, at least six individuals were taken into custody, though their affiliations remained unclear. This event follows several days of heightened demonstrations sparked by Ben-Gvir's presence, creating friction between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel groups, particularly in Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish communities.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reveals that global military expenditure surged to a record $2.7 trillion in 2024, marking a 9.4% increase from the previous year and the fastest annual rise since the end of the Cold War. The surge is primarily driven by the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, with significant increases in military spending observed in Europe and the Middle East. Germany has become the fourth-largest military spender worldwide due to a special fund for its armed forces, and the US continues to lead in military investments, focusing on modernizing its capabilities and nuclear arsenal.</p>

          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks discovered off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which sank in 1710. Marine archaeologists from Denmark's National Museum confirmed the ships' identities through investigations of ship timbers, bricks, and clay pipes found during underwater excavations. The Fridericus Quartus was set on fire, while the Christianus Quintus was wrecked in the surf, revealing a tragic chapter in Denmark's history of transatlantic slave trade, which was banned in 1792 but not abolished until 1847.</p>

          <p>A letter written by Titanic survivor Col. Archibald Gracie days before the ship sank has sold at auction for nearly $400,000. Gracie's letter contained a prescient line about withholding judgment on the ship until the end of the journey, making it a highly prized artifact. Gracie survived the sinking by climbing onto an overturned lifeboat and later wrote a book about the disaster, but died less than eight months later due to complications from the shipwreck.</p>

          <p>Despite reaching the FA Cup final, Manchester City's Pep Guardiola dismissed suggestions of a successful season, emphasizing that the Premier League title is the primary measure of success. Guardiola stated that the club needs to make the right decisions for the next season. One player, Rico Lewis, believes his side are now moving in the right direction after their faltering mid-season form proved costly in domestic and European competitions.</p>
