          <p>According to sources, the acting director of FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly told staff he was unaware that hurricane season had begun during a meeting. Hurricane season officially starts on June 1st and lasts until November 30th. A DHS spokesperson stated that Richardson was joking and that FEMA is focused on disaster response and protecting the American people. The advisory council was established by President Donald Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and Richardson is sticking with the old plan not to get in the way of the FEMA advisory council.</p>

          <p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has claimed responsibility for a new attack on Russia's Kerch Strait Bridge, asserting that its agents mined the supports, causing severe damage without civilian casualties. This operation, which reportedly lasted several months, involved 1,100 kg of explosives in TNT equivalent. SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk stated this action continues their tradition of targeting the bridge, following previous strikes in 2022 and 2023. The claim comes as Russia continues long-range attacks on multiple Ukrainian cities, resulting in at least seven deaths and 27 injuries, while peace talks between the two nations show little progress.</p>

          <p>A multi-billion pound project to build a railway line between Oxford and Cambridge has sparked anger as it is classified as an 'England and Wales' project, despite no tracks being laid in Wales. This classification means Wales will not benefit from extra funding, leading to accusations of being denied millions for its own rail network. Politicians argue this is similar to the HS2 situation, where Wales received no extra cash despite it being classified as an England and Wales project. The UK government maintains that its rail network enhancements pipeline is funding projects in Wales, but critics argue the funding formula is unfair and needs fixing.</p>

The search, prompted by German prosecutors, spans 21 plots of land between the resort where Madeleine disappeared and the location where the prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, was staying at the time. BrÃ¼ckner, currently imprisoned in Germany for a separate sexual assault case, has been named a formal suspect in Madeleine's disappearance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millennials are entering their 40s, redefining the traditional midlife crisis with a focus on personal growth and opportunity rather than the stereotypical abandonment of family and pursuit of fleeting pleasures. Unlike previous generations, millennials often lack the financial stability to drastically alter their lives, leading them to seek fulfillment through career changes, fitness journeys, and self-discovery. Factors like economic instability and the influence of social media contribute to a sense of uncertainty, but many millennials find support in their communities and embrace the ongoing journey of self-improvement. This generation is learning to accept that their lives may not mirror those of their parents and are finding new ways to make the most of their remaining years.</p>

While Lee had shifted to the political center, he is expected to pursue a more left-leaning agenda, focusing on economic revival and tariff negotiations with the U.S.</p>

The court rejected these arguments, stating insufficient evidence of a violation. Had the BSW surpassed the 5% hurdle, the new coalition government's majority would have been jeopardized.</p>

          <h2>Senate Republicans Clash Over Debt Impact of Trump's Funding Bill</h2>

          <p>As the Senate prepares to consider President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, some Republican senators are raising concerns about its potential impact on the national debt. Deficit hawks like Rand Paul and Ron Johnson are pushing for deeper cuts than those in the House-passed bill, which they argue still adds trillions to the debt. This puts them at odds with the White House, which claims the legislation will save $1.6 trillion over 10 years. Speaker Mike Johnson, who guided the bill through the House, insists it will not add to the debt, but faces challenges from both fiscal hard-liners and moderates.</p>

          <p>A sandwich shop employee in Navarre, Florida, is being praised for helping authorities rescue a domestic violence victim who had allegedly been kidnapped. Eleanor Coffee, working at Jersey Mike's, discovered a note in the bathroom pleading for help with a woman's name, phone number, and address. Coffee alerted her manager and the sheriff's office, leading to the arrest of Jordan Williams, the woman's boyfriend, on charges including kidnapping and aggravated assault.

          <p>The Trump administration is leveraging the immigration status of the suspect in the Colorado attack on an Israeli hostage rally to promote its deportation agenda. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national who overstayed his tourist visa, is accused of attacking the event specifically to target Zionists. Right-wing figures are using the incident to call for increased deportations and stricter border controls, contrasting with their reactions to attacks against Palestinians and Muslims. The administration's response highlights the intersection of anti-Israel sentiment and illegal immigration in right-wing rhetoric.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores the concept of modern feudalism, arguing that the increasing privatization of public services is leading to a society where power and wealth are concentrated in private hands. Drawing parallels to the Middle Ages, the author discusses how essential functions like security, law enforcement, and even the control of money are being outsourced to private entities. This trend erodes public control and accountability, creating a system where a small elite governs a large population relegated to service jobs. The article cites examples such as private military companies, gated communities, and the privatization of prisons as evidence of this shift.</p>
