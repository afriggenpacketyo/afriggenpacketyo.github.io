          <p>In a recent court filing, the Trump administration has denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, contradicting earlier reports and public statements by White House officials. Previously, adviser Stephen Miller had mentioned a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The new filing, part of a lawsuit in California, states that no such numerical target has been officially issued as policy to DHS or ICE. This discrepancy has drawn scrutiny, though the White House maintains its commitment to enforcing federal immigration laws and large-scale deportations.</p>

          <p>A small 3.0 magnitude earthquake, centered near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the New York City area on Saturday night. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the minor quake caused brief shaking but resulted in no significant damage or injuries. Residents described the event as startling, with some comparing the sound and vibration to a vehicle collision. This tremor follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that hit the region in April 2024, with officials noting that while infrequent, such seismic activity is not entirely unexpected on the East Coast.</p>

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union stated that the proposal was insufficient and did not adequately reflect the skill and dedication of its members. The workers, who assemble fighter jets and the MQ-25 refueling drone, will begin their strike at midnight on Monday. This marks the first strike at Boeing's St. Louis defense hub since 1996, occurring as the division expands its manufacturing facilities for a new Air Force fighter jet.</p>

          <p>Florida has unexpectedly surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy installations, driven primarily by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop panels. This growth is attributed to streamlined state regulations for projects under 75 megawatts and the increasing cost-effectiveness of solar compared to natural gas. However, the future of this boom faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing grid constraints, which require significant investment in storage and infrastructure. The success of solar-powered communities like Babcock Ranch, which withstood Hurricane Ian, highlights the potential for energy resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix, closing the championship gap with his teammate Oscar Piastri to just nine points. The victory was Norris's third in the last four races, but it came after a difficult start where he dropped to fifth place on the first lap. A strategic switch to a one-stop tire strategy proved successful, allowing him to recover and ultimately take the win. Norris acknowledged he is not making the title fight easy for himself and aims to improve in the second half of the season after the summer break.</p>

          <p>The final Test between England and India is set for a tense conclusion on its last day, with England needing 35 more runs and India needing four wickets to secure the series. A dramatic fourth day saw England, chasing a record 374, reach 339-6 before rain and bad light stopped play. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position, but a late surge from India's bowlers shifted the momentum, creating a knife-edge scenario. The outcome of this single session of play will decide if England wins the series 3-1 or if India draws it 2-2.</p>

The firing has been condemned as a dangerous precedent that politicizes a neutral government agency, with some calling it an authoritarian tactic to control economic narratives.

          <p>New Mexico's Democratic Governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, has stated that new federal requirements for Medicaid are practically impossible to implement. Speaking on Face the Nation, she argued that the changes, part of President Trump's recent legislation, create excessive paperwork and will ultimately harm healthcare access, particularly in rural areas. While acknowledging her state is in a good financial position to temporarily absorb some costs, she warned the long-term loss of federal funding would be catastrophic, leading to hospital closures and a collapse of local economies. She called the $50 billion rural relief fund a token gesture.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, after being struck by a boat on Saturday afternoon. The collision nearly capsized the vessel and threw a passenger overboard, who was reportedly unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was spotted resting on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions and the need for heavy equipment, the carcass will be moved on Monday for a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death.

While Canada faces a 35% U.S. tariff rate, nearly 90% of its exports remain duty-free under the existing CUSMA/USMCA agreement, providing a buffer. Officials on both sides express a desire to reach a deal, but key issues surrounding tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos remain unresolved. (not investment advice)</p>
