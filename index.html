          <p>Max Verstappen secured victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, marking a return to form for the team. The race was overshadowed by a controversial decision from McLaren, who ordered Oscar Piastri to cede second place to his teammate Lando Norris. The order came after a slow pit stop for Norris, which had cost him the position he held for most of the race. While Piastri complied, he expressed his disagreement, sparking a debate about team strategy and fairness in the tight championship battle between the two McLaren drivers.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since her appointment, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett discussed her legal philosophy and new book. She pushed back against labels of the court shifting politically, stating she decides cases as they come without partisan considerations. Regarding the Dobbs decision, Barrett explained it returned the abortion issue to the democratic process within states, rather than making it illegal. She consistently declined to comment on pending legal questions about President Trump's executive authority, emphasizing the judicial need to approach cases with an open mind after reviewing all arguments.</p>

          <p>A Black man in South Carolina is advocating for the state to enact a hate crime law after he was the target of a racist attack. The man, Jarvis McKenzie, reported that a white man fired a rifle over his head and shouted racial slurs at him. South Carolina is one of only two states without a hate crime statute, although the local county has an ordinance that was used to charge the alleged attacker. The incident has renewed calls from advocates and business leaders for the state's Republican-led senate to pass a long-stalled bill that would impose stricter penalties for hate-motivated crimes.</p>

          <p>Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth strongly criticized President Trump's social media posts suggesting he would send troops to Chicago and rename the Department of Defense the "Department of War." In an interview, Duckworth labeled the president's rhetoric an unacceptable declaration of war on a major American city and stated such an order would be illegal. She confirmed that the Great Lakes naval base has only been asked to provide office space for ICE, not prepare for troops. Duckworth also condemned a recent U.S. military strike on an alleged drug boat in international waters, arguing it sets a dangerous precedent that could endanger American civilians.</p>

          <p>Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna are leading a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing all government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Massie stated that justice should not be avoided simply to prevent embarrassment for powerful individuals who may be implicated in the documents. Khanna expressed confidence that they have secured the 218 votes needed for a discharge petition, which would bring their bill directly to the House floor for a vote. They anticipate reaching the required signature threshold by the end of September, signaling a significant step toward public disclosure of the files.</p>

          <p>In an open commentary, Dr. Timothy Johnson, a longtime medical editor, has publicly pleaded with Senator Bill Cassidy to exercise his promised oversight of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Johnson cites Kennedy's recent firing of top CDC officials and a nearly $500 million cut to mRNA vaccine research as deeply concerning actions. He reminds Cassidy of his pledge to rebuff any attempts to undermine vaccine access without scientific evidence. Johnson, appealing to Cassidy as a fellow physician, urges him to use his committee's authority to intervene before the policy changes lead to unnecessarily lost lives.</p>

          <p>Four senior physicians have resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, citing deep concerns over the direction of U.S. public health policy under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The resignations follow the firing of the CDC's director and new recommendations restricting COVID vaccine eligibility for children and pregnant women, which the former officials say are not based on evidence. They warn that these actions are eroding trust in the CDC and could dismantle the nation's public health infrastructure, potentially leading to outbreaks of preventable diseases. The White House has maintained its full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership.</p>

In her new role, Baerbock will chair meetings and manage discussions among the 193 member states, acting as a behind-the-scenes unifier and honest broker. The nomination by Germany's previous government was not without controversy, as some critics felt a more experienced career diplomat should have been chosen for the post.</p>

          <p>An economic analysis suggests that while the Trump administration's elimination of the 'de minimis' tariff loophole will impact some small businesses, the broader panic may be misdirected. The rule, which affects imported goods valued under $800, primarily targets a fraction of the nation's small businesses, as the majority are service-based and do not rely on international goods. The author argues that the economy's ability to absorb the resulting price increases depends more on larger factors like employment and income levels. Therefore, overall economic health, which remains relatively strong, is a more critical indicator to watch than this specific policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

The majority of arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization under the Terrorism Act, after protesters gathered with signs to defy the ban. The government proscribed Palestine Action in July, making support for the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. While police reported that the protest turned violent, with 17 arrests for assaults on officers, organizers insisted the event was peaceful and accused the police of making false claims.</p>

Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling the baby, and ensuring the baby is well-fed and burped.

          <p>Over 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a deal for the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. The demonstrations, some of the largest in recent months, included impassioned pleas from the families of hostages who fear that an expanded military offensive will further endanger their loved ones. Despite growing domestic and international pressure, the Netanyahu government has shown no signs of ending the war, vowing to achieve total victory over Hamas and gain full control of the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as head coach of the University of North Carolina with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, Belichick addressed reports about his relationship with his former NFL team, the New England Patriots, confirming that he has banned their scouts from attending UNC practices. He stated that since he feels he is not welcome in the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome in his, indicating a clear deterioration in the relationship since his departure. The win provided a much-needed positive result for the Tar Heels after an embarrassing season-opening loss.</p>

          <p>London Underground staff have begun a five-day strike over pay and working conditions, causing significant disruption across the city's transport network. Members of the RMT union are demanding a 32-hour work week and are engaging in rolling action that will result in little to no service on most Tube lines through Thursday. Transport for London (TfL) has called the demand for a shorter week unaffordable, though it remains open to further talks. The Elizabeth line and Overground are still operating but are experiencing much higher passenger volumes, and a separate dispute will also halt DLR services on two days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's recent expansion of coal power capacity is not a reversal of its climate policy but a strategic move to support its massive renewable energy rollout. Despite adding record amounts of solar power, China faces challenges with grid stability and energy curtailment, where clean power is generated but cannot be used. Droughts have also reduced hydropower output. In this context, new coal plants act as a crucial backup or "shock absorber," ensuring the lights stay on during peak demand and giving grid operators the confidence to continue integrating unprecedented levels of wind and solar energy.</p>

          <p>This commentary criticizes the United States Tennis Association (USTA) for instructing broadcasters to avoid showing any crowd dissent against Donald Trump during the US Open final. The author argues the decision is a cowardly and hypocritical act of censorship that contradicts the tournament's brand of being rowdy and unfiltered. The article points out that the USTA has previously televised other disruptions, such as climate protests, without issue. By attempting to shield a politician from public disapproval, the USTA is sacrificing the event's authenticity and undermining the democratic expression of its audience, according to the author.</p>

          <p>The online marketplace Vinted, now a billion-dollar company, began with a common problem: too many clothes. In 2008, co-founder Milda Mitkutė needed to downsize her wardrobe before moving and, with friend Justas Janauskas, created a simple website to sell her unwanted items. The concept quickly gained popularity through word of mouth, expanding from Lithuania to Germany and beyond. Despite a near-disastrous period in 2016 after introducing a commission fee, the company recovered by scrapping the fee and investing in advertising. In 2019, Vinted became Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup, championing the second-hand clothing market.</p>

          <p>A new study of sauropod fossils from Brazil reveals that these giant, long-necked dinosaurs were afflicted with osteomyelitis, a destructive bone infection. Researchers found evidence of the disease, which is caused by bacteria or other pathogens, in the 80-million-year-old skeletons of six different individuals from the same site. The lesions on the bones showed no signs of healing, suggesting the infections were active at the time of death and may have been fatal. The findings indicate that the swampy, wet ecosystems preferred by sauropods may have been breeding grounds for pathogens that posed a significant threat to these massive creatures.</p>

This move coincides with the Trump administration considering the use of private contractors in a post-war Ukraine.

This comes as a new state law allows for time to be set aside for prayer and reading of religious texts. Critics point to Paxton's past actions, including a 2017 inquiry into a school for allowing Muslim students a space to pray, as evidence of a double standard that promotes Christianity over other faiths.

          <p>Former officials and housing finance experts have described the process used by the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to refer Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for a criminal mortgage fraud investigation as highly unusual and "bizarre." Typically, such investigations are handled by the agency's independent Office of Inspector General (OIG), not the director himself. The referral, made by Trump-appointee William Pulte, alleges Cook misrepresented her primary residence on mortgage applications. Critics suggest the move is politically motivated, designed to give President Trump a basis to fire Cook, and that it is unprecedented for a director to personally initiate such a referral.</p>

          <p>Political science experts suggest that President Trump's recent proposal to welcome more students from China should be viewed as a strategic negotiation tactic rather than a genuine policy shift. According to one analyst, the move is likely intended to create a more positive atmosphere ahead of a potential meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The overall political climate in the U.S. remains highly skeptical of China, and there are no signs that visa procedures will be streamlined. Therefore, Chinese students are cautioned against interpreting these comments as a fundamental change in U.S. policy toward them.</p>

          <p>The New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite eradicated from the U.S. decades ago, is making a comeback in Central America and approaching the U.S. border, posing a major threat to the American livestock industry. After a containment barrier in Panama failed, the fly has spread into Mexico, causing over a billion dollars in losses to its cattle industry. The U.S. is now investing millions to build sterile fly production facilities in Mexico and Texas to combat the spread, reviving the successful 20th-century eradication technique. However, experts warn that climate change and a scaled-up livestock industry present new challenges for controlling this devastating parasite.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has voiced concerns about the political "balance" of the UK's Labour cabinet following a major reshuffle prompted by Angela Rayner's resignation. Rayner stepped down as Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, triggering a contest for the separate role of deputy party leader. Burnham sees this contest as an opportunity to discuss the party's internal management and suggested someone from the north of England should be chosen to counter a London-centric focus. The reshuffle saw key appointments for David Lammy and Yvette Cooper, but also the removal of other figures like Lucy Powell.</p>
