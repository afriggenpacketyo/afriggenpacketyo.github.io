          <p>Sir Menzies "Ming" Campbell, the former leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats from 2006 to 2007, has passed away at the age of 84. Before his distinguished 28-year career as a Member of Parliament, he was an accomplished sprinter, holding the British 100m record and competing in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Remembered as a "Liberal giant," he was a prominent and principled critic of the Iraq War, serving as his party's foreign affairs spokesman for 14 years. His colleagues praised his wisdom, experience, and dedication to public service.</p>

He was charged with displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization in the UK, during a concert. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions was not obtained within the six-month statutory time limit. Following the ruling, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence advocacy for Gaza.</p>

The statement firmly opposes the establishment of foreign military bases in the region by countries responsible for the current situation in Afghanistan. The diplomatic response was prompted by Trump's remarks suggesting the U.S. intended to reclaim the former military base due to its strategic proximity to China's nuclear facilities. The four nations reiterated their commitment to supporting Afghanistan's peaceful reconstruction.</p>

          <p>New York Mets broadcaster Gary Cohen did not address or apologize for his recent on-air criticism of Chicago Cubs rookie Matt Shaw during his latest broadcast. Cohen had previously called Shaw's decision to miss a game to attend the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk "weird," sparking backlash from some fans. Shaw defended his decision, stating his connection with Kirk was through their shared Christian faith, which is a driving force in his life. Despite the controversy, Cohen made no mention of his past remarks while calling Shaw's at-bats in a subsequent game.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Faith in Housing Act, has been introduced in the U.S. Congress to help address the affordable housing crisis by allowing religious institutions to build homes on their land. The legislation would override restrictive local zoning laws that often prevent churches, synagogues, and mosques from developing their property for residential use. This "Yes in God's Backyard" (YIGBY) movement seeks to create a win-win situation, providing low-income housing while generating revenue for faith organizations facing declining membership. The bill follows similar state-level efforts, most notably in California.</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, health officials are warning of a potential rise in both flu and COVID-19 cases, creating confusion due to their overlapping symptoms. While the flu often presents suddenly with fever, aches, and exhaustion, COVID-19 symptoms have evolved and can now mimic a common cold, though a hoarse throat has become a hallmark of recent variants. Both viruses can cause serious illness, especially in vulnerable populations. Officials urge eligible individuals, including those over 65 and with underlying health conditions, to receive both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the risk of severe outcomes.</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power across Africa through its government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture. With branches in 49 African countries, these institutes offer language courses and scholarships, attracting many young Africans seeking career opportunities with Chinese companies. However, critics raise concerns about the institutes' role in promoting Beijing's political ideology and interfering with academic freedom at host universities. Experts argue this cultural expansion is intertwined with China's economic interests, including access to the continent's natural resources, and call for African nations to strengthen their own cultural funding.</p>

The hard surfaces of the bombs, including V-1 cruise missiles, have become artificial reefs, attracting crabs, sea anemones, and even starfish, which were observed directly on exposed TNT.

U.S. Coast Guard data shows that seizures in the region consist almost exclusively of cocaine and marijuana, with no recorded instances of fentanyl. Experts suggest the administration is using the fentanyl crisis as a pretext for extrajudicial killings of suspected traffickers and potentially as a prelude to broader military action against Venezuela or cartels in Mexico.

          <p>In an open letter to President Trump, a columnist reflects on his Catholic school upbringing and questions the president's recent embrace of religious rhetoric, including the "America Prays" initiative. The article juxtaposes several Bible verses emphasizing love, humility, and kindness with Trump's own public statements, which often feature insults, dismissiveness towards environmental stewardship, and hostility towards immigrants and political opponents. The author uses this contrast to challenge the sincerity of the president's professed faith. The piece concludes by suggesting that true piety requires actions consistent with religious teachings.</p>

          <p>George Retes Jr., a 25-year-old U.S. Army veteran, claims he is facing retaliation from the Department of Homeland Security after speaking out about his wrongful arrest during a major ICE raid in Camarillo, California. Retes, a contracted security guard, was arrested, pepper-sprayed, and jailed for three days without charges while trying to get to work. After he published an op-ed about his experience, DHS accused him of assaulting officers during the raid, a claim he denies and which appears to be contradicted by video evidence. His case raises concerns about government overreach and retribution against citizens.</p>

          <p>The 2026 race for Los Angeles County Sheriff is already intensifying, with six candidates officially challenging incumbent Robert Luna. The field includes former Sheriff Alex Villanueva, who lost to Luna in 2022 and is seeking a rematch, alongside other current and former law enforcement officials. Challengers are criticizing Luna's leadership as ineffective and lacking transparency, particularly regarding jail conditions and deputy gangs. Luna defends his record, arguing for stability as the region prepares to host the World Cup and Olympics, while political analysts note that unseating an incumbent is a significant challenge.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite campaign promises to lower electricity prices, President Trump's actions since taking office have consistently driven up energy costs. The administration has blocked new clean energy projects, which are the cheapest and fastest source of new power, by raising taxes and creating bureaucratic hurdles for wind and solar initiatives. Furthermore, new tariffs have increased the cost of materials like steel for all types of power plants, while policies supporting natural gas exports and subsidizing unprofitable coal plants further strain the domestic supply and increase utility bills. These moves undermine energy affordability and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sir Tony Blair, the former UK Prime Minister, has reportedly been involved in high-level discussions about leading a post-war transitional authority in Gaza. The proposal, said to have White House support, would see Blair head a UN-backed body with support from Gulf nations for approximately five years before returning control to Palestinians. Blair previously served as a Middle East envoy after leaving office in 2007. The discussions come as various international parties continue to table different proposals for the future governance and reconstruction of the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto is currently forecast to remain at sea, but meteorologists are monitoring its potential interaction with another nearby developing storm in the Atlantic. If the two systems get close enough, they could engage in a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two storms orbit a common center. Typically, a stronger storm absorbs a weaker one, but two storms of comparable strength can "dance" around each other before separating. While this interaction is considered unlikely, it could slightly alter the storms' predicted tracks as they move through the region.</p>
