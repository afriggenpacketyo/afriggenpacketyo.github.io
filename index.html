          <p>Over 300 Foreign Office staff who expressed concerns about the UK's potential complicity in Israel's actions in Gaza were advised to consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. A letter from senior civil servants to the signatories stated that resignation was an honorable course for those with deep disagreements. The staff had questioned the UK's continued arms sales and perceived disregard for international law by Israel, citing the civilian death toll and restrictions on aid. This response has sparked outrage among officials who feel the space for challenging policy is being further restricted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an 'unprecedented decline' in world fertility rates, with many people unable to have their desired number of children. A survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries revealed that one in five respondents have had or expect to have fewer children than they want, citing financial limitations and lack of suitable partners as key reasons. The report marks a shift in the UN's focus, as it has historically concentrated on women having more children than desired. The findings underscore a growing global trend of undershooting fertility ideals.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion to the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coastline. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes, with the Treasury hailing it as a landmark decision to kickstart economic growth. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized the investment's necessity for achieving a 'golden age of clean energy'. However, critics like Alison Downes from Stop Sizewell C argue that the government has not been transparent about the plant's total cost and that the funds could be better allocated elsewhere.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have seen a significant decline, particularly among Gen Z, with a 47% reduction in overdose risk. Data from the CDC shows that drug deaths among those under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this trend to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens. While the improvement is dramatic, researchers caution that sustaining this progress may be difficult, especially for those struggling with severe addiction.</p>

The defense argues that Read's vehicle never struck the victim, and that something else caused his injuries.

          <p>Los Angeles has been gripped by days of violent protests following immigration raids, prompting President Trump to deploy thousands of National Guard troops. The protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in Latino areas, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Demonstrations have been largely limited to downtown LA, where vehicles were set alight, and police have used riot gear and flash-bang grenades to control crowds. The deployment of the National Guard has been condemned by California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, who accuse Trump of escalating the situation.</p>
