          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has officially concluded that the 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible was caused by faulty engineering. The final report details how the carbon fiber composite pressure vessel contained multiple anomalies and failed to meet necessary strength and durability standards for its deep-sea dives to the Titanic wreckage. The investigation also found that operator OceanGate did not adequately test the vessel and misinterpreted real-time monitoring data, failing to recognize existing damage that should have removed the sub from service. This preventable tragedy resulted in the deaths of all five passengers aboard the craft.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed that he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, citing the need to counter drug trafficking and the alleged release of prisoners into the U.S. The move has been condemned by the Venezuelan government as a "warmongering" effort aimed at regime change. This confirmation comes as the Trump administration increases its military presence in the Caribbean, having conducted at least five airstrikes against suspected drug boats off the Venezuelan coast. Critics in the U.S. have raised concerns about the lack of congressional authorization for military force against drug traffickers in the region.</p>

          <p>Parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, have successfully raised over $125,000 to continue their legal fight against the local school district. A federal judge had ordered them to pay the substantial bond to cover the school district's potential attorney fees if their lawsuit fails. The case centers on their sons, who were suspended and found responsible for sexual harassment after they objected to a transgender classmate using the boys' locker room. Despite the unusual and high bond requirement, community and online donations, including a single $50,000 contribution, allowed the parents to meet the deadline and proceed with their case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will stop purchasing oil from Russia, although a specific timeline for the cessation was not provided. Trump framed the move as a significant step in isolating Moscow over its war in Ukraine, stating that it would make ending the conflict "much easier." India is one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, and its continued trade has been a point of friction in its relationship with Washington. The halt will reportedly be a gradual process, with India potentially resuming purchases after the war concludes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leading Chinese airlines, including Air China, have formally filed their opposition to a U.S. Department of Transportation proposal that would prohibit them from flying over Russian airspace on routes to the United States. The carriers argue that such a restriction would cause significant disruption and inconvenience for thousands of passengers, especially during the upcoming holiday season. Air China stated that at least 4,400 ticket holders for November and December would be affected and requested a 60-day grace period if the rule is implemented. This dispute highlights the escalating trade and geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of participating in on-field batting practice in an effort to break a significant postseason slump. The $700-million player, who typically avoids this public routine, has struggled at the plate, hitting just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts since the start of the playoffs. Manager Dave Roberts has expressed that the team cannot win the World Series with Ohtani performing at this level. Ohtani downplayed the idea that his dual role as a pitcher and hitter is contributing to his offensive struggles, instead focusing on improving his at-bats and swing decisions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came after the administration sent reduction-in-force notifications to over 4,000 employees, with the White House budget director suggesting the total could exceed 10,000. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" during a shutdown and cited President Trump's own social media posts as evidence that the cuts were intended to punish political opponents by targeting specific agencies.

Some legal experts argue this failure undermines the right to a fair trial by a jury of one's peers.

The motive remains unclear, though authorities cited a ChatGPT image he allegedly generated of a burning forest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new requirement for a $100,000 payment for each new H-1B visa is already causing significant disruption for small businesses and venture-backed startups in the U.S. Recruiters and entrepreneurs report that the high cost is slowing hiring and shrinking the available talent pool, particularly for highly specialized roles in fields like artificial intelligence. While the policy aims to prioritize American workers, it creates a major hurdle for new companies unable to afford the fee. As a result, some companies are intensifying efforts to upskill their existing workforce and build new talent pipelines from U.S. universities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of six foreign nationals for making incendiary social media comments following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The individuals, from six different countries, reportedly made posts suggesting Kirk deserved to be killed. A State Department official stated that the U.S. has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans and is continuing to identify other visa holders who celebrated the killing. This action is part of a broader crackdown on such comments and raises unresolved legal questions about the government's power to revoke visas based on speech.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK housing association chief executive has proposed a novel solution to the costly and controversial issue of housing asylum seekers in hotels. The plan suggests the government provide funds to councils and housing associations to purchase properties for the social housing stock, rather than paying private contractors for expensive hotel rooms. This would create new homes for existing social housing tenants, and the properties they vacate could then be used for asylum seekers at a fraction of the current cost. The proposal has reportedly been discussed with government departments as a potential way to meet the pledge of emptying all asylum hotels by 2029.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has asserted that federal regulation of artificial intelligence is essential, especially to protect children online, as individual states like California and Texas begin to enact their own laws. Speaking at the CNBC AI Summit, Blackburn emphasized the need for a federal standard to preempt a patchwork of state rules and to hold big tech platforms accountable. She highlighted her work on the Kid's Online Safety Act and other bills aimed at protecting consumer data privacy and preventing the unauthorized use of an individual's name, image, or likeness by AI models. Regulation, she argued, must focus on end-use applications rather than specific technologies.</p>

The claim asserts that instead of issuing warnings, the company misled regulators and consumers for decades.

In the aftermath of the disaster that killed 10 people and wiped out 95% of the town, residents chose to rebuild with a focus on green energy. Today, Greensburg derives 100% of its electricity from wind power, and many buildings feature solar panels and other sustainable designs. This approach has provided not only environmental benefits but also economic stability, with electricity costs remaining remarkably low and consistent over the past decade, inspiring some former residents to return.</p>
