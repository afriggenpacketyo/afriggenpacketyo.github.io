          <p>The United States' dependence on China for rare earth magnets is causing shortages, potentially leading to severe economic disruptions. The U.S. allowed its rare earth metals industry to relocate to China, leaving it vulnerable to supply limitations imposed by China. This situation highlights the strategic importance of rare earth elements in various industries and the risks associated with relying on a single foreign source for critical materials. The dependence raises concerns about national security and economic stability.</p>

          <p>South Korea's election is taking place under the shadow of martial law, with the leading opposition candidate, Lee Jae-myung, campaigning in a bullet-proof vest and behind bullet-proof glass. The election follows President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment after attempting a military takeover, creating a polarized and violent political environment. The ruling party's candidate, Kim Moon-soo, has struggled due to his association with Yoon, while Lee has positioned himself as the only candidate who can prevent future martial law attempts. This election offers an opportunity to steer South Korea back onto safer, more stable ground.</p>
