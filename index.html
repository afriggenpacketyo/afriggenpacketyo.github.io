          <p>Cash App has introduced "Pools," a new peer-to-peer group payment feature designed to simplify shared expenses and expand its user base. For the first time, the platform allows contributions from individuals using Apple Pay or Google Pay, opening up its services to non-Cash App users. This strategic move aims to re-energize user growth and enhance the app's social functionality, positioning it as a comprehensive financial operating system. The initiative, developed with internal AI tools, is part of Block's broader strategy to deepen peer-to-peer engagement and compete more effectively with rivals like Venmo, prioritizing network expansion over immediate revenue.

          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis has reinstated its financial guidance for the latter half of the year, projecting increased net revenues and improved industrial free cash flow. This comes despite reporting a significant first-half net loss of 2.3 billion euros, primarily attributed to a projected full-year tariff impact of 1.5 billion euros from U.S. duties on vehicles made in Canada and Mexico. New CEO Antonio Filosa acknowledged 2025 as a challenging but gradually improving year, stressing the need for "tough decisions" to re-establish profitable growth. The company seeks proper recognition from the U.S. administration regarding the high American content in its vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder following a tragic stabbing incident at a business in Bermondsey, south-east London. The attack resulted in the deaths of two men, aged 58 and 27, and left a third man in his 30s in a life-threatening condition. Police indicate the victims were known to each other, suggesting a targeted and isolated event, rather than random violence. The arrested suspect is also receiving hospital treatment for non-life-threatening injuries, as the local community expresses profound shock and unease over the unexpected and brutal daytime crime.</p>

          <p>With college tuition costs continuing to rise, many students encounter funding gaps that federal aid and scholarships cannot fully cover, prompting a turn to private student loans. The current student lending landscape is increasingly competitive, offering more flexible terms, borrower benefits, and specialized loans for diverse student populations, including undergraduates, graduate students, and international students. This article highlights top private lenders such as College Ave for flexible repayment, Sallie Mae for specialized programs, Ascent for no-cosigner loans, SoFi for member benefits, and MPOWER Financing for international students. It advises careful comparison of interest rates, repayment flexibility, and borrower benefits, while strongly recommending exhausting federal loan options first. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Destructive thunderstorms have swept across the Midwest, causing widespread power outages and property damage in states like South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa, with wind gusts exceeding 90 mph reported. Simultaneously, an extreme heat dome continues to affect the Southern U.S., placing over 165 million Americans under dangerous heat advisories and warnings, with "feels like" temperatures potentially reaching 116 degrees. This weather pattern, where a frontal boundary interacts with the heat dome, is generating severe storms and flash flooding risks. Additionally, air quality along the I-95 corridor is unhealthy due to pollution and wildfire smoke from Canada.</p>

Despite his claims, police have found no evidence of a traumatic brain injury or CTE in his background. The attack, which took place in a building housing NFL headquarters, appears to have been an attempt to target NFL employees, though the shooter mistakenly entered a different office.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares plummeted over 20% following the announcement of Maziar Mike Doustdar as its new CEO and a simultaneous reduction in its full-year financial guidance. The revised outlook stems from weaker growth projections for its highly successful obesity drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic within the crucial U.S. market. Factors cited include the continued use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-anticipated market expansion, and heightened competition. This marks the second guidance downgrade this year for the pharmaceutical giant, which has also contended with negative market sentiment due to disappointing trial results for its next-generation obesity drug candidate, CagriSema.

While Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin welcomed the conviction, he expressed disappointment that Ayyad remains at large and criticized the perceived leniency of sentences for other individuals convicted in the case. This ruling represents a significant development in the pursuit of justice for Rooney, who was the first Irish soldier killed on UN duty in Lebanon in over two decades.</p>

Although the company aims to mitigate most tariff effects through productivity measures, some costs will inevitably be transferred to consumers, who are currently characterized as "value-seeking."

Furthermore, the rate of new marriages among prime-age adults has shown an increase in recent years, suggesting a potential reversal of long-term declines. This resilience is partly attributed to marriage adapting to evolving societal norms, including greater male involvement in childcare.
