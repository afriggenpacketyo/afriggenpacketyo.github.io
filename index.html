          <p>The mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, is trailing his opponent in the Democratic primary runoff while facing federal bribery charges. Lumumba, along with two other officials, is accused of accepting payments from undercover FBI agents posing as real estate developers. Despite pleading not guilty and claiming a political prosecution, Lumumba faces an uphill battle for reelection as voters express a desire for change. The winner of the primary will advance to the general election in June.</p>

          <p>The European Union has fined Apple 500 million euros and Meta 200 million euros for violating the bloc's digital competition rules. Apple is penalized for preventing app makers from informing users about cheaper options outside the App Store, while Meta is fined for requiring Facebook and Instagram users to pay for ad-free versions, limiting their choice to freely consent to data use. Both companies plan to appeal, arguing that the EU is unfairly targeting American businesses. The fines were issued under the Digital Markets Act, designed to promote consumer choice and prevent Big Tech dominance.</p>

Firefighters are working to establish containment lines and conduct backfiring operations to control the blaze, which is currently only 10% contained.

          <p>The anti-abortion movement in the US is increasingly embracing more punitive measures, with some advocating for women who have abortions to be charged with homicide. This shift is driven by the rise of "abortion abolitionists" who believe that if a fetus is a person, abortion should be treated as murder. While such views remain unpopular with the majority of Americans, they are gaining traction in Republican-dominated state legislatures and could influence future legal challenges to abortion rights, particularly at the Supreme Court.</p>

While courts possess coercive powers like fines and imprisonment, their effectiveness relies on democratic cultural norms and public opinion. The article highlights historical examples where presidents complied with court rulings despite disagreement, emphasizing the importance of a shared commitment to constitutional democracy. The author suggests that clear directives from the courts and bipartisan condemnation from Congress are crucial to ensure executive branch compliance.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford believes it is unlikely he will play for Manchester United again under Ruben Amorim. Rashford has been playing for Aston Villa on loan since February and scored his fourth goal during their 2-1 loss at Manchester City on Tuesday. Rashford was exiled by Amorim from the first team in December. Sources close to the player do not see an obvious way back into the Old Trafford fold.</p>

          <p>Chinese autonomous-driving firm Pony.ai plans to expand its robotaxi services globally, leveraging lower production costs due to China's automotive industry leadership. The company's robotaxis are reportedly 20 to 30 percent cheaper than those of US rival Waymo. Pony.ai debuted its seventh-generation autonomous-driving system and showcased three mass production robotaxi models developed with Toyota Motor, BAIC Group, and GAC at the Shanghai Auto Show. Mass production of robotaxis is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of this year, with a 70 percent reduction in production costs compared to the previous generation.</p>

While the original film presented a more egalitarian view of resistance, later installments leaned into the trope of characters with special destinies. The author argues that this focus on saviors can be disempowering, suggesting that societal change is best left to those deemed more important, and that the most relatable parts of Star Wars are the ordinary failings of Luke Skywalker.</p>

To give the public tools to measure its success — or failure — they included a process to add concrete targets and time lines after county voters approved the measure in November. Those statistics became the baselines. The Leadership table then set five-year targets for improvement. In contrast to the sweeping language of ending homelessness that led to disillusionment over previous tax measures, it adopted moderate goals that it considered attainable.

Just over 156 million people live in neighborhoods with unhealthy levels of soot or smog – a 16% rise compared with last year and the highest number in a decade, according to the American Lung Association (ALA) annual state of the air report. A person of color is more than twice as likely as a white American to live in a neighborhood with unhealthy levels of smog and soot. But Latino Americans are the most impacted, and three times more likely to be breathing in both toxic air pollutants.</p>
