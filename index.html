        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eutelsat's stock experienced a significant increase after announcing a 1.35 billion euro capital raise, supported by the French state and other investors. The capital increase, along with debt refinancing, aims to bolster the company's Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. The French state will become the largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited at 18.7%. Eutelsat recently secured a 10-year deal with the French armed forces to provide priority-access space resources on its OneWeb LEO satellite constellation, positioning it as a strategic player in military communications and secure government connectivity. Optimism regarding Eutelsat as a European alternative to Starlink has contributed to the stock's volatility this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament is considering changes to assisted dying laws, with a bill in England and Wales proposing to allow terminally ill people to end their lives under specific conditions, including being over 18, having a terminal illness with a life expectancy of six months or less, and satisfying independent doctors. The bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, has undergone revisions, including the suggestion of a three-person panel overseeing applications instead of a High Court judge. Scotland is also considering a separate assisted dying bill, while the Isle of Man passed its Assisted Dying Bill in March 2025, and Jersey is drafting final legislation on the matter. Supporters argue for the dignity of choice, while opponents raise concerns about vulnerable individuals and the accuracy of diagnoses.</p>

          <p>Israelis are experiencing repeated missile attacks amid the ongoing conflict with Iran, raising concerns about the impact on the war in Gaza and the fate of hostages. Many Israelis express fear but also a determination to continue with daily life.

Public opinion polls indicate widespread support among Jewish Israelis for attacks on Iran, while Palestinian Israeli citizens largely oppose the strikes and favor diplomacy.</p>

The development requires collaboration across multiple disciplines, including microscopic device engineering, materials science, and bionics.

Jurors have heard allegations of drug use and coercion during "freak off" parties involving escorts and Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura.

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, primarily due to a "dismal" month for supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Sales volumes fell by 2.7%, the largest monthly decline since December 2023, with food retailers reporting lower sales of alcohol and tobacco as consumers cut back. Separate figures revealed that government borrowing rose in May, reaching the second-highest level since monthly records began in 1993. Economists suggest the data indicates that the economic growth seen earlier in the year is slowing, with inflation prompting consumers to reduce spending.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart International Group's shares have fallen after the People's Daily criticized its blind box business model, warning against the addictiveness of these collectibles. The newspaper described blind boxes as "business traps" that encourage repeat purchases through unpredictable rewards. Chinese authorities have already banned the sale of blind boxes to children under eight years old to curb addiction. Pop Mart's shares fell 3.6 per cent, wiping out billions in market value.</p>

          <p>Rightwing populists are increasingly critical of cities, citing their liberal elites, immigrants, and progressive policies as provocations. Cities are viewed as centers of fluid loyalties and complex politics, contrasting with populism's emphasis on the nation state and traditional values. The shift of cities like Los Angeles towards more progressive administrations has been seen as a defeat for the right. Despite the challenges, cities continue to serve as hubs of economic activity and resistance to intolerant populism.</p>
