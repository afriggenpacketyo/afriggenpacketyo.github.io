          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced their steepest decline in over five years, dropping by 34.5% in May. This decline contributed to overall export growth missing expectations, despite increases in shipments to Southeast Asia, the EU, and Africa. Imports from the U.S. also fell, leading to a decrease in China's trade surplus with America. The decline is attributed to tariffs imposed by the U.S., although a temporary truce was reached in mid-May. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal aims to extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. This announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, where concerns about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling on marine life have been raised. The proposed extension would cover 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation.</p>

          <p>China's export growth has slowed to a three-month low in May, largely due to a decline in shipments to the United States following tariffs imposed by President Trump. Exports rose 4.8% year-on-year, but shipments to the US fell almost 12% month-on-month. These figures were released just hours before another round of trade talks between US and Chinese officials in London. In May, China exported $28.8 billion worth of goods to the US, down from $33 billion in April. (not investment advice)</p>
