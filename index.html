          <h2>Scotland Faces Waste Export Surge Due to Landfill Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 04:02:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland is set to export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England due to an impending ban on landfilling biodegradable municipal waste. The Scottish government acknowledges a capacity gap in incinerators, leading to "bridging contracts" with English waste handlers. Concerns arise over increased emissions from transporting waste and stagnant domestic recycling rates. Despite initiatives to promote a circular economy, challenges persist in reducing household waste, highlighting the difficulties in achieving long-term environmental goals. The current plan is considered a temporary solution until more incinerators are built in the next few years.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister is pushing ahead with plans to cut the benefits bill by £5 billion by 203, facing opposition from within his own party. The reforms include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip), a benefit for individuals with long-term health conditions. Critics argue the changes could push 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, into relative poverty. Despite concerns, the Prime Minister maintains that the system needs reform to support those who can work and protect those who cannot.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that global warming will lead to more frequent ice jams in the Yellow River's estuary by the end of the century, affecting coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. Warmer temperatures will cause upstream ice to break apart and drift downstream, where it can refreeze and accumulate, forming ice jams. These jams can cause destructive flooding, damaging downstream communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. Researchers analyzed 160 years of data to conclude that climate change is shifting the geographic distribution of ice jam hotspots downstream.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amidst rising tensions with Beijing. The two leading Chinese chip firms are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to them. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and aims to tighten loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches. The decision reflects growing concerns over arms proliferation activities and national security.</p>

          <p>Analysts are warning that foreign investment into the U.S. could be threatened by Donald Trump’s proposed “revenge tax.” The provision, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would allow the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions that levy “unfair foreign taxes” on U.S. individuals and companies. Critics fear this could alienate foreign investors and undermine the dollar's safe-haven status. The act could also transform trade wars into capital wars by using taxation on foreign holdings of U.S. assets as leverage.</p>
