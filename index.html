          <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned the U.S. of "irreparable damage" should it militarily strike Iran amidst escalating tensions with Israel. These remarks followed Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting retaliatory missile fire from Iran. Trump cautioned that U.S. patience was "wearing thin" but stated that Khamenei would not be killed, emphasizing the goal of Tehran's "UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!" Khamenei rejected surrender, stating the Iranian people cannot be forced. The G7 labeled Iran a "principal source of regional instability," and Germany's Chancellor Merz stated Israel is doing "the dirty work" for the Western world. This conflict threatens to envelop the oil-rich Middle East, driving investors to safe-haven assets. The situation remains volatile with potential for broader escalation.</p>

          <p>China has evacuated hundreds of its citizens from Iran and is working to relocate over a thousand more due to the ongoing conflict with Israel. According to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, 791 citizens have been moved to safe areas with the assistance of neighboring countries. Some citizens have also been evacuated from Israel, and there have been no reports of Chinese nationals killed or injured in the fighting.

          <p>Smugglers in France are using "taxi boats" to collect migrants waiting in the sea, a new tactic to circumvent increased police patrols. These boats cruise the coastline, picking up paying customers who gather in waist-deep water, often out of reach of the police. French authorities, while intercepting a significant number of boats, are hesitant to intervene at sea due to the risk of drownings. New guidelines are expected next month to allow police to intervene more forcefully, but officers fear legal repercussions under current regulations. The smugglers are adapting quickly, launching from hidden locations and threatening local farmers who object to their presence.</p>

          <p>Israel and Iran are engaged in an existential battle that neither can afford to lose, potentially reshaping the Middle East. For Iran, the Khamenei regime's survival depends on retaliating against Israeli strikes to maintain domestic strength. Israel aims to neutralize Iran's nuclear capabilities and achieve a Tehran government that doesn't threaten its survival, seeking U.S. military support. The conflict's outcome could destabilize the theocratic rule in Iran, though Israel claims its mission is to remove the threat of nuclear war, not to change the regime. Trump's statements have been contradictory, leaving uncertainty about U.S. involvement.</p>

          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, preventing criminal punishment for women ending a pregnancy. The House of Commons approved an amendment to a crime bill, driven by concerns over police investigations of women for suspected illegal abortions. The change aims to remove vulnerable women from the criminal justice system, addressing cases where women were prosecuted for obtaining abortion pills illegally. Anti-abortion groups opposed the measure, fearing it would lead to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy. The amendment is a landmark reform protecting women from imprisonment for ending their pregnancies.</p>

          <p>Analysts are struggling to predict the extent to which the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran could influence oil prices. The market is weighing the likelihood of U.S. involvement and potential supply disruptions, such as Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz. The chief executives of TotalEnergies, Shell, and EnQuest have said that further attacks on critical energy infrastructure could have serious consequences for global supply and prices. Some analysts believe the conflict makes a 2014/2020 reset lower to $30-50 more likely when the conflict is over as producers are now producing and hedging as much as they can. Stephen Schork suggests a significant escalation could push oil prices substantially higher.</p>

Many of these cases were in Texas, which has seen a deadly outbreak of the highly contagious virus this year. The CDC emphasizes that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications, with disease symptoms generally milder in vaccinated individuals. Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.</p>

          <h2>Study Examines Why Men are 'Bad' at Gossiping and the Impact on Male Loneliness</h2>

          <p>A study by professor Andrew Hales and his research team found that men, more than women, “were consistently more open” to being talked about. The article examines the cultural perception that men, particularly straight men, are not skilled at gossiping, and the impact this has on male social connections and the male loneliness epidemic. The article posits that the inability of men to share secrets, especially with other men, may contribute to this loneliness crisis. While the article acknowledges that men do gossip, it suggests they lack the cultural opportunities and training to do so effectively.</p>

          <p>An Iranian official warned that any U.S. intervention in the conflict with Israel would risk "all-out war." Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said an "extensive operation" struck a centrifuge production site intended to enhance uranium enrichment. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that two centrifuge production facilities in Iran were hit. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei said the U.S. "should know that any military intervention will undoubtedly result in irreparable damage."

          <p>Austria's government is tightening gun laws following a deadly school shooting in Graz, where a gunman killed 10 people. The reforms include raising the minimum age for purchasing dangerous firearms from 21 to 25 and extending the waiting period between purchase and receipt to four weeks. Newly issued gun permits will expire after eight years, and there will be increased emphasis on psychological tests for gun owners. The government also plans to increase the number of school psychologists to identify potential dangers early. Better data transfer between the armed forces and firearm regulatory agencies will also be implemented.</p>

Sources familiar with the president's mindset said he has grown frustrated by Iran's inability to provide immediate answers.

          <p>The U.K. Parliament has voted to decriminalize some late-term abortions, barring women in England and Wales from being investigated, arrested, prosecuted, or imprisoned for terminating their own pregnancies, regardless of term. The law changes rules governing abortions in a clinical setting, and it leaves open the possibility of prosecutions of anyone who assists a woman in getting a late-term abortion, including medical professionals. Supporters say the new law recognizes that these women need care and support, not criminalization. The new law still needs approval in the upper house of Parliament, the House of Lords, before taking effect.</p>

          <p>President Trump intensified his rhetoric against Iran, threatening to target Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and claiming complete control of the skies over Iran. The president is also signaling that the U.S. is already more involved in the conflict than the White House previously let on. A new report from the CDC indicates that street drug deaths in the U.S. appear to be rising for the first time in over a year. This anxiety stems from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's announcement that it will target industries that employ many individuals without legal status.</p>
