          <p>President Trump confirmed that U.S. personnel are being moved out of parts of the Middle East due to escalating tensions with Israel and Iran, citing potential danger. The State Department had already ordered the departure of nonessential staff from the embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to increased security risks. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from various locations in the Middle East. Trump reiterated that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and that the administration is working to reach a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, including one at a car wash where Jesus Cruz worked for a decade, have sparked fear and protests in the community. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been targeting workplaces, leading to arrests of undocumented migrants, which some see as an escalation of the White House's deportation strategy. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass emphasized the fear among Angelenos, with many unsure if they are safe at home or work. Protests have broken out, with confrontations between demonstrators and federal agents, leading to arrests and the deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley in his retrial, marking a partial verdict after days of deliberation. The jury found Weinstein not guilty of criminal sexual assault regarding Kaja Sokola but could not reach a verdict on the charge of third-degree sexual assault involving Jessica Mann. The jury foreperson reported infighting and an alleged threat from a fellow juror, prompting defense attorneys to request a mistrial, which was denied. Weinstein's publicist called the split verdict a win, while Sokola's lawyer emphasized that her truth was heard and helped bring down a man who believed he was untouchable.</p>

          <p>A recent Quinnipiac University poll reveals that a majority of Democrats disapprove of the job performance of their party's lawmakers in Congress. The poll indicates that 53% of Democrats disapprove, while only 41% approve, reflecting a broader trend of dissatisfaction among voters nationwide. Overall approval for Republicans in Congress has also dropped since February. This dissatisfaction is fueled by an increasingly energized Democratic base urging party leaders to take a stronger stand against President Trump's agenda, leading to historic lows in the Democratic Party's favorable ratings.

          <p>Brian Wilson, the co-founder of the Beach Boys, has died at the age of 82, leaving behind a legacy as one of music's true visionaries. As a composer, arranger, and constructor of textures, Wilson's control of emotion allowed him to articulate feelings of affection, fear, and disappointment. The Beach Boys' hits are deeply embedded in American culture, with Wilson's studio experimentation leading to advances that rivaled the Beatles. Despite battling mental illness, Wilson continued to create music, leaving a lasting impact on the music world and epitomizing the lore of Southern California.</p>

          <p>Frito-Lay closed its manufacturing operations at the Rancho Cucamonga facility, ending over five decades of snack food production and eliminating hundreds of jobs. The plant, a major employer in the area, was also the birthplace of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos. PepsiCo Foods U.S. confirmed the shutdown, offering pay and benefits to affected employees. The closure is part of a broader pattern of PepsiCo facility shutdowns amid declining snack sales, with warehouse, distribution, fleet and transportation services continuing to operate out of the facility.</p>

This comes after Trump indicated he was open to reconciliation in a recent interview. The two had a public fallout after Musk stepped back from his White House role and criticized Trump's tax bill. Musk had previously urged Americans to oppose the tax bill, claiming it would cause a recession, and made unsubstantiated claims about Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
