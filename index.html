          <p>Following days of violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters over President Trump's immigration enforcement operations, National Guard troops have arrived in downtown Los Angeles. Protests, which have included clashes with soldiers, have erupted throughout L.A. County, leading to numerous arrests and injuries among both protesters and federal law enforcement officers. Mr. Trump announced the deployment in response to what he described as "two days of violence, clashes and unrest," while Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "purposefully inflammatory."</p>

          <p>Another series of unmarked graves, containing 14 individuals from Greece's civil war era, have been discovered in a park near Thessaloniki. These remains, like those found earlier this year, belong to prisoners executed between 1946 and 1953, alleged to be communists and sympathizers, who were held in the nearby Yedi Kule fortress. The bodies were found jumbled and hastily buried during park renovations, with torsos and heads separated. Despite the age of the bones being less than 100 years, local authorities are proceeding with excavations due to the find's historical significance.</p>

The defense argues that the prosecution knowingly presented false testimony from Cassie Ventura's friend, Bryana "Bana" Bongolan, regarding an alleged 2016 balcony incident. Diddy's lawyers claim that Cassie and Bana provided "demonstrably false" evidence about the allegation, which influenced the admission of inadmissible hearsay.

The assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, further crippled the organization, leading to a ceasefire and diminished Iranian power. The proxy war strategy Iran has pursued with Hezbollah for decades is failing, requiring a review of its approach to regional influence.</p>

          <p>British energy firms are receiving substantial payments to curtail power generation due to grid limitations, exacerbating the country's energy bill problems. Wind farms like Moray East and West are paid to reduce output when the grid cannot handle their electricity, while gas-fired plants are paid to increase production. This balancing act has cost the country over Â£500 million this year, potentially reaching Â£8 billion by 2030, driving up energy bills. The government is considering a radical solution: shifting to regional electricity markets to improve efficiency and lower costs.</p>

Historian Srinath Raghavan's new book reveals how Gandhi's government explored centralizing power, sidelining the judiciary, and weakening parliament. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, the move aimed to overcome the constraints of parliamentary democracy. The idea, though never fully realized, reflected a desire for a stronger executive capable of making unpopular decisions.</p>
