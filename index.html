          <p>Melody Farris, convicted of murdering her husband Gary in 2018, maintains her innocence, claiming her son Scott is the real killer. The case, investigated by Detective Daniel Hayes, revealed a dysfunctional family dynamic involving affairs, financial disputes, and a suspicious burn pile where Gary's remains were discovered. Evidence included Gary's blood in the basement and conflicting testimonies from family members, leading to Melody's conviction after a lengthy trial. At her sentencing, Melody accused Scott, alleging he wanted the family property and set her up, while Scott vehemently denies any involvement and accuses Melody of the crime.</p>

          <p>Despite the recent market rebound, some Wall Street analysts remain cautious, citing concerns over the long-term economic impact of the ongoing trade war. Michael Mullaney of Boston Partners is closely monitoring economic data, including shipping volumes and consumer spending, which suggest potential damage from trade tensions. While others are relieved by signals of easing trade hostility, Mullaney maintains a cautious stance, holding cash and anticipating continued economic fallout. This divergence highlights the uncertainty surrounding the market's trajectory and the potential for skeptics to be proven wrong by a sustained recovery.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) refuted claims by the Venezuelan government that the U.S. "kidnapped" a child, clarifying that the action was taken due to the child's parents being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The father is a lieutenant overseeing violent crimes, and the mother recruits young women for illicit activities. The child was removed from the deportation manifest for her safety and placed in foster care under the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The DHS emphasized its commitment to protecting children from abuse and exploitation, contrasting this approach with the previous administration's handling of unaccompanied minors.</p>

          <p>Canada's upcoming election has seen a dramatic shift, with the Liberal party, led by Mark Carney, gaining ground after Justin Trudeau's resignation and the return of Donald Trump to the White House. Trump's trade war and annexation threats have galvanized voters, particularly those on the left, who see Carney as a steady hand to navigate the crisis. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, initially held a significant lead but have struggled to adapt their message amidst the changing political landscape. The election's outcome hinges on which party can convince voters they have the best plan to deal with Trump's influence.</p>
