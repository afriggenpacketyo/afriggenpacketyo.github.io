          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has taken effect, marking the first phase of a US-brokered peace plan for Gaza. This initial stage involves the release of 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza. Increased humanitarian aid is also expected to enter the Strip, which has been facing dire conditions. A multinational force, including troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE, will monitor the ceasefire, though no US forces will be on the ground in Gaza. This article details the immediate terms and monitoring mechanisms of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla is expected to bring significant flash flooding to the southwestern United States through the weekend. While its core will dissipate off Mexico's Baja California coast, the storm is forecast to deliver two to four inches of rain, with up to six inches in some areas of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Forecasters warn that large swells generated by Priscilla are also causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the Pacific coast of Baja California Sur.

          <p>China's foreign ministry has strongly criticized a U.S. proposal to ban Chinese airlines from using Russian airspace, arguing it creates an unfair advantage for other carriers. The U.S. transport regulators suggested the ban to eliminate what they described as a cost benefit enjoyed by Chinese airlines flying shorter, cheaper routes via Russia. Beijing urged Washington to consider the policy's impact on American companies and global consumers, emphasizing its detrimental effect on people-to-people exchanges.

          <p>In an Indiana murder investigation, police suggested that a pit bull mix named Willow might have been used to conceal a murder weapon, though the accused wife was acquitted. Kevin Davis died from traumatic head injuries, which his wife Alison claimed were from a fall down stairs. Detective James Krueger, who later became police chief, believes a weapon could have been in the room guarded by the dog, preventing its discovery. The jury ultimately found Alison Davis not guilty, citing holes in the prosecution's case. This article explores the lingering questions in a tragic and unusual death investigation.</p>

          <p>The federal indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James on bank fraud charges has been met with approval by prominent figures in President Trump's MAGA movement. Eric Trump and Kari Lake publicly celebrated the charges, drawing parallels to James's successful civil fraud case against the Trump Organization. Critics, including the Democratic National Committee, condemn the indictment as politically motivated revenge orchestrated by Trump, citing the replacement of experienced prosecutors. This article highlights the highly polarized political reactions to James's legal troubles, framed within the context of Trump's perceived weaponization of the justice system.</p>

          <h2>National Guard Deployments Prove Inefficient and Costly for Crime Reduction</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's National Guard deployments in American cities, ostensibly to reduce crime, are proving incredibly expensive and inefficient. Costs for D.C. and Los Angeles alone are in the hundreds of millions, with total expenses potentially reaching two-thirds of a billion dollars. While some areas saw crime reductions, experts argue the method is inefficient, as Guardsmen are often deployed to tourist areas rather than high-crime zones. The administration simultaneously proposed cuts to more effective Justice Department programs designed for police staffing and community violence intervention. This article critiques the financial and strategic effectiveness of these deployments.</p>
