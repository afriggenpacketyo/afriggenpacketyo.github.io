          <p>Federal agents from the FBI searched the Maryland residence of former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, reportedly seeking classified records. The extensive operation, involving approximately six FBI vehicles, lasted over an hour, with local police briefly blocking access to his street. This extraordinary move comes as President Donald Trump has recently ramped up pressure on the Justice Department to bring charges against his political opponents, though Trump claimed he didn't know about this specific raid. A separate federal magistrate judge had also authorized the search of Bolton's downtown DC office, suggesting a broader investigation into the alleged possession of sensitive government documents.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she does not resign, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice following a criminal referral regarding claims she took two properties as her primary residence simultaneously. Trump's aggressive move, if successful, could allow him to significantly reshape the central bank's governing board, potentially influencing monetary policy for years to come. Cook has publicly stated she has "no intention of being bullied" into stepping down from her position.</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a leading global authority on food crises, officially declared a famine in Gaza City, warning it could rapidly spread to other southern cities without a ceasefire and an end to humanitarian aid restrictions. Israel immediately rejected the assessment, asserting "there is no famine in Gaza" and accusing the IPC of relying on "Hamas lies." The IPC, comprising over a dozen UN agencies and aid groups, confirmed the famine based on "reasonable evidence," stating over half a million people face catastrophic conditions characterized by starvation and death. This marks the first confirmed famine in the Middle East, highlighting a dire humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Amid elevated living costs and stock market volatility, experts offer five effective strategies for retirees to maximize their income and protect savings. These include delaying Social Security benefits until after age 70 to significantly increase monthly payments, and considering downsizing or relocating to areas with lower costs of living to reduce housing expenses. Utilizing annuities or reverse mortgages can provide guaranteed income streams, while making catch-up contributions to retirement accounts or engaging in part-time work can boost savings. Reviewing tax-efficient withdrawal strategies is also crucial for optimizing long-term financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three individuals were fatally shot in separate incidents in Chicago overnight, marking the latest string of violence in the Democratic-led city. This surge in crime occurred as President Donald Trump visited Washington, D.C., threatening to expand the deployment of federal law enforcement into more crime-ridden cities across the country. Trump emphasized the need for strength and toughness to combat crime, suggesting federal intervention could extend beyond the capital to other areas. No arrests have been made in the Chicago shootings, which remain under active investigation by local police.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans, including Ellen Allen from West Virginia, are preparing for significant increases in their Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance premiums next year. This is due to the expiration of pandemic-era federal tax credits that made coverage affordable for millions, with the average enrollee expected to see a 75% increase. Some individuals, like Allen, anticipate premiums of $2,800 a month, prompting her to save money that would otherwise go to retirement investments. The Congressional Budget Office estimates 4.2 million more people could become uninsured, highlighting a growing healthcare affordability crisis.</p>

          <p>Kimbal Musk, younger brother of Elon Musk, publicly stated that his brother "deserves to be paid" in light of Tesla's ongoing legal dispute over its CEO's compensation package. Elon Musk receives no salary or cash bonuses, compensated instead through performance-based stock options. Tesla recently granted him an "interim" pay package of 96 million shares, valued at approximately $29 billion, without a direct shareholder vote. This new award is intended to apply if the 2018 $56 billion package, which was revoked by a Delaware judge, is not reinstated on appeal, highlighting the contentious nature of his compensation.</p>

          <p>Thousands of immigrants in the U.S. face potential deportation to dangerous countries as the Trump administration targets Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for citizens of seven nations. A federal appeals court recently sided with the administration, potentially ending protections for Hondurans, Nicaraguans, and Nepalis, some of whom have held TPS for over 25 years. Despite UN reports detailing unsafe conditions and human rights abuses in countries like Nicaragua and Afghanistan, the Department of Homeland Security cites "improved conditions." Advocacy groups highlight the humanitarian crisis and the significant economic contributions of TPS holders, calling the policy an "unwillingness to acknowledge humanity."</p>

This controversial statement prompted outrage and a defense of historical accuracy, particularly from those familiar with the institution's commitment to intellectual integrity. The article emphasizes that chattel slavery, lasting nearly 250 years, involved immense physical, sexual violence, and psychological terror, as evidenced by numerous first-person accounts.

          <p>In an unusual economic trend, annual wage growth for "job stayers" has surpassed that of "job switchers" for the past six months, a phenomenon last seen around the Great Recession. This "job hugging" trend indicates an underlying cooling in the labor market, where fewer workers are voluntarily leaving jobs for better pay due to economic uncertainty. Job openings have declined, and employers are hiring at their slowest pace in over a decade, consequently reducing workers' bargaining power. Long-term unemployment is also increasing, forcing some individuals to accept lower-paying jobs. (not investment advice)</p>
