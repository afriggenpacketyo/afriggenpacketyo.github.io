          <p>This article discusses the need for China and ASEAN to build trust to align their security interests. Cambodia's allowing foreign warships at its Ream naval base signals inclusivity, countering perceptions of Chinese exclusivity. China's Global Security Initiative aims for peaceful dialogue in resolving disputes, particularly in the South China Sea. For China's vision to be realized, it must demonstrate openness, consistency, and a commitment to multilateral dialogue, fostering lasting trust with its Southeast Asian neighbors and reinforcing regional stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow the deportation of nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership and detained in Texas. The solicitor general cited an incident at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility where migrants allegedly barricaded themselves, threatened hostages, and caused damage. The administration argues the migrants pose a danger and should be promptly removed under the Alien Enemies Act. This follows previous attempts to deport Venezuelans, some of whom were sent to El Salvador and held in a prison designated for terrorists.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in ten years, driven by the oil and gas sector and strong performance in tech and finance. The World Bank projects a slight increase to 3.7% in 2025, though agricultural growth remains slow due to insecurity and high input costs. President Tinubu's reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, have been praised, but have also led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians. Despite some relief in food prices, nearly half of Nigerians live in poverty, and inflation is expected to remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

Central banks have been increasing their gold reserves, contributing to the upward trend.

          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at the Philadelphia facility managing Newark Liberty International Airport's air traffic caused significant flight delays. As few as three controllers were scheduled during peak hours, far below the target of 14, leading to delays up to seven hours. The FAA cited ongoing staffing issues, equipment failures, and runway construction as contributing factors. The agency plans to reduce flights and implement infrastructure upgrades to address the problems, while the Transportation Secretary blamed the Biden administration for a bungled relocation of air traffic management from Long Island.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the question of who should be prescribed GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, arguing that changes in health, particularly the reduction of visceral fat, should be the primary goal, rather than weight alone. GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing visceral fat, which is linked to cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. The article suggests that waist size and blood-lipid patterns are better indicators than BMI for determining who would benefit most from these medications. The author notes that the United States is still deciding how to approach GLP-1s and that more data is needed on their long-term effects.</p>

          <p>Gary Ramirez, 78, of Hawaii, was sentenced to life in prison after pleading no contest to the 1982 sexual assault and murder of 15-year-old Karen Stitt in Sunnyvale, California. Stitt was sexually assaulted and stabbed 59 times, with the case remaining unsolved for decades. New DNA technology and a community tip led to Ramirez's arrest in 2022. The victim's friends and family attended the sentencing hearing to share their grief and ensure she is not forgotten.</p>

This incident is seen as another example of the Trump administration's disregard for traditional norms of propriety and legal guardrails around public service.</p>
