          <h2>Appeals Court Temporarily Blocks Order Restoring California National Guard Control to Governor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 00:04:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily delayed a lower court's order that would have returned control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom from the Trump administration. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay and scheduled a hearing for June 17. This legal battle stems from Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in response to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles, a move Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta challenged as an unlawful militarization of the city. The lower court judge had ruled that Trump's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment, but the appeals court's stay allows the deployment to continue pending further review. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between federal and state authority regarding the use of the National Guard during civil unrest, and the appeals court will be tasked with determining whether the President followed procedure when deploying the National Guard. Optimism score of 45.</p>

          <p>Israel's military launched preemptive airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and research scientists early Friday morning local time, marking the first wave of a potentially extended attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the operation, named "Operation Rising Lion," as a targeted effort to diminish the Iranian threat to Israel's survival. In response, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a harsh response, raising concerns about further escalation. The United States asserted it was not involved in the operation, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasizing the priority of protecting American forces in the region and warning Iran against targeting U.S. interests. The strikes occurred amid ongoing U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, adding further complexity to the already tense geopolitical landscape. Optimism score of 20.</p>

          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the United States has continued to rise, reaching nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This increase is attributed to various factors, including changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising costs of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which have dropped significantly since 2016. Experts suggest this decline could be due to adolescents delaying sexual activity or increased contraceptive use. Optimism score of 75.</p>

          <p>The Karen Read trial is nearing its finale, with closing arguments scheduled for Friday after 31 days of testimony regarding the death of Boston cop John O'Keefe. Read is accused of hitting O'Keefe with her car and leaving him to die in a blizzard, a charge she denies, claiming he was attacked by someone else. The prosecution's case hinges on taillight fragments found on O'Keefe's clothes, expert testimony about the nature of his injuries, and Read's alleged admission, while the defense argues that the crash never happened, the investigation was sloppy, and O'Keefe's injuries were caused by animal bites. The jury will soon begin deliberations to determine Read's fate. Optimism score of 50.</p>

          <p>Israel has launched a sweeping attack on Iran, described by the Israeli government as a preemptive strike to eliminate the Iranian threat. However, this action is being debated as a preventive war, which involves removing a potential threat on one's own terms and timetable, a move considered morally and practically risky. While preemptive attacks are seen as legitimate self-defense against imminent threats, preventive wars are viewed as illegal and immoral in the international community. The scale of the Israeli offensive, including the reported deaths of senior Iranian leaders, suggests a broader goal of regime change, raising questions about the justification for the action under international law.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary ruling against the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with the state of California's argument that the president erred in how the guard was being activated. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Gov. Gavin Newsom by noon Friday. The judge rejected an argument by the administration's lawyer that the courts do not have authority to review a president's decision on whether the National Guard is needed. The Trump administration has said it took over California's National Guard to restore order and to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as they swept up people in Los Angeles who were believed to be in the country illegally.
