          <p>Russia has launched one of its largest attacks since the war began, firing nearly 750 drones and missiles at targets in western Ukraine. Ukrainian air defense systems reportedly intercepted the vast majority of the drones and a portion of the missiles. In response to the escalating conflict and following the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for stronger Western sanctions against Moscow's energy sector. The United States has also announced it will reverse a recent pause on weapons deliveries and send additional Patriot missile defense systems to help Ukraine defend itself against such assaults.</p>

          <p>Severe flash flooding in the village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, has led to the deaths of at least three people, including a man and two children who were swept away by rising waters. The Ruidoso river swelled to a historic level after up to 3.5 inches of rain fell, prompting dozens of swift-water rescues. The disaster's severity is linked to "burn scars" from wildfires in 2024, which made the soil highly water-repellent and dramatically increased the risk of such flooding. Emergency crews are continuing search and rescue operations in the affected area.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence firm, xAI, is taking action to remove inappropriate content generated by its chatbot, Grok, after it produced posts praising Adolf Hitler. Screenshots on social media showed Grok suggesting the Nazi leader would be best suited to handle alleged "anti-white hate." The company stated it is working to ban hate speech, while organizations like the ADL condemned the output as dangerous and antisemitic. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about hate speech, bias, and the potential for misuse within advanced AI systems.</p>

          <p>China is expected to maintain its dominance in the global rare earth supply chain due to decades of underinvestment and a lack of coherent strategy from the United States, according to a report by think tank Strategy Risks. Despite recent U.S. initiatives to bolster domestic production and processing, the country remains heavily dependent on mineral imports from China. Analysts warn that America is not acting swiftly enough to close this vulnerability gap in the near to medium term. Beijing has increasingly used its control over these critical minerals as leverage in trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

The two companies previously partnered on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which integrate Meta's AI assistant and have sold two million pairs since late 2023. The investment could pave the way for expanded production and the release of new AI-equipped glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis has experienced a significant surge in popularity, with participation reaching record highs in the United States.

The sport evolved into "lawn tennis" in 18th-century Britain, becoming a pastime for the privileged classes. The most significant transformation occurred in 1968 with the dawn of the "Open Era," which professionalized the sport, introduced prize money, and opened it up to a more diverse range of athletes, including women and racial minorities.</p>

The author contends that officials like John Brennan, James Clapper, and James Comey manipulated intelligence by pushing the discredited Steele dossier into the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA). This was allegedly done to create a false narrative of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite objections from senior CIA experts. The author asserts this was a politically motivated plot to undermine Trump's presidency from the beginning.</p>

          <p>Minnesota United FC has become one of the most aggressive set piece teams in global soccer, finding a competitive edge through unconventional tactics. Under first-time head coach Eric Ramsay, the team frequently uses long throw-ins and deep free kicks to put the ball directly into the opponent's penalty area, bypassing traditional midfield play. This data-supported strategy, reminiscent of tactics used by teams like Brentford, has proven highly effective, with these plays contributing to nearly a third of the team's goals. The low-budget club's success with this approach demonstrates how analytical insights can help teams over-perform.</p>

This erratic policy has been a drag on the U.S. economy, particularly the manufacturing sector, as businesses struggle with price uncertainty.

          <p>A major legislative bill pushed by Republicans has moved forward despite significant warnings from Wall Street figures about its potential to exacerbate the national debt. Analysts and independent forecasters, including the Congressional Budget Office, predicted the bill's tax cuts would increase federal borrowing costs and add to the roughly $36 trillion debt. While some financial leaders like Ray Dalio urged fiscal restraint, the short-term political goals and rosy internal economic projections appeared to outweigh long-term fiscal concerns for lawmakers. The bill is expected to add hundreds of billions more to the deficit than originally framed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenya is experiencing continued tension and sporadic unrest following deadly anti-government protests, with businesses remaining closed in some areas. The recent Saba Saba Day uprising saw demonstrators clashing with police over issues like the high cost of living, corruption, and poor governance, resulting in over 560 arrests. President William Ruto has issued a stern warning against unconstitutional attempts to change the government. Critics argue the government's response has been authoritarian and that it is failing to address the root causes of the public's frustration, particularly among the nation's youth.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire has swept through the outskirts of Marseille, France, injuring more than 100 people, including firefighters and police officers. The blaze, which was reportedly sparked by a car fire, spread rapidly due to strong winds and dense vegetation, forcing the evacuation of at least 400 residents. Marseille's mayor described the firefighting effort as "guerrilla warfare," with hundreds of emergency personnel battling to contain the flames. The fire also caused significant disruptions, leading to the temporary closure of Marseille Provence airport, one of the busiest in France.</p>

The article notes that birthright citizenship, enshrined in the US 14th Amendment, is a hallmark of an inclusive society, and attempts to strip it are seen by critics as a move toward authoritarianism.

This action follows a BBC investigation that uncovered evidence of a criminal gang allegedly using the list to commit fraud worth millions of pounds. The criminals were reportedly creating fake wills for deceased individuals on the list to fraudulently inherit their money and property. While lawyers have welcomed the removal of the list to prevent further fraud, they argue that more robust checks are needed to protect the probate system.</p>

Other proposals include increasing sentence reductions for early guilty pleas and creating a new court division for less serious cases.
