          <p>Former workers at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) warn that mass terminations and budget cuts under the Trump administration, now led by Robert F Kennedy Jr, are gutting key programs and increasing the risk of missed disease outbreaks. The cuts, driven by Elon Musk's 'department of government efficiency,' have led to layoffs at state public health agencies, impacting disease surveillance and response capabilities. The Pepfar program, focused on HIV prevention in children, has also been affected, with federal experts being fired. These cuts are also impacting child support services and have led to increased workloads and potential funding losses for states.</p>

          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) has released its annual allergy report, naming Wichita, Kansas, as the top allergy capital for the third consecutive year, with New Orleans, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa also ranking high. The report analyzes tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, over-the-counter allergy medicine use, and allergist availability. Dr. Purvi Parikh recommends starting medications early, washing clothes after being outdoors, and paying attention to pollen count timing, which is highest in the mornings and late afternoons. The article advises consulting a doctor if symptoms persist or worsen, as they could be indicative of a cold, virus, or asthma.</p>

          <p>While Chinese electric vehicle (EV) exports to the United Kingdom have decreased, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles are experiencing a significant surge. The UK has become a popular destination for Chinese car brands, with plug-in hybrid vehicle exports increasing nearly 600% in the first quarter of this year. The report highlights that the UK imposes a standard 10% import tariff, unlike the European Union, which is considering higher tariffs, up to 45.3 per cent, on Chinese EVs.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco's net profit for the first quarter of 2025 fell by 5% due to lower oil prices and production, resulting in a net income of $26 billion. The company's free cash flow also decreased from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion compared to the previous year. This financial strain impacts the Saudi government, which faces widening deficits and mounting debt due to costly megaprojects. Aramco has reduced its performance-linked dividend payout, signaling further challenges ahead amidst global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty affecting energy markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump anticipates progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, urging an end to the 'bloodbath' via social media. This comes after Putin announced a unilateral three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine said was violated by Russian forces. Zelenskyy proposed a 30-day ceasefire, and following talks with European leaders, agreed that a complete ceasefire should begin on May 12. Putin offered direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday, leading Zelenskyy to view it as a 'positive sign,' expecting Russia to confirm a complete ceasefire starting May 12.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, challenges the notion of the 'perfect mother,' arguing that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance. She critiques the tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and highlights the pressure mothers face from various sources. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to acknowledge their imperfections and stop striving for an unattainable ideal, offering a quiz to illustrate common parenting moments of imperfection. The article concludes with a message of reassurance, urging mothers to recognize that they are good enough.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, referencing unsuccessful 2022 talks. This offer follows pressure from European leaders who threatened increased sanctions if Russia doesn't commit to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Putin accused Ukraine of sabotaging previous ceasefire attempts, while Zelenskyy called the European leaders' meeting a 'very important signal,' supporting a 30-day ceasefire for diplomatic efforts. The European leaders threatened further sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin did not comply with the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, is accused of the 'depraved heart murder' of his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, by providing her with habit-forming anesthesia drugs, propofol and ketamine, that eventually led to her death.

Text messages revealed that Ryan had been providing Sarah with drugs, sometimes injecting her while she was asleep, and controlling her access to them.

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remains steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but lower than the previous year. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. High mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster spring home-buying season as sales of previously occupied homes decline.</p>

He suggests the UK should have focused on its relationship with the EU instead, highlighting that Trump's strategy is to 'divide and conquer,' targeting weaker countries. The deal includes reduced tariffs on British car and steel exports to the US, while the UK has agreed to remove a tariff on ethanol.</p>

          <p>The new German cabinet under Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing criticism for appointing individuals with close ties to the business world to top government positions. Critics argue that these appointments could lead to conflicts of interest and undue influence from specific industries. While lobbying is regulated in Germany through a lobby register, loopholes and a lack of enforcement mechanisms raise concerns about transparency and accountability. Experts emphasize the need for stricter rules and oversight to prevent potential abuses of power and ensure that political decisions are made in the public interest.</p>

          <p>Faced with the threat of new sanctions, President Vladimir Putin called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in the coming days. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, on their first joint visit to Ukraine, said on Saturday that Russia would face “new and massive” sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if President Vladimir V. Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire. He proposed a meeting between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without specifying who would participate in the talks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to USAID funding are having catastrophic consequences for healthcare in Africa, leading to a loss of access to medication for HIV patients and the halting of crucial healthcare programs. Sub-Saharan Africa, a major recipient of USAID funding, faces the potential loss of millions of lives due to treatable diseases. NGOs like Amref Health Africa have experienced significant budget cuts, resulting in canceled educational programs and reduced disease screenings. Experts fear that these cuts will reverse years of progress in combating malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has described the initial discussions as being "very good" and said change had been "negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner". An escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has seen the US president hit Chinese imports to the US with tariffs of 145%. China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods. Following months of back-and-forth, the two countries are meeting in Geneva this weekend for the first time since Trump hit China with tariffs at the start of the year.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. A report by ODI Global reveals that Africa has become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, experiencing a 153% surge in exports from 2020 to 2024. This shift aligns with global trends indicating China's growing focus on renewable energy and its commitment to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas. Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production are driving this trend.</p>
