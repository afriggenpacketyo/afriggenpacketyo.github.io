            <p>Senator Mark Warner, the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has voiced concerns that President Trump's extension of the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's US assets may violate US law. Warner argues that the reported deal under consideration would not sufficiently eliminate ByteDance's influence over TikTok's US operations, as required by the 2024 law. The proposed deal would reportedly allow ByteDance to retain a significant equity stake and an active role in technology development, raising questions about its compliance with legal requirements. The situation highlights ongoing scrutiny of TikTok's ownership and its potential impact on US national security.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the US and Iran would hold direct talks regarding a possible nuclear deal, a meeting also confirmed by Iran's foreign minister who described it as an opportunity and a test. Trump warned that a failure to reach an agreement would be a "very bad day for Iran," reiterating his stance that Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons. The announcement followed a White House meeting with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, who has previously suggested military action to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The talks are scheduled to take place in Oman, signaling a potential shift in diplomatic engagement between the two nations.</p>

            <p>As President Trump's tariffs continue to disrupt the global economy, some Republicans in Congress are exploring ways to limit the president's authority over trade policy. A bipartisan bill has been introduced to require congressional approval for new tariffs, reflecting concerns about the potential for economic damage.
