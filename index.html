          <p>China has committed to supporting peaceful development in the Horn of Africa, as announced by its special envoy at a conference in Uganda. Beijing plans to offer military assistance, training, and infrastructure development to promote stability and common prosperity in the region. The envoy emphasized China's backing for "African-led solutions" through established platforms like the African Union. This engagement includes cooperation on counterterrorism and landmine eradication, reinforcing China's diplomatic and strategic interests across East Africa.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK-China Transparency think tank suggests that Chinese students at UK universities are being coerced into spying on their peers to suppress discussions on topics sensitive to Beijing. The report also highlights instances of Chinese officials warning lecturers to avoid certain subjects, raising concerns about academic freedom. While the Chinese embassy has dismissed the report as baseless, it comes as new UK legislation empowers regulators to fine universities for failing to protect free speech. The issue is complicated by the financial reliance of some UK universities on fees from Chinese students.</p>

          <p>A third child, 10-year-old Ari Buchman, has died from injuries sustained in a sailboat crash near Miami Beach. The incident occurred when a summer camp sailboat collided with a barge, which had already resulted in the deaths of two other girls, aged 7 and 13. The crash, which involved five children and one adult counselor, is currently under investigation by the U.S. Coast Guard, with international partners from Argentina also participating. The local sailing community has expressed profound grief over the multiple fatalities from this tragic accident.</p>

          <p>Rapper Soulja Boy, legally named DeAndre Cortez Way, was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The arrest occurred early Sunday morning after police conducted a traffic stop in the Melrose area and found the firearm on Way, who was a passenger in the vehicle. Way, who gained fame with his 2007 hit "Crank That (Soulja Boy)," has a prior felony conviction, making it illegal for him to possess a firearm. No further details about the traffic stop or the circumstances of the arrest were immediately released.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he now "loves" a controversial American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney after being informed she is a registered Republican. The ad, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," had drawn mixed reactions, with some critics claiming it had eugenicist undertones. Public records indicate Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida, a detail that surfaced amid the social media debate. Trump's comment reframes the controversy through a political lens, following similar remarks from Vice President JD Vance who mocked the backlash against the actress.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic legislators has fled Texas to prevent a vote on a new congressional map proposed by Republicans. By leaving the state, they aim to deny the Republican-controlled legislature the necessary quorum to pass the redistricting plan, which Democrats argue is a racist, gerrymandered map designed to unfairly benefit the GOP in future elections. This action halts a special session called by Governor Greg Abbott, who has threatened to remove the absent lawmakers from their positions if they do not return to the capitol.</p>

          <p>More than three thousand Boeing defense workers in Missouri and Illinois are set to strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer. The union members, who build military aircraft like the F-15 fighter jet, voted against the proposal due to disagreements over pay, pensions, and work schedules. This walkout represents a new challenge for the aviation giant, which is already dealing with safety scandals and the financial fallout from previous labor disputes. The strike, led by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, would be the first at Boeing's defense unit since 1996.</p>

          <p>A BBC Africa Eye investigation has uncovered a child sex trade in Maai Mahiu, Kenya, where women known as "madams" are exploiting children as young as 13 for prostitution. Undercover filming revealed women admitting to the illegality of their actions while arranging for investigators to meet with underage girls who are forced to have sex with truck drivers. Despite the evidence being handed to Kenyan police, no arrests have been made, highlighting the challenges in prosecuting such cases. The report exposes the vulnerability of children in the key transport hub.</p>

          <h2>Finance Expert Dave Ramsey Argues Spending Habits, Not Income, Cause Financial Distress</h2>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey recently asserted that people are broke not because of low income, but because they allocate their earnings to debt payments for others. He identified credit cards, car payments, and student loans as the primary culprits that prevent individuals from building personal wealth. Ramsey advocates for a strict financial plan that includes creating a zero-based budget, aggressively paying down debt using the "debt snowball" method, and paying for all purchases with cash. He argues that this discipline is the key to achieving financial independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume more than 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption of the Krasheninnikov volcano was accompanied by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake, though a resulting tsunami warning was later lifted. According to officials, the ash cloud spread eastward over the Pacific Ocean without affecting populated areas. There is some discrepancy among scientific bodies regarding the exact date of its last eruption, with estimates ranging from 475 to 600 years ago.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, reportedly negotiated for the release of billions in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees.

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated a new AI model named Genie 2, which can generate interactive, 3D game-like environments from a single static image or text prompt. This technology allows a user or an AI agent to explore a dynamically created world that extends beyond the original source material. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis explained that while the model has entertainment applications, its primary goal is to build a "world model" that understands our physical environment. This could be used to train AI agents and robots in a vast array of simulated scenarios.</p>
