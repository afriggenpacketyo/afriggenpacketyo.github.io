          <p>Los Angeles experienced widespread protests following numerous arrests made during citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. President Trump responded by deploying at least 2,000 National Guard troops to L.A. County due to clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators. The ICE operations resulted in the arrest of 118 immigrants, and protesters gathered outside a federal detention center, chanting and displaying anti-ICE slogans. Local officials, including Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass, have expressed concerns over the federal government's actions and the escalation of tensions, as the protests spread and clashes with law enforcement intensified.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles under Title 10 authority has raised legal questions and concerns, as Governor Newsom opposed the move. Title 10 allows the activation of National Guard troops for federal service, but critics argue that using the military domestically to quell protests is chilling and a misuse of power. Concerns have also been raised about the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act of 1807, which could further escalate the situation and undermine local law enforcement efforts. The ACLU has warned against the dangerous implications of Trump's use of the military domestically, citing historical precedents and the importance of maintaining the separation between military and civilian law enforcement.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The researchers said the drastic decline in fertility rates was especially urgent in countries “getting old before getting rich,” as low fertility threatens economic stability and the ability to catch up to developed nations.</p>

          <p>Nutritionists are warning that intermittent fasting, a popular eating plan, may disguise disordered eating behaviors. While intermittent fasting is often promoted as a tool for weight loss and improving metabolic health, it can become problematic, especially for those with a history of eating disorders. Experts emphasize that the potential benefits of intermittent fasting do not outweigh the risks of developing or worsening an eating disorder. They recommend focusing on balanced meals, variety, satisfaction, and listening to hunger and fullness cues instead of adhering to rigid food rules.</p>

Johnny 5 drew inspiration from both "old school" regional Mexican music and English-language artists like Michael Jackson and The Beatles. He also created the song "72" in honor of his mother, Jenni Rivera, who died in 2012, when he was 11 years old. The young artist hopes his music can help others heal from their own wounds.</p>

Recent findings suggest the search must continue, with new findings suggesting the search must continue, as molecules identified on K2-18b can also form without the presence of life. Three teams of astronomers have assessed the models and data used in the original biosignature discovery and got very different results, which they have submitted for peer review.

          <p>A Macau conglomerate is targeting Hong Kong’s affluent retirees with a new luxury senior housing project in the Greater Bay Area. Serensia Woods, a 13,500-square-metre retirement community in Zhuhai’s Hengqin district, includes a hotel, residential towers, wellness centers, and a spa center. The development aims to tap into a growing demographic, as 36 per cent of Hong Kong’s population will be over 65 by 2046. The project capitalizes on a shortage of high-end retirement options for the city’s affluent retirees.</p>

          <p>Japan is grappling with inadequate disaster preparedness regarding sanitation, as evidenced by the "toilet panic" following the Noto Peninsula earthquake. The earthquake disrupted water and electricity, rendering flush toilets inoperable and leading to unsanitary conditions. Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets in times of disaster to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and protect public health. Efforts are underway to educate children on the use of portable toilets and encourage households and workplaces to stockpile them for emergencies.</p>

However, many founders and VCs argue that this approach is unsustainable and incompatible with European values and regulations. They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures, work-life balance, and adequate funding and resources to support growth and innovation.</p>

This approach emphasizes the importance of conscientious behavior around AI systems, as they learn by absorbing everything we do and say online. De Kai's book, Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future, explores this concept and its implications for living with AI.</p>
