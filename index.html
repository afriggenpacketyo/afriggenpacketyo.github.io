This move follows an executive order targeting funding for programs at the Smithsonian Institution that contain what Trump characterized as "divisive, race-centered ideology."

          <p>Many of Saturday's papers feature Donald Trump gifting Elon Musk a ceremonial key, marking Musk's last day with the Department of Government Efficiency. The Times splits its front page with this image and a report on the UK Defence Secretary committing to spend 3% of GDP on defense by 2034. The Independent leads with a UN report describing Israel's aid blockade as putting "100% of the population at risk of famine". The Daily Mail reports that Sir Keir Starmer is facing pressure to sack his attorney general for comparing right-wing politicians to Nazis.</p>

Yimin is among the first to develop "intelligent coal mines" as part of China's push to digitally transform its coal industry. The initiative stems from guidance issued in 2020 by central government agencies, which outlined the construction of intelligent mines and identified autonomous driving as a strategic goal.</p>
