        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JetBlue Airways will cease operations at Miami International Airport on September 3rd as part of a cost-cutting strategy focused on eliminating less profitable routes. The airline will continue serving South Florida via Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Lauderdaleâ€“Hollywood International Airport, with the latter offering numerous daily flights. This decision aligns with CEO Joanna Geraghty's memo about winding down underperforming routes due to softening travel demand and reliance on borrowed cash. JetBlue will contact affected customers to offer alternative travel options or refunds, marking the end of a four-year presence at Miami International where it once operated up to 14 daily flights. The airline is also suspending year-round service between Boston and Seattle, offering flights between the two cities solely during the summer season. Optimism remains low for Miami International Airport officials, as the airline is focusing on more profitable routes. </p>

          <p>An escalating conflict between the U.S. and Iran could have significant economic consequences for Americans, primarily through rising oil prices and disruptions to global commerce. Iran's potential control over the Strait of Hormuz could lead to a surge in oil prices, impacting energy and transportation costs. Additionally, American soldiers stationed in the Middle East face increased threats from Iranian missiles, as demonstrated by a recent attack on a U.S. base in Qatar. While the Trump administration claims that strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities have mitigated the threat of nuclear proliferation, some argue that these actions may actually make Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons more likely by ending diplomacy and increasing Tehran's sense of insecurity.

          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. The amendment expresses concerns about the potential increase in relative poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessment on the job market and people's health. If the reasoned amendment is selected by the House Speaker and receives majority support, the welfare reform bill will be halted. This level of opposition among Labour MPs signals a potential rebellion against the government's welfare plans, particularly with support from newly elected MPs. The vote on the bill is scheduled for July 1st, raising questions about the future of the social security system. </p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as the absence of reported casualties raised hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil fell by 7.22% to $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent shed 7.18% to settle at $71.48. Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate after President Donald Trump's actions against Iran, with some suggesting Trump has successfully escalated to de-escalate. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, which allowed for the prevention of casualties, and called for peace in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terror law, effectively branding the group a terrorist organization. This decision follows a series of incidents, including activists breaking into RAF Brize Norton and causing damage. Cooper cited the group's history of criminal damage and increasing frequency and severity of activities targeting financial firms, charities, universities, and government buildings. The ban would make membership or support of the group a criminal offense, punishable by up to 14 years in prison, but does not affect lawful protest groups. Palestine Action has stated it will legally challenge the ban, asserting that its actions are aimed at disrupting companies arming Israel's military campaign. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, officials and experts have offered conflicting assessments regarding the extent of the damage. While some, like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, claim Iran's nuclear program has been "obliterated," others caution that it will take time to fully assess the impact. Ballistic experts suggest that underground facilities like Fordo may not have sustained significant damage due to their depth. The International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Grossi stated that the true extent of damage cannot be ascertained until inspectors are allowed access. Some experts worry that the attacks may permanently estrange Iran from the international system of legal frameworks and norms, potentially leading to the development of clandestine enrichment facilities. </p>

This move is seen by some as a response to President Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center and subsequent cancellation of a Hamilton production. The Kennedy Center itself is not involved in programming the event, but the White House has proposed a significant increase in its federal funding. The event can be seen as a reoccupation of the Kennedy Center after Trump took over the Kennedy Center in February. </p>

Brentford is likely to demand a fee comparable to what Wolves received for Matheus Cunha, considering Mbeumo's remaining contract year.

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including CVS Health and UnitedHealthcare, have voluntarily agreed to streamline and reduce prior authorizations, a process often criticized for causing delays and physician burnout. The changes aim to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce the administrative burden on providers. Insurers will establish a common standard for electronic prior authorization requests by 2027, with at least 80% of approvals answered in real time. Individual plans will also reduce the types of claims subject to prior authorization requests by 2026. </p>

          <p>With their chances of winning the Democratic mayoral primary diminishing, some candidates are now focusing on preventing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo from reaching City Hall. Candidates like Brad Lander and Zellnor Myrie are urging voters to leave Cuomo off their ranked-choice ballots. Meanwhile, Zohran Mamdani, a progressive candidate, is attempting to unseat Cuomo, who has been considered the frontrunner. The race reflects ideological divides within the Democratic Party, as evidenced by their differing reactions to the U.S. bombing of Iran's nuclear sites. </p>

          <p>Apple's recent underperformance has raised questions about its role as a stock market safe haven, prompting investors to explore alternative options. While tech stocks have historically served as a safe haven during times of volatility, Apple's recent slide has challenged this notion. Investors are now turning to broader market bets and traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples. Despite Apple's struggles, tech remains a significant component of S&P 500 index funds, and some analysts view market volatility as a buying opportunity for tech stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

Symptoms include high body temperature, confusion, and rapid breathing. Immediate treatment involves calling emergency services and cooling the person down by moving them to a shaded area and removing unnecessary clothing. </p>

          <p>Tyrese Haliburton's torn Achilles tendon during Game 7 of the NBA Finals has raised concerns about the prevalence of Achilles injuries in the league. Haliburton is the third superstar to suffer an Achilles tear during the playoffs, following Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum. Regenerative medicine doctor Jesse Morse suggested that Haliburton's high-grade calf strain in Game 5 was a precursor to the Achilles injury. The Achilles tendon is a fibrous cord connecting muscles from the calf to the heel bone, and sudden explosive movements can cause it to tear or rupture. </p>
