        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review by the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has concluded that a major power outage at Heathrow Airport was most likely caused by moisture entering an electrical component. The incident, which occurred at the North Hyde substation in March, resulted in a fire that led to the airport's closure the following day. This disruption caused thousands of flight cancellations and affected approximately 270,000 passenger journeys. The report explains that the moisture likely caused a short circuit, leading to sparks that ignited oil within the equipment.</p>

As demand for copper in electric vehicles and solar power grows, Chinese companies are expanding operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and now Botswana.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government experienced a significant political setback, forcing a major U-turn on its welfare reform bill after facing a large-scale rebellion from its own MPs. The government initially intended to change eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) but had to concede to pressure, leaving its policy agenda in disarray. The chaotic situation has drawn comparisons to previous unstable governments and has weakened the Prime Minister's authority despite his large majority. This event has led to internal party frustration and speculation about future tax increases.</p>

This perspective suggests that any portrayal of a smooth, problem-free relationship is primarily for Beijing's benefit.

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng has reported its eighth consecutive month of delivering over 30,000 cars, demonstrating resilience amid a fierce price war in China's EV market. While market leader BYD continues to dominate, Xpeng's steady performance contrasts with mixed results from competitors like Nio and Li Auto. The intense competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government, is putting pressure on all automakers, including Tesla. Xpeng's ability to maintain its sales momentum highlights the dynamic and challenging nature of the world's largest electric vehicle market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of "30% or 35%" on Japanese imports if a trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This potential hike is significantly higher than the current 10% levy that was temporarily put in place to allow for negotiations. Trump expressed doubt that a deal with Tokyo would be finalized, while Japanese officials stated they would not make concessions that harm the country's agricultural sector. The threat escalates trade tensions between the two allied nations, with key Japanese exports like vehicles already facing significant import taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to prematurely end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for more than 500,000 Haitians in the United States. The administration had announced it would terminate the protections on September 2, much earlier than the February 2026 date set by the previous administration. The judge ruled that this early termination is unlawful, as it violates the required notice period and disrupts the lives of beneficiaries who have established jobs and enrolled in schools. The ruling is a significant, though potentially temporary, victory for Haitian migrants facing deportation.</p>

Instead, the company may focus more resources on its next-generation "14A" process to better compete with rivals like TSMC for major customers such as Apple and Nvidia.
