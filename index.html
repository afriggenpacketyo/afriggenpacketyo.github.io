          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was excluded from England's squad for the World Cup qualifier against Andorra, raising concerns about his fitness. Head coach Thomas Tuchel mentioned Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting his absence is linked to this. Saka, who has 43 caps for the Three Lions, previously missed three months due to a hamstring injury but returned for the season's final stretch. Ollie Watkins was also left out due to a minor injury, while the reason for Conor Gallagher's omission remains unclear, with England currently unbeaten in World Cup qualifying. </p>

Vietnam is also constructing military facilities such as harbour basins, wharves, and runways, including an airstrip on Barque Canada Reef expected to be 3,000 meters long, amid rival territorial claims with China in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>The UK government is struggling to reduce the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers, with the Home Office planning to spend £2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This is only marginally less than the £2.3 billion spent in 2024/25, primarily to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers in the UK. The Home Office aims to end asylum hotels and speed up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money, while also working with the Greater Manchester combined authority to increase dispersal accommodation. Critics argue that diverting aid to domestic costs undermines humanitarian and development priorities overseas, especially with overall ODA budget reductions. </p>

          <p>Tottenham captain Son Heung-min described sacked manager Ange Postecoglou as a "legend" who "changed the trajectory of this club". Postecoglou was sacked just over two weeks after leading the club to a Europa League victory, ending a 17-year trophy drought, despite finishing 17th in the Premier League. Players like Vicario, Micky van de Ven, and Dominic Solanke also expressed gratitude for Postecoglou's impact. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust acknowledged the vast majority of fans will "love Ange forever" despite league results falling short of expectations, calling for the board to fully support Postecoglou's replacement.</p>

          <p>King Charles is reportedly "livid" due to a potential pheasant shortage at Sandringham Estate, possibly affecting the traditional Boxing Day shoot, a favorite royal pastime. Royal experts suggest the shortage reflects poorly on the management of Sandringham, inherited from Queen Elizabeth II, and the King's preference for maintaining the estate’s game population. Some suggest this might prompt a review of the shooting tradition, which has faced criticism from animal rights groups. Others hope the change will allow the King to prioritize reconciliation with Prince Harry, as the family adapts to a slimmed-down monarchy and the King's cancer treatments.</p>

This concern arises as the US shifts its approach to Africa, emphasizing self-reliance over military aid. China is a major supplier of military equipment, especially in the Sahel region, as junta-led leaders distance themselves from Western partners. The move by the Trump administration to cut foreign aid has negatively impacted programs like IMET, despite their previous success.</p>

The weather agency also cautioned about frequent lightning, hail, and strong, gusty winds, which could cause disruption to transport and potential damage to buildings.

          <p>Muhammed Asif Hafeez, a global businessman and ambassador of a London polo club, lived a double life as "one of the world's most prolific drug traffickers". While presenting himself as an upstanding individual who provided information to authorities, Hafeez was the puppet-master of a vast drugs empire, supplying heroin, methamphetamine, and hashish worldwide. He informed on rival cartels to eliminate competition, earning the nickname "the Sultan." Hafeez was extradited from the UK in 2023 and sentenced to 16 years in a New York prison for conspiring to import drugs into the US, ending his criminal reign.</p>

Jack's condition has caused him to be blind, experience frequent seizures, and is unlikely to ever walk or talk, with doctors indicating it is life-limiting. Amanda has connected with one other parent whose daughter had the same condition and passed away at age two, finding the shared experience invaluable.

          <p>Rory McIlroy expressed his concern about his form heading into the US Open after struggling with driver issues at the Canadian Open, where he missed the cut. McIlroy shot an eight-over-par 78 during his second round, struggling to get to grips with a new driver after his previous one was ruled non-conforming. With the US Open at Oakmont requiring accurate fairway hits, McIlroy acknowledges he is still searching for the missing piece off the tee.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported in error by the Trump administration, has been returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. He appeared in federal court in Nashville, with his lawyer calling the charges "fantastical". The indictment alleges Abrego Garcia was involved in smuggling undocumented migrants into the US, though his lawyer argues the charges are based on statements from individuals facing prosecution. The US Supreme Court ordered Trump to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return after admitting to an "administrative error" that led to his deportation, amid tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary.</p>
