        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the current interest rates for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans, noting they are significantly lower than other borrowing options like personal loans and credit cards. With average home equity exceeding $300,000, these products offer an affordable way for homeowners to access large sums of money. Rates, which average around 8.10% to 8.37% depending on the loan term, are expected to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later in 2025. Homeowners should compare offers and understand the differences between fixed-rate home equity loans and variable-rate HELOCs, as well as the tax benefits for home improvements (not investment advice).</p>

Emergency services, including the Air Ambulance, responded to the incident around 08:20 BST, with fifteen people hospitalized for non-life-threatening conditions. Eyewitnesses described the bus accelerating rapidly, emitting black smoke, and then crashing with a loud bang. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause, with police appealing for witnesses and closing the road due to a diesel spill.</p>

          <p>A Trump-backed redistricting push in Missouri aims to flip a Democratic-held House seat, making the state a new political battleground ahead of the 2026 midterms. Governor Matt Kehoe called a special legislative session to redraw congressional districts, proposing a map that would likely give Republicans a 7-1 advantage. This effort follows a similar move in Texas and is part of a broader Republican strategy to expand their House majority. Democrats are fighting back, with California proposing its own ballot measure to counter Republican gains, and Missouri's Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver vowing legal action.</p>

          <p>A devastating funicular cable railway derailment in Lisbon resulted in 16 fatalities and approximately 20 injuries, prompting a national day of mourning in Portugal. Among the deceased was a transport worker, while the injured included Portuguese nationals and foreign visitors from nine different countries. A three-year-old German boy sustained minor injuries, though his father died and mother remains in critical condition. Police are investigating the cause of the tragic incident, which saw the funicular carriage crash into a building.</p>

          <p>U.S. private sector hiring significantly slowed in August, with only 54,000 jobs added, falling below economists' forecasts and marking a sharp decline from the previous month's revised gain. ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, attributed the decrease to consumer worries, labor shortages, and AI disruptions. While trade, transportation, and education sectors saw losses, leisure and hospitality experienced a boom. This report, alongside increased jobless claims, reinforces concerns about the labor market's health ahead of the official government jobs report, further increasing bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut.</p>

          <p>Russia's Foreign Ministry reiterated its firm stance against any Western troop presence in Ukraine as European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gathered in Paris. Spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated that Moscow views such interventions as unacceptable and a threat to Europe. The discussions in Paris, part of the 'Coalition of the Willing,' precede a virtual call with U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently imposed tariffs on India for purchasing Russian energy. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for a united front to pressure Russia towards a diplomatic solution, despite Moscow's unwillingness to negotiate.</p>

          <p>U.S. job cuts have surged by 66% year-to-date, surpassing the total for the previous year, with approximately 892,000 announced through August. This significant increase is attributed to the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, economic uncertainty, and the growing impact of artificial intelligence. California and the tech industry have been particularly affected, alongside pharmaceuticals, finance, and retail sectors struggling with tariffs and inflation. AI was directly cited for over 10,000 job cuts, highlighting its role in the evolving labor market.</p>

          <p>In a major antitrust case, a federal judge ruled against breaking up Google but prohibited it from making exclusive deals to establish its search engine as the default on phones and other devices.

While the judge ruled in the DOJ's favor, the 'remedies' phase is ongoing, with discussions about licensing Google's search index to aid smaller competitors and AI developers.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration unlawfully froze over $2 billion in research funds for Harvard University.
