          <h2>Economists Urge China to Implement Structural Reforms to Boost Domestic Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 00:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the World Economic Forum's 'Summer Davos' event, prominent economists argued that China must undergo significant structural reforms to become a consumption-driven economy. They emphasized that relying solely on production and technological supremacy is unsustainable for achieving long-term wealth and harmonious global trade relationships. Panelists suggested that for China to avoid trade friction with the U.S. and other nations, it needs to increase internal consumption, with opportunities present in the services sector and smaller cities.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed it will amend its controversial welfare reform bill after facing a significant rebellion from over 100 of its own MPs. The changes mean that planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) will now only apply to future claimants, while current recipients will be unaffected. This major concession is seen as a climbdown by the government to ensure the bill passes a crucial vote in the House of Commons and avoids a damaging defeat.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez held a star-studded reception in Venice, Italy, ahead of their weekend wedding, drawing a crowd of celebrities including Oprah Winfrey and Leonardo DiCaprio. The high-profile event, with around 200 expected guests, has not been without controversy. The influx of powerful figures has prompted protests from some Venice locals and the formation of a 'No Space for Bezos' campaign, part of a broader European pushback against the impacts of over-tourism.</p>
