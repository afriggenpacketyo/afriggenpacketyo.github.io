          <p>The Defense Department is investing $400 million in MP Materials, which operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S. This move will make the Pentagon the company's largest shareholder and is aimed at expanding domestic processing and magnet production to reduce reliance on China for these critical components. The investment, which includes a price floor guarantee for ten years, caused the company's shares to surge significantly. The deal is part of a broader U.S. strategy to secure domestic supply chains for materials essential to defense and technology sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italian confectioner Ferrero has agreed to purchase cereal maker WK Kellogg in a $3.1 billion deal, causing WK Kellogg's stock to jump 30%. The acquisition reflects ongoing consolidation in the packaged foods industry, as many consumers shift away from sugary cereals towards healthier options or private-label brands. This move significantly expands Ferrero's footprint in the U.S. market, following several other North American acquisitions in recent years. WK Kellogg was spun off from Kellanova (formerly Kellogg) in 2023.</p>

          <p>While popular for weight loss, GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic are facing scrutiny over an increasing number of reported side effects, some of which are severe. Beyond common digestive issues, reports link the medications to more serious conditions like pancreatitis, vision changes, and musculoskeletal disorders, with some cases proving fatal. Regulators and researchers are calling for more studies, particularly on long-term use and effects in underrepresented groups like women, as these risks were not fully apparent in initial clinical trials. Despite the concerns, many experts believe the drugs' benefits in treating obesity and diabetes still outweigh the risks for prescribed users.</p>

These factors, combined with restrictive zoning, the deinstitutionalization of mental health care without community support, and soaring housing prices, created a perfect storm where a lack of affordable housing became the central driver of mass homelessness.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' shares surged after the company reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and provided a stronger-than-expected forecast for summer travel. CEO Ed Bastian stated that while booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, demand has stabilized, particularly for premium seats and corporate travel. The airline's revenue from higher-priced cabins and its American Express partnership showed strong growth, offsetting a decline in main cabin sales. This positive report from the first major U.S. airline to release quarterly results has boosted confidence across the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The death toll has climbed to at least 120, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River swelled to unprecedented levels. The disaster, which tragically impacted a girls' summer camp, has prompted a federal disaster declaration to support the ongoing efforts of local, state, and volunteer crews.

          <p>In an opinion piece, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva argues that abandoning globalization in response to current world crises would be a grave mistake. He contends that the international order is collapsing due to the trivialization of illegal force, the failure to address atrocities, and economic policies that deepen inequality. However, he asserts that the solution is not to "deplanetise" but to rebuild multilateralism on fairer, more inclusive foundations that reflect today's global realities. He calls for a renewed commitment to diplomacy to address shared challenges like poverty, war, and climate change.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has called for restricting access to disability and sickness benefits to British citizens only, describing the country's rising welfare bill as a "ticking time bomb." In a speech, she argued that it is reasonable to expect individuals to become citizens before accessing such support. The proposal aims to create a clear policy distinction from the Labour government, which recently scaled back its own planned welfare cuts, and from Reform UK. Labour criticized the plan, warning it could lead to reciprocal actions against British citizens abroad.</p>

While birth rates have been falling for centuries, the global population is projected to peak and then enter a continuous freefall, which Spears contends is not a solution to environmental problems. He makes the case that more people lead to more innovation, knowledge, and shared infrastructure, and that society should have a thoughtful conversation about creating conditions, such as greater gender equality, that make it easier for people to choose to have children.</p>

The motion cited concerns over transparency in COVID-19 vaccine procurement, but von der Leyen's political partners used the opportunity to critique her perceived cooperation with the right and perceived backsliding on climate goals.
