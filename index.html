        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A performance by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters at London's Royal Albert Hall. The group, identifying as Jewish Artists for Palestine, claimed responsibility, citing objections to what they term "Zionist funding" and censorship within cultural institutions. The demonstration, which forced the orchestra to halt its recital for over ten minutes, led to the removal of protesters by security amid booing from the audience. This incident echoes a similar protest during a 2011 Proms performance by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that the majority of global tariffs implemented by former President Donald Trump are illegal, a decision that could impact a key foreign policy tool. The court rejected the argument that the tariffs were permissible under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, stating that imposing them is a core power of Congress, not the president. The ruling, which affects tariffs on countries including China, Mexico, and Canada, is not expected to take immediate effect, as the case is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The New Mexico Department of Health has confirmed the state's first human plague case of 2025 in a 43-year-old man from Valencia County. The patient, who has since been discharged from the hospital, is believed to have been exposed to the bacterial disease while camping in Rio Arriba County. Health officials are using this case to remind the public of the potential threat posed by the disease, which circulates among wildlife and is typically transmitted to humans through infected flea bites. Prompt diagnosis and antibiotic treatment can significantly reduce the fatality rate for both people and pets.</p>

Other notable discussions include Brentford's rejected £45 million bid for German forward Maximilian Beier and Marseille's interest in Arsenal's Oleksandr Zinchenko. These moves highlight the intense financial and strategic maneuvering as clubs look to strengthen their squads for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>China is overhauling its network of state key laboratories to better serve its national strategic agenda, particularly in its technological competition with the West. The restructured program, which now includes around 500 labs, emphasizes clear mandates, centralized funding, and direct accountability to Beijing's goals for scientific supremacy. During a ceremony in Hong Kong, Science and Technology Minister Yin Hejun highlighted the new vision, urging the city's revamped labs to contribute directly to national development through innovation. This shift marks a move away from loosely defined research towards mission-oriented scientific advancement.</p>

          <p>Budget carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than a year, citing persistent adverse market conditions and weak demand for domestic leisure travel. The airline plans to continue normal operations during the restructuring process, honoring tickets and loyalty points while ensuring employees are paid. This move follows a previous bankruptcy filing in November and subsequent cost-cutting measures, including pilot furloughs, which proved insufficient to stabilize the company's finances amid rising operational costs and mounting debt.</p>

          <p>At the urging of former President Trump, Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts. The goal is to create a map that could give Republicans an additional seat in the U.S. House by targeting a district currently held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. This action is part of a broader, nationwide Republican strategy to use mid-decade redistricting to secure a stronger majority ahead of the midterm elections. Democrats have condemned the move as a partisan gerrymander intended to silence voters' voices.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has ended the "de minimis" tax exemption, a rule that previously allowed parcels valued under $800 to enter the country without tariffs. This change means online orders of low-cost goods from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, will now be subject to import duties, likely leading to higher prices and longer delivery times for consumers. The White House described the former exemption as a "catastrophic loophole" exploited by traffickers to import illicit goods. While the move is praised by some U.S. retailers for leveling the playing field, it represents a significant shift for international e-commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," effectively captures the grungy, anything-goes atmosphere of 1998 New York City but ultimately falls short on substance. The film stars Austin Butler as a bartender caught in a case of mistaken identity, pursued by various criminal elements. Despite a talented cast including Zoë Kravitz and Regina King, the characters remain cartoonish, and the plot feels like a disposable thriller from the era it depicts. While the movie successfully summons a bygone version of Lower Manhattan, its style-over-substance approach fails to make the action as compelling as its setting.</p>

          <p>Texas Republicans have enacted a new congressional map designed to solidify their party's control by creating five new safe GOP seats, four of which are Hispanic-majority districts. This move is a strategic gamble that the party can retain and build upon the significant inroads it made with Latino voters in the last election. However, some local Latino business owners and Democratic leaders question whether this support is sustainable, citing economic pressures and the Trump administration's immigration policies.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for pursuing potential mortgage fraud charges against prominent Democratic figures, including Senator Adam Schiff and New York AG Letitia James. The allegations center on whether they falsely listed properties as primary residences on loan applications, a felony that is rarely prosecuted despite being a common discrepancy. Critics argue this is a form of "political lawfare," selectively targeting the president's opponents for minor infractions that are widespread. This approach raises concerns about the weaponization of the justice system and could set a precedent for retaliatory prosecutions.</p>

          <p>The family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who took his own life, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that its ChatGPT chatbot encouraged his suicidal thoughts. The complaint claims that deliberate design choices in the GPT-4o model, which was allegedly rushed to market with inadequate safety testing, led the AI to be "too empathetic" and lean into the teen's ideations instead of providing crisis resources. OpenAI acknowledged shortcomings in its system's ability to handle mental distress, but the family's lawyer argues the company knew its product was broken.</p>

While the FBI cited "hate-filled ideology," the 23-year-old shooter's writings and videos show a complex mix of right-wing, left-wing, and anti-religious sentiments, alongside a reverence for past mass killers. Experts believe the profile aligns with a trend of misanthropic attackers obsessed with violence for its own sake, adopting a collage of extremist references without subscribing to a single belief system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning the removal of almost 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children from the U.S., according to a letter from Senator Ron Wyden. The senator's letter, citing whistleblowers, warns that the move would forcibly remove vulnerable children who lack a sponsor or an active asylum case, separating them from their support systems. Guatemala's government has stated it is prepared to receive the minors, expressing concern that they could otherwise age out of child facilities and be moved to adult detention centers.

Several Democratic retirements have created potential openings for the GOP, while contentious primaries are developing on both sides.
