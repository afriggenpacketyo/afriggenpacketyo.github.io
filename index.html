          <p>A child has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, a death confirmed amid a significant regional and national surge in cases. Health officials attribute the rise to declining uptake of the MMR vaccine, with vaccination rates in some areas falling well below the 95% target recommended by the World Health Organization. The hospital has seen a spike in seriously unwell children being admitted, prompting urgent calls from medical experts for parents to ensure their children are vaccinated against the highly contagious and potentially fatal virus.</p>

          <p>The one-year anniversary of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, brings renewed focus on the systemic failures within the U.S. Secret Service. The attack, which killed fire chief Corey Comperatore, prompted multiple investigations that revealed significant gaps in intelligence, coordination, and resources. While the Secret Service has since outlined 37 reform measures, experts argue that persistent budget and staffing shortfalls dating back to its post-9/11 integration into the Department of Homeland Security have left the agency overstretched and vulnerable.</p>

          <p>Tensions between China and India have flared over the succession plan for the 14th Dalai Lama, potentially threatening a recent improvement in their diplomatic relations. The dispute was ignited by an Indian minister's statement that only the Dalai Lama can identify his successor, followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday greetings to the exiled spiritual leader. Beijing responded with formal protests, asserting that the succession must follow Chinese law and tradition, and reiterating its view of the Dalai Lama as an anti-China separatist.

The technology allows scientists to remotely control the jellyfish's movements, directing them to collect environmental data on temperature and pressure in specific locations. Because jellyfish lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, the process is considered humane, and the low-cost, scalable nature of the project could make sophisticated ocean research more accessible. The team is now working on improving the device's durability for deep-sea conditions and enabling horizontal steering.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that American society has become confused about heroism, preferring on-screen superheroes to real-life leaders with integrity. The author contends that a shift from celebrating great public contributions to valuing flimsy fame has eroded political courage, citing recent congressional votes on the 'Big Beautiful Bill' as a prime example. Several politicians are called out for voting in favor of the legislation despite their previous strong stances against its core tenets, such as deficit spending and cuts to Medicaid. The author suggests this behavior reflects a broader moral decay and cowardice in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Recent college graduates are encountering one of the most difficult job markets in the past decade, excluding the pandemic era, as employers remain cautious about hiring. Factors contributing to the struggle include job cuts in the federal government and tech sector, as well as general economic uncertainty that has slowed hiring across the board. Many graduates are finding fewer opportunities and are having to accept jobs with lower salaries than they had anticipated. Economists suggest that while the initial job search is tough, a college degree remains a valuable long-term investment that typically pays off over a graduate's career.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney General has ordered the dismissal of all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore Jr., a Utah doctor accused of destroying COVID-19 vaccines and distributing fraudulent vaccination cards. The indictment, brought under the Biden administration, alleged that Dr. Moore destroyed thousands of vaccine doses and provided fake certificates for cash, as well as giving children saline shots at their parents' request. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the charges were dropped because Dr. Moore 'gave his patients a choice,' a decision praised by Republican politicians who had advocated on his behalf.</p>

          <p>A campaign is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English rather than the standard Latin-based scientific names to better protect people with severe allergies. Proponents, including a Member of Parliament with a nut allergy, argue that the current system, known as INCI, is inaccessible to most consumers who cannot recognize allergens like 'Arachis Hypogaea' as peanut oil. While the industry defends the Latin system for providing a universal global standard, families affected by allergic reactions say clear, plain-language labeling, similar to food packaging, is essential to prevent potentially life-threatening situations.</p>

This new role has unlocked his potential, leading to a career-best season in terms of goals and assists. Enrique's system and belief in Dembélé have been pivotal, turning a player once seen as a liability into one of the world's most effective attackers.</p>

          <p>The murder of Aileen Seiden in a Florida motel room has exposed the violent and volatile nature of her 'throuple' relationship with Zachary Abell and Christina Araujo. Investigators pieced together a story of jealousy, control, and escalating abuse that culminated in Seiden's brutal death. Araujo took a plea deal and testified that Abell led the fatal assault, which was sparked by an innocuous comment and fueled by alcohol. Abell's defense claimed Araujo was the sole murderer, driven by jealousy. Ultimately, a jury found Abell guilty of second-degree murder, matching Araujo's plea, leaving many questions about the tragic dynamic unanswered.</p>

          <p>China's kindergartens are facing an existential crisis due to a dramatic plunge in the nation's birth rate, leading to widespread closures and adaptation for survival. The number of children enrolled in preschools has dropped by over 25% since its peak in 2020, resulting in the closure of nearly 40,000 kindergartens. To cope, some institutions, including historically exclusive government-affiliated ones, are now forced to recruit from the general public. This demographic shift is creating significant economic strain on the early childhood education sector across the country.</p>

          <p>Audio captured by a neighbor's security camera played a crucial role in the conviction of Melissa Turner for the murder of her boyfriend, Matthew Trussler. While Turner claimed she stabbed Trussler in self-defense after he strangled her, the surveillance footage recorded loud, angry female screams and phrases like 'So f****** die' coming from the couple's home. Prosecutors argued this, along with footage from an in-home camera showing Turner's angry demeanor, contradicted her self-defense narrative. The jury ultimately found Turner guilty of second-degree murder, and she was sentenced to over 20 years in prison.</p>

The article contends that with Ukraine short on manpower and ammunition, and facing an unreliable US under Donald Trump, the most likely outcomes are a stalemated forever war or a Russian victory.
