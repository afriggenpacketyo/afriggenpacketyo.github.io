          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, asserting it infringes on the president's powers under Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Johnson stated that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear targets was within his constitutional authority. He also indicated that a resolution aimed at preventing unauthorized U.S. military action in Iran would likely fail in the House. Johnson mentioned that Representative Massie, who introduced the resolution, might reconsider in light of the announced ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Beginner gold investors should strategically consider key decisions before July, as the price of gold could potentially surge to new records. Investors should consider whether to wait for a price drop, although the potential for a significant drop is low. They should also determine how much of their portfolio to allocate to gold, typically around 10%, based on their goals and risk tolerance. Finally, it's crucial to assess whether gold aligns with their portfolio needs, such as diversification or hedging against inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The family of the victim will receive compensation, marking the first time a French court has linked a person's death to the state's negligence in such cases.

          <p>After Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested that President Trump's decision to bomb Iran could be grounds for impeachment, Trump attacked her on social media. Ocasio-Cortez responded with a humorous message, deflecting the insults and criticizing Trump's actions in Iran. She also corrected him about her connection to Queens. The exchange highlighted the ongoing political tensions and differing views on the president's foreign policy decisions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to managing the conflict between Iran and Israel has been marked by frequent social media posts, ranging from bellicose to conciliatory. After announcing a ceasefire, Trump quickly demanded that Israel cease bombing Iran. His real-time commentary has provided unfiltered views on the war. Despite criticism, the Israeli ambassador to the United States defended Trump's social media statements as a comprehensive strategy. Experts, however, remain concerned about the potential challenges to a lasting ceasefire due to Trump's impulsiveness.</p>

          <p>Florida officials are developing a migrant detention center in the Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," due to its location surrounded by the wetland ecosystem. The facility, proposed by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, aims to support the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. The detention center is expected to open in early July with a capacity of 5,000 beds, eventually expanding to 10,000. Environmental organizations and immigration advocates have raised concerns about the project's impact on the Everglades and the well-being of the detainees.</p>

Powell explained that the Fed expects tariff inflation to increase but is unsure how much will be passed on to consumers. The Fed left interest rates unchanged, signaling two potential rate cuts later in the year. Powell cited low unemployment, rising wages, and "decent" economic growth as reasons to maintain current borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>
