        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to permit President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. This request for emergency relief aims to freeze a lower court's decision that had ordered Cook's reinstatement. Solicitor General J. John Sauer argues that the lower court's ruling represents "improper judicial interference" with the President's authority to remove Fed members for cause. This developing story highlights a significant legal challenge concerning executive power and the independence of the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, accusing them of "illegal" ticket resale tactics. The lawsuit, joined by seven states, alleges the companies tacitly collaborated with scalpers to inflate profits and used a "bait and switch" approach to ticket pricing. The FTC claims Ticketmaster "triple dips" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers across both primary and secondary markets, generating billions in revenue. This legal action aims to address practices that allegedly cost ordinary fans millions and frustrate artists' efforts to maintain affordable ticket prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has carried out its first deportation of a small boat migrant to France under a new "one in one out" pilot scheme. An Indian national was removed on Thursday morning, marking an initial step in the year-long agreement designed to deter illegal English Channel crossings. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated this action sends a clear message that illegal entry will lead to removal, despite ongoing legal challenges and concerns raised by the anti-slavery commissioner about the system's potential for abuse. The scheme also anticipates the first arrivals from France to the UK under a new asylum route soon.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett indicated the White House's approval of the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its key borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point. Despite some administration officials, including new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, advocating for a larger half-point reduction, Hassett described the 25-basis-point cut as "prudent policy" and a "good first step." President Trump, who has previously criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more aggressively, has yet to comment.

          <p>Scientists have identified a "mileage clock" within the brain, observing how specific cells in rats' brains "fired" in a pattern correlating with distance traveled. This discovery, made by recording brain activity in running rats, indicates how our internal map estimates distance. Further experiments with human volunteers suggest a similar mechanism exists in the human brain. Disrupting this internal clock, such as by altering the environment, causes both rats and humans to misjudge distances, akin to navigating in fog. This research offers crucial insights into how the brain navigates and what happens when this internal system malfunctions.</p>

          <p>American soybean farmers are experiencing significant financial losses due to the absence of Chinese orders, a direct consequence of reciprocal tariffs in the US-China trade dispute. Mike McCranie, a South Dakota farmer, described the situation as "walking a tightrope," supporting President Trump's tariff policy only "if it results in a long-term deal." China's overall tariff rate on US soybeans reached 34% in August, effectively pricing American produce out of the market. Farmers are hopeful for a trade agreement to alleviate the "pain in the market" and secure their livelihoods. This article highlights the real-world economic impact of trade tensions.

          <p>Car prices remain near record highs largely because automakers are increasingly focusing on high-end vehicles, with the share of new cars sold over $50,000 nearly doubling since 2019. Wealthier customers, benefiting from rising house values, stock market returns, and favorable credit, are predominantly driving these sales. Conversely, lower- and middle-income buyers are increasingly priced out of the market. Experts warn that companies' growing reliance on a smaller segment of affluent consumers could have "dramatic implications across the economy" if this market segment weakens. This article explores the economic stratification influencing the automotive industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities have implemented measures discouraging or banning meat-based foods, causing challenges for meat-eaters in daily life. The article explores how vegetarianism is often linked to Hindu cultural identity, sometimes ignoring diverse food practices and stigmatizing minorities. Despite the perception, only about 40% of Indian adults identify as vegetarian, with 80% consuming some form of meat, highlighting the complex interplay of food, caste, and social hierarchy.</p>

The new housing secretary, Steve Reed, acknowledged the figures as "unacceptable" and vowed to overhaul the planning system.
