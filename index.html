        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while the assassination of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk is a condemnable act of political violence, it is crucial not to rewrite his controversial history in death. The author criticizes commentators, including some on the center-left, for creating hagiographies that misrepresent Kirk's political activities as good-faith debate, when they were often aggressive and aimed at humiliating opponents. The piece contends that an honest accounting of his life must include his opposition to the Civil Rights Act and his promotion of hateful rhetoric against various minority groups. The author asserts that condemning his murder should not require lying about the divisive and harmful nature of his political work.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 09:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the Israeli public's detachment from the realities of the two-year Gaza war, where Palestinian suffering remains abstract and daily life continues largely uninterrupted. It examines how the conflict is sustained by a militarized economy and a shift in public discourse towards mythical, victim-centric narratives. The analysis also explores a new book by former negotiators Hussein Agha and Robert Malley, which argues that the peace process was flawed from the start by ignoring the deep-rooted historical and existential identities of both Israelis and Palestinians. The author concludes that recognizing Palestinian rights as a starting point, rather than an end goal, is crucial for breaking the cycle of violence and fatalism.</p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are experiencing heightened fear and anxiety following a Supreme Court ruling that enables federal agents to conduct warrantless raids, with the Department of Homeland Security vowing to "flood the zone." The ruling has placed undocumented workers, particularly day laborers, in a precarious position, forcing them to choose between risking deportation by going to work or facing eviction by staying home. Community organizers and volunteer groups are mobilizing to protect residents by monitoring for ICE activity and providing information on legal rights. The situation highlights the severe economic and emotional toll on families who live under the constant threat of being separated.</p>

          <p>West Yorkshire Police are searching for a suspected metal thief, Jacob Ryan, after an explosion destroyed an empty house in Bradford and damaged two neighboring properties. The blast, which occurred late Saturday night, resulted in minor injuries to a man, woman, and child in an adjacent home. Another 27-year-old man, found seriously injured nearby, has been arrested on suspicion of theft in connection with the incident. Authorities believe the two men were attempting to steal metal from the unoccupied property when the explosion was triggered and are urging the suspect at large to come forward, as he may also be injured.</p>

          <h2>UK Minister States Far-Right Figures Are Tapping into National Disquiet After London Protests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK cabinet minister, Peter Kyle, has stated that figures like far-right activist Tommy Robinson are successfully tapping into a widespread "sense of disquiet and grievance" across the country. This comment followed a "Unite the Kingdom" rally in London, which drew up to 150,000 participants and was met by a counter-protest of about 5,000 people. The day resulted in 26 police officers being injured and 24 arrests as tensions flared between the groups. The business secretary suggested these events are "klaxon calls" for the government to address public concerns, including immigration, and criticized Elon Musk's video-linked appearance at the rally as "totally inappropriate."</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived in Israel for a two-day visit to address diplomatic tensions following an Israeli airstrike in Doha, Qatar, that killed several Hamas operatives and a Qatari security officer. The strike, which President Trump was reportedly "not happy about," has complicated efforts to broker a ceasefire and has drawn international condemnation. Rubio's visit aims to balance criticism of the attack with a message of overall support for Israel, particularly as several key allies prepare to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The visit coincides with an intensified Israeli military campaign in Gaza City, where airstrikes have flattened residential towers and killed dozens of Palestinians in recent days.</p>

McIlroy revealed that players could customize the level of vitriol, stating he told the programmers to "go as far as you want."

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, experts are weighing in on key storylines and potential outcomes, with a significant focus on the Minnesota Lynx's quest for a championship. After a controversial loss in the 2024 finals, the Lynx are seen by many as being on a "revenge tour," anchored by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier and the league's top defense. Other notable predictions include the Las Vegas Aces, led by A'ja Wilson, as strong contenders for a third title in four years. The absence of rookies Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark from the postseason is viewed as a mixed bag, potentially allowing other league talent to shine without the intense media focus on the duo.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called for Prince Andrew to be fully investigated over allegations that he sexually abused her. In an interview with the BBC, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that every person, regardless of royal status, should be held to the fullest extent of the law and that the Duke of York has not faced sufficient consequences. Giuffre alleged that Epstein introduced her to Prince Andrew when she was 17, leading to three instances of sexual abuse. While the Prince has consistently denied the claims and reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022, the family insists that his loss of titles and public shaming are not enough.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the event as an "obvious expansion of the war by Russia," while Moscow has not commented.

CBS News recently appointed a Trump ally as its ombudsman following the acquisition of its parent company, Paramount, by the Trump-friendly Ellison family, who are now reportedly seeking to buy CNN's parent company. Concurrently, a settlement in the Murdoch family ensures that Fox News will maintain its conservative direction for decades.

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of far-right activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, a state law permitting concealed-carry permit holders to have firearms on college campuses is facing renewed scrutiny. The law, HB 128, which passed just last month, has been highlighted in the national conversation about the incident, although it is still unclear if the suspected shooter was legally carrying the weapon. Utah has some of the nation's most permissive gun laws, including permitless carry and a lack of "red-flag" laws, reflecting a legislative approach that favors gun access as a deterrent. Critics argue this approach is inadequate against politically motivated violence and creates significant safety challenges for securing public events.</p>

Parents striving to follow MAHA's principles face higher costs, more time-consuming shopping at multiple stores, and the challenge of finding compliant foods like seed-oil-free baby formula.

The book, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, lists figures like Trump and Bill Clinton as "friends" and includes crude drawings, fueling questions about how widely Epstein's proclivities were known within his elite circle.

They describe feeling as though they are "on death row," losing family members, and witnessing the collapse of social order, all while feeling abandoned by international law. They urge the world not to wait until they are killed to document their cases and to pressure governments to end the war.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is amplifying fears that the United States is entering a more dangerous era of political violence. The killing is the latest in a growing list of attacks on political figures, with data showing a nearly 40% increase in terrorism and targeted violence plots in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year. Experts compare the current climate to the 1960s but note that modern social media and the availability of lethal weapons make it more perilous. As prominent right-wing voices call for retribution, officials like Utah's governor worry the event could be the "beginning of a darker chapter" if the cycle of inflammatory rhetoric is not broken.</p>

          <p>A bold plan by Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, to eliminate all vaccine mandates in the state has significantly faltered following widespread backlash and criticism from former President Donald Trump. Ladapo had announced an effort to end all vaccine requirements, but Trump publicly defended the efficacy of vaccines for diseases like measles, stating they "pure and simple work." In response to the criticism, the Florida health department has walked back the initial proposal, now only seeking to remove mandates for vaccines not required for school entry, such as for chickenpox and hepatitis B. The state's Republican-led legislature has so far shown little enthusiasm for pursuing a broader repeal.</p>

          <p>This article features recommendations from The Atlantic's staff for five nonfiction books that are as engaging and propulsive as great fiction. The selections include Patricia Lockwood's surreal memoir "Priestdaddy," which chronicles her return to her eccentric Catholic priest father's home. Also recommended is Patrick Radden Keefe's "Say Nothing," a masterful investigation into a murder during the Troubles in Northern Ireland that unfolds like a mystery novel. Other picks are Åsne Seierstad's "One of Us," a haunting account of the 2011 Norway terror attacks; Kerry Howley's "Bottoms Up and the Devil Laughs"; and Barbara Demick's "Eat the Buddha."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This advice column addresses a reader struggling with scrupulosity, the obsessive worry about one's own morality, which can be paralyzing rather than motivating. The author uses rabbinic stories to argue against the mindset of moral optimization, suggesting it is an unrealistic standard for imperfect humans and can lead to burnout. Instead of striving for perfection, the column advises adopting a humbler goal of living in line with one's values and practicing self-compassion when falling short. This approach, supported by psychological research, can lead to greater personal responsibility and growth, reframing religious observances not as days of terrifying judgment but as opportunities for human growth.</p>

          <p>Nepal's new interim Prime Minister, Sushila Karki, has vowed to end corruption and restore calm following violent youth-led protests that ousted her predecessor and left at least 72 people dead. In her first public address, the former chief justice acknowledged that she was chosen by the "Gen Z" activists and promised to address their demands for good governance and economic equality. Karki, installed after protesters organized via the social media platform Discord, stated her interim government would not remain for more than six months.

They accuse the prime minister of stalling negotiations and using excuses to cling to power at the expense of the hostages' lives.

          <p>In this personal essay, a woman recounts her family's relationship with Kelvin, the biological father of her three adopted daughters, who was incarcerated for armed robbery. While in prison, Kelvin underwent significant rehabilitation, earning certifications, taking parenting classes, and maintaining a positive relationship with his children. Despite his transformation and having served his time, he was immediately taken into ICE custody upon parole and deported to El Salvador due to an old order. There, he was imprisoned under brutal conditions, effectively condemning him to a life sentence. The author argues that deporting a rehabilitated individual is not only inhumane but also a waste of the state's investment in his recovery.</p>

          <p>According to Chinese defense scientists, a new artificial intelligence-powered anti-submarine warfare (ASW) system could reduce a submarine's probability of escaping detection and attack to just 5%. The system moves beyond traditional search patterns, acting as an intelligent commander that synthesizes data from multiple sources in real-time. It integrates information from sonar buoys, underwater sensors, radar, and even environmental factors like ocean temperature and salinity. This allows the AI to create a comprehensive, live operational picture of the undersea environment, significantly enhancing its ability to track and target enemy submarines.</p>

While continuing the populist welfare programs of her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, she has carved her own path with a more diplomatic tone and a more aggressive security strategy against drug cartels. However, significant challenges loom, particularly in her relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, whose tariff threats have slowed Mexico's economy. Sheinbaum has navigated these pressures by making concessions on immigration while firmly asserting Mexican sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by university scholars warns that the Colorado River's major reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are so depleted that another dry year could push them to crisis levels. The researchers are urging the Trump administration to take immediate action and impose significant water use reductions across the seven states that depend on the river. Following a meager snowpack last winter, the report finds that if the upcoming year is similarly dry, water use would far exceed the river's natural flow, risking a severe water shortage. The experts argue that waiting for states to negotiate new rules is too slow and that federally mandated cuts are needed now to avoid "draconian measures" later.</p>

The probe was spearheaded by a young agent, Leah Marx, who went undercover in 2010 to investigate inmate complaints. When the Sheriff's Department discovered a contraband cellphone planted by the FBI on an inmate informant, Baca and his top officials launched an aggressive campaign to obstruct the federal investigation. This included hiding the informant and threatening the FBI agent, which ultimately led to the conviction of 22 department members, including Baca himself, for obstruction of justice.</p>
