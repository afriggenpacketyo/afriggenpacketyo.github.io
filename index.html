          <p>China has expressed its concern and regret over the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, urging both nations to exercise restraint and prioritize regional peace and stability. This statement was issued following India's military strikes on alleged terrorist camps inside Pakistan, which Pakistan claims resulted in casualties and infrastructure damage. China, as a neighbor to both countries, emphasizes the importance of maintaining calm and avoiding actions that could further complicate the situation. China opposes all forms of terrorism and calls for both India and Pakistan to prioritize the overall situation of peace and stability. Relevant context is that India and Pakistan have a history of conflict and heightened tensions in the Kashmir region.</p>

          <p>In his first interview since leaving office, former President Joe Biden expressed strong disapproval of Donald Trump's foreign policy, particularly his treatment of America's allies and his approach to Ukraine. Biden emphasized the importance of the Atlantic Alliance and NATO, viewing Trump's actions as a threat to the peace and security established over the past eight decades. Biden criticized Trump's comments about acquiring Greenland and pressuring Ukraine, stating that such behavior is "beneath America." He also voiced concerns that European leaders are questioning America's reliability and leadership on the global stage, fearing the erosion of democracy worldwide.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's military has reclassified the mausoleums of Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, as "camp areas," signaling a move away from honoring the former Kuomintang leaders. This decision by the island's independence-leaning authorities represents a continued effort to diminish the legacy of Chiang Kai-shek. The revised guidelines reflect updated administrative needs and the 2014 reclassification of Taoyuan as a metropolitan area, the military said in its announcement. This shift is part of a broader trend in Taiwan to grapple with and redefine its historical identity.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor, critiques Stephen Miran's "Mar-a-Lago Accord," a plan to weaken the dollar by coordinating with trading partners, arguing that it's based on a flawed understanding of trade deficits. Rogoff contends that while the dollar's reserve currency status contributes to trade imbalances, it is not the sole factor. He points out that historical data indicates that countries with reserve currencies can still run current account surpluses. The article suggests that addressing the fiscal deficit and strengthening the American economy are more effective solutions than implementing tariffs. </p>

This operation, labeled "Operation Sindoor," follows a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed.

However, this resilience is built on a fundamental dependence on foreign financial assistance, as Ukraine lacks the domestic resources to meet the enormous costs of the war. The recent minerals agreement with the United States, while seen as a victory for Ukraine, highlights this dependency, as it grants the US advantageous terms for accessing Ukraine's mineral wealth.

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing ongoing delays and cancellations due to a shortage of air traffic controllers and equipment failures.

          <p>US and Chinese officials are set to begin talks this week to try to deescalate a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks in Switzerland from 9 to 12 May. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer will represent Washington at the meeting, their offices announced. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods of up to 145%. Beijing has hit back with levies on some goods from the US of 125%. But global trade experts have told the BBC that they expect negotiations to take several months.</p>

Despite Trump's claim of success, it remained unclear whether the United States had achieved its objective of stopping the Houthis from impeding international shipping after a costly seven-week bombing campaign.
