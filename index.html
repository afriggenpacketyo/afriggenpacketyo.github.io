          <p>Chinese electric carmaker Nio's shares surged over 14% in Hong Kong, extending a seven-session gain. This rally follows the recent unveiling of its new ES8 SUV, priced affordably at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan. The company is strategically expanding into mass-market and youth-oriented segments with new brands, Onvo and Firefly, to navigate intense competition in China's EV sector. This article highlights Nio's efforts to broaden its customer base beyond its traditional high-end market focus.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspaper front pages highlight public concern over Sir Keir Starmer's handling of asylum seekers housed in hotels, with a YouGov poll indicating widespread dissatisfaction. Another significant report details the Trump administration's alleged prevention of Ukraine using long-range US-made missiles against Russia, aiming to force negotiations. Ukrainian President Zelensky, however, downplayed these restrictions, citing Ukraine's development of its own long-range weaponry. Additionally, the Daily Star celebrates a rain-free August Bank Holiday Monday forecast for the UK mainland, predicting temperatures up to 29C.</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after the state's infant mortality rate reached its highest in over a decade, nearly doubling the national average. The declaration aims to accelerate efforts to address the crisis, which disproportionately affects Black infants and is linked to structural inequities, poverty, and healthcare access issues. Proposed solutions include expanding prenatal services, creating regional obstetric care systems, and strengthening community health programs. Federal funding cuts to vital maternal and infant health initiatives are complicating the state's response, with potential Medicaid changes further exacerbating the problem.</p>

          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of defense tech company Anduril, argues that AI-powered autonomous weapons represent the future of warfare, aiming to replace outdated military technology. He contends these "smart weapons," like the Roadrunner drone interceptor and Fury fighter jet, can analyze, move assets, and execute missions faster than humans, ultimately saving American lives by reducing the need for human deployment. Despite concerns from international groups who label them "killer robots," Luckey asserts all Anduril weapons have a "kill switch" and promote peace through deterrence. His company, which has secured over $6 billion in government contracts, seeks to disrupt the traditional defense industry by developing products with private capital before seeking government procurement.</p>

          <p>Nine Palestinian students in Gaza, including Chevening scholars, have received notification from the UK government about facilitated evacuation to pursue university studies, a first since the war began. These students, like Mahmoud who hopes his global health policy degree will aid Gaza's healthcare system, face immense emotional challenges, including the prospect of leaving their families behind in perilous conditions. Despite this positive step, dozens of other scholarship recipients remain in limbo, highlighting concerns about bureaucratic hurdles and unequal consideration. The situation underscores the devastating impact of the conflict on education and future prospects for Gazan youth.</p>

          <p>Victims of violent cartels in Ecuador are seeking asylum in the US, but face increasing difficulties under evolving immigration policies. Gabriela, who fled after her family endured kidnapping and murder by gangs, is among millions with pending asylum claims. US asylum law, based on persecution criteria, often struggles to accommodate cases driven by cartel violence, despite its systemic nature. While the Biden administration repealed some Trump-era restrictions, the legal framework remains challenging. Concerns also exist that Trump's designation of some cartels as terrorist organizations could inadvertently complicate asylum for victims forced to pay extortions, potentially categorizing them as having provided "material support."</p>

          <p>Lourdes, France, is a renowned Catholic sanctuary where over 70 medical miracles have been recognized by the Church in 163 years, drawing millions of pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, conducts decade-long investigations into claims of cures. Cases are deemed miraculous if they involve severe diseases, sudden, complete, and lasting cures with no possible medical explanation. Despite initial skepticism about historical rigor, independent analyses, like Dr. Esther Sternberg's, have found the office's conclusions credible, based on increasingly rigorous medical documentation and long-term patient follow-up.</p>

This crucial information, turned over to the FBI after 9/11, was never shared with field agents or top intelligence officials, raising questions about investigative failures. Bayoumi, identified as a Saudi intelligence operative with ties to two hijackers, also possessed an airplane sketch and math formula for calculating descent rates, which was only discovered years later.

          <p>Anduril Industries has unveiled Fury, an autonomous AI-powered fighter jet designed to operate without a pilot, marking a significant leap in unmanned combat aircraft. Co-founder Brian Schimpf showcased the cockpit-less jet, explaining it uses advanced software to sense and react in airspace, working collaboratively with manned aircraft to detect enemies and protect pilots. Fury's design incorporates common, readily available parts, aiming for easier and cheaper mass production than traditional fighter jets. This development is part of Anduril's broader vision to remake the U.S. military with AI-driven systems, with Fury scheduled for its first test flight this summer and full operational status by decade's end.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify deploying federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, overriding local authority. This move follows similar deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, despite statistics showing crime rates declining in many major cities. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the plan as a "flagrant violation of our constitution." Trump, however, insists Chicago residents are "screaming for us to come" and views the deployments as necessary for public safety. State and local leaders emphasize that the National Guard is not meant for municipal policing and that such federal intervention is illegal without a governor's request.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with Christine Bordine assuming the acting role. No official reason was given, but the move follows the DIA's preliminary assessment of strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, which contradicted President Trump's public statements. This assessment, indicating a setback of months rather than decades and pre-strike movement of uranium, reportedly caused backlash from the administration. Democratic Senator Mark Warner criticized the firing as another instance of the Trump administration treating intelligence as a loyalty test, raising widespread concerns among DIA employees about politicization of their work.</p>

However, many online commenters and experts, including a renewable energy engineer, argued that Level 1 charging with manufacturer-supplied equipment is generally permissible under NEC 625.

          <p>Corpus Christi city officials are considering reinstating a street maintenance fee, eliminated in 2024, to address a projected $15 million shortfall for residential street repairs in fiscal year 2027. The previous fee, around $5.30 per month, generated $12 million annually but was not adjusted for inflation. Staff now recommend reimplementing it at approximately $6.60, which could cover the funding gap. While some council members support the fee's return, Mayor Paulette Guajardo and Councilman Gil Hernandez advocate for alternative funding, such as bond programs or adjusting reserve balances, to avoid increasing utility bills, which are already slated for other increases.
