          <p>Senate Republicans are struggling to secure enough votes to pass a massive tax and spending bill central to President Donald Trump's agenda ahead of a July 4th deadline. The passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" is in jeopardy as at least three Republican senatorsâ€”Ron Johnson, Thom Tillis, and Rand Paulâ€”have announced their opposition. With a narrow majority, the party leadership cannot afford these defections, placing intense focus on centrists like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. The legislation aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts while also making significant changes to welfare programs.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman experienced a likely shark bite while in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York.

          <p>The Senate's version of the "big, beautiful bill" backed by President Trump contains several key provisions with wide-ranging impacts. It aims to make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and introduces new temporary breaks for tip income and overtime pay, which primarily benefit upper-income families. A significant change involves raising the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for some households. The bill also includes deep cuts to Medicaid, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that proposed work requirements could cause millions to lose health insurance coverage.

          <p>A mudslide triggered by heavy rains caused a complete shutdown of the northbound West Virginia Turnpike, stranding thousands of motorists for more than eight hours overnight. Traffic was backed up for 12 miles, and authorities failed to establish a detour, forcing drivers to remain in their vehicles without information or resources. The West Virginia Parkways Authority has taken full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic, calling the situation unacceptable and vowing to revise its emergency procedures.

The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP statute, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit alleges that Trump defamed the men by falsely stating during a presidential debate that they had pled guilty and killed someone. This ruling allows the case, which centers on events from decades ago, to proceed against the former president.</p>

          <p>Police in Phoenix, Arizona, rescued a baby who had been left alone for several days in an apartment after the infant's mother died. Officers forced entry into the home after a neighbor reported not hearing from the woman, who had recently given birth. They found the baby on a bed, visibly emaciated, and the mother deceased on the floor. The infant was rushed to a hospital for lifesaving care and is now expected to make a full recovery, while the cause of the mother's death is under investigation.</p>

          <p>Wall Street concluded a strong week with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing at new record highs, demonstrating resilience in the face of significant geopolitical risk. The market largely shrugged off news of U.S. military action in Iran, betting that the conflict would not escalate into a systemic economic threat. This optimism was bolstered by a sharp drop in oil prices, which eased concerns about inflation and consumer spending. Investor focus also turned to potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest Supreme Court term concluded with a series of significant victories for conservative states and a strengthening of former President Trump's claims of executive power. The court's 6-3 conservative majority issued rulings that give states more authority to restrict gender-affirming care, deny Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood, and enforce age-verification for online content. Concurrently, the court has consistently sided with the Trump administration in fast-track appeals, reining in the power of lower court judges to block executive actions. This term reflects a judiciary increasingly aligned with a states-rights conservative philosophy.</p>

          <p>Genetic analysis of skeletons from Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k, a well-preserved 9,000-year-old city in Turkey, suggests it may have been a matriarchal or matrilineal society. Researchers found that where biological connections existed among individuals buried in the same house, the link was through the female line, indicating women likely remained in their family homes after marriage while men moved in. This evidence, combined with a higher prevalence of grave goods for females, challenges traditional assumptions about patriarchal structures in ancient societies and points to women holding significant social power.</p>

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's upset victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Republican leaders have launched a coordinated effort to frame him and the broader Democratic party as radical and socialist. Top Republicans, including Donald Trump, are using Mamdani's win to energize their base and attack Democrats as out of step with the country. In response, some Democratic members of Congress have condemned what they describe as Islamophobic and racist attacks against Mamdani, who is a Muslim of Indian descent, creating a new flashpoint in national political discourse.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris delivered a stunning performance to secure pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the field by more than half a second. Norris described his qualifying lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, marking a significant return to form after a season hampered by mistakes. This dominant result, aided by recent car upgrades, places him in an excellent position for Sunday's race. It also sets up a compelling intra-team battle with his championship-leading teammate, Oscar Piastri, who will start in third.</p>
