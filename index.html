        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has successfully tested key technologies for an experimental bullet-shaped satellite designed for very low Earth orbit (VLEO). The Chutian-001 satellite, launched a year ago, demonstrated capabilities in satellite system performance, high-resolution imaging, and space environment monitoring. VLEO satellites offer advantages like lower signal latency and stronger transmission but require frequent thruster firings to combat atmospheric drag. This test is a step towards building a 300-satellite constellation for remote sensing and communications as part of China's commercial space sector growth.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, opening the door for potential parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The judge's decision followed testimony from family members who believe the brothers have been rehabilitated through education and self-help groups while incarcerated. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings, and ultimately to the governor's office for consideration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is reportedly seeking to hire lawyers to investigate employee misconduct, specifically unauthorized communications with the media. This move follows emails sent to some USAID employees accusing them of engaging with the press without authorization, threatening disciplinary action. Critics view this as an attempt to intimidate workers from objecting to agency downsizing efforts. The American Foreign Service Association expressed concern that the agency is looking to intimidate workers from objecting to the firings.</p>

The government aims to have 50% of UK-based senior civil servants in regional offices by 2030, expecting the changes to bring £729m to the local economy by 2030.</p>

          <p>Three UK GPs share their differing views on the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which proposes allowing some terminally ill patients the option of an assisted death. Dr. Abdul Farooq is against it due to religious beliefs and concerns about end-of-life care resources. Dr. Susi Caesar supports it based on patient choice and her father's experience with terminal illness. Dr. Gurpreet Khaira is conflicted, balancing personal experiences with concerns about vulnerable patients and coercion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional British television faces an existential threat from US streaming giants, leading to discussions about consolidation and cooperation among UK broadcasters. Some argue for mergers of ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5, while others believe distinctiveness is vital. The shift to digital-only video on demand by 2035 raises questions about the survival of British-originated TV and the content audiences will be watching. Financial challenges and competition from well-funded US streamers necessitate a strategy to safeguard the industry and ensure the continuation of trusted news and uniquely British programming.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," details former President Biden’s mental and physical decline while in the White House and how his aides allegedly quashed concerns about his age. The book describes instances of Biden forgetting names, appearing frail, and relying on scripted cabinet gatherings. The reliance on anonymous sources highlights the Democratic Party's reluctance to publicly address questions about Biden's fitness for office. The book suggests that aides and allies are seeking to shift the blame for Biden's shortcomings.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, which provided deportation protections and work permits to over 8,000 Afghans. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Afghanistan has an improved security situation and stabilizing economy, making it safe for them to return. Advocates criticize the decision as unconscionable, while the administration maintains it is returning TPS to its original temporary intent. The winddown of TPS will begin on July 12.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were tarnished by sports gambling scandals.

This decision opens the door for consideration of their Hall of Fame candidacy, although it is not without controversy due to their past actions.</p>

          <p>José Mujica, former president of Uruguay, has died at the age of 89.

A former guerrilla fighter, Mujica championed rural communities and lived a simple life, donating most of his salary to build housing for Uruguay’s neglected towns. He was also known for his skepticism of capitalism’s excesses and his commitment to social liberalism.</p>

          <p>Mayor Eric Adams of New York was found to have used at least seven different cellphone numbers during a federal corruption investigation. He explained that the phones were for different purposes, including office, personal, and campaign use. The F.B.I. obtained warrants to track Adams’s location using cellphone data, and his use of multiple phones prompted the F.B.I. to seek permission to use a “cell site simulator” to discover other devices. The charges against Adams were ultimately dismissed, but the episode sheds light on his personal habits and the tactics used by federal authorities.</p>
