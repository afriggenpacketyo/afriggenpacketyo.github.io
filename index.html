          <p>A court has sentenced former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe to 12 years of house arrest following his conviction for bribery and witness tampering. The case involved allegations that Uribe attempted to influence witnesses who had linked him to paramilitary groups in the 1990s. The verdict is a significant moment for the South American nation, as Uribe remains a deeply polarizing figure, celebrated by some for stabilizing the country and condemned by others for human rights abuses. His legal team plans to appeal the sentence, which also includes an eight-year ban from public office and a substantial fine.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified annex from the John Durham special counsel report has concluded that emails central to a Trump-era conspiracy theory were composites created through Russian intelligence hacking. The documents were purported to show a plot by Hillary Clinton's campaign to demonize Donald Trump, but the investigation found they were not authentic. This finding significantly undermines claims by figures like Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who have alleged a "deep state" plot against Trump. The revelation reinforces earlier intelligence community assessments about Russian interference in the 2016 election, complicating efforts to portray the investigation as a politically motivated hoax.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by Ally Bank reveals that nearly 60% of millennials and Gen Zers feel their social spending is hindering their ability to meet financial goals. While experts acknowledge that spending on social activities is beneficial for well-being, many younger adults are overspending, with 42% exceeding their social budgets multiple times a year. The report highlights a disconnect, as few individuals in these demographics maintain a strict budget for social outings. Financial advisors suggest incorporating social expenses into a formal budget and exploring cheaper or free activities to maintain a healthy social life without incurring debt or financial stress.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced a 4% year-over-year decrease in its second-quarter operating earnings, with profits falling to $11.16 billion. The conglomerate's report highlighted a drop in insurance underwriting income but saw gains in its railroad, energy, and retail sectors. Significantly, the company issued a strong warning about the potential negative consequences of U.S. trade tariffs on its diverse business operations and investments, noting considerable uncertainty remains. The firm's cash reserves are near a record high, and it continued to be a net seller of stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian officials have confirmed that the country's oil refineries will continue to import oil from Russia, dismissing reports that they would yield to U.S. pressure. The statement came after President Trump threatened sanctions and tariffs against nations trading with Moscow over the war in Ukraine. Indian sources maintain that their purchasing decisions are based on economic factors and that their imports of discounted Russian crude have helped stabilize global oil prices. This stance underscores the complex diplomatic and economic relationship between India and Russia, which persists despite growing pressure from the United States to isolate Moscow.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are introducing a variety of spicy new menu items in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners, who show a strong preference for bold flavors. Companies like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell are launching spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes as a cost-effective strategy to generate buzz and drive sales amid slower consumer spending. This trend is heavily amplified by social media platforms like TikTok, where spicy food challenges and taste tests often go viral. While effective, the challenge for restaurants lies in the fast-moving nature of trends among younger generations, requiring constant innovation.</p>

CRPS is a rare, incurable disorder where an injury develops into a chronic pain condition, causing extreme sensitivity, swelling, and discoloration. The diagnosis is challenging as there is no definitive test, and treatment requires a multi-faceted approach including physical therapy, medication, and nerve blocks. After finding a specialized physical therapist, Meade has found a combination of treatments, including ketamine infusions, that have improved her quality of life.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on President Trump's attempt to suspend the U.S. asylum system, ruling that his administration cannot ignore laws protecting migrants from being deported to countries where they face persecution or torture. The D.C. Circuit Court panel upheld a lower court's finding that the president's proclamation defied U.S. law, but narrowed its scope. While the administration can still use the order to deny asylum applications, it cannot prevent migrants from seeking other mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal." The ruling marks a significant legal check on the administration's aggressive border policies.</p>

The story focuses on the detention of a respected local imam and the subsequent protests, arrests of journalists, and firings of the imam's supporters.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Democrats should strategically and persistently connect President Trump to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal to expose him as a protector of corrupt elites. The author suggests that rather than getting lost in conspiracy details, the message should be simple: Trump's actions, from covering up files to his association with figures like Epstein, demonstrate a system where the rich and powerful are shielded from accountability. This narrative, it is argued, could resonate with voters who already feel the system is rigged against them. The piece advises using the scandal as a consistent proof point for a broader message about elite favoritism.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old man from Long Beach, California, has been arrested for allegedly providing material support to the terrorist group ISIS. Federal prosecutors claim Mark Lorenzo Villanueva sent over $1,600 to individuals he believed were ISIS fighters and expressed his own desire to join the organization in online communications. During his arrest, the FBI reportedly recovered what appeared to be a bomb from his bedroom. Villanueva, a lawful permanent resident from the Philippines, faces a charge that carries a potential sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted.</p>

          <h2>Medical Procedure to Reconstruct a Bladder Using Intestinal Tissue Explained</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Deion Sanders' recent bladder cancer surgery, medical experts are explaining the neobladder reconstruction procedure he underwent. The complex surgery involves removing the patient's original bladder and creating a new one from a section of their own small intestine. This new, spherical organ is then connected to the kidneys and urethra. Because the neobladder is made from the patient's own tissue, there is no risk of rejection, and patients do not require immunosuppressant drugs. While the procedure is life-saving, it requires significant adjustment, as patients must retrain themselves to control urination.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis piece explores Russia's muted official reaction to President Trump's announcement that he ordered nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia, a move apparently triggered by a social media spat with former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Russian state media has been largely dismissive, portraying Trump's statement as a tantrum rather than a credible threat. The Kremlin and defense ministry have remained silent, suggesting Moscow does not feel a need to escalate or is choosing not to engage with what it may see as political theater. The author notes that this unpredictability is a hallmark of Trump's foreign policy style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, philosopher Mark C. Taylor argues that humanity must move beyond its traditional, anthropocentric worldview to survive crises like climate change and the rise of AI. He contends that the modern concept of the self, rooted in Cartesian dualism, has led to the exploitation of nature by treating it as a machine. Taylor proposes a new understanding based on relationality and interconnectedness, seeing all life and systems as part of a complex information-processing web. He critiques techno-utopian ideas of escaping earthly problems as a modern form of Gnosticism and calls for an "amor mundi," or love of the world.</p>

          <p>A detailed report from Reuters outlines how the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) successfully shot down an Indian Rafale fighter jet during a large-scale air battle in May. The engagement's outcome was heavily influenced by an Indian intelligence failure regarding the true range of the Chinese-made PL-15 missile used by Pakistan's J-10C jets. Pakistani forces were able to strike from a distance the Indian pilots believed was safe. The report also highlights Pakistan's effective use of a networked "kill chain" that integrated Chinese hardware with other assets, providing superior situational awareness during the conflict.</p>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against recent comments by a Philadelphia 76ers executive and others who have questioned the legitimacy of the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA championship. The author argues that viewing the title as less genuine because it was won in the sterile "Bubble" environment ignores the immense courage and mental fortitude required from players during a global pandemic. The piece emphasizes the context of the time, including widespread loss of life and the personal impact of COVID-19 on players. It concludes that the unique challenges of isolation and uncertainty make the championship worthy of an exclamation point, not an asterisk.</p>

The tariffs are part of a broader trade policy shift, and business owners feel caught in the middle of international diplomacy, fearing they will lose customers. The move creates significant uncertainty for small, family-run businesses that are central to the local Indian-American cultural and economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
