          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 19:40:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to a massive coltan mine in eastern DR Congo, currently under the control of M23 rebels. This mine is a crucial source for the mineral used in mobile phones and other electronics, employing thousands of local miners in dangerous but vital work. The article explores the complex dynamics of the region, including the M23's role in providing security, the immense profits generated from the mine, and the geopolitical implications of a recent US-brokered ceasefire deal. The miners express a desire for peace and better pay amidst the ongoing conflict and international interest in the region's resources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a revival in viewership, largely attributed to its massive engagement on social media, particularly TikTok. While television ratings are recovering, they remain below their peak, but the show's online following has exploded, with short-form clips and fan-created content driving conversation. The article notes that many viewers now follow the show through social media recaps rather than watching the full daily episodes. This shift in consumption habits raises concerns about context, as character narratives are condensed into brief, potentially misleading clips.</p>

          <p>A significant wildfire, the White Sage Fire, has rapidly expanded in Arizona's Kaibab National Forest, prompting evacuations near the Grand Canyon. This local crisis is part of a broader environmental issue, as smoke from extensive wildfires in Canada is simultaneously causing unhealthy air quality across the Upper Midwest, including states like Minnesota and North Dakota. The article highlights the dual threats of direct fire danger in the Southwest, which has already claimed a hiker's life amid extreme heat, and the far-reaching impact of Canadian fires on air quality for millions in the US.</p>

          <p>A review of the book "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America" delves into its analysis of the election that saw Donald Trump return to the presidency. The book is praised for its deep sourcing and exploration of the institutional failures and voter frustrations that fueled Trump's victory. It examines the missteps of the Biden-Harris campaign and poses several "what-if" scenarios that could have altered the outcome. The review highlights the book's chronicle of how elite miscalculations and a divided Democratic party contributed to an election that moved the U.S. closer to autocracy.</p>

His comments come amid confusion over steel tariffs and a broader, aggressive trade posture from the Trump administration, which recently announced a 30% tariff on EU and Mexican goods. Mandelson also stated that President Trump should expect a "warm reception" on his next state visit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of actress and comedian Rosie O'Donnell, one of his long-standing public rivals. O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland following Trump's election, responded by calling him a "criminal con man." Legal experts quickly noted that the President has no authority to strip a native-born U.S. citizen of their citizenship, citing a 1967 Supreme Court ruling that protects this right under the Fourteenth Amendment.

          <p>An aviation expert, analyzing the preliminary report on the Air India crash, believes a chip malfunction is a more likely cause than pilot error. The report found that the engine fuel cutoff switches moved to the "off" position, starving the engines of fuel. Former pilot Marco Chan suggests this could be linked to a known issue with a flawed chip that can cause signal loss if not properly maintained. He notes that the switch design makes accidental activation by pilots highly unlikely. This analysis provides a potential technical explanation for the catastrophic event that killed 260 people.</p>
