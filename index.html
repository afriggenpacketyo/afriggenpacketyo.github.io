        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, minimum salaries are being implemented in the top two tiers of professional women's football in England, the Women's Super League (WSL) and WSL 2. While the specific salary amount has not been disclosed, it is described as a "full-time wage" and is part of a broader effort by WSL Football to professionalize the sport further. The new requirements also include enhanced criteria for high-performance environments, wellbeing support, and safeguarding measures for players. This move aims to eliminate the need for players to hold part-time jobs and to standardize professional conditions across the leagues.</p>

          <p>The main podcast of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), a denomination associated with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has served as a platform for Christian nationalist and other far-right views. The podcast, "CrossPolitic," has hosted guests who advocate for theocratic rule and support authoritarian figures, raising concerns about the potential influence of these ideologies on U.S. policy. The article details the podcast's connections to controversial figures and its promotion of perspectives that directly oppose liberal democratic principles. The hosts have largely been dismissive when questioned about their content.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent drop in mortgage rates to their lowest level since April, overall mortgage application volume fell by 1.2% last week, ending a four-week period of gains. Applications for home purchases decreased by 3%, indicating that affordability remains a significant barrier for potential buyers even with more housing inventory available. In contrast, refinancing applications saw a slight 1% increase for the week, driven by more appealing rates for FHA and VA loans compared to conventional ones. The market awaits key economic reports, particularly the monthly employment data, which could influence future rate movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Macy's reported second-quarter financial results that significantly exceeded Wall Street predictions, attributing the strong performance to successful sales trends at its revamped stores. The department store operator posted adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share, well above the 18 cents expected, with revenue also beating forecasts at $4.81 billion. Citing this positive momentum, the company raised its full-year guidance for both earnings and sales. This optimistic outlook marks a notable turnaround from the previous quarter when Macy's had reduced its forecast due to economic uncertainties, including potential impacts from tariffs.

          <p>The British Embassy in Cairo has temporarily closed its main building after Egyptian authorities removed long-standing security barriers from its perimeter. This action occurs amidst escalating diplomatic friction between Egypt and several Western nations over pro-Palestinian protests targeting Egyptian diplomatic missions abroad. Egyptian officials have criticized host countries for failing to protect their embassies from vandalism and have suggested reciprocal security measures.

          <p>The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly surpassed the 5% threshold, reflecting investor concerns over trade policy, budget deficits, and potential threats to the Federal Reserve's independence. This market movement was partly triggered by a federal court ruling that deemed many of President Trump's tariffs illegal, which could lead to substantial government refunds. Additional anxiety stems from the president's attempts to influence the Federal Reserve, which investors fear could undermine the central bank's credibility in controlling inflation. Markets are now closely watching for the upcoming monthly jobs report for further economic indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House Oversight Committee has released over 33,000 pages of records from the Department of Justice related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The release follows months of controversy surrounding the Trump administration's decision to withhold additional files in the case. The documents reportedly include previously public court filings concerning Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as police bodycam footage and interview records. Epstein, who had connections to many powerful figures, died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges involving hundreds of underage girls.</p>

          <p>A political analysis suggests that the Democratic Party's electoral challenges are not merely a messaging issue but a more fundamental problem of engaging in political battles on terms set by their opponents. Drawing on E.E. Schattschneider's 1960 theory of political conflict, the article argues that the side that successfully defines the central conflict usually wins. Instead of focusing on tested slogans, Democrats should redefine the core political debates, such as framing tariffs as an "isolation tax" rather than just a price increase. The piece contends that by accepting unfavorable frames, such as defending existing institutions against populist attacks, the party has been fighting on losing ground.</p>

The arrest of the "Father Ted" co-creator sparked a significant backlash, with critics labeling it an infringement on free speech. Streeting acknowledged public anxiety over some online speech-related arrests and prosecutions, questioning if they align with Parliament's original intent when the laws were passed.</p>

The rejected cases include one against a woman who allegedly posted a death threat against President Trump on Instagram and another against a man accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent.

          <p>Independent concert promoter Sid the Cat is set to open a new 500-capacity music venue this fall in a restored historic elementary school auditorium in South Pasadena. The opening of the Sid the Cat Auditorium is seen as a sign of hope for the local arts community, which was deeply affected by the destructive Eaton fire that tore through the nearby musician-heavy neighborhood of Altadena. The promoters, who funded the project independently, aim to provide a unique, artist-friendly space with modern amenities in a historic setting. The venue is expected to become a vital hub for musicians and audiences in northeast Los Angeles.</p>

The book delves into the pressures of fame, including stalkers and panic attacks, as well as her experiences on Broadway and her decision to pose for Playboy. Now 54, Gibson continues to tour independently and plans to create new music and develop projects for musical theater.</p>

          <p>After decades of dangerous landslides and costly temporary repairs, California's transportation department has proposed a permanent solution for the treacherous "Last Chance Grade" section of Highway 101. The plan involves constructing a 6,000-foot, $2.1 billion tunnel through the redwood forest to bypass the eroding coastal cliffs. This three-mile stretch is the only viable route connecting Del Norte County to the rest of the state, making its stability critical for the local economy and emergency services. While funding for the massive project is still being secured, officials emphasize its necessity, arguing that if a similar issue affected a major urban highway, it would have been fixed long ago.</p>

          <p>Despite a renewed diplomatic push in 2025, peace talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine have failed to produce a ceasefire or lasting agreement. The return of Donald Trump to the White House marked a new phase of negotiations, but a February meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ended acrimoniously. Subsequent U.S. pressure, including a suspension of military aid, and multiple rounds of talks involving low-level delegations in Istanbul have yielded little progress. A high-profile summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska also concluded without any concrete deals, as Russia continues its large-scale attacks across Ukraine.</p>

The article explores methods to make the process more sustainable, such as diluting the brine with additional seawater before discharge, as practiced at a large plant in California. Other innovative approaches treat the brine as a resource, with projects underway to mine it for valuable minerals like lithium and magnesium. Additionally, experts are developing models to identify optimal locations for new plants that can be powered by renewable energy, further reducing their ecological footprint.</p>

          <p>A trade body has warned that UK cement production has fallen to its lowest level since 1950, potentially jeopardizing the government's ambitious housing and infrastructure projects. The Mineral Products Association (MPA) stated that production is under threat from high energy, regulatory, and labor costs, as well as a significant increase in cheaper cement imports. With the government planning to build 1.5 million new homes and invest heavily in infrastructure, the decline in domestic cement manufacturing raises serious concerns about the feasibility of these goals and the competitiveness of the UK industry.

This outcome is viewed as a major victory for the tech giant, removing a significant legal overhang and prompting a 6% rise in Alphabet's premarket stock price as investor confidence grew.
