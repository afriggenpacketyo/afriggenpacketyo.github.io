          <p>A severe heatwave is impacting approximately 168 million Americans across the Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast, with advisories urging people to remain indoors. New York's governor has emphasized the life-threatening nature of the heat, which is the leading cause of weather-related fatalities in the state. Cooling centers have been opened and public pool hours extended, as New York City's LaGuardia Airport reported a record-breaking temperature of 100°F. The extreme weather, which is also affecting large parts of Canada, is expected to ease after storms move through the region.</p>

          <p>China's Finance Minister, Lan Foan, has committed to accelerating fiscal spending to stimulate domestic demand and manage local government debt. The plan includes expediting the issuance of ultra-long-term bonds and special-purpose bonds for local governments, aligning with the Politburo's call for a more proactive fiscal policy. In the first half of 2025, China issued a record 7.88 trillion yuan in government bonds, a 35% year-on-year increase, while the average interest rate on these bonds decreased. These measures aim to stabilize and invigorate the nation's economy amid ongoing financial pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a powerful earthquake near Russia, residents across Hawaii evacuated coastal areas as tsunami waves reached the islands, prompting officials to urge "urgent action" to protect lives. Many locals, including those on Maui still recovering from past wildfires, moved to higher ground, causing significant traffic congestion on roads. Although the initial tsunami warning was later downgraded to an advisory, the threat of dangerous currents and flooding remained. Residents described an eerie atmosphere, balancing caution with the memory of past disasters, as they prepared for the potential impact of the waves.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has confirmed it will impose a 25% tariff on Indian exports to the United States, along with other financial penalties, effective from August. In a social media post, President Trump criticized India for what he described as excessively high tariffs and "obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers." He also linked the decision to India's significant purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia, particularly during the ongoing war in Ukraine. This move signals a significant escalation in trade tensions between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Russia's Far East, scientific experts have provided context on the resulting tsunami. Oceanographers explain that the quake occurred on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the movement of tectonic plates can displace the seabed and generate tsunami waves. Scientists noted that while powerful, this event was not expected to cause mass devastation on the scale of the 2004 or 2011 tsunamis, which were generated by significantly stronger earthquakes. Experts emphasize that tsunamis are more like "ocean floods" than single waves, consisting of a series of powerful surges that can pose a risk for hours.</p>

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has finalized the signing of Colombian winger Luiz Diaz from Liverpool in a deal reportedly worth €75 million. This transfer makes the 28-year-old one of the most expensive players in Bundesliga history, and he has signed a contract with the club until 2029. Diaz is known for his relentless running, goal-scoring threat, and intense style of play, which is expected to bolster Bayern's attack, particularly with the recent departure of Leroy Sane. The signing follows Bayern's recent trend of acquiring high-profile talent from the English Premier League.</p>

          <p>Eric Trump believes his father, President Donald Trump, deserves to have The Open, one of golf's major championships, return to his Turnberry course in Scotland. In an interview, he asserted that no one has been better for the game of golf and that politics has been the main reason the prestigious event has not been held there since 2009. While the R&A, the event's governing body, has cited logistical issues, Eric Trump insists the venue is ready to host immediately. He suggested that by the time The Open does return, his father's time in government will likely be over.</p>

          <p>As Medicare and Medicaid mark their 60th anniversary, a new Republican budget law has enacted the largest cuts in the programs' history, a move that this article traces back to decades of conservative opposition. The cuts are projected to remove nearly 12 million people from Medicaid coverage and threaten the viability of hundreds of rural hospitals. The article recounts the programs' origins as civil rights-era tools to desegregate healthcare and fight poverty, contrasting their history of expansion with the long-standing conservative push for "block grants" and other restrictions. This historical context frames the current cuts as a significant turning point in American healthcare policy.</p>

          <p>Leaders in the financial industry perceive a more welcoming regulatory environment for cryptocurrency-related products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), under the Trump administration. Sal Gilbertie, CEO of Teucrium, noted a shift from an "antagonistic" to a more innovation-friendly attitude from regulators in Washington. This change in tone comes as President Trump signed the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, furthering his goal to make the U.S. a "crypto capital." Industry experts are encouraged by the increased engagement from the SEC and hope for regulatory certainty that still allows for competition and new product development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A combination of U.S. tariff threats and a controversial judicial overhaul in Mexico is creating a wave of uncertainty, causing domestic and foreign investors to pause or shelve investment plans. Business leaders report that long-term planning has become nearly impossible as they weigh President Trump's proposed tariffs against Mexican President Sheinbaum's push to reshape the judiciary, which critics fear undermines the rule of law. The economic slowdown is already evident, with job creation falling to its lowest level since 2009 and business confidence declining, threatening Mexico's growth prospects as the U.S.'s largest trading partner.</p>

          <p>This analytical article posits that the social justice-driven unrest following George Floyd's death in 2020 and the January 6 Capitol siege are "fratricidal twins," both born from a belief that the state has lost legitimacy and that violence is a valid form of political speech. The author argues that the pandemic created a fertile ground for protest, with the summer of 2020's events establishing a pattern of lawlessness that was later imitated by the populist right. The piece suggests that this dynamic has fueled a politics of "grief and fury," warping the American moral universe and entrenching a societal divide mediated by spectacle and images.</p>

Experts and former players suggest that Australian rugby is in a constant battle for talent and public attention. Some argue that if the country's best athletes weren't drawn to the NRL and AFL, the Wallabies would be a dominant global force. Despite these challenges and inconsistent performances, there is hope that a "golden decade," including upcoming World Cups and the Lions tour, can reinvigorate the sport and capture the nation's interest.</p>
