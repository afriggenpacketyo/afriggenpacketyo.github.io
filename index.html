          <p>A small aircraft crashed near Hicks Airfield in Fort Worth, Texas, resulting in multiple semi-trucks catching fire. Emergency services responded to the scene on N. Saginaw Boulevard following the crash, which occurred around 1:30 p.m. The Tarrant County Sheriff's Office confirmed the incident involved a small aircraft impacting unknown structures, prompting a response from the FAA and NSTB, with the FAA taking the lead in the investigation. Business 287 was temporarily closed as authorities worked to manage the situation, and the number of people aboard the aircraft and the extent of injuries remain unclear. The incident is under investigation. </p>

          <p>A new report indicates that coral reefs are the first environmental system on Earth to surpass a climate "tipping point" due to rising ocean temperatures, leading to mass bleaching events and ecosystem collapse. Researchers at the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute emphasize the urgency of addressing this unprecedented crisis, with reef deterioration impacting marine life and the livelihoods of a billion people. The report highlights that coral reefs start to decline significantly when global warming reaches 1.2 degrees Celsius, and scientists estimate a 70-90% coral death rate at 1.5 degrees. The preservation of remaining coral pockets and decarbonization efforts are critical to mitigating further damage. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced that "the war is over" as he travels to Israel to oversee the release of hostages from Gaza under a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Trump praised Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar for their roles, anticipating the establishment of a "board of peace" for Gaza. The ceasefire, brokered by Trump, took effect on Friday morning, with the next phases of the 20-point peace plan still under negotiation. Trump will then lead a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh alongside Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, where a document ending the war in the Gaza Strip is expected to be signed. </p>

          <p>Paramount, with support from Larry Ellison, is actively bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery, despite the initial offer of $20 a share being rejected by the Warner Bros. Discovery board. Paramount is reportedly preparing a second bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO, CNN, and Warner Bros. movie studio. David Ellison aims to revitalize Paramount by acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, which could lead to the consolidation of CNN with CBS News. The potential merger has caused stocks of both companies to rise, but some analysts believe Paramount's offer undervalues Warner Bros. Discovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Steve Clarke expressed his disappointment with Scotland's performance despite securing a 2-1 win over Belarus in World Cup qualifying. Clarke's anger stemmed from his team's failure to reach their expected levels, despite the victory assuring them of at least a play-off place. Players acknowledged the criticism and admitted the need for improvement, with midfielder John McGinn describing Clarke as the "wildest" he's seen him in 72 games. Scotland's win puts them in a strong position, but Clarke's dissatisfaction reflects the high standards he has set for the team. </p>
