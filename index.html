          <p>At least 25 Palestinians were killed overnight in Gaza from Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, with many of the victims shot while awaiting aid trucks near the Zikim crossing. The incident occurs as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have stalled and the United Nations warns of a looming famine in the region. Amidst the humanitarian crisis, Israel faces mounting international pressure to allow more aid into the enclave, while it has recently permitted some airdrops requested by Jordan. The violence highlights the desperate conditions and ongoing dangers faced by civilians seeking essential supplies.</p>

          <p>Deadly border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have escalated for a third day, resulting in at least 33 deaths and the displacement of over 168,000 people. Both nations have traded accusations of initiating fresh artillery and gunfire attacks near border villages, expanding the conflict zone. The violence, which has prompted both countries to recall their ambassadors, has drawn international concern, with the UN Security Council calling for de-escalation. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is being urged to mediate the long-standing border dispute, which has now flared into significant armed conflict.</p>

          <p>In a significant political event in Taiwan, all lawmakers targeted in a large-scale recall vote, primarily from the opposition Kuomintang party, have retained their seats. The "Great Recall" was initiated by a civic movement concerned that the legislators were excessively influenced by Beijing, threatening Taiwan's democracy. The failure of the recall effort means the opposition will maintain its majority in the legislature, potentially intensifying the political deadlock with President William Lai's Democratic Progressive Party. The outcome was closely watched as it could have shifted the balance of power in the politically polarized nation.</p>

          <p>An American comedian living in Scotland shares her personal perspective on Donald Trump's visit, expressing a sense of frustration and annoyance at his presence. She explains that she avoids discussing Trump in her comedy to preserve her own peace of mind, and she contrasts his desire for Scottish acceptance with the authentic connection she feels to her adopted home. The author reflects on the late Scottish comedian Janey Godley's famous protest as a more fitting expression of local sentiment. The piece conveys a feeling of being unable to escape the political turmoil of the U.S. even while living abroad.</p>

          <p>The article argues that Columbia University's recent agreement with the Trump administration represents a capitulation that undermines academic independence and sets a dangerous precedent for American higher education. To restore federal research funding, the university reportedly agreed to a $200 million fine and concessions, including allowing a Trump-approved monitor to review admissions and the Middle Eastern studies department. The author describes the deal as an "extortion scheme" where the administration leveraged the university's funding to enforce its political agenda. This event is framed as a significant blow to the idea that strong US institutions can resist political pressure.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that using credit cards to pay for a wedding can be a smart strategy, but only if handled with care. Recent surveys show a significant number of couples are using credit to cover rising wedding costs, which are expected to average $36,000 in 2025. The primary benefit comes from earning rewards like points or miles by charging expenses and then immediately paying off the balance with savings. However, experts warn against carrying this debt, as high interest rates can create significant financial stress for a new marriage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite earning six-figure salaries, many Americans, dubbed "HENRYs" (high earners, not rich yet), report feeling financially insecure and still live paycheck to paycheck. Experts attribute this phenomenon to a combination of rising costs, significant debt, and lifestyle creep, where spending increases to match income. A recent survey found that 62% of people earning over $300,000 annually struggle with credit card debt. Psychologists note a paradox where the process of accumulating wealth, which requires saving rather than spending, prevents individuals from feeling rich, creating persistent financial anxiety even among top earners.

          <p>Pemiscot Memorial, a vital hospital in Missouri's poorest county, is on the brink of closure due to financial struggles, a situation expected to worsen under a new bill championed by President Trump. The legislation mandates historic cuts to Medicaid, which accounts for a significant portion of the hospital's revenue and is a lifeline for the local low-income population. Despite local Republican lawmakers supporting the bill, hospital leaders and healthcare advocates warn that the changes will devastate an already fragile rural healthcare system. The story highlights the direct impact of national policy on a vulnerable community that largely voted for its proponents.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece pays tribute to the late actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, reflecting on the profound significance of his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." The author explains how Theo, along with other key Black characters from that era, provided crucial representation for young Black viewers, navigating struggles with identity, academics, and coming of age. The column argues that Warner's graceful portrayal helped redefine Blackness on television, challenging narrow stereotypes at a time when positive, successful Black families were absent from the screen. His death is felt not just as nostalgia but as gratitude for the burden he carried.</p>

As a member of the "ADA generation," she grew up with rights like ASL interpreters and closed captions, which opened doors to education and community. However, she warns that these rights are now under threat from an administration hostile to disabled people and from budget cuts to crucial programs like Medicaid.

          <p>Los Angeles County is projected to spend over $230 million on seismic upgrades for the Gas Company Tower, a downtown skyscraper it purchased for $200 million last year. While officials state the building is currently safe, the "voluntary" upgrades are intended to ensure its long-term performance, particularly reinforcing its steel moment frame connections. The county CEO's office argues this total cost is still a fraction of the estimated $1 billion needed to retrofit its current, seismically vulnerable headquarters.

          <p>A new study from Keck Medicine of USC reveals that the prevalence of advanced liver scarring has more than doubled among heavy drinkers in the U.S. over the last two decades. Researchers found this increase occurred even though the overall rate of heavy drinking and the amount consumed did not significantly change. The rise in liver disease was most pronounced in women, older individuals, and those with metabolic conditions like obesity and diabetes. Experts are concerned because liver disease is often "silent," with no symptoms until it is advanced, highlighting the need for greater awareness.</p>

Because cannabis remains illegal under federal law, the action against a prominent, publicly traded company raises questions about the security of the entire state-legal industry.

As arrests quadrupled from April to June, the proportion of those without a criminal record surged to 69%. Experts argue the administration focuses on a small number of violent offenders to justify broader enforcement policies needed to meet aggressive deportation quotas.

Registered dietitians note that bison has fewer calories, less total and saturated fat, and lower cholesterol compared to beef, while offering similar or higher levels of key nutrients like iron and vitamin B12. While beef can be a good choice for those needing more calories, such as athletes, bison's leanness makes it particularly beneficial for individuals concerned with cardiovascular health or insulin resistance.

Meanwhile, high mortgage rates, currently averaging 6.74%, are sidelining many first-time and middle-income buyers.
