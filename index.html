            <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with the CEOs of Walmart, Target, Home Depot, and Lowe's to discuss the potential impact of his proposed tariffs on their businesses. These retailers, heavily reliant on imports, are facing challenges due to rising inflation and consumer sensitivity to low prices. The meeting aims to address the concerns of these major retailers regarding Trump's aggressive trade policies and their potential to disrupt established business models, impacting both the companies and consumers. The executives will likely express their worries about increased costs and potential disruptions to supply chains. Optimism score: 50</p>

            <p>A UN report warns that cyber scam operations, originating from Asian crime syndicates, are rapidly expanding across the globe, including into Africa, Europe, and South America. These scams, which involve investment, cryptocurrency, and romance fraud, are a sophisticated global industry employing tens of thousands of trafficked workers who are forced to con people online. The UNODC urges international action to address this growing threat, emphasizing that failure to do so will have significant global consequences. The expansion reflects the industry's growth and attempts to hedge against disruptions in Southeast Asia. Optimism score: 35</p>

            <p>Google is arguing against the Justice Department's proposal to break up the company, claiming it would harm the U.S.'s ability to compete with China in the global race for technological supremacy. Google asserts that divesting its Chrome browser unit and opening its search data to rivals would hinder its AI development efforts. The company contends that the DOJ's remedies would give a government-appointed committee control over its product design and development, stifling American innovation. Google is currently facing multiple antitrust challenges, including a separate case where it was found to have illegal monopolies in online advertising markets. Optimism score: 45</p>

            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a significant drop, exceeding 1,000 points, as President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser." The stock market's decline is attributed to ongoing tariff uncertainties and anticipation of upcoming earnings reports from major U.S. tech companies. The dollar index also fell to its lowest level since 2022, while gold reached a record high, indicating investor concerns about the safety of U.S. assets. Trump's pressure on Powell to lower interest rates has fueled worries about potential conflicts between the White House and the Federal Reserve. Optimism score: 25</p>

            <p>The Department of Justice is offering alleged migrant gang members at least 24 hours to file a habeas petition contesting their deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. This comes after pushback on the Trump administration's efforts to deport migrants with limited due process. The ACLU argues that 24 hours is insufficient time to file a petition.
