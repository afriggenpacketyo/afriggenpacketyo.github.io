          <p>Floods and heavy rains have damaged Indian farmlands, particularly in Punjab, but analysts predict a limited impact on India's overall inflation for fiscal year 2026. This forecast is based on sufficient cereal production and existing stocks, expected to keep food inflation in check. Despite an August inflation rise to 2.1%, experts anticipate that cuts in goods and services tax will help maintain lower price growth. The central bank is expected to ease monetary policy further, spurring domestic growth amid trade challenges with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached a "framework" agreement regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, potentially paving the way for American control. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the development, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to finalize the deal soon. This comes amidst national security concerns over user data and the platform's algorithm, with Oracle reportedly part of a consortium to facilitate the transition.

          <p>A commentary article argues that American democracy faces severe threats from President Trump's actions, emphasizing the urgency for citizens to act within the next 400 days. The author highlights issues like executive overreach, chronic gerrymandering, endemic violence, and the exploitation of capitalist competition as corrosive forces. It urges Democrats to regain control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections, not just on policy, but to restore constitutional checks and balances. The article suggests focusing on economic "kitchen-table issues" to resonate with voters and counter the current trajectory.</p>

          <p>Chinese missile names, such as "Dongfeng" (east wind), are inspired by the speeches and philosophy of Mao Zedong, the founding father of the People's Republic of China. The name "Dongfeng" specifically references Mao's 1957 speech about the "east wind prevailing over the west wind," symbolizing the communist East's eventual triumph over the capitalist West.

Senior government figures acknowledge a "dreadful" period for their party, with internal factionalism amplifying existing jitters. For Labour, the fear is losing power to Reform, while Conservatives face existential questions with each defection.

          <p>Taiwan is preparing for the imminent arrival of substantial U.S. arms shipments, which are expected to bolster its deterrence and war-fighting capabilities against escalating threats from Beijing. While some orders, like the AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapon and F-16V Block 70 fighters, have experienced delays, the overall annual volume of arms arrivals will be the highest in years. The defense ministry reports that nearly $4.5 billion worth of systems are currently in the delivery process. This influx of weaponry is crucial for Taiwan's self-defense strategy.</p>

          <p>Frequent fume incidents on airliners, particularly Airbus A320 family jets, are raising health concerns for both passengers and crew members due to potential toxic exposure. A CBS News review found over three such incidents daily, with symptoms including nervous system problems. Flight attendant unions advocate for improved filtration systems, arguing that engine seal failures can release oil and toxic particles into cabin air. While the FAA maintains strict cabin air standards, the issue underscores a persistent public safety and health challenge in air travel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked President Trump from firing Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board, just ahead of a crucial interest rate vote. The court upheld a lower court's ruling that firing Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" removal provisions. Cook's attorneys argued that unproven allegations from before her tenure do not meet this standard, emphasizing the importance of the Fed's independence from political pressure. This decision preserves the board's current composition for the upcoming policy meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly connected the brutal killing of a Dallas motel manager, Chandra Nagamallaiah, to Biden administration immigration policies, blaming them for the alleged perpetrator's presence in the U.S. The suspect, Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, an undocumented Cuban national with a prior arrest history, was under a final deportation order that Cuba would not accept.
