Margalit was murdered during the October 7, 2023, attacks at Kibbutz Nir Oz, and his body was subsequently taken into Gaza. His daughter, Nili Margalit, was also taken hostage but was released in November 2023.

          <p>Marissa Coreno, a 27-year-old from Ohio, discovered a lump in her armpit which led to a Stage II breast cancer diagnosis, a rare occurrence for her age group. Despite having no family history, she underwent exhaustive chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and radiation, and is now cancer-free. Her story highlights a rising trend of breast cancer diagnoses in younger women and underscores the importance of self-advocacy and investigating unusual health signs. Coreno, who found love and married during her treatment, hopes her experience encourages others to be vigilant about their health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Gen Z women in the United States are identifying as "leftist" rather than liberal, driven by a sense that moderation is insufficient to address urgent political and economic issues. This demographic shift, not mirrored by their male counterparts, is influenced by concerns over reproductive rights, economic instability, and a distrust in both major political parties. The article suggests that for these young women, political engagement is a form of self-defense against threats to their health, safety, and future, leading them to adopt more staunchly anti-capitalist and socially active stances.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is expected to confirm Douglas Troutman, a former industry lobbyist for the American Cleaning Institute, to head the EPA's chemical safety office. His nomination has alarmed environmental and public health advocates, who fear it will lead to significant deregulation and weaken protections against toxic substances. If confirmed, Troutman would join other former industry insiders in top EPA positions, raising concerns that corporate interests will be prioritized over public safety. Critics point to his past efforts to repeal state-level chemical transparency laws as evidence of his likely pro-industry agenda.</p>

          <p>North Korea has showcased a new, powerful strategic missile, described by its state media as its most potent nuclear weapon system. The missile's existence was revealed shortly before Kim Jong-un's visit to Beijing, suggesting a strategic move to push China towards more openly accepting North Korea's status as a nuclear power. Although the missile has not been tested, Pyongyang recently tested a new solid-fuel rocket engine intended for future intercontinental ballistic missiles. The display occurred during a military parade attended by high-ranking Russian and Vietnamese officials.</p>

The discussion also covered Ukraine's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles, with Zelenskyy later stating they decided not to speak publicly on the matter to avoid escalation. Trump expressed reservations about providing the weapons but was open to a potential trade for Ukrainian drones.

          <p>President Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos, who will be released immediately. Santos had been serving a more than seven-year sentence after pleading guilty to wire fraud and identity theft. In a social media post, Trump stated that Santos had been "horribly mistreated" in prison. The commutation, which is not a pardon and does not clear his criminal record, was met with criticism from some fellow Republicans who argued the disgraced ex-congressman's crimes warranted a longer sentence.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions, China is actively working to reduce its economic dependency on the United States by redirecting exports and strengthening ties with other regions like Africa, Southeast Asia, and the EU. Beijing has retaliated against U.S. tariffs with its own measures, including restricting exports of critical rare-earth minerals and boycotting American soybeans. Despite this strategic decoupling and a reduction in its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, the economic interdependence, termed "Chimerica," remains significant.

          <p>An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that two-thirds of Americans who get divorced eventually remarry. The study indicates that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and remarriage can offer significant economic benefits, with the median household wealth of remarried adults being comparable to those in their first marriage. However, some experts caution that second marriages have a higher rate of divorce, particularly among older adults in what are termed "gray divorces." The overall divorce rate in the U.S. has continued to decline since the 1980s.</p>

This article argues that the movement's earnest, sometimes "cringe" idealism is a potent tool against the cynicism and nihilism of the administration. While the first-term Resistance was effective in local organizing and contributing to the 2018 midterms, the new phase is more decentralized and focused on community solidarity and mutual aid. It suggests that sincere belief in democratic principles, once dismissed as naive, is now a crucial form of opposition.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener is preparing to run for the congressional seat long held by Nancy Pelosi, a move that ignites a high-profile political contest in San Francisco. While Wiener has been a strategic and effective legislator, his decision to challenge the 85-year-old Democratic stalwart brings the national debate about the party's need for younger leadership to her home district. The race is further complicated by the candidacy of wealthy progressive Saikat Chakrabarti, forcing Wiener to act now to build momentum and funding for what is expected to be an expensive and closely watched primary.</p>

          <p>Native tribes in California's Owens Valley are escalating their fight against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) over extensive groundwater pumping, which they argue has desiccated their ancestral lands. While L.A.'s diversion of the Owens River is well-known, its extraction from 105 wells has also severely impacted the local ecosystem, drying up springs and meadows. Tribal leaders from the Owens Valley Indian Water Commission are demanding the return of land and water rights to restore their homeland, which they call a "water colony" for Los Angeles.</p>

In a personal statement, the prince said the continued accusations were a distraction from the work of the Royal Family, though he continues to deny the allegations against him. The decision was made in consultation with King Charles and the Prince of Wales. This move further diminishes his role, though he will remain a prince, as he had already stepped back from public duties.</p>

          <p>Samantha Petersen, a Minnesota woman, has been sentenced to four years in prison for a deadly crash involving an Amish buggy that killed two children. Authorities stated Petersen was high on methamphetamine when she rear-ended the buggy, then called her identical twin sister, Sarah, to the scene to take the blame. Police uncovered the scheme through phone location data and a recorded call where Sarah acknowledged their similar appearance could deceive investigators. Samantha pleaded guilty to criminal vehicular homicide, while her sister has already served a sentence for her role in the attempted cover-up.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, a company central to 2020 election conspiracy theories, has been sold and rebranded as Liberty Vote. The new owner, Scott Leiendecker, has presented a dual message: publicly, he has promised a transformation to "restore faith in American elections," nodding to conservative priorities. Privately, however, company representatives have assured county election officials that it will be the "same team, same support, different name." This rebranding effort has raised questions about whether the change is a genuine overhaul or a strategic business move to appeal to conservative jurisdictions that were previously hesitant to use Dominion's technology.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has frequently advised average investors to invest in S&P 500 index funds, and one Wall Street analyst now predicts a significant surge for this strategy. Julian Emanuel of Evercore ISI forecasts that the S&P 500 could rise by 37% by the end of 2026, driven by continued earnings growth from companies adopting artificial intelligence. An accessible way to follow this advice is through low-cost ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). While predictions are never certain, the S&P 500 has a strong history of providing attractive long-term returns. (not investment advice)</p>

The commentary alleges the generals experienced a "total collapse of their beliefs" and undermined the core principle of the Communist Party's absolute command over the military. The piece did not provide specific details of their transgressions, but the strong language underscores a significant internal purge within China's armed forces.

          <p>The Falls of Clyde, a historic iron-hulled sailing ship built in Scotland in 1878, has been intentionally scuttled in deep water off the coast of Hawaii. The vessel had been a museum ship in Honolulu but had fallen into disrepair, and the local harbor board ordered its removal. The sinking has sparked outrage from maritime conservation groups in both the UK and the US, who had spent over a decade trying to raise funds to transport the ship back to Scotland for restoration. They described the destruction of the 147-year-old vessel as an inconceivable loss of maritime heritage.</p>
