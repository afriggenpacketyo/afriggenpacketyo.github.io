          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, expressed optimism about the future of AI and biotech, emphasizing the universal nature of science despite geopolitical tensions between the US and China. He highlighted that scientific breakthroughs in one country benefit humanity as a whole, contrasting this with the current political climate where the US has reduced scientific funding. Diamandis voiced concerns about the impact of these cuts on the pace of scientific discoveries, noting that his role involves helping people see the world in a positive light despite inherent fears and scarcity mindsets. His work through XPrize competitions aims to incentivize solutions to global challenges, as seen with the private space flight industry. The XPrize founder believes in the power of human innovation to overcome obstacles.</p>

          <p>A government review is underway in England to address long-term higher education funding, prompting concerns about potential subject "cold spots" due to university course cuts. Universities UK suggests greater collaboration between institutions could help mitigate costs and maintain course availability, though legal concerns hinder such cooperation. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recognizes the financial strain on universities and supports collaboration where possible, particularly in sharing back-office functions or discussing mergers. University budgets have been impacted by a drop in international students and rising inflation, leading to course cutbacks across various institutions, and the government is encouraging universities to increase opportunities for students and contribute to economic growth. The review aims to restore universities as engines of opportunity and growth.</p>

          <p>A new report by the Shared Health Foundation urges the government to implement measures preventing children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs, addressing widespread family displacement. The report advocates for a notification system ensuring authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary housing, and this comes as over 164,000 homeless children live in temporary accommodation across England. One mother describes the difficulties of finding suitable housing and the impact on her children's education, and some families have lived in temporary accommodation for extended periods, causing significant disruptions. The Local Government Association calls for increased temporary accommodation subsidies, while the government highlights the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to improve protections for vulnerable children.</p>

The TV series follows a group of Mormon women, most of whom rose to fame on TikTok, as they navigate evolving dynamics within their tight-knit community, and the women speak openly about the money they make from reality TV and brand deals. Cast members Jessi Ngatikaura and Whitney Leavitt discuss the impact of having their lives watched and commented on by millions, emphasizing the importance of aftercare provided by the production, and there was some backlash to the reality TV show from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Despite the drama and filming demands, the women praise the production for its duty of care standards.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate privately owned land without compensation in certain cases, sparking controversy and criticism from the US and domestic political parties. The government argues the law is necessary to increase black ownership of land, which remains predominantly in white hands, and that compensation will be paid in most instances. The new law aims to provide "just-and-equitable" compensation rather than "market value," and the government hopes the law will expedite the resolution of unsettled land claims. While Trump has opposed the law, some Afrikaner lobby groups believe it will not lead to large-scale expropriation of farmland, and the law is currently in limbo as Ramaphosa has not set a date for its implementation.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses the "Trump discount" and its negative impact on various sectors of the stock market due to political unpredictability (not investment advice). He notes that sectors like retail, drug companies, and tech companies such as Apple are being held back by the administration's policies, and he also mentions that sectors like banking and energy are not seeing the expected benefits under the current administration (not investment advice). Cramer suggests that the uncertainty surrounding the White House is making it difficult to predict cash flow and is negatively affecting mergers and acquisitions (not investment advice). Cramer feels alone writing this stuff, given how rarely it is talked about.</p>

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) responded to the "mass casualty" incident, and the blood bank at Nasser hospital was almost empty, and the BBC was contacted by doctors at the Nasser hospital who said they had received about 200 people with injuries caused by bullets or shrapnel.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler continued his stunning form with a four-shot victory at the Memorial Tournament in Columbus, Ohio, and he shot a two-under-par 70 to beat compatriot Ben Griffin. Griffin's challenge faded on the back nine, and Scheffler dropped just one shot in his final round. Scheffler's victory makes him just the second player to win the Memorial in consecutive years, following Tiger Woods.</p>

          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm in the forecast for Sunday night could make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., and the aurora could appear over much of the northern half of the contiguous U.S., even as far south as northern California and Alabama. Space weather officials detected a solar flare associated with this geomagnetic storm on Friday, and the geomagnetic storm is expected to last through late Monday. The storm could disrupt power systems, impede satellite operations, and hamper radio communications.</p>
