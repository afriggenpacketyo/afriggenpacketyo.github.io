          <h2>Premier League Clubs Lead a Record-Breaking Summer Transfer Spending Spree</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 11:03:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League clubs are dominating the summer transfer window with unprecedented spending, led by Liverpool's outlay of £269 million. Major clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal, and Manchester United have also invested heavily in new talent, pushing the league's total spending to new heights. While the figures are staggering, football finance experts note that when adjusted for "football inflation," the spending is not as historically lavish as it appears. The concentration of spending among the top clubs raises questions about the league's overall competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated he has not thought about pardoning or commuting the sentence of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving 20 years for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. While acknowledging he has the authority to do so, Trump deflected questions about his own past association with Epstein, suggesting focus should be on others like Bill Clinton. The comments come as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche meets with Maxwell, who her lawyer claims is being treated as a scapegoat and is prepared to tell the truth.</p>

          <p>Daniel Born, the deputy speaker of the state parliament in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, has resigned from his leadership role after admitting to drawing a swastika on a ballot. The Social Democrat politician made the mark next to the name of a far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) candidate during a vote. Born described his action as a "serious mistake" and a "momentary lapse" driven by deep concern over the AfD's conduct, but has faced calls to give up his parliamentary seat entirely. The use of unconstitutional symbols is a criminal offense in Germany.</p>

          <p>A former sanitation worker from a pilgrimage center in Dharmasthala, India, has alleged that he was forced to dispose of hundreds of bodies, many of whom were women and girls who appeared to have been sexually assaulted and murdered. In a police complaint, the man claimed that temple supervisors covered up the crimes between 1995 and 2014, threatening him with violence. The allegations have prompted the Karnataka state government to form a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the claims and have led families of missing persons to demand their cases be reopened.</p>

          <p>Facing a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional districts in Texas, a delegation of Democratic state legislators is traveling to California and Illinois to meet with Governors Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker.

The redistricting debate is occurring during a special legislative session, a move Democrats have criticized as manipulative and ill-timed given other state crises like recent deadly floods.</p>

          <p>With many Americans claiming Social Security at the earliest age of 62 and receiving reduced lifetime payments, this article outlines strategies to delay filing and maximize benefits. One approach is to invest in an annuity, which can provide a guaranteed income stream to bridge the financial gap until age 70. Another option for homeowners is a reverse mortgage, which allows borrowing against home equity. Finally, the article suggests maximizing catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs to build a sufficient fund for early retirement years.

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, the country faces worsening conditions, including economic hardship and deteriorating security. The junta has cracked down on dissent, restricted NGO operations leading to job losses, and deepened the nation's isolation by withdrawing from the regional ECOWAS bloc. Despite initial popular support for the coup, many citizens now face increased suffering, and human rights groups report a severe decline in freedoms.

          <p>With a U.S. deadline for imposing 30% tariffs on EU imports looming on August 1, Brussels is preparing for a no-deal scenario by readying a major package of counter-tariffs. The EU has approved a list of duties on €93 billion worth of American goods, which could be implemented promptly if a trade agreement is not reached. While talks are ongoing, President Trump has stated there is only a "50-50 chance" of a deal. In the absence of an agreement, the EU is expected to take a tit-for-tat approach with its own tariffs.

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, escalating his long-standing war against media outlets. The suit claims a story describing a sexually suggestive birthday card Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein is false. This legal action is part of a broader strategy by Trump to use the courts and his executive power to punish and discredit news organizations that publish critical reports. Media experts view the lawsuit as an act of vengeance and a warning to other outlets, consistent with his history of labeling critical press as "fake news."</p>

          <p>The United Nations' human rights chief, Volker Turk, has condemned the UK government's decision to ban the pro-Palestinian activist group Palestine Action as a "disturbing" misuse of counter-terrorism laws. Turk argued the ban is "disproportionate and unnecessary" and infringes on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The UK proscribed the group under the Terrorism Act 2000 after activists claimed responsibility for damaging military aircraft. Turk criticized the UK's broad definition of terrorism, which includes serious property damage, stating it should be confined to acts intended to cause death or serious injury.</p>

Despite calls for a ceasefire from international leaders and an offer of mediation from ASEAN, Thailand's foreign minister stated there was "no need" for third-party involvement, insisting on a bilateral solution.</p>

          <p>British fashion chain River Island is facing a critical juncture as it seeks court approval for a major restructuring plan to avoid potential collapse. The retailer intends to close 33 UK shops and secure rent reductions for 71 others, citing heavy financial losses due to the shift to online shopping and rising operational costs. Once a high street giant, the family-owned company has struggled against intense competition from online rivals like Shein and Temu. The plan is a proactive measure to stabilize the business, but its future hinges on a High Court ruling next month.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board report has concluded that a 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene "Buzzy" Peltola Jr., the husband of then-Congresswoman Mary Peltola, was caused by the aircraft being overloaded with moose meat. The Piper PA-18 plane was nearly 120 pounds over its maximum certified weight. Additionally, moose antlers had been improperly strapped to a wing strut, creating an unapproved external load that degraded the plane's performance. These factors led to the pilot losing control shortly after takeoff from a remote wilderness area in Alaska, resulting in the fatal crash.</p>

Black, who was once the UK's youngest MP, stood down from Parliament last year and stated there were "too many times" she could not support the party's strategy. While she remains a supporter of Scottish independence, she feels the party needs to change significantly, reflecting a more left-wing perspective.</p>
