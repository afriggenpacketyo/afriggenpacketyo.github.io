          <p>President Trump has stated that doctors will be advised against prescribing Tylenol to pregnant women, citing an unproven link to autism. This claim has been met with strong opposition from medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who maintain that acetaminophen is one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women. While some studies have suggested a possible association, larger and more recent research has found no definitive causal relationship, and health officials continue to recommend the drug for necessary pain and fever management during pregnancy.</p>

The ruling allows Orsted to resume work on the nearly completed project, providing a significant boost to the company and reflecting positively on the renewable energy sector's prospects.

Daoud's work gives a voice to the female victims of the conflict, leading to accusations of Islamophobia, which he vehemently denies, stating his right to critique the Islamist violence he witnessed.</p>

          <p>The article posits that ABC's decision to bring back late-night host Jimmy Kimmel was a direct result of a significant public relations failure following his suspension. The network faced widespread criticism for caving to government pressure and being perceived as an opponent of free speech, drawing condemnation from celebrities and figures like Howard Stern. The author argues that the "indefinite" suspension became untenable for Disney and its CEO Bob Iger, ultimately forcing them to reinstate Kimmel to mitigate the damage to their reputation.</p>

          <p>Global investment in renewable energy technologies surged to a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, a 10% increase from the previous year. This growth occurred despite the Trump administration's efforts to roll back support for low-carbon projects, indicating strong underlying momentum in the sector. The report also notes that finance for wind power and electricity grids has seen significant increases, suggesting that the global transition to cleaner energy sources remains resilient and is continuing to attract substantial capital.

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reflects on her brief presidential campaign, arguing that a lack of time and interference from President Biden's staff hindered her chances. She recounts a distracting phone call from Biden just moments before her debate with Donald Trump, which she felt was self-serving and unsettling. The book also reveals her vetting process for a running mate, noting that while Pete Buttigieg was her first choice, she ultimately had concerns about Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's expectations for the vice presidential role.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for music producer Sean "Diddy" Combs have requested a prison sentence of no more than 14 months for his conviction on two prostitution-related charges. In a submission to a federal judge, they argued that since he has already been incarcerated for over a year, this sentence would result in his immediate release. The defense emphasized that the jury acquitted Combs of the more severe racketeering and sex trafficking charges, which they claim is an "affirmative indication of innocence" that should be considered during his October sentencing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese buyers have reportedly purchased at least 10 cargoes of soybeans from Argentina immediately after Buenos Aires temporarily suspended its grain export taxes. This move makes Argentine soybeans more competitive and allows China to secure supplies for the fourth quarter, a period typically dominated by U.S. exports. The deals represent another significant setback for American farmers, who have been largely excluded from their top market due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and are struggling with low prices.

          <p>Alaa Abdel Fattah, a leading British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist and political prisoner, has been freed after nearly six years of imprisonment in Egypt. His release came after a pardon from President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, reportedly following a request from the country's National Council for Human Rights. Abdel Fattah, who was convicted of "spreading false news," became a symbol of the widespread crackdown on dissent in Egypt, and his freedom was celebrated by his family and human rights advocates who had long campaigned for his release.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that Europe is strategically adrift, caught between an unreliable U.S. under Trump and an assertive China. With the transatlantic relationship fractured, Europe's previous policy of aligning with Washington on China is no longer viable, forcing a difficult reassessment of its own interests regarding trade, technology, and security. The author suggests China views Europe primarily through the lens of its rivalry with the U.S., prioritizing its "no-limits friendship" with Russia as a strategic necessity, leaving Europe in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>Prominent academic Zheng Yongnian is calling for China to establish its own unique foreign relations knowledge system, moving away from long-dominant Western theories. He argues that creating a China-centric framework is strategically urgent for Beijing to more effectively explain its global role and foreign policy to the world. This intellectual push aligns with China's broader goal of promoting a multipolar global order and asserting its influence on international governance, challenging the existing intellectual paradigms that have shaped global diplomacy for decades.</p>

          <p>A 33-year-old man from Washington, D.C., is facing federal charges after allegedly shining a laser pointer at the Marine One helicopter while President Trump was on board. According to a Secret Service affidavit, an officer observed the man point the laser at the aircraft as it flew overhead, creating a risk of collision by potentially blinding or disorienting the pilot. The suspect reportedly told investigators he was unaware he could not point the laser at the helicopter and was also found to be in possession of a small knife.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes a eulogy delivered by White House adviser Stephen Miller for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, portraying it as a distillation of Trumpism's core ideology. Miller's speech framed the political landscape as a Manichean struggle between the forces of good (Trump supporters) and pure evil (their opponents), whom he described as destined for destruction. The author contrasts this rhetoric with Barack Obama's eulogy after the 2015 Charleston church shooting, highlighting Miller's focus on collective blame and subjugation rather than reconciliation.</p>

          <p>Jack Thorne, the writer of the upcoming ITV drama "The Hack," has lauded the journalists who exposed the phone hacking scandal at the News of the World. The series, which stars David Tennant, will explore the troubling relationship between the press, police, and politicians that the scandal revealed. Thorne noted that unlike the Post Office scandal, which required a TV drama to gain widespread public attention, the phone hacking story is a celebration of how brilliant journalism successfully held its own powerful industry to account.</p>
