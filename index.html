          <h2>Polish Presidential Election Result Uncertain as Exit Polls Show Tight Race</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exit polls from the Polish presidential election indicate a close contest between Warsaw's Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki. Initial polls showed Trzaskowski slightly ahead, but later polls gave Nawrocki the lead, with official results expected the following morning. The outcome of the election could significantly impact Poland's political landscape, particularly regarding the government's ability to implement key campaign promises and its relationship with the European Union. Both candidates support continued assistance for Ukraine, but they differ on approaches to the EU, with Trzaskowski favoring closer ties and Nawrocki advocating for a more sovereign Poland. </p>

          <p>The UK government is set to reveal a significant defense review that includes plans to construct up to 12 new attack submarines, with an announcement expected from the prime minister. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance the armed forces' "warfighting readiness" in response to growing global threats. The new submarines, conventionally-armed and nuclear-powered, will replace the existing fleet starting in the late 2030s, and the UK will invest £15 billion in its nuclear warhead program. The construction of these submarines is projected to support 30,000 jobs into the 2030s, along with numerous apprenticeships and graduate roles. </p>

          <p>The Colorado Rockies suffered a 5-3 defeat to the New York Mets, marking their 50th loss of the season and setting a modern MLB record for futility. The Rockies have the worst record through 59 games since 1901 and have been swept in 10 of their 20 series, tying a league mark. The Mets' victory, powered by home runs from Pete Alonso and Francisco Lindor, propelled them to the top of the National League East. Despite firing their manager in May, the Rockies' struggles continue as they embark on a road trip against the Miami Marlins. </p>

          <p>According to Angela Zhang, a law professor at USC, US tariffs and technology restrictions are pushing China to innovate and find cost-effective solutions in its technology sector, particularly in artificial intelligence. Higher tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, but Chinese companies are responding by cutting costs and scaling up, as seen with the open-sourcing of AI models. These firms are also looking to other markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and seeking to deepen trade with Europe by offering technology transfers. While challenges remain under the Trump administration, Chinese firms are expected to continue pushing hard to remain competitive. </p>

          <p>Ukraine's recent drone attack on Russian air force bases, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," is sending a critical message to both Russia and Ukraine's western allies. The operation, which reportedly took 18 months to prepare, involved smuggling drones into Russia and launching them remotely, causing significant damage. While the exact extent of the damage is unverified, the attack serves as a propaganda coup and demonstrates Ukraine's continued resistance. The message aims to counter perceptions that Ukraine has already lost the war and to reinforce Kyiv's commitment to fighting for its independence. </p>
