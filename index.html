          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that he engaged in discussions with leaders from both Thailand and Cambodia, who are now reportedly seeking an immediate ceasefire to end deadly border conflicts. Trump indicated on social media that peace seems to be a natural outcome and linked future trade agreements to the cessation of hostilities. This development comes after the United Nations Security Council held an urgent meeting to address the fighting, which has resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced over 130,000 people. The long-standing dispute primarily revolves around the contested Preah Vihear temple.</p>

          <p>An extreme heatwave is impacting large areas of the U.S. Midwest and Southeast, with heat advisories affecting approximately 137 million people. Forecasters predict dangerously high temperatures, with heat indexes expected to reach between 105 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit in states from Florida to Virginia. The National Weather Service attributes the event to a persistent heat dome and is urging residents to take precautions against heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heatstroke. The weather service advises staying hydrated, seeking air-conditioned spaces, and limiting strenuous outdoor activities during peak heat.</p>

          <p>Director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed that a sequel to the 2002 hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is being developed, over two decades after the original's release. Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the changing landscape for women in football make it an opportune time to revisit the characters. The new installment, potentially a film or TV series, is tentatively planned for 2027 to coincide with the movie's 25th anniversary and the Women's World Cup. Chadha hopes to reunite the original cast for the project.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A USAID analysis of over 150 reported incidents found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza, a conclusion that contrasts with claims from the Trump administration. The report, compiled before USAID ceased independent operations, examined aid loss between October 2023 and May 2024. Both the Israel Defense Forces and the U.S. State Department have forcefully pushed back against the findings, asserting that significant aid diversion by Hamas does occur. The analysis emerges amid warnings of mass starvation in Gaza and debates over aid distribution methods.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:17:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Texas have developed a non-invasive wearable sensor designed to continuously monitor a person's hydration levels in real time. The device uses bioimpedance, sending a small electrical current through the body to measure tissue hydration, and transmits the data to a smartphone. This technology could help prevent dehydration-related health issues such as heatstroke, kidney stones, and cardiovascular problems. The creators envision its use not only for the general public and athletes but also for patients with chronic conditions, aiming to make hydration monitoring more accessible and proactive.</p>

After an early setback at 0-2, an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78) and KL Rahul (87) frustrated the English attack. Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team to a formidable total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined performance has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

          <p>BBC analyst Jeremy Bowen argues that Israel's offer to allow aid airdrops into Gaza is a gesture of desperation that will not solve the widespread hunger crisis. Drawing on past experiences in conflict zones like Iraqi Kurdistan and Bosnia, he describes airdrops as a crude, inefficient, and potentially dangerous method of delivery. Bowen contends that only a sustained, unrestricted ground-based aid operation via a ceasefire can address the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe. He emphasizes that land routes from Israel and Jordan are available and far more effective than dropping small amounts of aid from the sky.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men who were expelled from the U.S. to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison allegedly endured "state-sanctioned torture," according to their lawyers. The men were recently repatriated to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange deal between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments. Detainees have provided detailed testimonies of their experiences, which included severe beatings, humiliation by guards, unsanitary conditions, and being told they faced decades-long sentences. One man, José Manuel Ramos Bastidas, had no criminal convictions and was seeking asylum in the U.S. before his transfer.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), a body established under the Trump administration, is reportedly using an AI tool to identify and create a "delete list" of federal regulations. According to internal documents, the goal is to eliminate 50% of the 200,000 regulations it analyzes by the first anniversary of a potential second Trump term. The AI tool has allegedly been used by agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development to review thousands of regulatory sections. A White House spokesperson confirmed that various options are being explored to fulfill the president's deregulation promises.</p>

Kotsev, from the We Continue the Change party, was arrested on corruption charges, which his supporters claim are politically motivated by the rival GERB party. The protests highlight deep-seated concerns about the rule of law and judicial independence in Bulgaria, an issue also noted in a recent European Commission report.</p>

          <p>Tom Rogers, former NBC Cable President and a previous self-proclaimed "raging bull" on Netflix, is now expressing concern over the streaming giant's future. He points to declining viewership engagement per subscriber and intense competition from free content platforms like YouTube as significant headwinds. Rogers also suggests that while AI can help Netflix with ad targeting, it will also empower amateur creators on YouTube, blurring the line between professional and user-generated content. Despite these worries, he still sees Netflix as the world's most valuable media company for now.</p>
