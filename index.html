          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, after he was detained for over three months. Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, leading to demonstrations in New York and Washington D.C. The Trump administration argued that his activism interfered with US foreign policy and sought his deportation. Khalil criticized the administration for targeting him due to his protests against Israel's actions in Gaza and expressed eagerness to reunite with his wife and son. The judge ruled that the government's justification for detaining Khalil was likely unconstitutional, prompting the administration to cite a different charge related to his residency application.</p>

          <p>New emails obtained by WRAL shed light on Bill Belichick's romantic and professional relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old model. The controversy arose after a "CBS Sunday Morning" interview where Hudson declined to answer questions about how they met. Belichick claimed CBS secretly focused a camera on Hudson despite her request to sit off-camera, and explained that he met Hudson on a flight in 2021 and included her in his book acknowledgments for her creative contributions. He also addressed reports that he had Hudson copied on his emails, stating she assists him with his personal media. Belichick accused CBS of creating a false narrative, while CBS disagreed with his account.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump suggested he might fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. Despite previous statements of "no intention" to fire Powell, Trump expressed frustration, calling Powell a "Total and Complete Moron." Legally, firing Powell would be contentious, as federal law allows removal of Fed governors only "for cause." Trump's criticism stems from the Fed's interest rate policies, with Trump arguing that lower rates are needed to stimulate economic growth. Powell has maintained a cautious approach, balancing growth with the need to keep inflation in check. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Viral videos on Chinese social media have sparked debate about respect for the elderly. One video shows an elderly woman asking a young woman to give up a courtesy seat on a subway, leading to criticism from other young passengers and a refusal to move. In another incident, an elderly man with a cane asked a young man to give up his seat on a train, resulting in a heated argument. These incidents have reignited discussions about the erosion of traditional values such as filial piety in China's modern society, while staff at the subway authority in Shanghai offered little guidance on how to avoid such situations in the future.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests during a visit to Los Angeles. Vance also misidentified Senator Alex Padilla as ‚ÄúJose Padilla,‚Äù after the senator was forcibly removed from a press conference on immigration raids. Vance's visit, amidst turmoil surrounding the Israel-Iran war, underscores the Trump administration's focus on immigration policies. Newsom's office refuted Vance's claims, stating the governor has consistently condemned violence. The vice president's spokesperson later claimed the misidentification was a mix-up, while Newsom suggested it was intentional, referencing a convicted al-Qaida terrorism plotter with the same name.</p>

Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European diplomats in Geneva, who urged him to revive diplomatic efforts with the US. Israel's military announced new attacks on Iranian missile infrastructure after Iran launched missiles towards central Israel. Araghchi insisted that Iran's nuclear program was peaceful and that Israel's attacks violated international law, while stating that Iran will continue to exercise its right to self-defense. US President Trump suggested Iran had a limited time to avoid possible American air strikes.</p>

          <p>The United States' failure to reach a tariff deal with Japan, along with threats to impose new duties on other countries, could embolden China in trade negotiations. Analysts suggest that these developments demonstrate the difficulty Washington faces in securing favorable trade agreements. President Trump's earlier imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports had been temporarily paused, pending trade talks. Chen Zhiwu, a finance professor at the University of Hong Kong, believes these signs of desperation from the US side should encourage Chinese negotiators to take a firmer stance, as it shows that Washington is having a hard time getting what it wants through talks this summer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration faced environmental setbacks after moves to keep two Michigan coal plants open and a Supreme Court win for fossil fuel firms in an emissions case. The Department of Energy ordered the JH Campbell coal plant to remain open beyond its closure date, and the administration is expected to prolong the life of the Monroe power plant. These plants emit a significant portion of Michigan's greenhouse gas pollution. Opponents argue the decisions lack support in Michigan, could increase costs for ratepayers, and are ideologically driven, as the state's utilities did not request the plants to stay online.</p>

          <p>As summer approaches, the topic of wearing shorts in the office remains contentious despite the increasing casualization of workplace attire. While some companies have no explicit dress codes and encourage comfortable yet professional clothing, others expect staff to dress appropriately, especially when meeting clients. Stylists suggest that the appropriateness of shorts depends on context, with tailored shorts being more acceptable than beach or sports shorts. Some companies, like We Are Social, even allow employees to wear hot pants, while others, like Santander, prohibit beachwear. The perception of shorts may also differ between men and women, with some men feeling less comfortable wearing them outside of vacation.</p>

Yusuf's abrupt departure and subsequent return to Reform also drew parallels with his time at Velocity, where concerns included unpredictable behavior and unhygienic office conditions.
