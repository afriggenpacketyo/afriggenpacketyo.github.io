          <p>In a recent interview, Donald Trump attributed the positive aspects of the economy to his policies while assigning blame for any negative performance to Joe Biden. Trump defended his tariffs as a tool that would enrich the United States, despite economic uncertainty. He asserted that his administration had only been in power for a short period, implying that the effects of his policies were still unfolding. This article highlights Trump's strategy of taking credit for successes while deflecting blame for challenges.</p>

          <p>Samantha Montano, an emergency management expert, warns that the Trump administration's cuts to disaster management agencies will lead to increased deaths and devastation from extreme weather events and other disasters. She argues that the cuts to FEMA and NOAA will impair the ability to accurately predict, prepare for, and respond to disasters. Montano highlights the importance of these agencies for issuing warnings, evacuation orders, and pre-positioning resources, noting that the US is dismantling the emergency management system at a time when climate change is increasing the risk of hazards.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is considering cutting interest rates due to growing concerns about the impact of Donald Trump's trade war on the UK economy. Financial markets anticipate a quarter-point reduction in the key base rate, with some economists suggesting a more substantial cut is needed. Concerns over Trump's tariffs include a potential slowdown in trade and rising prices for US consumers, which could impact business and consumer confidence globally. The Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, has warned of a "growth shock" to the UK economy as a result of these policies.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's promises that his tariffs would create manufacturing jobs, they are already resulting in job losses, as evidenced by layoffs at Mack Trucks' Lehigh Valley plant. The company cited tariffs and economic uncertainty as the reasons for the layoffs, contradicting Trump's claims. While some workers remain supportive of tariffs in the hope of long-term change, economists largely agree that manufacturing will not return to its former prominence in the US economy. The article explores the complex feelings of workers in communities built around manufacturing, who are grappling with the decline of their industry.</p>

While the US economy has historically rebounded from shocks, Trump's defunding of scientific research and discouragement of immigration could hinder long-term growth. The biggest risk, however, is the potential reduction in the value of the dollar due to shaken confidence in America's economic and political stability.

          <p>The Israeli security cabinet has approved a plan to expand military operations in Gaza, including the mobilization of tens of thousands of reservists. Prime Minister Netanyahu claims this action is needed to defeat Hamas, while critics express doubts about the strategy's effectiveness. The move follows the collapse of a ceasefire and a halt to humanitarian aid, prompting widespread hunger and shortages. Concerns are rising about the impact on Palestinians and the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas, with calls for prioritizing a deal to secure their release.</p>

          <p>A mainland Chinese military magazine claims that China's sixth-generation fighter, unofficially dubbed the J-36, could potentially block airspace up to 1,000km from the Chinese shore, impacting foreign bases in Guam. This fighter is being developed to counter the American B-21 stealth bomber in a potential conflict over Taiwan. The article suggests that the J-36 could hinder the US Navy and Air Force's ability to maintain air superiority in the western Pacific.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the political meaning behind Trump's tariffs, arguing that they are not solely based on economic theory but are part of a broader vision to protect a way of life. It examines the historical context of capitalism's "spirit," from the Protestant work ethic to social democracy and the rise of the creative entrepreneur. The author contends that Trump's protectionist spirit masks sinister desires and fails to address the real issues underlying economic pain, advocating for a democratizing spirit that promotes collective well-being.</p>
