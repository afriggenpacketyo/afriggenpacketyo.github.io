          <p>Portugal is in profound shock after a 140-year-old Gloria funicular derailed in Lisbon, resulting in 15 fatalities and 18 injuries, five critically. Foreign nationals were among the victims of the crash, which occurred around 18:05, leading to a national day of mourning. Eyewitness accounts suggest a braking system failure caused the carriage to hurtle down the steep street and collide with a building. Authorities are investigating the cause, while European leaders have extended their condolences for this tragic event.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 both rose, with Australian household spending showing strong growth. Global bond markets remain under pressure, as the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield surpassed 5% following a court ruling on Trump-era tariffs. The tech sector's performance was notably strong after a favorable Alphabet antitrust decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Restoration of America Foundation (ROAF) is urging the Senate Finance Committee to question Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. regarding the removal of safety protocols for the abortion pill mifepristone. ROAF argues that the Biden administration's rollback of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements, which allowed telehealth prescribing and mail-order delivery, endangers women and shifts costs to taxpayers. They contend these changes eliminated essential safeguards like in-person screening for complications, advocating for their immediate reinstatement.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has requested the Supreme Court to expedite an appeal challenging lower court decisions that declared most of his imposed tariffs illegal. This appeal follows a 7-4 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which stated that Trump exceeded his authority in implementing broad levies on various countries. The administration argues that delaying a ruling could lead to significant disruption, with potential unwinding of $750 billion-$1 trillion in collected tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent contends the ruling undermines the President's diplomatic and national security capabilities.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Caravello, a 37-year-old professor at Cal State Channel Island, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on a felony charge of assaulting U.S. Border Patrol agents. The incident occurred during a protest against an immigration raid at a Ventura County marijuana farm, where Caravello allegedly picked up a tear gas canister deployed by agents and threw it back at them. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in federal prison, despite initially pleading not guilty to a downgraded misdemeanor charge. The incident highlights the tensions during the raid, which also saw one worker die while attempting to flee.</p>

          <p>China has initiated a 14-day aviation management workshop in Beijing for representatives from eight Southeast Asian nations, aiming to promote its domestically produced civilian aircraft, including the C919. This initiative seeks to capitalize on Southeast Asia's leading role in accepting Chinese aircraft deliveries, despite the global dominance of Airbus and Boeing. Experts view this as a strategic move to "break the duopoly" of Western manufacturers and deepen economic cooperation within the region. The training covers critical areas like safety management, airworthiness certification, and new technologies.</p>

While proponents argue it protects women and fetuses, critics denounce it as an intimidation tactic and a form of vigilante enforcement, anticipating numerous legal challenges.

          <p>Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, stated on Thursday that Russia considers any potential foreign military deployment in Ukraine "unacceptable" and has no plans to discuss it. Her comments directly addressed remarks by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who had outlined "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment as part of post-conflict security guarantees for Ukraine. Germany's defense minister had also previously dismissed von der Leyen's suggestions as premature. Russia views such intervention as fundamentally undermining any security discussions.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in artificial intelligence "agentic frameworks," the essential tools for creating autonomous AI agents, with major tech companies like Tencent and ByteDance entering the fray. Tencent recently open-sourced its Youtu-Agent framework, achieving a high score on a web traversal benchmark. This follows ByteDance's open-sourcing of its Coze Studio and Alibaba's Qwen-Agent earlier in the year. These developments position Chinese firms to compete with US players like AutoGen and OpenAI Swarm, enabling AI agents to autonomously perform complex tasks by planning and executing subtasks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump labeled the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein controversy an "irrelevant Democrat hoax" on Wednesday, despite a growing push on Capitol Hill to compel the release of all related files. Trump claimed thousands of documents had been released, but survivors expressed profound hurt over his characterization, with one Republican survivor inviting him to meet to understand the trauma. A bipartisan discharge petition, led by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, is gaining signatures to force a House vote on releasing the full records, challenging House Republican leadership and the White House's preferred committee investigation.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade, observed by President Trump, highlighted the potential dangers of his "America first" trade policies, particularly tariffs, which risk scrambling global economic and political alignments. The parade, coupled with an economic summit where Xi and Putin huddled with India's Modi, indicates a thawing of frosty relations between China and India, partly due to the impact of Trump's tariffs. Experts suggest China's display and diplomatic moves are an effort to rewrite international rules and challenge the US-backed order. The article also notes legal challenges to Trump's tariffs, raising questions about their long-term viability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expanded the U.S. military's counterterrorism mission into domestic crime fighting, targeting drug smugglers with lethal strikes in international waters and deploying the National Guard in American cities. This shift, exemplified by a missile strike against alleged "narco-terrorists," moves the armed forces into roles traditionally held by law enforcement. Critics argue this crosses a historical line dating back to the American Revolution, which sought to limit military involvement in internal affairs. The administration justifies these actions under the commander-in-chief authority and by designating drug gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, despite internal intelligence agency findings to the contrary.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling there was "no invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had used this obscure wartime law to remove hundreds of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, some sent to a supermax prison in El Salvador. The court rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" constituted an invasion, stating it was not an "armed, organized force." This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy, with the ACLU hailing it as a win against executive overreach.</p>

While the Treasury noted existing taxes on the wealthy, Nowak argued that banks have seen record profits and should pay their fair share.
