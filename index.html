        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The anglicized phrase 'Das crazy' has been voted the German Youth Word of the Year, reflecting the growing influence of English and internet culture on the language. Selected through an online poll by the PONS Langenscheidt publishing house, the term is a grammatically incorrect but popular expression used by young people to convey surprise or speechlessness. The choice highlights a trend towards brevity and the deliberate, humorous breaking of linguistic rules in youth communication. It narrowly beat out other slang terms like 'goonen' in a vote that saw two million participants, demonstrating how language evolves in online and everyday spaces.</p>

          <p>A Cameroon-flagged tanker has caught fire in the Gulf of Aden after being struck by an unidentified projectile, according to the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations. The incident occurred approximately 130 miles east of Aden, Yemen, a region known for attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. While no group immediately claimed responsibility, a maritime security firm reported that radio traffic suggested the crew was preparing to abandon the vessel, prompting a search-and-rescue effort. The attack continues a pattern of disruptions in a critical global shipping corridor that has resulted in multiple fatalities and sunken ships.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge recommends that parents delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, suggesting they should not have a smartphone until they can drive independently. To prepare them, she advises starting conversations about responsible technology use at least six years in advance, ideally in late elementary school. Key topics include protecting personal information, understanding the value of privacy, and recognizing time as a precious resource. Twenge also stresses the importance of setting firm rules, such as no phones in bedrooms overnight and using parental controls to enforce moderation.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer's LAFC has reiterated its support for the 'queer' community after co-sponsoring an awards ceremony that honored transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. At the Violet Visionary Awards, Thomas received the 'Voice of Inspiration' award, a decision that has drawn criticism from opponents of transgender athletes in women's sports. A spokesperson for an LAFC supporter group spoke at the event, emphasizing that queer individuals have always been a part of the sports world as fans and athletes. The club's involvement highlights the ongoing cultural debate surrounding transgender inclusion in sports, which has led to regulations in 29 states.</p>

          <p>Michael Berkowitz, a former commodities trader, successfully launched the luxury coat brand Norwegian Wool from his Bronx apartment after identifying a market gap for stylish, warm winter coats suitable for professionals. He invested $50,000 of his own money and secured further investment to create prototypes that blend Italian wool aesthetics with functional warmth. After personally testing the first coat in a supermarket's walk-in freezer, he sold his initial run of 200 coats in three months and quit his job. Today, the profitable brand is sold in over 100 stores, with its coats worn by billionaires and featured in popular culture.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) rule is causing concern among travelers by requiring airlines to input either 'M' or 'F' for a passenger's sex, regardless of an 'X' marker on their passport. The 'X' marker, introduced in 2022 for non-binary and intersex individuals, remains a valid identifier on the travel document itself due to a court order. However, the new airline input requirement creates confusion and potential difficulties for travelers, who fear they may face increased scrutiny, invasive pat-downs, or denials of boarding for international flights. Legal experts note the policy's implementation is unclear but suggest it could empower individual agents to act on personal biases.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett categorizes investments into three types: currency-based assets, non-productive assets like gold, and productive assets such as farms or businesses. He argues that currency-based investments are a bet on government stability and tend to lose value over time. Buffett famously critiques gold, explaining that its value relies solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future, as it produces nothing on its own. He strongly favors the third category—assets that generate tangible returns, like crops from a farm or profits from a company—as their success can be rationally calculated based on what they deliver.

          <p>An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that remarriage is a common outcome for divorced Americans, with two-thirds eventually marrying again. The study shows that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and nearly half of those who remarry have a child with their new spouse. Remarriage also appears to have economic benefits, as the median household wealth of remarried adults is comparable to those in their first marriage and significantly higher than that of divorced, single adults. While divorce rates have generally declined since the 1980s, the trend of remarriage continues to shape U.S. family structures.</p>

          <p>Despite being dismissed as embarrassing or ineffective, the anti-Trump 'Resistance' movement is re-emerging with a renewed sense of purpose, exemplified by the 'No Kings' protests. This article argues that the movement's earnest, and sometimes 'cringe,' idealism is a potent antidote to the cynicism and nihilism of authoritarian politics. While critics mocked the aesthetics of the first-term Resistance, its grassroots organizing contributed to significant political victories, such as the 2018 midterms. The new wave of activism is more localized, focusing on community solidarity and mutual aid, suggesting that sincere belief in democratic values, however uncool, remains a powerful tool for political change.</p>

          <p>Russia's investment envoy has confirmed that a feasibility study began six months ago for a 'Putin-Trump' rail tunnel connecting Russia and the U.S. under the Bering Strait. The ambitious project, which would link Alaska with Russia's Chukotka region, was pitched as a symbol of unity that could significantly shorten cargo routes. When asked about the idea during a press conference, President Trump called it 'interesting.' However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was present, expressed his disapproval of the concept, a reaction that drew laughter from the U.S. delegation.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has announced that the country is no longer bound by the restrictions of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the landmark nuclear deal officially expired. The agreement had capped Iran's nuclear activities and uranium stockpiles in exchange for sanctions relief. The deal has been in jeopardy since the U.S. withdrew in 2018, and recent efforts to revive it have stalled. The announcement comes after Britain, France, and Germany triggered a mechanism to reinstate international sanctions, citing significant violations by Iran, a move that Tehran says has removed any reason for further negotiations.</p>

          <p>Organizers anticipate that millions of demonstrators will participate in the second major wave of 'No Kings' protests across the United States. The movement, a coalition of progressive groups, accuses President Trump of authoritarian behavior and is protesting a range of administration policies, from immigration detentions to environmental rollbacks. The first protests in June drew an estimated five million people, and organizers believe this event could be larger. In response, some Republican leaders have condemned the marches as 'hate America' rallies, and the governors of Virginia and Texas have mobilized their states' National Guards as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>Native American tribes in California's Owens Valley are intensifying their fight to reclaim water rights from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP). While L.A.'s diversion of surface water is well-known, the city also operates numerous wells that pump groundwater from the valley, which tribal leaders say has desiccated their homeland, destroying springs and meadows. The tribes, whose ancestors called the area 'the land of flowing water,' argue that this pumping has severely damaged the ecosystem.
