          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to attend a military parade in Beijing, marking his first participation in a multilateral event with other heads of state. The visit, confirmed by both Chinese and North Korean state media, is seen by analysts as a potential indicator of a strategic realignment between the two allied nations. Chinese officials have warmly welcomed Kim's attendance, which coincides with the 80th anniversary of the end of Japanese colonial rule on the Korean peninsula. His presence alongside 25 other foreign leaders from nations including Vietnam, Pakistan, and Iran underscores a significant diplomatic moment for North Korea on the international stage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially revoked the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, effective September 1st. While federal law typically provides such protection for only six months post-service, the Biden administration had extended it to 18 months due to a heightened threat environment. However, the Trump administration directed the Department of Homeland Security to rescind the detail, stating a recent threat assessment did not find any alarming conditions warranting the extension. This decision follows a pattern of the administration removing security details for other former officials and family members of the previous administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's policy of maintaining visa access for hundreds of thousands of Chinese students is drawing criticism amid concerns over national security and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) influence in the U.S. A China policy expert from the Hudson Institute warned that the CCP has historically exploited this access for espionage and to silence dissent among Chinese nationals on American campuses. While the administration frames the policy as a continuation of existing norms essential for the financial health of U.S. universities, critics argue it creates a significant security liability.

          <p>The Pentagon has announced its intention to restore a controversial portrait of Confederate General Robert E. Lee to the library at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The large canvas, which depicts an enslaved man holding Lee's horse, was removed in 2022 following a law mandating the removal of Confederate commemorations from military installations. This move aligns with President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's efforts to reinstate Confederate symbols, framing their removal as an erasure of history. The decision has sparked debate over how to interpret the 2020 legislation and the role of such historical figures in military institutions.</p>

          <p>Yoga, the ancient Indian practice, has evolved into a significant tool for India's global soft power and cultural diplomacy. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga on June 21 has elevated the practice to a symbol of Indian national identity on the world stage. This cultural export is seen as a non-controversial way to build people-to-people ties and project India as a civilizational force beyond its economic and political influence. However, some critics raise concerns about the over-commercialization of yoga in the West and its potential use for political agendas domestically.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber made baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves. He became only the 21st player to achieve this feat and just the fourth to have an opportunity to hit a fifth homer in the same game. In his final at-bat, Schwarber faced a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the blowout 19-4 victory. By popping out on a slow pitch, Schwarber averted a potential controversy that could have tainted a record-setting fifth home run, as hitting it off a non-pitcher would have been viewed by many as illegitimate.</p>

          <p>Australian celebrity crocodile wrangler Matt Wright, star of "Wild Croc Territory," has been found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice. The charges stemmed from a 2022 helicopter crash that killed his co-star, Chris Wilson, during a crocodile egg-collecting expedition. A Darwin Supreme Court jury convicted Wright of lying to police about the helicopter's fuel level and encouraging the injured pilot to falsify flight records. Wilson was collecting eggs while dangling from a line when the aircraft reportedly ran out of fuel. Wright has been released on bail pending an appeal and expressed his disappointment with the verdict.</p>

Police have used tear gas and water cannons against demonstrators in Jakarta and Surabaya, who are demanding justice for Kurniawan's death.

The draft regulations would only permit the procedure if the mother's life is endangered, a narrow exception that advocates warn could lead to preventable deaths. This move would reverse a 2022 Biden administration policy that expanded abortion access for veterans following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.

          <p>The foreign ministers of six European countries—Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia, and Spain—have jointly condemned Israel's intensified military operations in Gaza City. In their statement, they warned that the offensive endangers the lives of remaining hostages and will cause an intolerable number of civilian deaths. The ministers also denounced the forced displacement of Palestinians and the systematic destruction of essential infrastructure as violations of international law. The statement comes as the Israeli military declares Gaza City a "dangerous combat zone" and suspends humanitarian pauses, and a UN-backed monitor confirms famine in the area.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Prime Minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, has been ordered to leave office after the nation's Constitutional Court ruled she violated ethics rules. The case centered on a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen, in which she was heard criticizing her own military commanders during a border dispute. At 39, Paetongtarn was the country's youngest-ever prime minister and head of the Pheu Thai party, continuing the political dynasty of her father and aunt. Her removal has destabilized the ruling coalition, and lawmakers must now vote on a successor to prevent further political turmoil or potential snap elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump has moved to block $4.9 billion in foreign aid previously approved by Congress, employing a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission." By formally requesting to cancel the funds just before the end of the fiscal year, the administration ensures Congress lacks the 45-day window to act, causing the funding to expire. This tactic, last used nearly 50 years ago, effectively allows the president to make budget cuts without legislative approval, raising constitutional questions about the separation of powers. The targeted funds were allocated for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a new regulation that would impose fixed time limits on visas for international students, cultural exchange visitors, and foreign journalists. Currently, these individuals can often stay for the duration of their program or employment. Under the new rule, student and exchange visas would be limited to a maximum of four years, while journalist visas could be restricted to as little as 90 days for Chinese nationals, with options to apply for extensions. The administration states the change is necessary for better monitoring, but it is seen by critics as another move to tighten legal immigration pathways.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing significant bipartisan backlash for firing Dr. Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), just one month after her confirmation. The dismissal, reportedly for refusing to align with the administration's anti-vaccine stance, has caused turmoil within the agency, leading to the resignation of four other top leaders and a staff walkout. Republican senators like Susan Collins have called the removal alarming and baseless, while others have questioned the legitimacy of vaccine recommendations made amid the chaos. The events have been described by critics as a politically motivated "war on science."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's AI Action Plan, combined with its efforts to restrict data collection on marginalized communities, risks embedding systemic biases into the future of American healthcare, according to this analysis. The article argues that by pressuring developers to create AI free from so-called "ideological dogmas" and by purging certain data from government sources, the administration incentivizes the creation of biased algorithms. These AI tools, which are increasingly used for medical diagnoses and treatment plans, could perpetuate and automate existing health disparities. History shows that once such biases are coded into clinical tools, they can cause harm for decades.</p>

          <p>Defender Trent Alexander-Arnold is facing a difficult period in his career after being excluded from the latest England national team squad by coach Thomas Tuchel. This decision comes shortly after a challenging start to his tenure at Real Madrid, where he was substituted early in his debut and benched for the following match. Tuchel has previously expressed public reservations about Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities, and this omission suggests the player has a significant battle ahead to secure a spot for the next World Cup. The setback at the international level compounds the pressure he faces in establishing himself at his new club.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD announced a nearly 30% drop in profits for the second quarter, earning 6.4 billion yuan despite a 14% increase in revenue. The Shenzhen-based company attributed the decline to an intense price war and aggressive marketing tactics within China's highly competitive EV market. While domestic profitability suffered, BYD's overseas sales surged dramatically, with international deliveries increasing by almost 145% compared to the same period last year. The results illustrate the challenge for Chinese automakers of balancing fierce competition at home with rapid expansion into global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Median prices for condominiums in the U.S. have declined by 2.1% over the past year, but this drop may not signal a bargain for potential buyers. The price reduction is largely attributed to an oversupply of condos on the market, particularly in states like Florida and Texas. However, rising hidden costs, such as increased HOA dues, surging insurance premiums, and new reserve fund requirements, are often offsetting the lower sale prices. Real estate agents advise that when these additional monthly expenses are factored in, the long-term cost of a condo can be comparable to that of a more expensive single-family home.
