          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to global oil supplies and subsequent price increases. While the price of West Texas Intermediate crude initially jumped but later declined, experts speculate that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial waterway for oil transport. However, ongoing tensions could still disrupt the energy market, with potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities posing a significant risk. A closure of the Strait of Hormuz could send prices soaring, potentially reaching $130 per barrel and significantly impacting global GDP (not investment advice).</p>

However, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel criticized the announcement for lacking immediate funding plans, emphasizing the urgency due to current geopolitical threats.

Iran denies launching missiles and its top security body has promised a decisive response to further Israeli aggression. The ceasefire, announced by Trump, aimed to end the 12-day conflict after Iran attacked a U.S. base in Qatar, which it claimed was retaliation for American strikes against its nuclear sites. Despite initial compliance, Israel reported missile launches from Iran, escalating tensions and casting doubt on the stability of the agreement.</p>

Slusser had previously expressed concerns about potential long-term brain damage from a second concussion, but the investigation found insufficient evidence to corroborate the allegations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decline in deep reading, characterized by sustained engagement with longform texts, is raising concerns about its potential impact on politics. Some commentators argue that the rise of digital media, with its emphasis on short-form content and social interaction, is leading to a reversion to an oral culture, impacting abstract thought and critical reasoning. Walter Ong's theory of orality suggests that pre-literate societies relied on memory, repetition, and concrete thinking, which may be mirrored in today's digital landscape. While acknowledging the potential harms, it's important to consider that literacy itself does not guarantee a commitment to liberal values, and the relationship between reading habits and political engagement is complex.</p>

          <p>The Democratic establishment's support for Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race is seen by some as an attempt to imitate Donald Trump's masculine, cruel, and combative style. Cuomo, who resigned as governor following sexual misconduct allegations, is accused of being abusive, corrupt, and indifferent to his constituents. Critics argue that the Democratic Party is abandoning decency by embracing Cuomo, rather than offering a contrast to Trumpism. This approach is seen as a moral failure and a potentially unwise political strategy, as voters seeking a strongman may prefer the real Trump over a Democratic imitation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in Brussels, focusing on defense spending commitments and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The summit takes place shortly after Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. The alliance has already agreed to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP, which Trump is taking credit for. The summit's agenda is overshadowed by recent U.S. military strikes against Iran, which have heightened tensions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>House Oversight Committee Democrats are convening to select a new ranking member following the death of Representative Gerry Connolly. The ranking member, though currently in the minority, would be in line to chair the Oversight Committee should Democrats regain control of the House in 2026. Four Democrats are competing for the top position, Representatives Stephen Lynch, Kweisi Mfume, Robert Garcia, and Jasmine Crockett. The selection occurs after a previous shakeup in committee leadership assignments, illustrating tensions within the party over a potential generational shift.</p>

          <p>President Trump's popularity is at its lowest point during his second term, marked by high disapproval ratings on key issues like the economy and immigration. A trend has emerged where Trump's popularity declines when he takes center stage with high-profile policy decisions, while it recovers when he recedes into the background. This suggests that the public reacts negatively to Trump's actions, reflecting a thermostatic model of public opinion where support shifts in the opposite direction of the government's actions. It is yet to be seen how his current military actions will affect these trends.</p>

          <h2>Labour MPs Mount Major Bid to Block Benefits Changes</h2>

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, expressing concerns about cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits. The amendment cites concerns about pushing people into poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. The number of Labour opponents could potentially defeat the government's welfare plans if combined with opposition parties. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden stated the government would talk to MPs with concerns, but insisted there was "no escaping the need for reform".</p>
