          <p>Two Israeli Embassy staff members, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 31, has been charged with first-degree murder and other related offenses, with authorities investigating the incident as a possible hate crime and act of terrorism. Rodriguez allegedly shouted "Free Palestine" during his arrest, and investigations are ongoing into his motives and potential connections to extremist groups. The victims were a young couple, with Lischinsky planning to propose to Milgrim in Jerusalem the following week, and the shooting has sparked condemnation from Israeli officials, who labeled it an antisemitic attack.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate accelerated to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years and exceeding market expectations. This rise in inflation, driven by persistent cost pressures, strengthens the case for the Bank of Japan to consider exiting its long-standing ultra-easy monetary policy. Headline inflation also climbed to 3.6%, remaining above the central bank's 2% target for more than three years, prompting Governor Kazuo Ueda to signal a readiness to continue raising rates, albeit at a slower pace, as authorities assess the impact of U.S. tariffs on the economy.</p>

Critics argue that Trump and his family are improperly benefiting from his position, with funds potentially flowing directly into their coffers.

Littler, the winner on the night, averaged over 114 and broke his own Premier League seasonal points record. Aspinall will join Littler, Luke Humphries, and Gerwyn Price at the London play-offs. Littler described his victory as a "warm-up" for the upcoming finale. Aspinall had finished just outside qualification in the previous two seasons, making this achievement significant.</p>

          <p>President Trump confirmed that a group of migrants from countries including Vietnam, Cuba, and Mexico were stuck in Djibouti, after a federal judge in Boston ordered them to remain there. The judge ruled that the Trump administration had given the deportees ‚Äúplainly insufficient‚Äù time to contest their expulsion. Trump criticized the decision, claiming the individuals were ‚Äúviolent criminals‚Äù and that the order forced the administration to leave ICE officers behind to watch them. Lawyers for the migrants expressed concern for their welfare, including access to food, water, and legal counsel.</p>

Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican, being asleep during the vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson joked about the situation, while Garbarino expressed pride in his role in negotiations. The bill includes a provision to lift the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes, a key issue for blue-state Republicans.
