The map details connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain regions, potentially aiding understanding of cognitive functions. Significant differences were found between macaque and rodent claustrums, which could provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness. This research contributes to the ongoing scientific exploration of how consciousness is generated and why it differs among species.</p>

          <p>An experiment assessing the viability of growing lab-grown food in space was launched into orbit by the European Space Agency (ESA). The project aims to explore cost-effective ways to feed astronauts in low gravity and high radiation environments, potentially leading to small food production plants on the International Space Station. Lab-grown food involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and processing them to resemble normal food, with potential benefits for long-term space missions. The team hopes to eventually use 3D printers to create customized meals for astronauts.</p>
