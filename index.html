          <p>A crane collapse at SpaceX's Starbase facility in Texas has triggered an investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The incident, captured on a livestream, adds to concerns about the company's workplace safety record, which has previously come under scrutiny for exceeding industry averages for injuries. It is not yet clear if anyone was harmed in the collapse. This event occurs amidst other challenges for SpaceX, including setbacks with its Starship rocket and criticism from environmental groups, complicating its ambitious plans for Mars exploration and its relationship with government partners like NASA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to announce a significant concession on its proposed welfare reforms following pressure from over 100 Labour backbenchers. The deal will reportedly protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit from planned cuts, which will now only apply to future claimants. This move represents a major climbdown for the government, which faced a potential defeat in the House of Commons. While the compromise is expected to allow the bill to pass, it raises questions about the future of the government's spending plans and has been criticized for creating a potential two-tier welfare system.</p>

          <p>A region in northern West Virginia is experiencing another round of torrential rain and flash flooding, less than two weeks after a deadly deluge killed nine people. The Wheeling area received a flash flood warning as up to two inches of rain fell rapidly, causing creeks to overflow and streets to turn into rivers. Residents reported that homes still being repaired from the previous flood were taking on water again. The earlier event on June 14 saw dozens of homes and businesses damaged, prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency for the county.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed Anthony Bernal, a former senior aide to Jill Biden, as part of its investigation into former President Joe Biden's mental fitness for office. The subpoena compels Bernal to appear for a deposition after his voluntary interview was withdrawn. This action is part of a broader Republican-led effort, supported by President Trump, to investigate the previous administration, including the use of an autopen for official documents. President Trump has waived executive privilege for Bernal and seven other former Biden officials, allowing them to testify about their interactions with the former president.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai is facing criticism from opposition lawmakers after a speech in which he compared the nation's democratic progress to forging steel and removing "all impurities." Critics condemned the remarks as a veiled threat and an attempt to justify a political purge of dissent. The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party claims the speech echoes extreme ideological purity and is linked to the ruling party's efforts to recall dozens of KMT legislators. They have called on the public to reject what they term Lai's "dictatorship" by voting against the recalls, highlighting growing political tensions in Taiwan.</p>

The reservoir was controversially empty during the January firestorm that destroyed thousands of homes, raising questions about its unavailability during the emergency. Repairs to its torn floating cover took longer than expected due to additional damage from storms and embers. While the DWP has restored the reservoir's function, inquiries into why it was offline during the critical fire event and the potential impact on firefighting efforts remain ongoing.</p>

Despite this downturn, some economists suggest that overall GDP growth remains on track to meet the government's target, potentially reducing the urgency for more aggressive stimulus.

Despite this headwind, Nike's fourth-quarter earnings beat Wall Street expectations, and the company signaled that the worst of its financial downturn may be over. The sportswear giant is now focused on stabilizing its business, which includes resetting its digital strategy and rebuilding relationships with wholesale partners. (not investment advice)</p>

The indictment accuses him and his co-conspirators of stealing and selling data from over 40 victims, including a telecommunications company and a healthcare provider, causing at least $25 million in damages. If convicted on charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and wire fraud, West could face up to 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Omar Navarro, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran against Rep. Maxine Waters four times, has pleaded guilty to wire fraud for funneling campaign donations to his personal use. As part of a plea agreement, Navarro admitted to a single felony count, which will prohibit him from holding office in the future. Prosecutors alleged he used campaign funds for personal trips and expenses, channeling the money through his mother and a friend. Navarro, who had gained the support of high-profile conservative figures, had previously claimed the charges against him were politically motivated.</p>
