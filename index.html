          <p>South Korea's LG Energy Solution has secured a major $4.3 billion contract to supply batteries to an undisclosed corporation, with the agreement running until July 2030. While the company maintained confidentiality regarding the counterparty, reports suggest the deal is with electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla. The contract's value is notably larger than LG Energy's entire second-quarter revenue, highlighting its significance for the company's growth. The deal involves the supply of lithium iron phosphate batteries, but it remains unspecified whether they are for electric vehicles or energy storage systems. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami warnings for Hawaii and parts of Alaska, and advisories for the entire U.S. West Coast. Japan also issued a tsunami alert, with small waves reaching its northern coast, while evacuations occurred in Russian regions near the epicenter. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center cautioned that waves could reach up to 10 feet in some areas, prompting authorities in Hawaii to activate warning sirens and urge residents to seek higher ground. This event is reported as the strongest earthquake globally since the 2011 quake off Japan.</p>

          <h2>Indian Rupee Faces Pressure Amid Threat of Increased U.S. Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 22:54:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Indian rupee is anticipated to weaken significantly following indications from U.S. President Donald Trump that Indian exports could face tariffs of 20-25%. This development adds to pressure from ongoing portfolio outflows, with the rupee expected to open at a four-month low. India is reportedly preparing for these higher tariffs as it has not yet secured a trade deal with Washington, unlike several other regional and global partners. While negotiations are planned to resume next month, the uncertainty is expected to cause a negative market reaction, potentially prompting intervention from the Reserve Bank of India.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is set to sign an executive order that will allow local governments in the Los Angeles area to limit housing development in neighborhoods affected by wildfires. The order specifically targets a 2021 state law, SB 9, which permits the construction of up to four homes on lots previously zoned for single-family residences. This decision follows pressure from Los Angeles officials who raised concerns that increased housing density in high-fire-risk areas like Pacific Palisades could severely complicate future emergency evacuations. The move aims to balance housing needs with public safety in fire-prone communities.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes significant steps to end the conflict in Gaza, release aid, and commit to a two-state solution. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the move is intended to "affect the situation on the ground" and create a pathway to peace amid the suffering. The decision has drawn criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a reward for terrorism. Domestically, the policy shift was welcomed by some Labour MPs but criticized by opposition parties for either not going far enough or for being poorly timed.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its intention to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," a key scientific basis that classifies greenhouse gases as a threat to public health under the Clean Air Act. This finding has underpinned all major federal regulations on climate pollution from vehicles, power plants, and other sources for over a decade. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the move as a major deregulatory action to save Americans billions annually and restore consumer choice. Environmental groups and former EPA officials condemned the decision as a denial of established science and vowed to challenge it in court.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation for the second quarter fell to 2.1% year-over-year, its lowest level since March 2021 and below economists' expectations. This figure brings inflation to the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2%-3% target range, strengthening the case for an interest rate cut. While the RBA held rates steady in its last meeting, analysts believe the weaker inflation data, combined with a softer global growth outlook and rising unemployment, provides sufficient evidence for a rate reduction at its upcoming August meeting. The RBA governor noted the low figure is partly due to temporary cost-of-living relief measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NYC Mayor Eric Adams described the deadly mass shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building as an "intentional, sick, twisted act of violence," sharing details from surveillance footage. The gunman, who traveled from Nevada, appeared to methodically target victims, and a note found on him mentioned CTE, possibly linking his motive to the NFL headquarters in the building. Four people were killed and one was injured before the shooter took his own life. Adams praised the building's security and the rapid police response, while also calling for national legislation to address the availability of automatic weapons.</p>

          <p>A zoo in Nuremberg, Germany, has sparked controversy and protests after culling 12 healthy Guinea baboons, citing overcrowding in their enclosure. The zoo stated that conflicts among the baboons had increased and that it could not find alternative housing, making the culling a "legitimate last resort." The culled animals were subsequently fed to the zoo's predators. Animal rights groups have filed a criminal complaint, arguing the decision was illegal and resulted from irresponsible breeding policies. The incident has reignited a broader European debate over the practice of culling healthy zoo animals.</p>

The motion also cites ongoing threats of violence at the Metropolitan Detention Center and frames his actions as part of a consensual "swinger" lifestyle. Combs was acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering charges but was convicted of violating the Mann Act for transporting sex workers.</p>

The discussions covered economic issues, rare earth minerals, and the implementation of previously agreed terms, with the U.S. also pressing China on its relations with Russia and Iran.

The new group will run as a 12-month pilot and will exclude trans and non-binary individuals, operating alongside the charity's existing inclusive sessions. The move acknowledges that some survivors require a female-only space for their healing, reflecting a recent UK Supreme Court ruling on single-sex services.</p>

          <p>Shortly after the Trump administration extended the term of U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli in Los Angeles, federal prosecutors filed motions to dismiss charges in two high-profile cases.

          <p>A recent American Eagle ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has ignited a firestorm of online debate, illustrating the broken nature of modern digital discourse. The ad's play on "jeans/genes" was interpreted by some as an obtuse or even nefarious nod to eugenics, sparking progressive outrage, which was then amplified by reactionary commentators to portray their opponents as hysterical. The article argues that this cycle, where genuine concerns are stripped of context and weaponized for engagement, is not a productive conversation. Instead, it becomes an attention spectacle where all participants issue statements without listening, feeding an algorithm that thrives on perpetual conflict.</p>

          <p>An ophthalmologist is issuing a strong warning about the dangers of sleeping with contact lenses, even for short naps, calling the habit a "game of Russian roulette." Sleeping in contacts significantly increases the risk of a corneal ulcer, a serious infection that can cause permanent vision loss or, in extreme cases, the loss of the eye itself. The expert also cautions against exposing lenses to any nonsterile source, including tap water or swimming pools, as this can trap bacteria against the cornea. To maintain eye health, the doctor advises throwing away contacts if proper solution is unavailable.</p>

While the federal move would dismantle the legal basis for many national emissions standards, experts say it might inadvertently cede regulatory authority to states. California has a long history of implementing its own aggressive environmental laws that predate the federal finding, such as its mandate to phase out gas-powered cars. If the EPA formally declares it cannot regulate greenhouse gases, it may create a stronger legal argument for California to enforce its own stricter standards.</p>
