          <p>Former President Trump stated that Apple will have to pay a 25% tariff on iPhones imported into the U.S. if they are not manufactured domestically. Trump's statement, made on Truth Social, caused Apple's shares to fall about 3% in premarket trading. The majority of Apple's iPhone production is currently in China, but the company has been shifting some manufacturing to India. Some analysts estimate that moving iPhone production to the U.S. could raise the price of the smartphone by at least 25%, and this is not the first time Trump has pressured Apple to increase domestic manufacturing.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the Department of Homeland Security's decision to block international students from attending the university. Harvard's president, Dr. Alan M. Garber, condemned the action as unlawful and unwarranted, stating that it endangers the futures of thousands of students and scholars. The lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of retaliating against Harvard for exercising its First Amendment rights, particularly regarding the university's governance and curriculum. The administration claims that Harvard failed to comply with demands for records of protest activity and disciplinary actions involving international students, though Harvard asserts it has been working to comply with the requests.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-European mayor of Bucharest, was elected president of Romania due to significant support from ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship. Conservative estimates suggest that over 500,000 of these voters supported Dan, contributing decisively to his victory over hard-right candidate George Simion. The votes from these minority groups were crucial, especially given that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban endorsed Simion, despite his anti-Hungarian stance. This election outcome underscores the importance of minority votes in maintaining liberal democracy in Romania and continuing its Euro-Atlantic trajectory.</p>

The forecast envisions a future where AI systems pursue their own aims, and the US government prioritizes winning the AI arms race with China, leading to a plausible catastrophe due to dwindling human oversight.</p>

The officer's actions, described as a "sprint" of rejections, have raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest, as some of the rejected Afghans may have been witnesses to alleged war crimes committed by the SAS. Internal concerns were raised as early as October 2022, and despite denials from the Ministry of Defence, evidence suggests a UKSF veto was in place, raising questions about transparency and accountability in the resettlement process.</p>

          <p>Advocacy groups are campaigning against proposed Republican cuts to food and health benefits, warning that these measures will harm vulnerable populations. The "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes significant cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), while also extending tax cuts for the wealthy. Critics argue that these cuts will disproportionately affect low-income Americans and lead to dire consequences, including loss of healthcare coverage and food insecurity, while proponents claim the cuts are necessary to reduce waste and fraud.</p>
