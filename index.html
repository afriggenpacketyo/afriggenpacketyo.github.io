          <p>Youth-led anti-corruption protests in Nepal led to the death of 51 people, including protesters and police, and the escape of thousands of prisoners. The protests toppled the government, and former chief justice Sushila Karki is expected to be appointed as interim prime minister due to the demands of the 'Gen Z' protesters. Some prisoners who escaped have been detained trying to cross the border into India, while Karki's appointment is expected to be announced after a meeting at the President's residence. The scale of the public unrest is emerging as normality returns to Kathmandu. The situation remains sensitive as negotiations continue. Optimism score has not been determined.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Insect Populations Declining in Undisturbed Areas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 05:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill reveals that insect populations are declining even in areas relatively untouched by human activity. The research, conducted over 15 summers in a remote Colorado meadow, showed an average annual decline of 6.6% in flying insect density. Climate change is identified as a likely factor, with a lag time observed between summer temperatures and their impact on insect numbers the following year. Entomologist Jonathan Larson emphasizes the critical role of insects in the global food chain, raising concerns about the potential impact of their decline on various ecosystems.

          <h2>FDA May Discontinue Expert Reviews of New Drugs Under Trump</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under President Trump, FDA leaders are considering ending the practice of using external experts to review drug applications, which critics fear would reduce public scrutiny of the agency's decisions. The FDA argues these reviews are redundant and time-consuming, preferring to focus on broader regulatory questions. Former FDA officials and academics disagree, asserting that expert reviews aid FDA scientists and enhance public understanding of drug regulation. While the FDA has begun publishing complete response letters, critics argue this does not replace the value of open committee meetings. Optimism score has not been determined.</p>

          <p>Russia and Belarus have initiated joint military exercises amid escalating tensions with NATO countries, particularly after Poland reported Russian drones breaching its airspace. The drills, named Zapad ("West"), are scheduled from September 12 to 16 and involve tens of thousands of soldiers. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted that the exercises are not aimed against any other country, but rather to improve cooperation and training. The UK announced new sanctions targeting companies supplying electronics and explosives used in Russian weapons, coinciding with British Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper's visit to Kyiv.

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper, with just over 100 satellites in orbit, secured its first contract to provide in-flight WiFi to JetBlue, challenging SpaceX's Starlink in the satellite internet market. Despite Starlink's significant lead in the number of satellites and launch capacity, Amazon's move injects competition into the market. Global satellite operators plan to launch roughly 70,000 LEO satellites between 2025 and 2031, driven by the potential for 6G communications and providing internet access to underserved populations. This competition aims to benefit the roughly 2.5 billion of people - or 30.5% of the world's population — who lack internet access. Optimism score has not been determined.</p>
