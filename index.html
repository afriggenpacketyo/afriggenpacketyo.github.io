        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Magistrate Judge expressed significant confusion and surprise during the indictment process for former FBI Director James Comey, as revealed by a court transcript. The judge questioned interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump personal lawyer, about the presentation of two inconsistent versions of the indictment, both bearing the grand jury foreperson's signature. This procedural irregularity arose after the grand jury voted against one of the three proposed charges, ultimately indicting Comey on two counts: making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. The charges represent an unprecedented step for the Justice Department, coming after years of public calls from President Trump for Comey's prosecution, raising concerns about political influence in the legal process.</p>

          <p>The popular dance competition "Strictly Come Dancing" is gearing up for its first live show, with 15 celebrity-professional pairings preparing to compete for the glitterball trophy. Backstage interviews highlight the grueling training and the range of emotions, from excitement about the show's glamour to significant nervousness among contestants. This season features notable participants like Ellie Goldstein, the first star with Down's syndrome, and replacement Amber Davies. The article also touches on recent controversies, including allegations of drug use and a separate sexual assault investigation involving an unnamed star from the show, which contestants largely dismiss as they focus on the dancing.</p>

          <p>Three immigrant detainees, Miguel Angel García-Hernandez, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, and Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, have been identified as victims in a deadly attack on a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas. The FBI characterized the incident as a "targeted attack" by alleged shooter Joshua Jahn, who later died by suicide. Guzman-Fuentes was killed, and García-Hernandez sustained multiple serious gunshot wounds, with his family seeking legal assistance and a GoFundMe campaign launched for support. Jahn's notes indicated he aimed to harm ICE employees, not detainees, but the incident tragically resulted in civilian casualties. This event underscores the volatile nature of immigration enforcement and the risks faced by individuals within detention facilities.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown promising results in slowing the progression of Huntington's disease by 75%, offering immense hope for patients and their families. This breakthrough is particularly significant as there has been no prior treatment for the devastating neurodegenerative condition, which combines symptoms of dementia, Parkinson's, and MND. For families like Gemma and Matt Botting, whose husband was diagnosed in 2011, the news feels "like winning the lottery 10 times over," transforming their outlook from despair to optimism. While the treatment's full study awaits publication and NHS availability is years away, the scientific community sees it as a major step with potential implications for other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

The U.S. Secret Service is investigating how the individual gained entry, and the incident is framed by the White House as part of a disturbing pattern against the President and his staff.</p>

          <p>Three women, Ashleigh Brown, Cynthia Raygoza, and Sandra Carmona Samane, have been indicted on charges of illegally "doxing" a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Los Angeles. The indictment alleges the women followed an agent from a federal building to their residence, live-streamed the event, and shouted personal information. Authorities, including Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, condemned the actions, stating that those who threaten or harm federal agents will face prosecution. This case marks a significant legal action amid ongoing protests against Trump administration immigration enforcement, with federal officials expressing concerns about the "doxing" of agents.</p>

The charge, making false statements to Congress, specifically claims Comey lied under oath in 2020 when denying he authorized anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source regarding the Clinton probe. It is understood that "PERSON 1" in the article refers to Clinton, and "PERSON 3" is Comey's close friend and former personal lawyer, Daniel Richman.

The girls were found suffocated with wrists bound after Decker failed to return them from a visit. Due to the minimal skeletal remains and the time elapsed, a forensic anthropologist could not conduct a full autopsy, leaving many questions about his death unanswered.</p>

Manufacturers are offering 0-2% financing, particularly for electric vehicles, but general interest rates remain higher than during the pandemic. The article advises consumers to use aggregate sites like CarGurus for approximate "Days on Market" data to aid in bargaining, though this metric can include transit time. Overall, the car market is slowing but 2025 remains a relatively good year since 2019, influenced by factors like EV sales saturation. (not investment advice)</p>

Justice Elena Kagan criticized the use of the emergency docket for such a significant decision, citing insufficient deliberation.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer outlined key economic events for the upcoming week, focusing on the nonfarm payroll report and earnings from companies like Paychex and Nike. Cramer expressed concern about economic overheating in some sectors versus struggles in others, questioning the Federal Reserve's ability to balance these trends. He highlighted Carnival and Jefferies for their insights into leisure travel and investment banking, respectively. Paychex earnings will provide a metric for the small and medium-sized business economy, while Nike's report is anticipated for its potential "breakout quarter." The nonfarm payrolls report on Friday is deemed crucial, as hot figures could deter further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Famed money manager Howard Rubin and his former assistant, Jennifer Powers, have been arrested on sex trafficking charges, accused of transporting women for commercial sex acts over a decade. Prosecutors alleged Rubin engaged in abusive acts, converting a Manhattan penthouse into a "sex dungeon" with equipment for non-consensual activities. A federal magistrate judge ordered Rubin detained without bail, citing flight risk and his alleged discussion of hiring a "hitman" against civil suit plaintiffs. Rubin, who pleaded not guilty, faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted, with prosecutors detailing his extraordinary wealth and attempts to structure payments to avoid reporting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts suggest that President Trump's public attacks on James Comey and the controversial leadership changes in the prosecuting U.S. Attorney's Office could severely undermine the indictment against the former FBI director. Former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi argues these factors provide strong evidence for a selective or vindictive prosecution defense. The appointment of Trump's former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, to lead the prosecution, despite a "declination" memo from career prosecutors, raises significant concerns about political motivation. While such claims are difficult to win, the unusual circumstances surrounding Comey's case make it a notable exception, potentially challenging the integrity of the legal process.</p>

One incident involved a dog attacking four employees, sending them to the hospital. Wag Hotels stated the settlement was mutual, admitting no wrongdoing for "isolated incidents" and asserting that issues have been addressed by their current practices.</p>

Her case has long been a point of contention in U.S.-Cuba relations, with American authorities demanding her return. While the FBI listed her as a "most wanted terrorist," her supporters viewed her as a victim of an unjust system, and her writings became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

Professor Victor Kattan, speaking for the petitioners, welcomed state recognition but argued it doesn't address the UK's historical conduct, which he believes empowered a "dictator" and caused suffering.
