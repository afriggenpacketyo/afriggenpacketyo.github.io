          <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her role in a widespread bribery scheme. She was convicted of accepting bribes, including cash, gold bars, and a luxury car, in exchange for her husband's political influence. The judge considered her health issues but emphasized her central role in the conspiracy, stating that she was a knowing and active participant. Despite tearfully blaming her husband in court, she has indicated she does not plan to divorce him.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News argues that Wikipedia editors are pushing a biased, left-wing narrative to discredit conservative activist Charlie Kirk following his assassination. The author claims that Kirk's article is framed with negative labels like "right-wing" and focuses on controversies, a treatment not applied to comparable left-leaning figures. The piece contends that this alleged bias extends to the sources used and influences AI platforms like ChatGPT, thereby shaping the public's perception of Kirk in a deliberately damaging way.</p>

          <p>This article examines the security arrangements at the Utah Valley University event, including the presence of six police officers and Kirk's private security team for a crowd of 3,000. Experts suggest the outdoor venue made it difficult to control access and that the shooter's position on a rooftop exploited a key vulnerability. The analysis raises critical questions about the adequacy of threat assessments and security protocols for high-profile public figures at open-air events.</p>

          <p>Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has completed a loan move to Turkish club Trabzonspor for the remainder of the 2025-26 season. The Cameroon international, who was signed for £47.2m in 2023 to be the team's starting keeper, had not played in the club's first three Premier League matches this season. His only appearance under the new manager was in a Carabao Cup defeat, prompting the move to secure more playing time.</p>
