          <p>The Department of Justice has formally requested the Supreme Court to reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse crimes. Maxwell's legal team argues that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement with Epstein should have also protected his co-conspirators, including her, from federal prosecution nationwide. However, the DOJ contends the agreement was limited to a specific Florida district and did not apply to Maxwell, whom they describe as an incidental beneficiary not even known to prosecutors at the time.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Victorville, California, have arrested a man for allegedly orchestrating a prank involving a teddy bear that appeared to be made of human skin. The man, Hector Corona Villanueva, is accused of filing a false emergency report after leaving the macabre-looking item at a gas station. The San Bernardino County coroner confirmed the bear was not made of human remains, and a South Carolina artist later identified it as one of her creations sold online. Officials criticized the incident for wasting valuable emergency resources.</p>

          <p>Recent firings of federal prosecutors by the Trump administration are impacting a major criminal case against a Florida businessman accused of stealing $100 million from a fund for children with special needs. The lead prosecutor, Michael Gordon, was among those dismissed, raising concerns that the case against Leo Govoni could be jeopardized. Critics allege the firings are political retribution, while victims of the alleged fraud express fear that justice will be delayed. The Justice Department has not commented on the dismissals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico, terminating a long-standing trade agreement. The Commerce Department stated the move is intended to protect American farmers from what it calls unfair trade practices and cheap imports that have undercut domestic pricing. While U.S. growers, particularly in Florida, have praised the decision, critics and some business groups warn it could lead to higher consumer prices for tomatoes and potential retaliatory tariffs from Mexico. This action is part of a broader strategy of increasing tariffs on various trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The estimated number of people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County has decreased by 4% to 72,308, marking the second straight year of decline. Mayor Karen Bass hailed the results of the annual count as a sign that the city's strategies are working, noting a significant 17.5% drop in unsheltered homelessness within the city of Los Angeles since 2023. While officials celebrated the progress in moving people into shelters and housing, they acknowledged the situation remains a crisis, with people of color disproportionately affected.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, in his role as administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is facing criticism for out-of-touch comments made during a Fox Business interview. While discussing recent cuts to Medicaid, Oz advised Americans to "do the most that you can do" to stay healthy, specifically suggesting they should "not eat carrot cake" and instead eat real food. His remarks, made while presenting the host with a carrot cake, were widely mocked on social media as trivializing the serious issue of millions losing their health care coverage.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Major League Baseball should modify its Home Run Derby format to encourage participation from its biggest stars, like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, who are absent from this year's event. Ohtani has cited the physical demands of the current format as a reason for not competing, suggesting changes like limits on swings or a focus on distance. The author contends that the league should be flexible to maximize the exposure Ohtani brings, as his presence would elevate the event's profile and draw much-needed attention to the sport.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump's recent policy shift against Russia, including threatening tariffs and authorizing weapons for Ukraine, is motivated by personal frustration and a sense of humiliation. According to White House sources, Trump feels that Russian President Vladimir Putin has ignored his repeated calls to end the war, making him appear weak. This change in approach is seen less as a strategic realignment toward supporting Ukraine and more as a reaction to being personally slighted by the Russian leader's defiance, providing a deeper context for the administration's actions.</p>
