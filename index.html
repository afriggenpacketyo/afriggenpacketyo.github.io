          <p>Fidelity's recent analysis of over 25,000 corporate 401(k) plans revealed that the average savings rate, including both employee and company contributions, has reached a record high of 14.3% during the first quarter of 2025. Employees are deferring 9.5% of their income, while companies are contributing 4.8%. Fidelity recommends aiming for a 15% savings target to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement, but experts emphasize that the ideal percentage varies based on individual circumstances such as existing savings and planned retirement date. Many companies offer 401(k) matching contributions, which employees should take advantage of as it's essentially 'free money' to boost their retirement savings (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Dana Chandler, 65, was sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the 2002 murders of her ex-husband and his girlfriend. The case involved a complex legal journey, including an overturned conviction due to prosecutorial misconduct and a hung jury in the second trial. Chandler's daughter, Hailey Seel, delivered a victim impact statement, expressing her belief in her mother's guilt and recommending a maximum sentence if Chandler continued to deny involvement. Throughout the trials, Chandler maintained her innocence, claiming she was not in Topeka, Kansas, on the day of the murders and never owned a 9mm firearm. The article notes that families of the victims hope the focus shifts from Chandler to remembering those who were killed.</p>

Despite exceeding earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter and raising its full-year earnings outlook, the company's revenue estimates remained unchanged (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, a move that experts predict could lead to higher prices for various consumer goods. Industries such as automobile manufacturing, sports equipment, and canned goods are expected to be affected due to their reliance on these metals. While some businesses may absorb the increased costs, many are likely to pass them on to consumers through higher prices, potentially impacting affordability, particularly for lower-income households. The tariffs are intended to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations, but concerns remain about the impact on consumers and businesses.</p>

          <p>Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Charles W. McCook, a WWII pilot, has been accounted for 82 years after his plane crashed in Burma during a bombing raid, where he was credited with saving a fellow airman's life. McCook was able to bring the damaged plane up to an altitude that allowed Boyd and the other surviving soldier to parachute from the craft before it crashed. After the war, the American Grave Registration Service recovered four sets of remains from a common grave near a village in Burma. McCook will be buried in his hometown in August 2025.</p>

          <h2>UK-US Trade Deal Could Come Into Effect Soon, Says Starmer</h2>

          <p>Keir Starmer has expressed optimism that a trade deal with the US, agreed upon last month, could be implemented soon, with indications that the UK will be exempt from increased steel and aluminum tariffs. While the executive order signed by the US president will raise import taxes for US companies buying from other countries, levies will remain at 25% for imports from Britain. Discussions are ongoing to reduce the tariff rate to effectively zero, benefiting sectors such as steel, aluminum, and automotive.</p>
