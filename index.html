          <p>McDonald's reported a larger-than-expected decline in U.S. same-store sales, marking the worst domestic performance since the COVID-19 pandemic's onset, as it faced challenges from bad weather and cautious consumer spending habits. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted a substantial drop in traffic from low- and middle-income consumers, highlighting the economic pressures affecting a broader range of diners, while high-income consumer spending was not enough to offset the losses from other income groups. The fast-food chain plans to focus on value meals and popular menu items to attract customers, such as the return of snack wraps and tie-ins with the Minecraft video game franchise. The article reports that the company's strategy appears to be working as new McCrispy Chicken Strips have been selling well and tie-in meals with Minecraft have been successful.</p>

          <p>A court found Apple in willful violation of a 2021 injunction related to the Epic Games case, with a judge accusing an Apple executive of lying under oath regarding the company's App Store fee policies. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple Vice President of Finance Alex Roman "outright lied" about when Apple decided to levy a 27% fee on some purchases linked to its App Store. Apple disputes the decision and plans to appeal, despite the court's intention to refer the matter to U.S. attorneys for potential criminal contempt proceedings against both Roman and Apple.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government, advocating for a "system of merit" in hiring and recruitment. Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller stated that the administration seeks to prevent society from devolving into what he termed "communist, woke, DEI strangulation," emphasizing that merit-based systems drive innovation and economic growth. The administration is leveraging federal funding to pressure universities to eliminate DEI programs, warning state education departments of potential funding losses if they maintain such policies.

          <p>Elon Musk described his first 100 days as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as "very intense," acknowledging progress but stating that it has "not been as effective as I'd like" due to "an entrenched set of interests." Musk claimed that DOGE has saved American taxpayers $160 billion so far, but he emphasized the difficulty of reforming federal budgeting and the need for more political support to reach the goal of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending. He also discussed his day-to-day life in Washington, including occasionally staying at the White House and working seven days a week.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs, but lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to a recent cancer treatment deal. The company's blockbuster diabetes treatment, Mounjaro, and weight loss drug, Zepbound, exceeded sales estimates, but Eli Lilly revised its fiscal 2025 earnings outlook to reflect a $1.57 billion deal charge related to its acquisition of an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the threat of tariffs is already bringing back critical supply chains into important industries.</p>

          <p>Despite many Western companies announcing their withdrawal from Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, some are maintaining their trademark rights in the country, indicating a desire to retain brand ownership for potential future re-entry. Companies like Ikea, McDonald's, and Mercedes-Benz are among those keeping their trademarks registered, while others, such as Henkel and Fortum, have not applied for their trademarks to be used in Russia after February 2022. This move is seen as a formal procedure to avoid brand appropriation and facilitate potential repurchase rights if the political situation changes.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have signed a deal giving the United States control over a share of its future revenue from natural resources, a long-awaited agreement that Kyiv hopes will clear the way for continued U.S. support. The announcement late on Wednesday that the deal had been signed came after months of fraught negotiations — including an explosive Oval Office confrontation — as the Trump administration tries to broker an end to Ukraine’s three-year war with Russia. The agreement, which involves creating a joint investment fund between the countries, is intended to give President Trump a personal stake in the country’s fate while addressing his concerns that the United States has provided Kyiv with a blank check to try to withstand Russia’s invasion. It could also clear the way for more consequential talks on U.S. military backing for Ukraine and on the terms of a possible truce with Russia.</p>
