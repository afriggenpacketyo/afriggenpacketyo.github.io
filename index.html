          <p>Black Sabbath's guitarist, Tony Iommi, has admitted to feeling nervous about the band's farewell performance in their hometown of Birmingham. The concert marks the first time the original lineup has played together in two decades, drawing over 40,000 fans from around the world. Iommi described the preparations as tough due to the band members' age but emphasized the poignancy of ending their career where it all began. He confirmed this would be their final show, hoping it concludes their legacy on a positive note.</p>

          <p>A six-month-long bin strike in Birmingham has left the city grappling with "apocalyptic" piles of uncollected rubbish, with no end to the dispute in sight. The strike, initiated by the Unite union over proposed role downgrades, has suspended recycling and green waste collections, causing significant frustration for residents. The city council remains committed to resolving the issue, even as its recycling rate has plummeted to be among the lowest in the country. Residents are resorting to storing waste in their homes or are unable to access recycling centers.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated he "understands what anchors" US President Donald Trump, citing a connection built on shared family values. Despite political differences, Starmer said their good personal relationship was instrumental in securing a crucial deal to exempt UK industries from US tariffs. He recounted how Trump offered condolences after his brother's death, highlighting family as a point of connection. Starmer asserted that building strong relationships with international leaders like Trump is vital for the national interest, leading to tangible benefits for the country.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street Group from its markets, accusing it of extensive market manipulation. The regulator also froze over $566 million in alleged illegal gains, claiming the firm artificially influenced the Nifty 50 index for profit through a complex trading strategy. Jane Street allegedly used large stock purchases to influence index options before selling off positions to drive the index down, profiting from bets on its decline. The firm has disputed the findings and stated its commitment to regulatory compliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has passed Congress, marking a significant legislative victory that finances many of his campaign promises. The bill includes extensive tax cuts, increased funding for immigration control and defense, and incentives for fossil fuels, while cutting health and social programs. Critics highlight that the legislation is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade and could cause millions to lose health insurance coverage. Despite its unpopularity in polls, the bill represents a major success for Trump's "America First" agenda.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the national park system to implement higher entrance fees for foreign visitors. The order instructs the Interior Department to develop a strategy to increase fees for non-U.S. residents while keeping prices low for Americans, under an "America First" policy for parks. The administration estimates this surcharge could generate over $90 million annually to fund park improvements. The order also calls for U.S. residents to receive preferential treatment in park access systems, such as lotteries or permitting, and revokes an Obama-era memo promoting diversity.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has taken a person into custody after they crossed the heavily fortified border from North Korea. The individual, who was unarmed, crossed the Military Demarcation Line in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). South Korean forces safely guided the person out of the mine-strewn area. The Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the individual is being investigated by relevant authorities, but did not specify if it was a defection attempt. This is a rare event, as successful crossings of the dangerous DMZ are uncommon.</p>

          <p>On the eve of Independence Day, veterans and legal advocates warned that the Trump administration's deployment of troops to Los Angeles threatens democratic norms and erodes public trust. Critics argue the move pushes the military close to violating the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federal troops from civilian law enforcement. Speakers at a virtual conference highlighted the strain on military families and argued that service members are not trained for domestic policing. They described the situation as "making America militarized again" and contrary to the principles the nation was founded on.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that immigrants with no criminal convictions constitute the most rapidly growing segment of the population in ICE detention, which now holds at least 56,000 people. According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of those detained have no criminal record, challenging the administration's narrative of focusing on the "worst of the worst." Researchers note a significant increase in the detention of non-criminal individuals since May, coinciding with a push for more arrests. The article highlights the case of a pastor deported after 30 years in the U.S. despite having no criminal history.</p>

          <p>Significant staffing cuts at the National Park Service (NPS) are creating safety concerns, particularly at locations like Maryland's Assateague Island National Seashore, where lifeguard towers are shuttered. Advocacy groups report the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff since January due to a hiring freeze and budget cuts under the Trump administration. While the NPS acknowledges a nationwide lifeguard shortage, critics directly link the understaffing to administration policy. Local officials and advocates fear the lack of personnel, especially lifeguards, puts the millions of summer visitors at increased risk.</p>
