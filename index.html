          <p>This article alleges that Donald Trump has leveraged his presidency for significant personal financial gain, contradicting his public image of donating his presidential salary. The report highlights the Trump family's ventures into cryptocurrency, including meme coins and a publicly traded token, which have reportedly increased their net worth by billions. These activities raise concerns about corruption and conflicts of interest, particularly when access to the president is seemingly offered to top investors in his private businesses, blurring the lines between public service and personal enrichment.</p>

          <p>Following a series of high-profile scandals, BBC Director General Tim Davie and Chair Samir Shah faced questions from a parliamentary committee regarding the corporation's workplace culture. Davie asserted that "no-one is irreplaceable" and that the organization is determined to address bad behavior, regardless of an individual's fame or importance. The executives acknowledged that cultural change takes time and more issues may yet surface, but they are implementing changes to handle abuses of power more effectively. They also addressed criticism over the broadcast of a controversial Glastonbury performance, calling it a "significant mistake."</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is reportedly set to appoint Ange Postecoglou as their new head coach following the sudden dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo. Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham at the end of last season despite winning the Europa League, is considered a strong candidate to take over at the City Ground. Nuno's departure after 21 months surprised many players, especially after he guided the club to European qualification for the first time in decades. The potential appointment of Postecoglou has received mixed reactions from fans, with some wary of his high-risk tactical approach.</p>

          <p>A Russian airstrike has reportedly killed more than 20 civilians in the village of Yarova, located in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the victims were ordinary people who were collecting their pensions at the time of the attack. This incident represents one of the deadliest single attacks on civilians in recent weeks, occurring near the front lines where Russian forces have been advancing. Zelensky condemned the strike and called for a global response to the ongoing violence against non-combatants.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within the Murdoch media empire has been resolved, cementing Lachlan Murdoch's future control over Fox News and News Corp. A new agreement establishes a trust controlled by Lachlan, while his more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts holding company shares. Instead, they are expected to sell their holdings and will each receive approximately $1.1 billion, effectively ending their influence over the media conglomerate's conservative direction. The deal concludes years of family turmoil that famously inspired the television series "Succession."</p>

          <p>The city of Shenzhen, China, has launched a new service allowing international tourists to receive tax refunds instantly through overseas e-wallets like AlipayHK. This initiative, a partnership between Ant International's Alipay+ and local authorities, aims to streamline the refund process from days to seconds. The move is part of a broader Chinese strategy to attract more foreign visitors and stimulate consumer spending. To further encourage tourism, China recently lowered the minimum purchase amount for tax refunds and increased the cash refund limit, expanding the program to more stores and locations.</p>

This surge is occurring as the Trump administration increases pressure on elite universities over issues like diversity initiatives. While the growing interest is a positive sign for HBCUs, it also presents financial challenges, as many of these institutions lack the resources to provide sufficient financial aid for all applicants.</p>

The station's slogan is "Make Country Great Again," and it uses a voice actor impersonating Trump for on-air promotions, including a controversial "Deportation a day" cruise giveaway.

In response, groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics are issuing their own recommendations, and some states are creating their own policies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent cuts to Medicaid enacted under the Trump administration are projected to have a severe financial impact on children's hospitals across the United States. While Republicans framed the cuts as targeting fraud and non-working adults, nearly half of all Medicaid enrollees are children. Hospitals that rely heavily on the program for revenue, like Phoenix Children's, anticipate losing hundreds of millions in supplemental payments, which could force them to reduce staff and critical services. The law will cut federal Medicaid spending by about $900 billion over a decade, potentially causing 7.5 million Americans to lose coverage.</p>

          <p>At a virtual BRICS summit, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called on member nations to address significant trade imbalances, noting that India's largest deficits are with its BRICS partners. The call came as the bloc, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, collectively criticized U.S. trade tariffs. India's trade deficit with China reached a record high of $99.21 billion in the last fiscal year, and its deficit with Russia has also grown. This focus on internal economic issues contrasts with China and Russia's view of BRICS as a geopolitical counterweight to the West. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Novi Sad, Serbia, used what witnesses described as excessive force against peaceful demonstrators, deploying tear gas, stun grenades, and batons to disperse a protest at the city's university. The crackdown led to a chaotic scene, with police chasing and beating students, professors, and other citizens. President Aleksandar Vucic praised the police for a "professionally executed job" and labeled the protesters "cowards," while critics called the action a retaliatory assault meant to intimidate dissent. The incident has raised concerns that the Serbian government is shifting toward open repression to crush opposition.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a U.S. judge decided against breaking up Google, citing the rapid emergence of generative AI as a significant factor that could disrupt the search market. The Department of Justice had sought to force Google to sell its Chrome browser after a court found it had illegally monopolized search. However, Judge Amit Mehta's final decision acknowledged that AI-powered chatbots from companies like OpenAI and others represent a new form of competition that could change the industry. Instead of a breakup, Google will be required to share some information with rivals and establish an oversight committee.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has personally overseen the final ground test of a new solid-fuel engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), according to state media. Solid-fuel missiles are considered a greater threat because they can be launched more quickly and are harder to detect than liquid-fuel variants. Analysts believe this successful test indicates that Pyongyang is ready for a full test launch of the new ICBM, possibly before the end of the year. The development suggests North Korea's missile program is advancing, potentially aided by technical expertise from its deepening cooperation with Russia.</p>
