          <p>Following a Houthi missile strike near Israel's main airport, Israeli forces bombed the main international airport in Sanaa, Yemen, targeting runways, aircraft, and infrastructure. The Israeli military claimed the airport was being used by the Houthis to transfer weapons and personnel. Yemeni civilians expressed concerns about the disruption of flights, which provide a vital link to the outside world for medical treatment and work. The Houthi-controlled government vowed to retaliate, declaring a "holy war" in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Sanaâ€™s airport was previously closed for nearly six years during a war against the Houthis, and only reopened in 2022.</p>

          <p>Florida Fish and Wildlife officers killed three bears that may have been responsible for the death of an 89-year-old man and his dog near Naples. DNA samples have been sent for testing to determine if the bears were involved in the fatal attack. The incident occurred south of the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, prompting officials to urge local residents to remain alert. This marks the first deadly bear attack on a human in Florida's history, though conflicts between bears and dogs are common. The FWC is investigating what led to the attacks, as the black bear population in Florida has been on the rise. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit surged to a record $140.5 billion in March, driven by a spike in imports as businesses and consumers sought to get ahead of President Trump's impending tariffs. Consumer goods, particularly pharmaceutical products imported from Ireland, saw the largest increase. This import surge contributed to a contraction in U.S. economic growth during the first quarter, with GDP falling at an annual rate of 0.3%. Economists warn that these tariffs will likely increase operating costs for businesses and raise prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A declassified U.S. intelligence memo concludes that the Venezuelan government, led by President Maduro, does not control the Tren de Aragua (TDA) criminal gang. This contradicts claims made by President Trump, who has used the gang's alleged control by Maduro to justify deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while some Maduro regime members may tolerate or work with TDA, there is no evidence of widespread, organized cooperation or direction of the gang's activities in the U.S. The intelligence community assesses that Maduro views the gang as a threat, and that TDA is decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large-scale human trafficking or migrant smuggling.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has introduced legislation aimed at restricting the use of mifepristone, a widely used abortion pill, following a study indicating potential adverse health effects for women. The proposed Restoring Safeguards for Dangerous Abortion Drugs Act would mandate the FDA to implement stricter safeguards on the drug, allow women to sue telehealth providers and pharmacies for damages, and ban foreign companies from importing mifepristone into the U.S. Hawley cited a study revealing that a significant percentage of women experience serious adverse events after using mifepristone, prompting his call for immediate action from the FDA.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has introduced the Restoring Safeguards for Dangerous Abortion Drugs Act, seeking to impose stricter regulations on the abortion drug mifepristone. The legislation follows a study that suggests 1 in 10 women experience adverse health effects after using the medication. The bill would direct the FDA to create safeguards on mifepristone, allow women to sue telehealth providers and pharmacies for damages, and prohibit foreign companies from mailing and importing the drug into the U.S. The introduction of the bill comes amid ongoing legal battles over access to mifepristone, with the Justice Department recently requesting the dismissal of a case that could restrict access to the pill.</p>

Key provisions include agreements on the services sector and procurement, enabling British firms to compete for more contracts in India. However, the agreement does not alter immigration policies and has faced criticism from opposition leaders regarding tax exemptions for certain workers.</p>
