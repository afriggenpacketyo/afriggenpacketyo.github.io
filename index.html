          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption occurred days after a major earthquake in the region and was accompanied by a 7.0-magnitude quake, briefly prompting a tsunami warning. Russian authorities confirmed it was the volcano's first historically documented eruption in centuries, though sources differ on the exact timeline of its last activity. Officials stated the ash plume spread eastward over the Pacific Ocean, posing no immediate threat to populated areas.</p>

Way rose to fame in 2007 with his hit song "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" and has since continued his music career while also gaining a following as an online streamer.

          <h2>China Approves 183 Brazilian Coffee Exporters Following New U.S. Tariffs</h2>

          <p>China has granted export permits to 183 new Brazilian coffee companies, a significant move that provides an alternative market for Brazil's top agricultural export. This development comes as Brazilian coffee producers face a new 50% tariff from the United States, historically a primary destination for their product. While China is Brazil's largest overall trading partner, its coffee imports have been a fraction of those to the U.S. This expansion of trade access to the Chinese market could help mitigate the economic impact of the steep American tariffs on the Brazilian coffee industry.

          <p>Inter Miami star Lionel Messi left Saturday's Leagues Cup match against Necaxa in the opening minutes with an apparent hamstring injury. The 38-year-old forward fell after a challenge and was seen walking off the field before being substituted in the 11th minute. Coach Javier Mascherano stated that Messi felt a pull and would undergo tests to determine the injury's severity. The incident raises concerns about Messi's availability for upcoming matches, as the team has been carefully managing his workload throughout a packed season that includes both league and international commitments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has dismissed star defensive end Micah Parsons' public trade request as "negotiation talk." The comments came after Parsons, who is seeking a contract extension that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in NFL history, posted his request on social media. Jones insisted the standoff is a normal part of the negotiation process and believes an agreement framework is already in place from earlier discussions. Despite the public friction, Jones expressed confidence that the situation will be resolved, as teammates and fans voiced their support for Parsons.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has provoked widespread anger by visiting and openly praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. This action violates a long-standing "status quo" agreement that permits non-Muslims to visit the holy site but not to pray there. Jordan, the site's custodian, called the visit an "unacceptable provocation," while Palestinian authorities described it as crossing "all red lines." The Israeli prime minister's office stated there has been no change in policy, but the incident has further inflamed tensions over one of the Middle East's most sensitive religious sites.</p>

          <p>Actor Sydney Sweeney is facing public scrutiny after it was revealed she registered as a Republican voter in Florida in June 2024. The information became public amid controversy over a new American Eagle ad campaign with the tagline "Sydney Sweeney has great genes," which some critics found tone-deaf and reminiscent of eugenicist rhetoric. Conservatives have defended Sweeney and the campaign against what they call "woke" criticism. This follows a previous incident where the actor was criticized for photos from a family party where guests wore hats resembling MAGA apparel.</p>

          <p>China's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult launch system. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV as part of a series celebrating the People's Liberation Army anniversary showed what looked like a successful take-off drill. This marks a significant milestone for the Fujian, China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, which allows for the deployment of heavier and more varied aircraft. The carrier is expected to officially enter service with the Chinese navy later this year.</p>

          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump, marked by rambling monologues and factual inaccuracies, have renewed questions about his mental acuity. Experts point to instances of confabulation, such as a false story about his uncle and the Unabomber, and frequent, incoherent digressions on topics like windmills and faucet water pressure. While the White House aggressively defends the president's sharpness, some mental health professionals and political opponents argue his behavior shows signs of cognitive decline. This scrutiny follows similar concerns raised about Joe Biden during the 2024 campaign.</p>
