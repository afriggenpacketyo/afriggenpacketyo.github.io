          <p>Chinese influencer Luo Yonghao and his co-host Xiao Mu utilized AI-generated avatars based on Baidu's generative AI model for a livestreaming session on Baidu's e-commerce platform, generating 55 million yuan ($7.65 million). The avatars, trained on five years of videos, mimicked their jokes and style, resulting in higher sales compared to Luo's previous livestream. Luo expressed amazement at the effectiveness of the digital human technology, noting its potential impact on the influencer market. This collaboration between Baidu and Luo Yonghao demonstrates the growing capabilities of AI in sales and marketing. Optimism is tempered by the potential job displacement in the influencer industry.</p>

          <p>Colorado congressional Republicans are urging Governor Jared Polis to halt the state's Medicaid program, Health First Colorado, from enrolling undocumented immigrants. They argue that such policies are expensive and detrimental to American citizens who need Medicaid. The Republicans cited similar reforms in California, Minnesota, and Illinois as examples of states reconsidering healthcare benefits for undocumented immigrants. A spokesperson for Polis' office countered that the proposed federal legislation would harm Coloradans by reducing Medicaid funding and increasing insurance costs. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between providing healthcare access and managing state budgets.</p>

          <p>Nearly 10 years ago, the United States and other world powers reached a landmark nuclear agreement with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which imposed restrictions on Iranâ€™s civilian nuclear enrichment program in exchange for sanctions relief. In 2018, President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal, arguing it was defective at its core and reimposed economic sanctions on Iran. Since then, Iran has reduced its breakout time for accumulating enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. Negotiations between Iran and the U.S. have stalled amid conflict between Israel and Iran, with Trump threatening potential military action.</p>

          <p>Carlos Gonzalo Coronel, a Los Angeles police sergeant, has been charged with DUI causing great bodily injury and hit-and-run causing death after allegedly fatally striking a 19-year-old pedestrian while driving drunk in Tustin.

Coronel, who had a prior DUI conviction in 2011, faces a maximum sentence of six years and eight months if convicted on all counts.
