        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican-led House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a single vote after Speaker Mike Johnson navigated internal GOP disagreements. The bill, crucial for advancing President Donald Trump's tax and immigration agenda, includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and border security spending. Johnson hailed the bill as a victory for Americans and a return to winning, though two Republicans opposed the measure, and one voted present. The bill now moves to the Senate, where revisions are expected, marking just the first hurdle in its legislative journey.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is seriously considering making Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public companies, which are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) critical to America's housing financial system. These entities buy mortgages from lenders and bundle them into mortgage-backed securities, selling them to investors, thus providing liquidity and stability to the market. Trump stated that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are performing well and generating significant cash, suggesting the timing is right for this transition.

          <p>House Republicans made several late revisions to their tax cut and immigration bill to secure support for its passage. These changes included removing sections authorizing the sale of public lands in Nevada and Utah, renaming "MAGA" accounts to "Trump" accounts, and accelerating the implementation of Medicaid work requirements. The revised bill also quadruples the cap on state and local tax deductions and deregulates gun silencers. These adjustments reflect efforts to balance the diverse interests within the Republican conference and address specific concerns from various factions.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports on a proposal where the Republican party is seeking to invest $1,000 for every American baby born over the next four years. The money would be deposited in a "Trump account" and invested on their behalf in financial markets. Once they had grown up, they could withdraw the proceeds to pay for certain expenses, including going to college or buying a house. People could only contribute post-tax income to the accounts, and gains in the accounts would also be taxed when money was withdrawn, making the ‚ÄúTrump account‚Äù function much like a typical investment account, rather than a tax-advantaged account like an individual retirement account or a health savings account.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics, driven by restrictions on visas and the ongoing effects of the pandemic. The decrease was primarily due to fewer people coming to work and study in the UK, coupled with a rise in those leaving after completing their studies. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper highlighted a 300,000 drop in net migration since the election and promised further reductions through new immigration measures. Conservative figures sought to claim credit for the decline, while Reform UK leader Nigel Farage criticized the figures as still disastrous.</p>

          <p>Experts caution that a Republican-backed tax bill threatens to eliminate clean energy incentives, potentially costing over 830,000 jobs, raising energy bills for US households, and increasing planet-heating pollution. The bill would eliminate tax credits for clean cars this year and phase out incentives for renewable energy projects by 2032. A former Department of Energy official noted that these changes would increase prices for everyone, with the average household seeing bills rise by more than $230 by 2035. This legislation will also cause the US to emit 260 million tonnes more pollution than it would‚Äôve otherwise in 2035.</p>

          <p>Kyodo News reports that Japan will pursue greater defense equipment cooperation with allies amid a severe security environment. The government is considering reusing soil from Fukushima cleanup efforts on the grounds of the Prime Minister's office to set a precedent for recycling outside the prefecture. Despite a GDP contraction, the government maintains a positive economic outlook, while the auto industry urges the removal of US tariffs.

Eric Garcia, author of "We're Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation," argues that RFK's perspective treats autism as a tragedy to be fixed, rather than recognizing autistic individuals as human beings deserving of services, support, and acceptance. This has exposed rifts within the autism community, particularly between those with high-support-needs children and self-advocates who can speak for themselves.</p>

          <p>The Republican Party is facing internal divisions over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction within President Donald Trump's major tax and spending bill. The SALT deduction, which allows Americans to deduct a portion of their state and local taxes from federal taxes, has caused a stir due to its disproportionate benefit to wealthy earners in high-tax states. House GOP lawmakers from blue states are pushing for changes to the SALT cap, creating a complex dynamic within the party as they navigate reelection pressures and narrow margins in the House.</p>

Factors such as weaker economic growth and potential increases in spending on winter fuel payments and defense are contributing to the pressure on government finances.</p>
