          <p>The UK government has strongly criticized the BBC for broadcasting a live performance by rap-punk duo Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury Festival. During their set, the artists led chants calling for "death to the IDF," prompting Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy to demand an explanation from the BBC's director general. The BBC described the comments as "deeply offensive" and has removed the performance from its on-demand iPlayer service. Police are now reviewing footage from the performance to determine if any criminal offenses were committed.</p>

          <p>The Senate has released its version of a major Republican legislative package, aiming for a vote before the July 4th holiday.

It also includes controversial provisions such as deep cuts to Medicaid, the elimination of the electric vehicle tax credit, and new work requirements for the program.

          <p>A significant mudslide, triggered by heavy rains, left thousands of motorists stranded overnight on the West Virginia Turnpike. The incident blocked northbound lanes for over eight hours, creating a 12-mile traffic backup with no detours provided. The West Virginia Parkways Authority has taken full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic and pledged to revise its emergency procedures.

Meteorologists and atmospheric scientists have expressed alarm, warning that the loss of this data will severely impede forecast accuracy for life-threatening cyclones.

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is employing a procedural maneuver to delay the Republican-led effort to pass President Trump's 940-page spending bill. Schumer will force Senate clerks to read the entire legislative text aloud on the floor, a process expected to take up to 15 hours. This tactic is intended to draw attention to the bill's contents and consume time before the formal debate and amendment process can begin. While it will not ultimately prevent a vote, the move highlights the deep partisan divisions surrounding the major legislative package.</p>

The lawsuit stems from statements Trump made during a 2024 presidential debate, where he allegedly and falsely claimed the men had killed someone and pled guilty.

A key theme was the expansion of presidential authority and reining in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural win for President Trump. These decisions reflect a states-rights approach to contentious social issues.</p>

          <p>New research on skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society where female lineage was paramount. A 12-year study of DNA from over 130 skeletons found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line, indicating men likely moved into their wives' homes after marriage. The findings also revealed preferential treatment for females in burials, with five times more grave goods offered to them than to males. This evidence challenges traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>

          <p>Two men involved in a human smuggling operation that resulted in the deaths of 53 migrants have been sentenced in a federal court. Felipe Orduna-Torres received a life sentence, while Armando Gonzales-Garcia was sentenced to 83 years for their roles in the 2022 tragedy. The migrants, including six children, died from heat and suffocation after being abandoned in a tractor-trailer with a broken air conditioner during the Texas summer. Prosecutors stated the men knew the cooling system was faulty, and their sentencing marks a step toward justice for the victims.</p>

          <p>A 59-year-old woman from Oroville, California, has died after a swim at Whittington Beach Park on Hawaii's Big Island turned deadly. Stacy Coon was swimming near the shore when she was pulled approximately 40 yards out into the ocean and began yelling for help. Bystanders were able to bring her back to the shoreline and administered CPR, but she remained unresponsive and was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. The park is known for its dangerous water conditions and has warning signs posted, though it lacks an on-duty lifeguard.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles due to a potential issue with the side curtain airbags. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly sealed seams may prevent the airbags from holding enough pressure during deployment in certain crashes. Dealers will inspect the airbags and replace them for free if necessary. Chrysler's parent company, Stellantis, stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect but is urging customers to comply with the recall.</p>
