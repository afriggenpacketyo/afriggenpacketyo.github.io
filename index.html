          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers and Los Angeles Dodgers completed a trade while simultaneously facing each other on the field, an unusual occurrence in professional sports. The Dodgers sent outfielder Steward Berroa to the Brewers in exchange for cash considerations, an announcement made during the Brewers' extra-innings victory that sealed a series sweep. Berroa, who recently made his major league debut, had been designated for assignment by the Dodgers and will now join the Brewers organization. The trade adds an interesting footnote to a competitive series between the two National League teams.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 20:09:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports is drawing scrutiny for its legal justification and political motivations. The administration is citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law already central to a court challenge against his previous tariffs. Critics argue Trump is abusing his emergency powers by explicitly linking the tariff to his opposition to the political trial of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. This move is seen by some lawmakers and legal experts as a significant overreach of executive authority, especially as the U.S. actually holds a trade surplus with Brazil. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top Trump administration official has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of mismanaging the central bank, specifically citing an "ostentatious" office renovation project. This criticism, detailed in a letter from the Office of Management and Budget, adds to President Trump's ongoing public pressure on Powell to lower interest rates. The letter questions whether the renovation's scope violates federal law, a claim Powell has previously refuted in congressional testimony as inaccurate. The conflict highlights the significant tension between the White House's economic demands and the Federal Reserve's traditional independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Shoshana Shendelman, a trustee at Columbia University, has publicly called for the university's leadership to fully comply with the Trump administration's demands regarding campus antisemitism and Title VI. In a formal letter, she argued that the university's failure to address the issue has damaged its reputation and created a hostile environment for Jewish students. The demand follows the release of text messages showing the acting president suggesting Shendelman's removal from the board. This internal conflict unfolds as Columbia faces potential loss of federal funding and accreditation over its handling of the issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated executive actions to increase timber harvesting on federal lands, framing it as a necessary measure to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. The plan is celebrated by logging communities in places like Oregon but has sparked alarm among environmental groups, who fear it will lead to deregulation and the destruction of old-growth forests. Stakeholders, including former U.S. Forest Service employees, express concern that federal agencies lack the staffing to implement such projects responsibly. The policy highlights the deep-seated conflict between economic interests, environmental protection, and forest management strategies.</p>

          <p>A 17-year veteran of the Justice Department, Patty Hartman, has issued a stark warning that the U.S. is "driving straight into an abyss" following her abrupt termination. Hartman is one of several officials fired in recent weeks who were connected to the prosecution of cases from the January 6th Capitol riot. She asserts that the traditional separation between the White House and the DOJ has been erased, with the administration now engaging in political retribution against career staff.

          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans by analyzing 20,000 global campaigns. He argues that eight specific words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together—serve as "emotional shortcuts" that resonate universally with voters. While not a guarantee of success, these words act as powerful building blocks for campaign messaging, as seen in past successful slogans. The article explores this concept, contrasting it with more bespoke slogans and noting the future impact of AI on political messaging.</p>

The piece notes that global temperatures have risen over 1.3°C, which disproportionately increases the intensity of heatwaves by 3-4°C in regions like the UK. While some compare it to the historic 1976 heatwave, data shows current events are hotter on average and more frequent.

The number of fertility procedures has risen nearly 50% in recent years, with experts attributing the trend to a generational shift where people desire more control over family planning. Many couples are delaying childbirth due to economic pressures, leading them to seek medical assistance like IVF later in life.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel and acknowledged an "operational failure" in its handling of security at a rally where an assassination attempt on Donald Trump occurred last year. A report released by the agency detailed the failings that allowed a gunman to fire at the then-candidate, killing a rally attendee. The agency has implemented reforms, including improved technology and clearer lines of accountability, to prevent future incidents. The disciplinary action and report come after a year of intense scrutiny and congressional criticism of the agency's security lapses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals an alarming trend: the length of heat waves is increasing at a rate that outpaces the overall rise in global temperatures. This means that even small increments of warming will have a disproportionately large impact, making the most extreme and lengthy heat waves more common and dangerous. The findings underscore the urgent need for adaptation strategies to protect public health, agriculture, and infrastructure from the effects of prolonged extreme heat. Researchers warn that this accelerated change will be most severe in tropical regions but will have significant global consequences.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a policy change that will exclude undocumented children from Head Start, the federal preschool program for low-income families. This move reverses decades of policy and is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for immigrants without legal status. The Department of Health and Human Services reclassified Head Start and other programs as "federal public benefits," thereby restricting access based on immigration status. Child advocacy groups warn this will create fear and confusion, denying vulnerable children access to crucial early education and nutrition services.</p>

The bonfire is built annually for Twelfth of July celebrations, but this year its proximity to an electricity substation and the presence of hazardous materials have caused alarm. Police have declined to assist in removing the structure, assessing that intervention carries a higher risk than letting it proceed with mitigation measures.

While the company's forecast accounts for some tariffs, executives acknowledge that the evolving trade landscape under President Trump creates uncertainty.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially announced plans for a significant workforce reduction, which will affect nearly 15% of its domestic staff through layoffs and voluntary departures. Senior officials state the restructuring aims to eliminate Cold War-era redundancies and align the department's mission with President Trump's "America First" foreign policy. The move, which follows a recent Supreme Court decision enabling mass government firings, will also merge or eliminate hundreds of bureaus. Critics worry the cuts will weaken American diplomacy and empower political appointees over career diplomats.</p>
