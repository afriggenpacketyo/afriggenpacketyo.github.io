            <p>Liontrust Asset Management PLC shareholders have experienced a substantial 74% decline in share price over the past three years, with a further 51% drop in the last year, causing considerable concern for investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) also decreased by 34% annually during this period, closely mirroring the share price decline. Despite some insider buying recently, earnings and revenue growth trends remain critical factors for consideration. Dividends have provided a slight boost to the total shareholder return, but overall performance has been disappointing (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times is undergoing a retrial following an appeals court decision that cited flaws in the initial trial. Palin alleges that a 2017 editorial falsely linked her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting, damaging her reputation and career. The Times acknowledges the inaccuracy but claims it was an honest mistake that was quickly corrected. The retrial occurs amid heightened scrutiny of media outlets and their treatment by public figures like former President Trump.</p>

            <p>A growing trend of "coolcations" is emerging as travelers, particularly baby boomers and first-time travelers, are shunning traditional summer hotspots in Southern Europe due to extreme heat, overcrowding, and cost concerns. Instead, destinations in Northern Europe, such as Scandinavia and the Baltic countries, are gaining popularity for their cooler climates. Travel companies are reporting increased bookings to these regions during the peak summer months, while bookings to Southern Europe are shifting to the shoulder seasons. This trend reflects a growing awareness of climate change and a desire to avoid its effects on travel experiences.</p>

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge of 12.4% in March, driven by businesses frontloading shipments to avoid anticipated U.S. tariffs. However, imports declined by 4.3% due to sluggish domestic demand, raising concerns about China's economic outlook. Analysts predict that exports may weaken in the coming months as U.S. tariffs increase, potentially leading to supply chain disruptions and inflation in the U.S. The Chinese government has reiterated its call for negotiations with Washington while implementing countermeasures against the U.S.</p>

Despite Peabody's reported investment of over Â£1m in improvements last year, tenants say repairs have been temporary and ineffective. They have enlisted lawyers and health workers from the charity Medact to advocate for proper solutions, citing high rates of health problems linked to the conditions in their homes. The government has announced stricter rules for social housing landlords to address damp and mould, set to take effect in October.</p>

            <p>Nesrine Malik explores the challenges of imagining a world where the United States is no longer the dominant global power, particularly in light of recent political shifts. The article discusses the technical and psychological difficulties of divesting from the US, including its role in the global financial order and its cultural influence. While acknowledging the potential for chaos in a world without a clear authority, the author argues that the US's breakdown could trigger the building of a new global order where all countries have a stake. The essay emphasizes that the world was always dangerously overexposed to whatever direction the US took.</p>

Known for his depictions of authoritarianism, violence, and machismo, Vargas Llosa was a key figure in the Latin American Boom literary movement. Initially drawn to left-wing ideas, he later became disillusioned and unsuccessfully ran for the Peruvian presidency with a centre-right party in 1990. His works, including "The Time of the Hero" and "The Green House," have been widely translated and celebrated for their rich language and imagery.</p>

            <p>China's exports rose by 12.4% in March, a surge attributed to businesses accelerating shipments before expected tariff increases from the United States. However, imports declined, indicating weak domestic demand. Analysts suggest this export surge may be a "final hurrah" before trade policies create more uncertainty. The article highlights concerns about the impact of Trump's potential tariffs on global trade and the challenges faced by Chinese businesses in navigating these changes.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense continues to struggle, contributing to a 4-2 defeat against the Chicago Cubs and marking their third consecutive series loss. Despite a talented roster, the team's hitting has been inconsistent, with several players in a slump.
