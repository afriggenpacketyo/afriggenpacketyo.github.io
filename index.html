          <p>President Trump unveiled his plan to construct a missile defense shield system named "Golden Dome," designed to protect the United States from threats originating from North Korea and other potential adversaries. This project is reminiscent of President Reagan's "Star Wars" program, and its projected costs range from tens of billions to hundreds of billions of dollars. General Michael Guetlein, the Pentagon's vice chief of space operations, will oversee the project, which aims to integrate with existing defense capabilities and become fully operational within three years. Critics question the necessity and potential financial strain on other vital programs, given the U.S.'s geographic buffer and existing defense systems.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the city of Chicago following comments made by Mayor Brandon Johnson regarding the hiring of Black officials in his administration. The probe was initiated after Johnson touted the diversity of his administration at a church, stating that 45% of the administration is Black, 25% Latino, 30% white, and 8% Asian. The DOJ's investigation is based on information suggesting that hiring decisions may have been made solely on the basis of race, potentially violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly committed to remaining in his leadership role at the electric vehicle company for at least the next five years. Musk stated that his desire to maintain control over Tesla is driven by a need to prevent activist investors from ousting him, rather than financial motivations. This announcement comes amidst investor concerns about Musk's dedication to Tesla, particularly given his advisory role in the Department of Government Efficiency. Despite a recent drop in Tesla's automotive revenue and net income, Musk plans to dedicate a day or two per week to government work, with the remainder focused on Tesla.</p>

          <p>A recent controversy surrounding Joe Biden's health, including his stage 4 prostate cancer diagnosis, has ignited debate over media skepticism and transparency. The publication of "Original Sin," detailing efforts to conceal Biden's declining health, has fueled this discussion. The article draws parallels to historical instances where presidents concealed their health issues, such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt's hidden disability and John F. Kennedy's secret Addison's disease. It suggests that the news media should exercise greater skepticism towards those in power, even when it is politically or ideologically undesirable, while acknowledging that partisanship can sometimes expose unpleasant truths.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has halted the Temecula school district's ban on critical race theory (CRT), stating the policy is unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the ban caused confusion and anxiety among teachers, leading to self-censorship and depriving students of a fully informed education. The court emphasized the resolution lacked clear definitions and enforcement guidelines, conflicting with state-mandated educational requirements. This decision reverses a previous ruling, with the appeals court arguing that the plaintiffs are likely to prevail against the school district. The court also addressed the board's policy on notifying parents about student gender identity, noting that state law prioritizes student privacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Navigating debt relief can be complex, but several surprising features can aid borrowers. Being behind on payments can actually help qualify for debt forgiveness, as it signals an inability to pay. Smaller debt amounts, as low as $5,000, may also qualify for assistance, particularly with credit card debt forgiveness. Furthermore, taking out another loan, such as a debt consolidation loan, can streamline debt payoff with lower interest rates. Understanding these nuances can help borrowers develop a personalized debt relief strategy and work towards financial independence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt forgiveness can provide a path to becoming debt-free, but it generally has a negative impact on your credit score. Settling a debt for less than the full amount owed is typically reported as "settled" rather than "paid in full," which can raise concerns for future lenders. Additionally, stopping payments while negotiating with creditors can lead to late payments and charge-offs on your credit report. While debt forgiveness stays on your credit report for seven years, its impact lessens over time as you rebuild your credit. Whether debt forgiveness is worthwhile depends on your financial situation and goals.</p>

          <p>The Senate has advanced the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating certain cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. The bill establishes rules for stablecoin issuers, mandating that firms hold a reserve of assets underlying the cryptocurrency to protect consumers. It also requires issuers to grant coin holders priority for repayment in the event of bankruptcy and abide by anti-money laundering rules. Supporters hail the bill as a means of protecting consumers and setting industry standards, while critics warn it fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns and risks endangering consumers with weak regulations.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced sharp criticism from Senate Democrats, particularly Sen. Chris Van Hollen, during a Senate Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. Van Hollen criticized Rubio's policy on deportations and the El Salvador detentions of migrants, comparing it to the "shameful era" of McCarthy-era witch hunts. Rubio defended his actions, asserting the administration's right to conduct foreign policy without judicial interference. The exchange became heated, with Van Hollen expressing regret for voting for Rubio as secretary of state, while Rubio defended his stance on deporting gang members.</p>

          <p>The FDA has announced new regulatory guidance for future COVID-19 vaccine boosters, setting stricter approval standards for healthy Americans. The agency wants to see new clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness before approving boosters for healthy adults and children. This represents a shift from previous approvals based on antibody responses, and means some people would receive the actual shot while others get an inactive substance like a saline shot, to compare results. The FDA will accept immunogenicity data for high-risk individuals but will require randomized, placebo-controlled trials for healthy individuals to show a vaccine is at least 30% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID.</p>

          <p>President Biden's announcement of an aggressive form of prostate cancer has sparked discussion among medical experts regarding his diagnosis, potential progression, and treatment options. Doctors emphasize that while the cancer is advanced, modern treatments can effectively manage it for years, often beyond the patient's life expectancy. The standard course of care for Biden will likely involve androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which aims to shut down testosterone production. Experts note that the diagnosis does not necessarily indicate negligence in his medical care, as aggressive forms of prostate cancer can develop rapidly.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump pressured House Republicans to support his tax bill, but its fate remains uncertain due to internal divisions over healthcare changes and tax deductions. Trump aimed to rally support for the "big, beautiful" bill, which includes $4.9 trillion in tax breaks, but faced resistance from both conservative hardliners and moderates. The main point of contention is changes to state and local tax deductions (SALT), with Republicans from high-tax states seeking a higher cap than the proposed $30,000. The measure still needs to pass a full House vote before heading to the Senate.</p>
