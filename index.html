          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's move to freeze $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling the action was unlawful. The judge's order concluded that the administration used antisemitism as a "smokescreen" for a politically motivated decision after the university rejected demands for policy changes. While siding with Harvard on the funding, the judge also wrote that the university should have done a better job of addressing antisemitism on its campus.</p>

          <p>Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo have announced plans to end all childhood vaccine mandates for school attendance, a first in the nation. The move, which would require legislative action for some vaccines, has drawn sharp criticism from pediatric and public health experts. They warn that eliminating requirements for vaccines against diseases like measles and polio could lead to outbreaks and endanger community health. The administration is also forming a state-level commission to promote "medical freedom."</p>

          <p>The Idaho Attorney General's office will not file criminal charges against four Pocatello police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Victor Perez, a 17-year-old with autism. Prosecutors determined they could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were unjustified, as they were responding to a report of a man with a knife and were unaware of Perez's age or disabilities. The teenager, who was nonverbal, was shot after he stood up and stepped toward them while holding a knife. The family's attorney stated they will proceed with a civil lawsuit.</p>

His comments come as a bipartisan effort in the House, led by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, gains momentum to force a vote on releasing all government files related to the deceased sex offender. A survivor of Epstein's abuse responded to Trump's remarks, stating it felt like "being gutted from the inside out" and that the trauma is not a hoax.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Premier League's Record £3 Billion Transfer Spending Raises Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The English Premier League's summer transfer spending reached a record £3 billion, widening the financial gap with other top European leagues and raising concerns about competitive balance. Financial regulations, known as Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), are reportedly creating a "glass ceiling" for ambitious clubs and perversely incentivizing the sale of homegrown academy players. This trend benefits the league's elite clubs, which can more easily absorb the costs, further polarizing the competition.</p>

This discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of these dinosaurs, suggesting their complex armor developed earlier than once believed and was likely used for both defense and display.</p>
