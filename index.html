          <p>President Trump withdrew Jared Isaacman's nomination for NASA due to his donations to Democrats, despite Isaacman disclosing these contributions beforehand, according to sources familiar with the situation. Isaacman, an ally of Elon Musk, had his nomination pulled after a review of his prior political associations. The president is expected to announce a new nominee who aligns with the 'America First' agenda in space exploration. The White House emphasized the importance of the next NASA leader fully supporting President Trump's vision, which includes planting the American flag on Mars.</p>

          <p>Joe Root's unbeaten 166 propelled England to a three-wicket victory over West Indies in Cardiff, securing the three-match series with one game to spare. Root surpassed Eoin Morgan to become England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, reaching his highest ODI score. Despite a shaky start at 93-4, Root's partnerships with Harry Brook and Will Jacks guided England to their target of 309. West Indies' innings was highlighted by Keacy Carty's century, but England's sloppy fielding and Rashid's bowling ultimately contributed to their downfall.</p>

Experts predict debate over the Medicaid provision and other potential alterations, even though the overall structure of the bill is not expected to drastically change.</p>

          <p>Advisers to President Trump are defending his tariff policies amid legal challenges, asserting that the tariffs will remain in place or the administration will find alternative methods to implement them. This stance comes after a federal court ruled that Trump exceeded his authority in imposing sweeping duties, leading to a temporary pause in the ruling granted by a federal appeals court. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that 'tariffs are not going away,' while National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would support Trump's tariffs. Trump has warned that an adverse court ruling would allow other countries to hold the U.S. hostage with anti-American tariffs.</p>

          <p>Senior officials at the US Department of Veterans Affairs have directed VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. The directive followed the publication of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine by two VA pulmonologists warning that staff reductions jeopardize veterans' health. Critics argue that this action fits a pattern of censorship by the Trump administration and represents an attack on freedom of speech, potentially harming veterans and research programs.</p>

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people and injuries to scores more, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses. The Israeli military denied involvement, stating that its forces did not fire at civilians near or within the site. Witnesses reported fire from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation dismissed reports of deaths and injuries around its sites. The incident occurred amidst faltering ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas.</p>
