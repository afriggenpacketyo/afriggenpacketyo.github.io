          <p>Russell Brand has formally pleaded not guilty to charges of sexual assault, indecent assault, and oral sexual assault at Southwark Crown Court in London. The charges relate to alleged incidents between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Brand, who appeared in court wearing a dark suit and unbuttoned shirt, confirmed his name and entered a "not guilty" plea for each count. He will remain on conditional bail until his trial, which is scheduled to begin on June 3, 2026, and he previously released a video asserting his innocence and expressing gratitude for the opportunity to defend himself in court. The case marks a significant moment in Brand's career, which has spanned stand-up comedy, television hosting, and Hollywood acting.</p>

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that IOMed will promote amicable resolution of international disputes and foster harmonious international relations. The move also seeks to solidify Hong Kong's position as an international legal and dispute resolution hub in Asia amidst the US's diminishing presence in global affairs, and China's increasing involvement in international organizations.</p>

A federal appeals court in Manhattan is scheduled to hear oral arguments on June 11, with Trump's lawyers arguing that the case belongs in federal court due to its relation to his official acts as president. Trump was sentenced to an unconditional discharge in January, but he maintains his innocence, claiming the prosecution was politically motivated. The Department of Justice has also filed an amicus brief supporting the move to federal court based on presidential immunity arguments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece explores the increasing trend of millennials and Gen Z choosing to be childless, attributing it to a redefined understanding of harm, abuse, neglect, and trauma. This generation faces immense pressure to meet impossible parenting standards, including ensuring their children's mental health and career success. The cultural shift has led to adult children cutting off contact with parents, citing emotional or relational struggles, contributing to a new perspective on the responsibilities and potential pitfalls of parenthood. This perspective may be influencing decisions to forgo having children.</p>

          <p>Valerie, a mini dachshund, has been reunited with her owners after surviving 529 days alone in the Australian bush. She went missing during a camping trip to Kangaroo Island in November 2023, and despite initial search efforts, the couple had to return home without her. After more than a year, a farmer spotted a dog matching Valerie's description, leading to a rescue effort by Kangala Wildlife Rescue. Valerie was captured after nearly two months of attempts and has since settled back into her life with her owners, inspiring hope for others with missing pets.</p>

          <p>Concerns are growing that the dismantling of the federal government by the Trump administration, particularly within the USDA and APHIS, is leaving American agriculture vulnerable. The exodus of thousands of experienced employees has raised fears about the ability to respond to crises, maintain competitiveness, and prevent the spread of pests and diseases. Despite assurances from the USDA that critical work will not be compromised, there are concerns that some programs and services will be scaled back. The situation has prompted questions about the understanding of APHIS's role among the new political leadership.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is leaving his role as the guiding force behind the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), facing legal setbacks and clashes with Cabinet members. Musk's departure is framed as the end of his "scheduled time" as a special government employee, though it is unlikely to significantly alter DOGE's work. Despite touting significant savings, NPR's reporting has found DOGE's claims to be overstated and inaccurate, and some of its signature efforts have been reversed or held up by the courts. Musk will return to his companies, including Tesla, at a time when his business empire has seen financial setbacks.</p>

Google argues these remedies are too severe and would hurt consumers and innovation, suggesting lighter alternatives such as ending exclusive agreements with device makers.
