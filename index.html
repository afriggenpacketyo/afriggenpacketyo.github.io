          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack during a pro-Israel demonstration, faces federal hate crime and state charges, including attempted first-degree murder. According to court documents, Soliman admitted to researching Molotov cocktails on YouTube and purchasing the ingredients. He allegedly stated he wanted to kill all Zionist people and expressed regret for not being able to purchase a gun due to his citizenship status. The attack resulted in injuries to 12 people, and Soliman is being held on a $10 million bond. Optimism around this event is low given the nature of the crime.</p>

          <p>A judge in California blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. The ruling applies to migrants in custody in the Central District of California and stems from a case involving a Venezuelan man who applied for asylum but was detained due to his tattoos. While the judge questioned the government's notice procedures, he did not rule on the legality of invoking the Alien Enemies Act.

          <p>The State Department has instructed U.S. embassies and consulates to increase vetting for all visa applicants seeking to attend Harvard University, including students, faculty, and visitors. Consular officers are directed to conduct a thorough screening of applicants' online presence and consider the absence of or limited visibility on social media as potentially indicative of evasiveness. This measure serves as a pilot for expanded screening of visa applicants generally, prompted by concerns over antisemitism on campus. The Trump administration has accused Harvard of failing to address antisemitic activity and has taken steps to restrict the university's ability to enroll foreign students.

President Trump has been advocating for the project as a national priority, urging Japan and South Korea to invest. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes that securing commercial offtakers for the gas will facilitate financing, while analysts express skepticism about the project's commercial viability. The project is planned to be built in stages, initially serving domestic demand in Alaska, with potential support from the Department of Defense. The stability of this project is still uncertain.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called Mexico’s judicial election “extraordinary” despite a turnout of less than 13%. The president could not conceal a harsh reality: Only about 13% of 100 million eligible voters cast ballots in a vote that the president had labeled a key component of the ruling party’s ongoing “transformation” of Mexican society. The lack of participation, experts said, can be attributed to many factors: it was an off-year election; the balloting process was new and extremely convoluted; the vast majority of more than 7,000 contenders for 881 federal judge positions — and for another 1,800 state jurist posts — were unknown. Final results won’t be known for a week or two.</p>
