          <p>Urawa Reds, representing Japan at the Club World Cup due to their Asian Champions League win, were defeated 3-1 by Argentina's River Plate. Despite strong support in Seattle, Urawa conceded all goals through headers, with River Plate taking an early lead. Urawa briefly rallied, with captain Marius Hoibraten scoring a disallowed goal due to offside, and Yusuke Matsuo converting a penalty. However, defensive lapses cost them as River Plate secured the victory, leaving Urawa facing a tough road ahead with Inter Milan next on the schedule. The match was decided by small details, but Urawa showed promise in dominating parts of the game.</p>

          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) leaders launched an action plan to mitigate risks in critical mineral supply chains, largely stemming from over-reliance on China. The strategy aims to bolster economic security by enhancing cooperation among G7 nations and like-minded countries, countering nonmarket practices. Areas of cooperation include monitoring mineral shortages, responding to market disruptions, and diversifying mining and recycling efforts. The G7 will also develop a roadmap for standards-based critical mineral markets and increase investments in responsible mining projects, though emphasizing the importance of stable relations with China while urging them to avoid market distortions.

          <p>Japan's exports fell 1.7% year-over-year in May, the largest drop since September 2024, driven by a significant decrease in shipments to the U.S. and China. Automobile exports to the U.S. saw a notable decline of 24.7%, contributing to the overall decrease in trade. The Bank of Japan acknowledged that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade uncertainties, while analysts warn that tariffs pose a major threat to Japan's economic outlook. Falling exports have already impacted Japan's GDP, with the economy contracting in the first quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge argued that transgender and nonbinary individuals would face psychological distress, harassment, and discrimination if forced to travel with passports that conflict with their gender identity.

          <p>UCLA's baseball team lost to Arkansas 7-3, ending their College World Series run in Omaha. After a 12-year wait to return to the series, the Bruins struggled to mount a comeback after falling behind early. UCLA's offense was unable to capitalize on opportunities, and Arkansas' pitching proved too difficult to overcome. Coach John Savage expressed pride in his team's accomplishments but acknowledged the need for improved starting pitching in the future.</p>

Despite ongoing negotiations, hurdles remain, and Japan aims to protect its national interests. Ishiba also highlighted the need to monitor crude oil and gasoline prices due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. officials indicated that the next 24 to 48 hours are critical in determining whether a diplomatic solution with Iran is possible or if President Trump will resort to military action. Trump ramped up his rhetoric against the Iranian regime, but U.S. negotiators believe Iran is in a weak position and could be forced to negotiate. The U.S. military is sending assets to the region, including additional aircraft and a second aircraft carrier, but officials say the moves are defensive. A major question is whether the U.S. will deploy its B-2 stealth bombers, capable of carrying bunker-buster bombs to destroy Iran's nuclear facility.</p>
