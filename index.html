        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission plans to propose a rule change that would allow public companies to report earnings on a semiannual basis instead of quarterly. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins confirmed the move, which follows a call from President Donald Trump to encourage long-term corporate focus over short-term results. If approved, the change would be optional, letting companies decide their reporting frequency, similar to the standard for foreign private issuers. Proponents argue it would save money and promote long-term strategy, while opponents raise concerns about reduced transparency for investors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has urgently appealed to the Supreme Court to block a lower court's order and enforce its policy requiring passports to reflect an individual's "biological sex at birth." This policy, a reversal of the Biden-era rule, eliminates the nonbinary "X" gender marker and prevents applicants from self-selecting a designation that aligns with their gender identity. A federal judge had previously halted the policy, ruling it was likely motivated by animus toward transgender people and violated their equal protection rights. The administration argues the policy is lawful and necessary for foreign policy and to reflect "scientific reality."</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a "courageous American patriot" following his recent killing, revealing a split among Democrats. While House Democratic leadership supported the measure to condemn political violence, 58 party members voted against it and 38 voted "present," citing Kirk's history of controversial and divisive rhetoric.

          <p>President Trump announced that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made progress on a deal concerning the ownership of TikTok during a productive phone call. Following the discussion, Trump stated he plans to visit China early next year and will meet with Xi at the upcoming APEC Summit in South Korea. The call was intended to finalize a framework agreement that would resolve U.S. national security concerns over the popular app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. While Trump expressed appreciation for the approval, a statement from China's Foreign Ministry indicated that a final deal is still subject to further consultation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and publisher Penguin Random House, labeling the complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible." U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday struck down the suit, which alleged a series of articles and a book constituted libel aimed at damaging Trump's reputation and electoral prospects. The judge criticized the lawsuit's language, comparing it to a political rally oration rather than a legal document. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to refile a revised complaint that adheres to proper legal standards.</p>

          <p>A potential deal between the U.S. and China to resolve TikTok's ownership dispute could involve a licensing agreement for the app's highly valuable algorithm. This technology, which powers TikTok's content recommendation engine, has been a major point of contention due to Chinese laws restricting its export. A licensing arrangement would allow a new U.S.-based entity to use the algorithm's technology, potentially satisfying both commercial interests and U.S. national security concerns. However, experts caution that such a deal must ensure that American user data is fully firewalled from China-based engineers to truly address the security risks that prompted the divestment law.</p>

The move has generated backlash from some Jewish organizations and has coincided with internal conflict within Israel's film community.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran expressed his view that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to have a significant inflationary impact on the U.S. economy. Acknowledging he is in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee with this stance, Miran argued that while tariffs cause relative price changes, they do not create the kind of macroeconomic inflation that requires a monetary policy response. This perspective informed his recent dissenting vote, where he advocated for a larger half-point interest rate cut instead of the quarter-point reduction approved by the committee, citing a lack of evidence that tariffs have materially driven up inflation.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. Currently, the estimated monthly payment on a $50,000 HELOC with a 10-year term at an average rate of 8.05% is approximately $608, down from about $640 last September when rates were higher. Since HELOCs have variable rates, they adjust with changes in the Fed's policy, allowing borrowers to benefit from rate cuts without refinancing. This article contrasts these costs with fixed-rate home equity loans, which offer more predictability but are slightly more expensive. (not investment advice)</p>

A decline to 5.75% on a $500,000 loan could save a borrower nearly $120 per month.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified Boeing as his "new favorite stock," advising investors to consider buying shares aggressively during its recent pullback. Despite a challenging month for the aerospace company's stock, Cramer expressed strong confidence in its potential. He also cautioned investors to monitor the 10-year Treasury yield, warning that a continued rise could negatively impact the broader stock market, similar to headwinds experienced in the past. The discussion also touched on Nvidia's recent collaboration with Intel, which Cramer views as a strategic win for the AI chipmaker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article critiques Silicon Valley's push for AI companions, such as the new wearable device named "Friend," as a flawed solution to the growing loneliness epidemic. It argues that such technologies exacerbate the very problem they purport to solve by replacing genuine human interaction with poor digital substitutes, a trend already established by social media and other isolating apps. The author contends that instead of fostering real connection, AI friends deepen social alienation by accommodating people to their isolation. The piece calls for the tech industry to acknowledge its role in creating this social issue rather than profiting from its symptoms.</p>

          <p>Mark A. Welsh III has resigned as president of Texas A&M University's main campus amidst controversy stemming from a student's complaint about "gender ideology" in a children's literature course. The complaint, which went viral after being shared by a state Republican lawmaker, led to the dismissal of the instructor and other academic staff. This incident follows previous political pressure on the university regarding diversity initiatives. Chancellor Glenn Hegar stated that while he was grateful for Welsh's service, it was the right moment for a change in leadership to position the university for the future.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have released new details suggesting a political motive in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, based on text messages from the suspect, Tyler Robinson. In messages to his roommate, Robinson allegedly wrote, "I had enough of his hatred," and stated he was going to "take out" Kirk. The suspect's mother told police that Robinson had become more left-wing and pro-trans rights over the past year. Investigators also found shell casings at the scene with engraved messages referencing internet memes and anti-fascist themes, though their exact meaning remains unclear amidst layers of online irony.</p>

          <p>A group calling itself the "Kingdom of Kubala" has been served a second eviction notice after relocating their camp in the Scottish Borders. The group, led by individuals who identify as a king and queen from Ghana and Zimbabwe, was first evicted from private land near Jedburgh but then moved to an adjacent site. After discovering the new camp was on council-owned land, the Scottish Borders Council initiated legal action. The group, which claims ancestral rights to the land, has been given until Monday to vacate the new location, but has stated on social media that their "kingdom can never be destroyed."</p>

          <p>The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show by ABC has prompted responses from fellow hosts Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Jimmy Fallon, who used a mix of satire and criticism to address the issue. Colbert condemned the decision as "blatant censorship," while Stewart satirically rebranded his show as "government-approved." Fallon expressed personal support for Kimmel and used comedic voice-overs to mock the idea of enforced praise for President Trump. The suspension came after Kimmel highlighted Trump's response to questions about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, sparking a debate over free speech and media suppression.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is implementing new strategies to win back liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade that was lost during recent years of severe drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers next year and are developing an "Interoceanic Energy Corridor," a 76-kilometer pipeline to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus. This pipeline would free up canal transit slots for other vessels, including LNG tankers. The initiatives are designed to offer more flexibility and reliability to energy shippers who had diverted to longer routes, such as around Africa's Cape of Good Hope.</p>

Norris described the incident as "costly" as it prevented him from completing important high-fuel race simulation runs. Despite the crash, Leclerc noted that McLaren's pace appeared formidable, suggesting they could be strong contenders in qualifying. Hamilton expressed satisfaction with improvements made to his car's braking system, boosting his confidence for the race weekend.</p>

The men, described as experienced outdoorsmen, were on an elk hunting trip and were last heard from on September 11. A massive search effort involving air support, ground crews, and volunteers was launched after they failed to check in with family. Their bodies were recovered on September 18 near the Rio de Los Pinos Trailhead. The tragic outcome has left their families heartbroken, with Porter's fiancée having posted hopeful messages just hours before the discovery.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is reportedly pausing new requests from European allies for certain military systems, including the highly sought-after Patriot air-defense system, due to concerns about dwindling U.S. stockpiles. This shift in policy, reflecting the Trump administration's "America First" priorities, appears to prioritize replenishing domestic inventories over arming allies, even as the threat from Russia remains high. The move has reportedly created confusion and risks creating rifts with European partners who have depleted their own weapon supplies to aid Ukraine. Critics warn this could undermine European security and push allies to seek alternative suppliers.</p>
