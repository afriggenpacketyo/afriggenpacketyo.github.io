          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a new record high, extending its gains for the tenth consecutive session, after the Finance Minister announced the government would abandon its previous plan to raise taxes on stock investments. This positive market movement occurred amidst mixed trading in other Asia-Pacific markets, as investors monitored U.S.-China talks in Spain and assessed a slate of economic data from Beijing, which indicated a slowdown. The decision to scrap the tax hike is seen as a significant boost to investor confidence and a key factor in the Kospi's robust performance, despite broader regional uncertainties.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party has formally demanded answers from Sir Keir Starmer regarding the extent of Downing Street's knowledge of Lord Mandelson's connections to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. This action follows BBC reports that Starmer explicitly questioned Mandelson about these links before his ambassadorial appointment, which was subsequently revoked after a cache of emails showing supportive messages to Epstein emerged. The Tories are seeking the release of all relevant government correspondence and for Starmer and his chief of staff to provide evidence to Parliament. This scandal, coming after another high-profile resignation, has intensified criticism of the Prime Minister's judgment and leadership.</p>

          <p>China's economic slowdown intensified in August, with key indicators like retail sales and industrial output falling below analysts' expectations, reflecting persistent weak domestic demand and a campaign against industrial overcapacity. Fixed-asset investment also saw a significant slowdown, and the contraction in real estate investment worsened to 12.9% in the first eight months. The urban unemployment rate slightly increased, attributed to the graduation season. This article highlights growing concerns about unstable external factors and multiple risks challenging China's economic development, prompting calls for comprehensive macro policies to stabilize employment, businesses, and market expectations.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that glaciers in High Mountain Asia, often called the "Third Pole," are melting at an accelerated rate, threatening the water supply for over 1.4 billion people in South and Central Asia. Shifting monsoon rainfall patterns, in addition to rising global temperatures, are significantly contributing to this rapid ice loss, particularly in the Himalayas. This phenomenon, where more water runs off instead of being stored as ice, increases risks of droughts, floods, and dangerous glacial lake outbursts. Scientists are actively researching mitigation strategies and promoting community resilience, underscoring the critical need for climate action to protect these vital "frozen reservoirs."</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 627, the "No Secret Police Act," which prohibits most local and federal law enforcement, including immigration agents, from wearing face coverings during operations. The bill aims to enhance transparency, build public trust, and prevent the impersonation of officers, though it includes limited exemptions for SWAT teams, undercover assignments, and medical masks. Supporters argue it counters "secret police" tactics and "rising fascism," while opponents, like the Department of Homeland Security, contend it compromises officer safety and ignores operational realities.

          <p>A significant number of drivers are finding themselves "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their car's worth, which complicates new vehicle purchases. Edmunds reports that 26.6% of trade-ins had negative equity in Q2 2025, the highest in four years, with an average negative balance of $6,754. This situation often arises from long loan terms or small down payments, forcing drivers to either pay the balance or roll it into a new loan. Experts advise keeping current vehicles if possible and researching credit scores and pre-approvals for better financing, also recommending gap insurance for protection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American farmers are facing significant economic pressure due to escalating trade tensions with China and President Trump's tariffs, leading to a sharp decline in crop orders and a five-year high in small business bankruptcies. Despite these severe financial hardships, many rural Americans, a key Trump voting bloc, maintain their deep loyalty, believing the tariffs will ultimately benefit them in the long run. This article explores the paradox of continued support amidst economic pain, attributing it to a long-standing "rural identity" and a willingness to attribute blame selectively.

Despite Jarmond's successes in other sports, the article emphasizes that football is the primary revenue driver and national reputation builder for a Power Five school.

Despite his popularity, he surprised many by declining a third term and later distanced himself from the Republican Party's shift to the right, even supporting Kamala Harris.

Murphy highlights instances where key players, like Bruno Fernandes, are deployed in deeper midfield roles that do not suit their natural instincts, leading to defensive vulnerabilities.

For middle powers grappling with military development and seeking to avoid Cold War entanglements, the parade signals that alignment with Beijing offers pathways outside Western terms of engagement, showcasing an "axis of the excluded" that rejects Western influence and promotes a multipolar world order.</p>
