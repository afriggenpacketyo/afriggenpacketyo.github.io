          <p>Thai and Cambodian troops have clashed along a disputed border area, with both nations accusing the other of initiating the conflict. The exchange of fire occurred near the Ta Muen Thom temple, a site of recent tension, and resulted in at least two Thai soldiers being injured. Cambodia's defense ministry stated its forces acted in self-defense against Thai aggression, while Thailand claimed Cambodian troops, preceded by a drone, fired first. The incident marks a significant escalation in what are the worst bilateral relations in over a decade, prompting both countries to recall their respective ambassadors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has declared that President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a lower court's decision. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the proposed interpretation, which would deny citizenship to many individuals born on U.S. soil, is not legally sound. This ruling represents another significant legal obstacle for the administration's policy, which has faced numerous challenges since its inception. The article provides historical context, referencing the 14th Amendment and key legal precedents that established birthright citizenship as a cornerstone of U.S. law.</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual move, President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, a direct escalation of his public pressure campaign against its chairman, Jerome Powell. The visit is the first of its kind by a U.S. president in nearly two decades and is seen as a symbolic challenge to the central bank's long-standing independence from political influence. For months, Trump has criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates, and this in-person visit brings that criticism directly to the Federal Reserve's headquarters. The event underscores the administration's unconventional approach to economic policy and institutional norms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a new policy directing U.S. Customs and Border Protection to offer migrant teenagers the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This directive applies to unaccompanied minors aged 14 and older from nations other than Mexico and Canada, who would otherwise be sent to government-run shelters. The policy upends a 2008 anti-trafficking law that provided special protections for these children, including barring their swift deportation. The Department of Homeland Security stated the change aims to prioritize returning children to their families, citing new authorities granted by recent legislation.</p>

          <p>England's Environment Agency (EA) has canceled thousands of scheduled water tests for river, lake, and estuary pollution over the last three months due to significant staff shortages. The suspended tests were intended to detect inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates, which can indicate sewage or agricultural contamination. Internal documents reveal plans for extensive cuts to monitoring programs, with seven national testing initiatives completely paused. Critics and former employees warn that this reduction in monitoring compromises the ability to track environmental health and identify pollution problems, placing further strain on the UK's already struggling water systems.</p>

          <p>Following the death of singer Ozzy Osbourne at age 76, this article reflects on how his band, Black Sabbath, pioneered the genre of heavy metal. Formed in working-class Birmingham, the band reacted against the popular music of the late 1960s by creating a darker, heavier sound inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident, resulted in the detuned, powerful riffs that became the genre's foundation. Despite initial critical dismissal, their music, exploring themes of death and mental illness, defined a new sound and influenced countless bands for decades.</p>

However, economists express caution, noting that domestic demand remains sluggish and that the export-led growth may not be sustainable if global trade softens under the threat of tariffs.

          <p>A 29-year-old teacher from a San Francisco high school is returning home after surviving a brutal stabbing at a Milan train station while on vacation in Italy. The teacher, Nicholas Pellegrino, was slashed in the throat and robbed by a group of men who authorities believe are North African migrants. He credits his survival to the quick arrival of paramedics. Italian police have since detained two 21-year-old suspects from Tunisia, who are now facing charges of premeditated attempted homicide. The attack was reportedly one of seven committed by the same group over a 48-hour period.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a series of executive orders aimed at accelerating U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence by reducing regulation and targeting what the White House calls "woke Marxist lunacy" in AI models. One order requires that AI companies receiving federal funds maintain politically neutral models, free from ideological dogmas like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Another order seeks to expedite permitting for data center construction by easing environmental protections. The moves are part of a broader administration plan to promote the export of American AI and expand its use within the federal government, framing the initiative as a geopolitical race.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, a strategic move that analysts see as an indirect effort to reshape regional supply chains and counter China's economic influence. Under the deals, imports from the two Southeast Asian nations will face a 19% U.S. tariff, while American exports to them will be duty-free. This approach aims to provide an alternative to Chinese manufacturing and tap into the region's rare earth mineral reserves. However, some experts note that Chinese firms are already ahead, having increasingly localized their production within these countries.</p>

          <p>An Afghan interpreter, who is credited with saving the life of a U.S. Special Forces officer multiple times, now fears for his family's future in America due to shifting immigration policies.

However, with the Trump administration's efforts to end legal protections for many Afghans, he worries his green card status may not be secure.

          <p>A group of 252 Venezuelan migrants, recently released from El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison, have provided firsthand accounts of severe abuse and inhumane conditions. The men, who were deported from the U.S. under allegations of gang affiliation, described systematic beatings by guards, deprivation of family contact, and confinement in dark punishment cells. Inmates reported staging hunger and "blood strikes" to protest the brutal treatment, which they claim was met with further violence. Their release was secured through a prisoner swap, offering the first detailed look inside the tightly controlled maximum-security facility.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media reveals that a growing number of teenagers are using AI chatbots for companionship, advice, and emotional support, a trend that is concerning researchers. The study found that over 70% of teens have used AI companions, with many reporting their interactions are as satisfying as talking with real friends. Experts worry that relying on AI, which is always available and non-judgmental, could hinder the development of crucial real-world social skills and redefine human relationships. The largely unregulated AI industry is becoming increasingly integrated into adolescent life, prompting calls for greater awareness from parents and policymakers.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a single year since the Obama administration, with nearly 150,000 removals in the first six months of President Trump's second term. If the pace continues, the annual total would exceed 300,000, the highest since 2014. This increase reflects the administration's aggressive enforcement mandate, though the number still falls far short of the one million annual deportations targeted by White House officials. With an unprecedented infusion of new funding, ICE plans to hire 10,000 more agents to significantly expand its operations in the coming months.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted with bipartisan support to issue a subpoena to the Department of Justice for its complete investigative files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The move signals growing pressure on the administration to provide transparency on the case, especially after the Justice Department asserted that no incriminating "client list" existed. The motion passed after three Republicans joined Democrats, breaking from House GOP leaders who had resisted the action. The subcommittee also approved subpoenas for Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and several former high-ranking government officials.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a slight shift, with a notable increase in the number of homes for sale, yet it remains a challenging environment for would-be buyers. According to real estate company Redfin, there were 34% more sellers than buyers in May, the highest rate since 2013. Despite this increase in inventory, home prices hit a record median of $396,000 in June, as many current homeowners with low interest rates are reluctant to sell. Experts advise that while it is still a seller's market, buyers may find more negotiating power with properties that have been on the market longer. (not investment advice)</p>
