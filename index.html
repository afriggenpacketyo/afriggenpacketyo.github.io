          <p>House Republicans are struggling to resolve disputes that threaten President Trump's domestic policy bill, with conservative members pushing for deeper spending cuts and blue-state Republicans demanding a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. The bill, which aims to extend tax cuts and increase spending on military and border security, faces opposition in the House Budget Committee. Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to negotiate a compromise, but faces the challenge of limited defections allowed for the bill to pass. The outcome of these negotiations will determine the fate of key Republican priorities. Optimism score is set at 50.</p>

Comey's post, featuring "8647" written in seashells, sparked controversy due to the slang meaning of "86" and Trump's position as the 47th president. While Comey claims the message was political and not intended to incite violence, Trump alleges Comey knew exactly what the post implied.
