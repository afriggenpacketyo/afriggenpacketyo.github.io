          <p>A public inquiry has begun into the July 2024 knife attack in Southport that killed three young girls and injured several others. The inquiry's chairman, Sir Adrian Fulford, described the event as "one of the most egregious crimes in our country's history." The investigation will scrutinize how public agencies handled the perpetrator's troubling behavior prior to the attack, which included previous violence and online research into extremism. It will also explore broader issues of youth violence and the balance between civil liberties and public protection.</p>

          <p>This article examines the Trump administration's apprehension towards the expanding BRICS bloc and its efforts to reduce global reliance on the U.S. dollar. It details how member nations like Russia and China are increasingly settling trade in local currencies, partly in response to Western sanctions. While the bloc has grown to represent nearly half the world's population, internal divisions, particularly between India and China, have stalled more ambitious plans like a common currency. The analysis suggests that despite its expansion, BRICS faces significant hurdles in challenging the dollar's dominance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three men have been found guilty of carrying out an arson attack on a London warehouse on behalf of the Russian Wagner Group. The targeted warehouse was used to send humanitarian aid and satellite internet equipment to Ukraine, and the attack caused approximately £1 million in damages. The plot was orchestrated by two other men who had already pleaded guilty, one of whom is the first person convicted under the UK's 2023 National Security Act. Prosecutors stated the case is a clear example of a Russian-linked organization using British 'proxies' for criminal activity.</p>

          <p>Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, are experiencing a significant increase in volunteer applications, with a rise of about 20% this year. This trend, which began in 2024, is partly attributed to the ongoing war in Ukraine, which has motivated many young Germans to serve. To meet ambitious recruitment goals of adding 60,000 soldiers, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is making military service more attractive with better pay and has introduced a mandatory questionnaire for all 18-year-old men. The military's improved equipment and a more positive public image are also cited as contributing factors.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision upholding a Texas law that requires age verification for adult websites marks a significant shift away from the historically light regulation of the internet. In Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the Court ruled that the goal of protecting children from explicit content justified the burden on adult access. This analysis suggests the ruling effectively ends the internet's laissez-faire era, providing a legal framework for more aggressive child-safety regulations that could soon be applied to social media and AI platforms across the country.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has advised air travelers to assume the 100ml liquid limit for hand luggage remains in effect, despite some airports updating their policies. Edinburgh and Birmingham airports have installed new CT scanners that allow passengers to carry liquids up to two liters, but the rollout across other UK airports is inconsistent. The installation of the heavy and costly technology has been slow and varied, creating a patchwork of rules. Officials urge passengers to check the specific security requirements for every airport on their itinerary, including return locations.</p>

          <p>England's children's commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, has warned that some children are living in "Dickensian" conditions of poverty. A new government-commissioned report details children's experiences with rat-infested homes, lack of food, and poor sanitation. The commissioner, along with her counterparts across the UK, is urging the government to take immediate action by scrapping the two-child benefit cap. This policy prevents families from claiming benefits for a third or subsequent child and is seen as a root cause of the escalating crisis.</p>

Unlike in many other countries, some studies show that Chinese youth from more affluent and educated families are at a higher risk, often due to extreme parental expectations for success. While issues like poverty and loneliness also affect children in rural areas, the intense focus on academic achievement creates a distinct and tragic source of pressure for many young people across the country.</p>

          <p>Government data for May showed the first decline in personal income since 2021, but the drop was a statistical anomaly rather than a sign of a weakening economy. The decrease was caused by the timing of payments related to the Social Security Fairness Act, which provided a one-time retroactive benefit boost to millions of former public-sector workers in April. With these increased benefits now being distributed monthly, income data is expected to normalize for the remainder of the year, clarifying that Americans' regular pay has not actually decreased.</p>

          <p>A serious crash during the third stage of the 2025 Tour de France, which forced top sprinter Jasper Philipsen to abandon the race with a broken collarbone, serves as a stark reminder of the sport's risks. The first week of the Tour is notoriously dangerous as riders are fresh and competition is fierce, leading to a high willingness to take risks. To mitigate danger, cycling's governing body has introduced new measures like yellow cards for unsafe riding and extending the safe zone before the finish line in flat stages to protect riders from losing time in crashes.</p>

          <p>A recent tax package does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients, contrary to some claims. The legislation introduces a new $6,000 deduction for seniors, which reduces taxable income but does not directly remove the tax on benefits. This deduction primarily benefits middle-income seniors and may indirectly lower their overall tax liability, but it will not affect those with incomes too low to be taxed or too high to qualify. Experts note the change will also reduce tax revenue for the Social Security program. (not investment advice)</p>

By targeting major trading partners of China like Japan, South Korea, and several Southeast Asian countries, the U.S. may be aiming to disrupt regional supply chains and curb the trans-shipping of Chinese goods. The U.S. recently struck a deal with Vietnam that specifically includes provisions against this practice.
