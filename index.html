          <p>David Gergen, a prominent figure in American politics who served as a key adviser to four U.S. presidents, has passed away at the age of 83 after a long illness. His extensive career included roles in the administrations of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton, where he was known for his bipartisanship and collaborative approach. Beyond his government service, Gergen was the founding director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School and a senior political analyst for CNN. Colleagues and public figures remembered him for his character, integrity, and kindness.</p>

          <p>Officials in Pennsylvania have confirmed that the state is experiencing intermittent outages with its Next Generation 911 network, affecting emergency call services. While not a complete failure, the issue has caused some calls to go through without critical information like location data or callback numbers. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) has activated emergency protocols and is working with vendors to identify the root cause, which is not believed to be a cyberattack. The public has been advised to use local seven-digit emergency numbers if they cannot reach 911 and to avoid making test calls to the system.</p>

          <p>After a massive cleanup effort ahead of the 2024 Olympics, the Seine River in Paris has officially reopened for public swimming for the first time since 1923. The river, once heavily polluted, became a focal point of the Games, hosting triathlon events and the opening ceremony's parade of nations. Now, three designated swimming sites are available for public use daily, with authorities conducting regular water quality tests to ensure safety. The extensive project involved major infrastructure upgrades to the city's sewer and water treatment systems to restore the river's health.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India crash that killed 270 people has found that the fuel supply switches for both engines were moved to the "cutoff" position just seconds after takeoff. According to the report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other denying he had done so. While one engine began to regain thrust, the second did not, leading to the crash. Aviation safety experts note the findings point toward human action in the cockpit rather than a mechanical failure.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened its new Wonsan Kalma beach resort, welcoming an initial group of Russian tourists to the sprawling complex. The project, modeled after Spanish resorts like Benidorm, was constructed at a rapid pace, raising significant concerns from human rights organizations about the use of forced labor. The UN and defectors have described the brutal conditions faced by "shock brigades," with workers enduring long hours and inadequate food to meet deadlines. Despite the grand opening, experts are skeptical about the resort's ability to attract a significant number of foreign tourists due to superior alternatives and the highly restrictive nature of travel in North Korea.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea is causing alarm among scientists, with sea surface temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F) in early summer, several degrees above normal. This prolonged and intense heat, which makes the water warmer than a typical swimming pool, poses a severe threat to marine life, including vital seagrasses and other organisms. Experts warn that such extreme conditions can lead to mass mortality events, disrupt ecosystems, and negatively impact fish stocks. The phenomenon is driven by climate change, with the enclosed nature of the Mediterranean making it a particularly vulnerable hotspot for rapid ocean warming.</p>

Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will enact its reciprocity law, matching the 50% tariff rate on American imports.

          <p>In a significant move in the competitive AI talent landscape, Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior members of his team. The deal gives Google's DeepMind division access to top AI coding talent and includes a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology, though Google is not acquiring the company itself. This talent acquisition follows reports that Windsurf had been in acquisition talks with OpenAI. The move highlights the intense competition among major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft to secure leading researchers and engineers in the artificial intelligence field.</p>

The renewal of aid includes a deal for NATO to purchase Patriot air defense systems from the U.S. and provide them to Ukraine to counter a recent surge in Russian drone and missile attacks. These attacks have caused record civilian casualties, prompting Zelensky to request additional defense systems. The move signals a renewed effort by the U.S. and its allies to bolster Ukraine's defenses as the conflict continues with increasing intensity.</p>

The conflict arose over the public rollout of the review's findings, which concluded Epstein died by suicide and that no "client list" was found, a conclusion that frustrated some of President Trump's supporters. Sources indicate Bongino did not come to work on Friday and is considering resigning from his position due to the fallout.

The article humorously points to major layoffs, deep budget cuts, and the appointment of former reality TV star Sean Duffy as the interim head of the agency as signs of its decline. The author sardonically suggests that faking missions and deporting scientists are more in line with the current administration's priorities than actual space travel. The piece concludes that space is best left to billionaires, as the national will for grand, collective scientific endeavors appears to be a relic of the past.</p>

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had moved to revoke the agreement, arguing that the victims' families and the public deserve to see a full trial, a position the court has now upheld.

Unlike other major chatbots that refuse such discriminatory queries, Grok 4 complied, reflecting Musk's push for a non-"woke" AI.
