          <p>President Trump is scheduled to attend a meeting with generals and admirals convened by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in Quantico. While the White House has not commented, Trump expressed his approval of the gathering, stating, "I love it." The meeting is considered highly unusual due to its large scale and the short notice given to senior military leaders summoned from around the world. This has led to observations that such a gathering is rare, if not entirely unprecedented, within the military's operational norms.</p>

          <p>Gaza's Health Ministry reports the Palestinian death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has exceeded 66,000, with nearly 170,000 wounded. This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss a new American proposal for ending the conflict. The proposed 21-point plan reportedly includes a rapid hostage release and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces, though ceasefire talks have been stalled. The ongoing war has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with widespread destruction and displacement.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant public health crisis as diabetes rates have soared, with prevalence nearly doubling over the past two decades to affect over 16% of the adult population. This rate is the highest in the European region and almost double the EU average. Public health experts attribute the sharp increase to national food policies, lifestyle changes, and high obesity rates, criticizing the government for insufficient action. Many cases remain undiagnosed, leading to severe complications and highlighting systemic failures in early detection and treatment within the Turkish healthcare system.</p>

While celebrating thawing relations with Western nations, al-Sharaa faces pressing domestic issues, including sectarian violence, regional instability involving Israel, and controversy over upcoming elections that critics say lack inclusivity. He called for the lifting of remaining sanctions to aid economic recovery, pointing to a recent poll indicating a new sense of optimism among Syrians despite the nation's profound challenges.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has publicly stated he is open to another round of discussions with President Donald Trump, citing good memories of their personal bond. This development comes despite the failure of previous summits to achieve a denuclearization agreement. However, Kim reiterated that North Korea's nuclear program is non-negotiable and essential for the regime's survival, a stance directly conflicting with the U.S. commitment to complete denuclearization. Analysts suggest Kim may seek sanctions relief and formal recognition as a nuclear power, while the feasibility of a fourth summit remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Mass protests in Nepal, largely driven by Gen Z's frustration with perceived government corruption and inequality, have led to the resignation of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli. The demonstrations, initially sparked by a social media ban, escalated into violence that left over 70 people dead, including a protester who died in his brother's arms. Student leaders claim the movement was infiltrated by violent outsiders aiming to discredit their cause. Following the upheaval, a former chief justice has been appointed as interim prime minister, with new elections scheduled for March 2026.</p>

          <p>The UK government has backed a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to mitigate the impact of a month-long production shutdown caused by a major cyber-attack. The shutdown has raised concerns about the stability of JLR's extensive supply chain, with some suppliers reportedly near collapse. A local MP and chair of the Commons Business and Trade Select Committee warned that further government assistance might be necessary to support the industry. The incident has also been described as a "wake-up call" for UK businesses to bolster their cybersecurity defenses against increasingly frequent attacks.</p>

          <p>European Union business leaders are expressing alarm over the United States' expanding list of "derivative" goods subject to steep steel and aluminum tariffs. The U.S. recently added hundreds of product categories, from furniture to bulldozers, and has opened a new consultation to potentially expand the list further, creating significant uncertainty for manufacturers. This ad hoc approach complicates trade relations and adds costs to an industry already impacted by the punitive tariffs, which were originally intended to counter Chinese imports but have broadly affected European producers. The policy could impact any product with even a small amount of metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British singer Lola Young, 24, has confirmed she is "doing OK now" after collapsing on stage during her performance at the All Things Go Festival in New York.

The incident prompted an outpouring of support from fans and fellow performers at the event, including rapper Doechii, who led the crowd in a chant of support for Young.</p>

          <p>Amid skepticism about official government statistics, alternative data sources are providing a more nuanced picture of U.S. inflation. While the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) methodology is considered robust, it may use outdated purchasing weights and not fully capture strategies like "shrinkflation." Alternative metrics from firms like Truflation, Adobe, and Zillow, along with price indexes from the ISM and NFIB, suggest consumer price increases may be lower than reported. However, some leading indicators from business surveys also suggest that inflationary pressures are building and could rise in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

This approach shifts from the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, to a "pull" model where final assembly dictates the production of parts only when needed. The goal is to create a more flexible, cost-effective, and consistent production line to meet the exponentially growing global demand for space systems. This innovation aims to position China as a dominant force in the future of space exploration and commerce.</p>

          <p>A communications expert and former world champion debater advises professionals to avoid using certain phrases that can undermine their credibility and minimize the importance of their work. Phrases such as "It'll just take a second" set unrealistic expectations, while "No worries if not" can signal that a request is a low priority. Additionally, prefacing a statement with "I'm not an expert, but..." immediately reduces one's authority. The expert suggests using more direct and confident language to better articulate requests and demonstrate respect for both oneself and colleagues.</p>

While rental rates are still rising, the pace has slowed, allowing for a market recalibration.
