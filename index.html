          <p>The Ukrainian Air Force reported ballistic missile strikes on Kyiv, with air defenses activated in the capital. Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko stated that three people were injured in the overnight attacks, urging residents to seek shelter. Metro tracks between two stations in Kyiv were damaged, but there were no casualties. The Ukrainian Air Force also reported cruise missiles heading towards Lutsk, Chernihiv, Lviv, and the Rivne regions. The escalation of attacks follows failed U.S.-brokered peace talks and evidence of Russia preparing to retaliate against Ukraine for drone strikes. Optimism regarding the situation remains low amidst ongoing conflict.</p>

Exposure to wildfire smoke can cause respiratory issues, highlighting the need for people to stay informed and protect their health as these events become more common. The situation is a repeat of 2023, and experts believe this will be a recurring issue.</p>

          <p>Operation Guardian Angel, launched by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, seeks to force sanctuary cities to comply with federal immigration laws. The program targets illegal aliens with prior deportations by obtaining federal criminal warrants for felony re-entry. This allows ICE to take custody of these individuals despite sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with federal authorities. The operation has already resulted in arrests, and it is expected to continue removing criminal illegal aliens. The strategy aims to restore enforcement power wrongfully taken by sanctuary states.</p>

          <p>The architects of Pride celebrations across the United States met six-figure challenges this year, owing to a corporate exodus in the spring that diminished their sponsorship funds, which they said would jeopardize future programming. Organizers are contending with serious budget shortfalls as Pride Month begins, and several reported 20% to 30% less corporate support than in past years. The show will go on this summer, they said, but what happens next is less certain. Several brands that stepped back from Pride partnerships in San Francisco have done the same in other cities.</p>

          <p>Pride celebrations are proceeding despite a significant decrease in corporate sponsorships, leading to budget shortfalls for organizers. Many corporations have withdrawn or reduced their support, citing financial strain or fear of retaliation. This decline is attributed to the Trump administration's anti-DEI policies and attacks on transgender Americans. Organizers are seeking increased donations and reviewing budgets to ensure Pride events can continue, though year-round programming and grant programs may be affected.</p>

SpaceX is crucial to the U.S. space program and national security, making it difficult to cancel contracts. Tesla, a major electric vehicle company, has also benefited from federal support, which could change under Trump's policies. Experts believe that ending federal programs would not severely damage Tesla but could affect Musk's wealth. Despite the feud, some analysts believe Musk will continue to thrive.</p>

          <p>People across Europe say their countries are in decline and society is broken, according to a new Ipsos poll shared with CNBC. Negative sentiment has grown in the past four years across Europe's major economies – with citizens in Great Britain, Germany, France and Italy all increasingly sharing the belief that society is "broken" over the past four years. Economic concerns appear to be adding to populist sentiment across the continent. Brits were the most likely to support turning to a "strong leader who breaks the rules" as the solution to the problems they see in their economy.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that many Europeans believe their societies are broken and in decline, with negative sentiment increasing in major economies. Economic concerns, including the belief that economies are rigged to favor the wealthy, contribute to this sentiment. In Great Britain, over half of respondents support a strong leader who breaks the rules to address these issues. Right-wing populist parties are adjusting their messaging to appeal to voters who feel mainstream parties have failed them. The U.K.'s Labour Party faces pressure from the right-wing Reform UK party.</p>

          <p>Two unassuming Cessna-208 Caravan aircraft flew in formation, separated by hundreds of metres in altitude. One emitted radar signals ; the other, flying lower, remained utterly silent, passively gathering echoes. On May 12, China’s prestigious Journal of Radars unveiled a landmark study led by award-winning radar scientist Li Zhongyu with the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in Chengdu, Sichuan province. Their innovation – a “ space -time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method” – enabled the silent Cessna to detect all three moving vehicles with crystal clarity.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that enables aircraft to detect moving targets without emitting radar signals. The innovation, called “space-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method,” allows a silent aircraft to passively gather echoes. This technology overcomes the challenge of detecting moving targets amidst clutter from land, sea, or buildings. The new system promises crystal clear detection of moving vehicles in complex environments, potentially enhancing surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.</p>

          <p>Builders will be required to fit solar panels to the "vast majority" of new build homes in England under changes to be published this year, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said. The regulations will require developers to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade. Speaking to the BBC, Miliband said the move was "just common sense" adding that solar panels would save the typical household £500 a year on their energy bills. The rules will be included in the Future Homes Standard, which will detail a wider plan for improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>Russian strikes across Ukraine resulted in at least three deaths and numerous injuries, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The aerial raids targeted Kyiv, Lutsk, and the Ternopil region, using over 400 drones and 40 missiles. The attacks followed warnings from Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to Ukraine's strikes on Russian airbases. Air raid alerts were in place in multiple cities, and Kyiv's train system was disrupted. The Russian defense ministry claimed to have shot down 174 Ukrainian drones overnight.</p>

          <p>India's central bank delivered a 50-point cut to its benchmark policy rate, bringing it to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and lower-than-expected growth amidst global uncertainty as reasons for the move. The decision followed better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. The central bank revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year. The RBI will shift its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative."</p>

Environment Secretary Steve Reed stated that the public is furious over bonuses for water firm bosses despite sewage spills and rising bills. The ban is part of new measures in the Water Act.</p>
