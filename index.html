          <p>A Michigan church experienced a horrific act of targeted violence during Sunday morning services, resulting in at least four fatalities and eight injuries. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his vehicle through the front doors, opened fire on hundreds of congregants, and deliberately set the building ablaze before being fatally engaged by law enforcement. This devastating incident, now under FBI investigation as an act of targeted violence, has prompted widespread shock and sorrow, with community leaders and officials expressing profound grief for the victims and their families. The tragedy has also led to calls for heightened security at religious institutions nationwide, underscoring the profound impact on the Grand Blanc community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the president's plan to deploy 200 National Guard troops to Portland. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield announced the suit, arguing that President Trump lacks the constitutional authority to federalize the National Guard without a legitimate threat of insurrection or widespread lawlessness. Governor Tina Kotek emphasized that Portland's communities are stable and local officials are capable of maintaining public safety, dismissing the federal intervention as politically motivated and potentially destabilizing. The lawsuit seeks to block the deployment, asserting that it undermines Oregon's self-governance and misrepresents the city's current conditions, which are far from the "war-ravaged" description used by the administration.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the mayoral reelection race, citing constant media speculation about his future and a Campaign Finance Board decision to withhold funds. His departure sets up a three-way contest between Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa, with Adams having faced a tumultuous year marked by a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his ties to the Trump administration. Mamdani and Cuomo have both reacted to the news, with Mamdani linking Trump's influence to Adams' actions, while Cuomo praised Adams' dedication to the city. Despite his exit, Adams' name will remain on the ballot.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally traded higher on Monday, as investors appeared to largely look past recent tariff developments, indicating a degree of resilience. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose, with the Reserve Bank of Australia expected to hold its cash rate steady despite "material upside risks to Q3 inflation" and signs of softer employment. South Korea's Kospi also added significant gains, recovering from a steep fall, while Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight decline after hitting a record high. The overall market sentiment reflects cautious optimism, with investors weighing economic data and global trade dynamics, suggesting a belief in underlying stability in the region's financial outlook.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto rapidly intensified over the weekend, reaching Category 5 strength before fluctuating back to a powerful Category 4, prompting a Tropical Storm Watch for Bermuda. The National Hurricane Center predicts Humberto will remain a dangerous major hurricane for several days, generating life-threatening surf and rip currents across Bermuda and portions of the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Concurrently, Tropical Storm Imelda formed, expected to bring significant rainfall and potential flooding to Cuba, the Bahamas, and coastal areas from Florida to the Carolinas. These two active systems in the Atlantic necessitate vigilant monitoring due to their potential for widespread impact and hazardous conditions.</p>

          <p>Deliveries of China’s C919 narrowbody passenger jet to the country's top three domestic airlines appear to be falling behind schedule, according to recent company financial reports. Both Air China and China Eastern Airlines have received only one C919 aircraft each, despite aiming for ten apiece in 2025, while China Southern Airlines reported "financially leasing" just three, without mention of ownership. Independent aviation analyst Li Hanming suggests that the Shanghai-based manufacturer, Comac, may be encountering difficulties in securing engines for the model. These potential supply chain disruptions could impede China's efforts to establish a strong foothold in the global aviation market, which is currently dominated by Western manufacturers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides practical strategies for identifying and managing "energy vampire" friendships, which involve individuals who consistently deplete one's emotional and mental reserves. Experts like psychologist Suzy Reading and journalist Radhika Sanghani explain that common indicators include excessive complaining, self-centered conversations, and a noticeable lack of reciprocal interest. A crucial tell-tale sign is the feeling of being utterly drained after spending time with such a friend. To navigate these challenging dynamics, the article suggests engaging in honest conversations to express feelings of not being heard, establishing firm boundaries regarding interaction frequency or topics, and even altering the nature of shared activities to reduce emotional intensity. These methods aim to protect personal well-being while potentially sustaining valuable connections.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are anticipated to formally resign on Tuesday, representing the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, as a direct result of the Trump administration's program to implement sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. Employees describe months of "fear and intimidation" as the primary reason for their departure, feeling they have no viable alternative. Concurrently, with Congress facing a critical funding deadline that could trigger a government shutdown, the White House has directed federal agencies to draft plans for extensive layoffs. This situation underscores significant anxieties among federal employees regarding job security, work-life balance, and the perceived erosion of their agency's core mission, reflecting a period of considerable instability for the public sector.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations to become a leading hub for green marine fuels are heavily reliant on establishing a robust methanol supply chain, as highlighted by Wang Yongxin, president of CM Energy. While the city has successfully implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations, the adoption of green methanol necessitates a comprehensive system for tax-free import, storage, and sale of mainland-produced fuel. This strategic focus is becoming increasingly critical due to Europe's impending carbon emissions-based import tariff regime, which is compelling companies like CM Energy to significantly increase their use of green methanol from 2027. Despite green methanol costing about four times more than traditional fuel, this transition underscores a global commitment to environmental sustainability and regulatory compliance in the maritime sector.</p>

Two federal courts have already blocked the order, but the administration is pushing for a definitive judgment.

          <p>A stowaway was tragically discovered deceased Sunday morning within the landing gear of an American Airlines flight that had arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, from Europe. Crews performing maintenance on the aircraft made the grim discovery, and airport division officers pronounced the individual dead at the scene. Aviation analyst John Nance underscored the extreme dangers inherent in stowing away on a commercial plane, explaining that survival is highly improbable due to the exposure to temperatures as low as minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit and the severe lack of oxygen at altitudes exceeding 35,000 feet. This article serves as a stark reminder of the perilous conditions and the almost universally fatal outcome of such desperate attempts, with risks extending to passengers and crew.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy strongly condemned the "unacceptable" fan abuse experienced during the Ryder Cup, revealing that his wife, Erica, was struck by a thrown beer. Despite Europe's triumphant 15-13 victory, McIlroy expressed deep disappointment with the crowd's behavior, asserting that golf should be held to a higher standard of etiquette and respect. He implored American fans to focus on supporting their own team rather than directing "vicious" abuse at opponents and their families. Shane Lowry, a close friend, corroborated the extensive abuse Erica McIlroy received.
