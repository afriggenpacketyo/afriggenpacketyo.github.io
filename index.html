            <p>Malaysian durian growers are witnessing a significant increase in sales to China, driven by Chinese consumers' growing preference for fresh, naturally ripened durian fruit. Improved logistics and a steady supply have contributed to this surge, with Malaysian suppliers expecting a 30% increase in exports this year. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen naturally on the tree before being harvested, a factor appealing to affluent Chinese consumers. The demand creates substantial opportunities for Malaysian growers in the Chinese market.</p>

            <p>Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of an "Easter truce" in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russian attacks were ongoing in some areas. Putin ordered his forces to halt military activity until the end of Sunday, but Zelensky accused Moscow of attempting to create a false impression of a ceasefire. Zelensky said Kyiv would adhere to the truce if Russia genuinely engaged in a full and unconditional cessation of hostilities and proposed extending the truce beyond April 20. The UK Foreign Office urged Putin to demonstrate his seriousness about peace by ending the invasion and committing to a full ceasefire.</p>

            <p>LogProstyle Inc., a Tokyo-based real estate company operating traditional Japanese-style inns, is aiming to expand its operations to the United States after listing on the NYSE American stock exchange. The company, which primarily targets foreign tourists, is considering locations in Los Angeles and Seattle for its inns. CEO Yasuyuki Nozawa stated that the U.S. listing was chosen to boost the company's name recognition in the United States, capitalizing on the growing popularity of Japanese-style inns among tourists and the recent depreciation of the yen.

            <p>Eddy Massaad, CEO of Swiss Butter, credits the brand's growth to its secret steak sauce and the resilience instilled by his Lebanese background. Despite the destruction of the original Beirut restaurant in 2020, it reopened within 30 days, demonstrating the company's ability to overcome challenges. Swiss Butter began its expansion in late 2021, opening 10 restaurants within a year, including its first London location. Massaad aims for 100 locations within five years, driven by the comfort food trend and the premium execution of its steak frites dining experience, especially its "secret" sauce with 33 ingredients created by his chef brother.</p>

            <p>The Indiana legislature has passed a bill to establish a commission to explore adjusting the state's border with Illinois, signaling a first step in a long-shot effort. This comes as some Illinois counties seek to separate from the Chicago area due to political divisions, with the heavily Democratic Chicago area controlling the state government. While Indiana's government supports the idea, Illinois' top officials do not, and any boundary change would require approval from both state governments and the U.S. Congress. Similar efforts are underway in eastern Oregon, where some counties want to join Idaho.</p>

Miliband warned that abandoning the net-zero agenda would not only risk climate breakdown but also jeopardize future clean energy jobs.

            <p>An Oregon detective's offer of a cigarette to a suspect led to a confession and the discovery of a body in a missing persons case that quickly turned into a homicide investigation. When Aaron Friar and his daughter Ellie vanished, detectives found a bloody crime scene. Detective Bill Ford interviewed Russell Jones, who initially wanted a cigarette before talking. Ford took Jones outside, and during their conversation, Jones confessed to helping load the body and directed Ford to the location where Aaron Friar's remains were dumped.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully detonated a non-nuclear hydrogen-based explosive device in a controlled field test, triggering chemical chain reactions without using nuclear materials. The 2kg device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation's 705 Research Institute, generated a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds. The device utilizes a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride, which releases hydrogen gas upon activation by conventional explosives. The researchers claim the hydrogen gas ignites with minimal energy, creating a broad explosion range and rapidly spreading flames.</p>
