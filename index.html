          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation replaced its federal lawyers in a lawsuit regarding New York City's congestion pricing program after accusing them of undermining the department's efforts to end the toll. The move followed the accidental filing of a confidential memo questioning the department's legal strategy, with transportation officials suggesting the disclosure might have been sabotage. The lawyers had warned that the transportation secretary's rationale for ending the toll was weak and likely to fail, leading to the transfer of the case to the Justice Department's civil division.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, asserting that Congress and the states hold the power to regulate elections. Judge Kollar-Kotelly stated that Trump's executive order was an attempt to bypass Congress's deliberative process and exceeded his authority. While the judge allowed the enforcement of sections related to existing laws, such as accessing voting databases to identify non-citizens and taking action against states not adopting Trump's mail-in ballot requirements, the core changes were blocked due to separation of powers concerns.</p>

This behavior helps females gain social rank and better access to food and mates for their sons, highlighting a rare instance of female-dominated societies in mammals.</p>

          <h2>The Debate Over Mental Health Days for Kids</h2>

          <p>As chronic absenteeism remains a problem around the country, some school officials are worried that giving kids mental health days could encourage an attitude that school attendance is optional. Mental health days can help destigmatize mental illness, and encourage young people to be open about any struggles they’re going through, rather than hiding them, kids and experts say. Taking a day off shouldn’t be a way for kids to avoid something they’re anxious about, like a class, a difficult friendship, or school in general, experts say.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, recently shed light on the cost of adding an extra “Please!” or “Thank you!” to chatbot prompts. While every single ask of a chatbot costs money and energy, and every additional word as part of that ask increases the cost for a server, Altman says it's worth the price. He said that tens of millions of dollars have been well spent on the electricity costs from people saying “please” and “thank you” to their models.</p>
