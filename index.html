          <p>Hong Kong is positioned to play a crucial role in enhancing climate resilience within the Greater Bay Area, an economically dynamic region with 86 million people and a US$2 trillion GDP. This effort is presented not merely as an environmental necessity but as an economic strategy to protect trade, attract investment, and ensure sustained growth against increasing climate volatility. Establishing a cross-border early warning system and common infrastructure standards are highlighted as key starting points for a coordinated adaptation framework, potentially setting a global benchmark.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. government is acquiring a 10% stake in Intel, making it one of the company's largest shareholders. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the deal, stating it aims to strengthen U.S. leadership in semiconductors, boost the economy, and secure America's technological edge. This move, which reportedly involved converting government grants pledged under the previous administration, blurs traditional public-private sector lines and follows Trump's efforts to increase domestic chip production. The struggling chipmaker, which lost nearly $19 billion last year, did not immediately comment on the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis star Emma Raducanu has urged other Grand Slam tournaments, including Wimbledon, to adopt a revamped mixed doubles format similar to the US Open's new competition. Raducanu, who partnered with Carlos Alcaraz in the event, described it as a "huge success" that generated significant fan engagement and attention for the sport. The new format, featuring a $1 million prize fund and a shorter "fast four" style, was moved to the qualifying week and prioritized singles players. She also expressed feeling much better about returning to the US Open, having struggled with pressure in previous years.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted in connection with Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, stated in a federal prison interview that she does not believe Epstein died by suicide. She attributed his death, ruled a suicide in 2019, to potential internal prison issues, citing mismanagement within the Bureau of Prisons and the low cost of arranging a "hit" among inmates. Maxwell, however, dismissed the idea of an external plot to silence Epstein, arguing that such an opportunity would have existed before his incarceration. This article is from Fox News.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that his administration will impose tariffs on imported furniture within the next 50 days, following an investigation into the industry. The move, intended to revitalize the furniture business in U.S. states like North Carolina and Michigan, caused shares of major furniture retailers like Wayfair and RH to tumble, while La-Z-Boy, with its domestic manufacturing, saw a rise. These new tariffs come at a challenging time for the U.S. furniture industry, which is already facing reduced demand due to a slower housing market and persistent inflation affecting consumer discretionary spending.

While the company stated its core values remain unchanged, conservative commentators and marketing experts criticized the redesign, with some labeling it "woke" and a "fiasco" for potentially alienating long-time customers.

          <p>Millions of American retirees rely on Social Security, but several factors can unexpectedly reduce monthly benefits. Working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an earnings test, leading to temporary deductions.

Furthermore, Social Security benefits can be subject to federal income tax if combined income exceeds certain thresholds, surprising many retirees.

          <h2>Famine Declared in Northern Gaza Amid Widespread Starvation</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A United Nations-backed panel, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), has officially declared that famine is underway in northern Gaza, with over half a million people on the brink of starvation. The declaration signifies documented widespread starvation, illness, and mortality, and warns that famine could spread to central and southern Gaza by late September. This dire situation arises nearly two years into the conflict with Israel, with Israeli restrictions limiting aid flow. The IPC system requires specific criteria—20% households facing catastrophe, 30% child malnutrition, and high daily death rates—before a famine is declared.</p>

          <p>San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies have arrested Jake and Rebecca Haro, parents of 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro, on suspicion of murder, after the baby was reported kidnapped last week. Rebecca Haro initially claimed she was assaulted and the baby taken from a store parking lot, but investigators found "inconsistencies" in her story. The search for Emmanuel continues, with the case reclassified from kidnapping to a critical missing child investigation. Jake Haro has a prior conviction for willful child cruelty, and another child was removed from their home during the investigation.</p>

          <p>Netflix's hit animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" is making a significant theatrical splash with weekend sing-along screenings, attracting large audiences and selling out over a thousand shows. Despite its strong performance, Netflix is adhering to its policy of not releasing box office figures, frustrating industry professionals. Estimates suggest the film could earn $16 million to $22 million, potentially topping the domestic box office. This unusual high-profile theatrical release highlights the evolving and often contentious relationship between streamers and cinema owners, as Netflix primarily views such events as marketing for its subscriber base.</p>

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov countered, stating Putin is ready to meet when the agenda is prepared, blaming Zelensky for rejecting proposals. Following a week of intensive diplomacy, Trump described the conflict as the most difficult he's tried to stop, while Zelensky seeks robust security guarantees from Western allies, reflecting NATO's Article 5, to deter future Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to be armed, intensifying the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses an earlier Pentagon stance that troops would not carry weapons, despite their current role being limited to patrolling landmarks rather than direct law enforcement. President Trump, who took control of the city's police force and declared D.C. "safe," is considering declaring a national emergency to extend the deployment beyond its 30-day deadline. The mission remains deeply unpopular with many city residents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion and delinquencies rise, many Americans seek relief through options like credit card forbearance. Forbearance is a temporary arrangement from issuers allowing borrowers to pause or reduce payments, often with fee waivers or interest relief, for a limited period. Qualification typically requires proof of genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or unexpected expenses, and a history of on-time payments. It's a short-term solution, as interest may still accrue, and alternative debt relief strategies like consolidation loans or balance transfers may be necessary for those who don't qualify.
