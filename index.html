Authorities believe finding the main rotor is crucial to determining the cause of the crash.

The detective re-interviews witnesses and sends evidence for DNA testing, eventually leading to the indictment of Selonia's husband, Reginald Reed, and his friend, Jimmy Ray Barnes.

This decision follows concerns from US tech companies that tariffs could significantly increase the cost of these goods. The exemptions, backdated to April 5th, also include semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. The White House stated the exemptions are intended to provide companies more time to shift manufacturing to the United States. However, these items are still subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl production. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronics from tariffs imposed on imports, a move welcomed by tech investors. This decision comes after warnings that tariffs would increase consumer prices. The US military is also increasing its presence on the Mexico border. This follows concerns that the flow of illegal immigrants is increasing exponentially, especially in light of the recent news about the man erroneously deported to El Salvador.</p>

            <p>Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is becoming a major health concern in India, with the country having the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults globally. A Lancet study predicts this number could rise to 450 million by 2050. The accumulation of fat around the belly is linked to chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Studies have shown that South Asians, including Indians, tend to have more body fat at the same Body Mass Index, with fat often collecting around the trunk, increasing the risk of metabolic disorders.</p>

The former Plough Inn, now renamed The Wigtown Ploughman, had been in continuous use since 1795 but closed after the Covid pandemic. The community raised £330,000 to purchase the building and reopened it with the help of volunteers. The pub aims to revitalize the town and attract visitors to Wigtown, Scotland's national book town.</p>

            <p>Sky has announced plans for a UK spin-off of the US TV institution Saturday Night Live, which has entertained viewers for 50 years. The show will feature British comedic talent and be overseen by the original show's creator, Lorne Michaels. While the move is considered courageous, there are challenges in translating the US comedy culture to the UK, including different comedic traditions and budget constraints. However, the sketch format lends itself well to the social media age, and the show could provide an opportunity to develop new talent.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration informed a federal judge that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the man wrongfully deported to El Salvador, is alive and detained in the country's Terrorism Confinement Center. This update comes after a Supreme Court order that the administration facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. The administration's legal team argues that because Abrego Garcia is no longer in U.S. custody, the courts cannot order him to be returned. The case has sparked controversy and raised concerns about immigration enforcement practices.</p>
