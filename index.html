          <p>Hundreds, including former President Joe Biden and Governor Tim Walz, attended the funeral for Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed in their home. Eulogies remembered Melissa Hortman as a consequential and compassionate leader dedicated to public service, and her husband Mark for sharing her passion for helping others. The service, held at Minneapolis' Basilica of St. Mary, honored their lives and legacy of community engagement, with their son Colin reciting a prayer his mother kept in her wallet. The suspect in their killing and the shooting of another political couple has been arrested and faces federal charges.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that President Trump's signature budget bill could add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national debt. The assessment also indicates the legislation would lead to healthcare funding cuts affecting almost 12 million Americans, complicating its passage in the Senate. Despite narrowly clearing a procedural vote, the bill faces opposition from some Republicans over its fiscal impact and healthcare provisions, while Democrats criticize it as a tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of vulnerable populations. The bill's future remains uncertain as debate continues. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a key procedural vote on President Trump's large spending bill, Republican and Democratic senators remain sharply divided over proposed changes to Medicaid. Senator Jim Banks (R-Ind.) argued the reforms target able-bodied, non-working Americans and undocumented immigrants, asserting they are necessary to prevent tax increases for working families. In contrast, Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) contended the nearly $900 billion in cuts would impose burdensome requirements on beneficiaries and harm the middle class, a concern echoed by some Republicans like Senator Thom Tillis. The debate highlights the deep ideological split over the social safety net as the bill moves forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection, a decision that came hours after former President Donald Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. Tillis's opposition to Trump's signature spending bill, specifically its provisions cutting Medicaid, put him at odds with the former president and party leadership. In his statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in Washington, likening his situation to that of retired senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. His retirement now sets up a highly competitive and expensive primary in the key battleground state of North Carolina.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced in a recent interview that he has found a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to purchase TikTok, the popular video-sharing app. This development comes as the app's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to sell its US operations due to a law passed over national security concerns. Trump, who previously supported the ban but now favors the app's use, expressed confidence that the Chinese government would approve the sale. The identity of the potential buyer remains undisclosed, with Trump stating he would reveal more details in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>An artisanal gold mine collapsed in a government-controlled area of Sudan over the weekend, resulting in the deaths of at least 11 miners and injuring seven others. The state-owned Sudanese Mineral Resources Company reported that it had previously suspended work at the specific mine due to significant safety risks. The tragedy highlights the dangerous conditions in Sudan's artisanal mining sector, which has become a crucial source of funding for both sides of the country's brutal civil war. Much of the gold is reportedly smuggled out of the country, fueling the ongoing conflict.</p>

Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker visited the families of the victims and assured them of the city's support.

Tropical Storm Barry, located on the southeast coast, is expected to bring up to 10 inches of rain to some areas as it moves inland, prompting a tropical storm warning. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Flossie formed off the southwest coast and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane, though it is expected to remain offshore. While Flossie is not projected to make landfall, it is still predicted to dump significant rainfall across several Mexican states.</p>

          <p>According to a Washington Post report citing classified U.S. intelligence, intercepted communications from Iranian officials have downplayed the severity of the damage caused by recent American military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. While President Trump has asserted the strikes "completely and totally obliterated" the program, this intelligence suggests Iranian leaders are portraying a different picture internally. However, a source cautioned that the reliability of these intercepts is questionable, as officials could be misrepresenting the facts. The report adds to the uncertainty surrounding the true extent of the setback to Iran's nuclear ambitions, with a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency assessment also suggesting a more limited impact.</p>

          <p>Tijuana's Kenia EnrÃ­quez, an interim world champion in two weight classes, has signed an exclusive contract with the mixed martial arts organization Combate Global.

EnrÃ­quez, who has held an interim title since 2017, feels she has been disrespected and denied the opportunities she has earned in the ring. Her transition to MMA represents a significant career shift, driven by a search for the respect and opportunities she feels are lacking in professional boxing.</p>

In the 24 hours leading up to Sunday, at least 86 people were reported killed by Israeli attacks, including three children in a strike on the designated "safe zone" of al-Mawasi. The new evacuation orders and ongoing violence create a complex backdrop for mediators attempting to broker a new truce.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States is critically behind in the geopolitical competition over rare earth metals, a vulnerability highlighted by China's recent export controls on these essential materials. The author contends that for over 15 years, the U.S. has failed to address its over-reliance on Chinese supply chains for minerals vital to defense, technology, and green energy. While a recent temporary trade framework may ease restrictions, it comes with risks of "competitive surveillance" as China's licensing process demands sensitive data. The article calls for a long-term, unified national strategy to build a secure and independent critical minerals supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia predicted that President Trump's signature spending bill will become a "political albatross" for the Republican party. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Warner criticized the legislation for its projected impact on the national debt and its cuts to social safety nets, which he warned would harm rural hospitals, food assistance programs, and access to health insurance. He argued that despite some popular provisions like an expanded Child Tax Credit, the bill's core elements are deeply damaging. Warner suggested that many Republicans are privately concerned about the bill's consequences and that it "will come back and bite them." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary marks a significant political shift, demonstrating that an outspoken critic of Israel can win in America's most Jewish city. The 33-year-old democratic socialist's success over establishment figures reflects a realignment among many Democratic voters, particularly younger progressives, who have grown critical of Israel's conduct in the war in Gaza. While some Jewish voters supported Mamdani, focusing on domestic issues like affordability, his win has alarmed others who fear it signals waning political influence and rising antisemitism. The outcome suggests that a pro-Palestinian stance is no longer a disqualifying factor in major Democratic primaries.</p>

In Spain, temperatures soared to a new national June record of 46Â°C (114.8Â°F), while Italy placed 21 cities, including Rome and Venice, on high alert for extreme heat. The heat is expected to persist, with London forecast to hit 35Â°C and parts of Germany expecting up to 39Â°C. Scientists warn that such extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and intense due to human-driven climate change, and are also taking a toll on local biodiversity, with wildlife rescue centers reporting an influx of struggling birds.</p>

          <p>With temperatures rising, animal welfare experts are reminding dog owners of the serious dangers of exercising their pets in hot weather. The RSPCA notes that dogs are far more likely to suffer from heat-related illness during exercise than from being left in a car, as they can only regulate their temperature through panting and their paw pads. Key signs of overheating include heavy panting, excessive drooling, and lethargy. To keep dogs safe, owners are advised to walk them only in the very early morning or late evening, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water and indoor playtime on the hottest days.</p>
