          <h2>Trump Administration Extends EU Tariff Deadline to July 9</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has agreed to extend the deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union to July 9, following a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump cited a "very nice call" with von der Leyen, who indicated that the EU is ready to advance trade talks swiftly but needs additional time to reach a good deal. The extension aims to provide more time for negotiations between the U.S. and the EU to avoid a potential trade war, as Trump has previously expressed frustration with the pace of discussions and threatened to increase tariffs. This decision follows earlier announcements of tariff pauses and reductions to allow for negotiations, with the EU reiterating its commitment to securing a fair trade agreement based on mutual respect. Optimism score is based on the avoidance of potential trade war.</p>

Other senators are also raising issues with the bill, particularly regarding the debt ceiling increase, which some want to address separately, potentially complicating its passage through Congress.

The mosaic, made of rich marble and porphyry, was part of the floor of one of Caligula's ships, which were sunk after his assassination. After centuries underwater, the ships were raised by Mussolini, but destroyed during World War II, and the mosaic disappeared until it resurfaced in a Manhattan apartment. After being identified by an Italian art expert, the mosaic was seized and returned to the Nemi Museum in Italy, where it is now on display.</p>

          <p>Fogo Island, a remote island off the coast of Newfoundland, is reinventing itself through a luxury inn that serves as an economic engine for the community. The island's economy, once reliant on cod fishing, faced decline until a local resident, Zita Cobb, invested her tech fortune to revitalize the area. The Fogo Island Inn employs many islanders and promotes local craftsmanship, with furniture and quilts made by residents. Cobb's efforts have stabilized the island's population and fostered a new culture that balances tradition with innovation, creating a unique destination for visitors.</p>

Dr. Daniel Perl's discovery of microscopic scarring in the brains of service members who died by suicide has led to studies on brain injuries from cumulative, low-level blasts. Programs like Operation Proper Exit provide combat veterans suffering from severe injuries and PTSD the opportunity to return to Iraq for emotional closure.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has alleged that the US's "silence" after recent Russian attacks is encouraging President Vladimir Putin, following Moscow's largest aerial attack yet. The overnight attack saw Russia fire 367 drones and missiles - the highest number in a single night since Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022. In a pointed message to Trump - who has previously claimed that Putin is interested in ending the war - Zelensky said: "The world may go on vacation, but the war continues, despite weekends and weekdays. This cannot be ignored. America's silence, and the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin."</p>
