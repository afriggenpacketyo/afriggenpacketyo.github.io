          <p>Following a recent conflict and U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear sites, Iran's Foreign Minister has issued a stern warning to President Trump. The official demanded an end to what he termed a "disrespectful" tone towards Iran's supreme leader, cautioning that failure to show respect could lead Iran to unveil its "Real Capabilities." This diplomatic escalation occurs amid high post-ceasefire tensions, with both nations publicly contradicting each other on the status of future negotiations and the extent of damage to Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Japan, South Korea, and Australia were notably absent from the annual NATO summit, sending lower-level representatives instead.

          <p>Canadian companies are facing significant operational challenges due to the unpredictable nature of U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Business owners express frustration over the lack of stable trade rules, which hampers their ability to plan and has led to punitive costs and a slowdown in the Canadian economy. Despite ongoing talks, President Trump recently terminated discussions over a digital services tax, adding to the instability and leaving businesses hoping for any deal that can provide much-needed certainty.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that limited the use of nationwide injunctions, the practical implementation of President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship faces many unanswered questions. While the administration can now plan its approach in states that haven't sued, the policy's constitutionality has not been decided, and further legal challenges are expected. The ruling creates a complex legal landscape where the policy could take effect in some states in as little as 30 days, while litigation continues in others.</p>

          <p>People are identifying common indicators that a neighborhood is on the verge of gentrification, a process that often displaces long-term, lower-income residents. Observable signs include the arrival of quirky coffee shops, the construction of "tall/skinny" modern homes, and positive media coverage of previously "sketchy" areas. Other signals mentioned are an increase in joggers, the renaming of neighborhoods, and a surge in property purchases by real estate investors, all pointing to an impending rise in living costs.</p>

          <p>A new study from Tulane University indicates that parts of New Orleans' post-Katrina flood protection system are sinking at a rate of nearly two inches per year, faster than the rise in sea levels. This subsidence, particularly in areas like the Michoud neighborhood, degrades the city's defenses against storm surges and increases flood risk. Researchers warn that if the trend continues, it could eliminate critical coastal wetlands that act as natural storm buffers, underscoring the urgent need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance.</p>

          <p>In a major 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies. The ruling stemmed from challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship but focused on the broader issue of judicial authority, with the majority arguing such sweeping orders exceed the power granted to courts. While the decision is a victory for the Trump administration, Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent warned it abdicates the court's role in protecting the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," written by Kat Sadler and starring her sister Lizzie Davidson, is earning praise for its dark and unfiltered humor. The show follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and dysfunctional relationships, touching on taboo subjects with a sharp, comedic edge. The creators say the series is inspired by their own all-female upbringing and a desire to satirize the "bleak" modern dating scene from a female perspective.</p>

          <p>Despite Apple's stock currently lagging and facing challenges from U.S.-China tariffs and a lack of groundbreaking AI announcements, CNBC's Jim Cramer advises investors not to give up on the company. He argues that Apple's history shows that periods of uncertainty have consistently proven to be excellent buying opportunities in hindsight. Citing faith in CEO Tim Cook and a strong projected earnings growth rate compared to the broader market, Cramer suggests the stock remains a valuable long-term hold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria used his Paris Fashion Week show to make a powerful statement about the treatment of immigrants and deportees. The show opened with models dressed in white with their hands bound, evoking imagery from high-security prisons in El Salvador used to hold some migrants deported from the U.S. Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the runway performance was intended to address the "dehumanization" of immigrants and was met with both widespread praise for its boldness and some criticism.</p>
