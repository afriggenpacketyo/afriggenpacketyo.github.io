          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs resulted in one death and several injuries, with authorities investigating the incident as an intentional act of terrorism. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, damaged nearby buildings and prompted a response from the FBI and ATF. The American Reproductive Centers confirmed the explosion took place in the parking lot but assured that their staff, eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials remained secure and undamaged, expecting to resume normal operations on Monday. Officials are working to determine the motive and whether additional devices were planted in the area, with Attorney General Pam Bondi condemning the violence against the clinic. </p>

          <p>A local government's initiative to promote a bridge as an ideal spot for capturing Instagram-worthy photos of Mt. Fuji has backfired, leading to complaints from residents about disruptions. The "Mt. Fuji dream bridge" in Fuji, Shizuoka Prefecture, now attracts around 1,000 visitors daily, resulting in illegal parking, excessive noise, and trespassing on private property. Despite the city's efforts to manage the influx with signs and free parking, residents report constant disturbances from early morning. A tourism professor criticized the city's response as insufficient and called for central government support to address overtourism issues.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are set to hold their first bilateral summit since Brexit, with both sides aiming to strengthen cooperation amid global concerns over Russia, China, and the US. Negotiations are ongoing, with expected announcements including a joint declaration on foreign policy priorities, an EU-UK security and defense pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. While the UK seeks closer economic ties, the Labour government remains cautious due to Eurosceptic sentiments and concerns about migration. Key negotiation points include fishing rights, access to EU defense contracts, and a youth mobility scheme.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and individuals with high-risk medical conditions, limiting access for healthy people under 65. This decision requires Novavax to conduct further studies on heart conditions, potentially costing the company millions. Experts have expressed disappointment, questioning the rationale behind the restrictions and fearing it could hinder vaccine availability and affordability.

The revised standards also include references to the Bible and national pride, while removing education about Black Lives Matter.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was driven by high winds from thunderstorms, lifting dry soil into the air. This unusual event, reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era, significantly reduced visibility in Chicago and surrounding areas. Meteorologists attribute the storm's severity to exceptionally dry soil conditions, highlighting the impact of drought on the region.</p>
