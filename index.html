          <p>Tesla announced a 12% rise in third-quarter revenue, marking a return to growth after two consecutive declines. However, the company's earnings per share did not meet analyst projections, causing a slight dip in its stock price during after-hours trading. The report also noted challenges such as a sales slump in Europe and the impact of expiring federal EV tax credits. Tesla refrained from providing specific volume guidance but affirmed its goal to begin volume production of new products like the Cybercab and Semi trucks in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump publicly called on American cattle ranchers to reduce their prices, stating in a social media post that his tariffs are the primary reason for their recent success. This statement follows concerns from farmers about the negative impacts of the U.S.-China trade war and the president's suggestion of importing beef from Argentina to lower domestic costs. Ranching industry representatives and lawmakers from states like Nebraska have expressed strong opposition to the idea, arguing that it would harm local producers who are already facing challenges like drought and low cattle supply. The president's comments highlight a growing tension between his trade policies and the interests of the agricultural sector.</p>

Authorities allege Carlitos Ricardo Parias attempted to ram agents' vehicles when they tried to apprehend him on an administrative arrest warrant. Parias was wounded in the elbow and now faces federal charges for assault on a federal officer. The incident has drawn attention due to Parias's status as a community figure who documents ICE raids, highlighting the tense dynamic between citizen journalists and federal law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-based ocean carrier, Atlantic Container Line (ACL), is facing an unexpected $34 million annual tariff bill due to last-minute changes in new port fees enacted by the Trump administration. The fees, part of the Section 301 program, reclassified ACL's unique hybrid vessels, which carry both containers and roll-on/roll-off freight, leading to a massive increase in costs. The company's CEO warned that the financial burden could force ACL to cease U.S. operations, disrupting supply chains for American manufacturers. The U.S. Trade Representative's office has indicated that it is not currently considering any changes to the fee structure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that the government will soon impose a "substantial pickup" in sanctions against Russia amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The statement came as NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte prepared to visit the White House to discuss President Trump's peace initiatives. This development follows recent intense Russian missile strikes on Ukraine, which resulted in at least seven fatalities. The specific details of the new sanctions were not disclosed, but they are expected to be revealed shortly, as U.S. lawmakers await approval to vote on a broader sanctions bill.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell affirmed the league's choice of Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl LX halftime show, despite backlash from figures including President Donald Trump. Goodell stated that the selection process is carefully considered and that criticism is expected when catering to an audience of hundreds of millions. The controversy stems from the artist's past critical comments about U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and his decision to tour exclusively in Puerto Rico over fears of ICE detaining his fans. Despite the blowback, Goodell expressed confidence that the globally popular artist will deliver an exciting and unifying performance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump recently hosted News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch for dinner at the White House, despite being actively engaged in a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against him. The lawsuit stems from a Wall Street Journal report about a risqué letter allegedly sent by Trump to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday. The dinner, which included other key figures from Murdoch's media empire, occurred just days before Trump's legal team filed a response to Murdoch's motion to dismiss the case. This event highlights the complex and often contradictory relationship between the president and the influential conservative media tycoon.</p>

          <p>Consumers may face higher prices for Thanksgiving turkeys this year, as the USDA reports a 40% surge in wholesale prices compared to 2024. This significant increase is attributed to a shrinking supply of turkeys, caused by a combination of long-term declines in farming and recent avian flu outbreaks that have affected over 3 million birds this year. In response, major retailers like Walmart and Aldi are offering competitive deals on turkeys, often using them as "loss leaders" to attract holiday shoppers. Despite the wholesale spike, economists suggest the price increase for consumers at the grocery store will likely be more moderate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by Oxford Economics suggests that many American taxpayers could see larger tax refunds in 2026 due to retroactive provisions in the Republicans' recently enacted tax law. The law extended previous tax cuts and introduced new breaks, but because the IRS has not yet updated its withholding tables, many employees are likely overpaying taxes this year. This overpayment could result in an additional $50 billion in total taxpayer savings, primarily through bigger refunds or lower tax bills when filing for the 2025 tax year. The report notes that a disproportionate share of these benefits is expected to accrue to upper-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citing revelations from a posthumously published memoir by abuse survivor Virginia Giuffre, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee is demanding that Attorney General Pam Bondi release government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Representative Robert Garcia stated that Giuffre's memoir, which details her abuse by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, contradicts claims that the files lacked justification for further investigation. The demand is part of an ongoing congressional inquiry into the government's handling of the Epstein case, with Garcia accusing the Justice Department of disregarding a congressional subpoena and raising questions about its motives.</p>

          <p>Four men arrested for projecting an image of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle during the president's UK visit have been released without any charges. The men were initially arrested on suspicion of offenses including malicious communications and public nuisance. The political campaign group Led By Donkeys claimed responsibility for the nine-minute projection, which it operated from a nearby hotel, calling the arrests a "ridiculous overreaction." The incident occurred while President Trump was staying at the castle for a state visit, drawing attention to his past association with the disgraced financier.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, credit card borrowers face a decision between waiting for potential relief or pursuing debt forgiveness now. While rate cuts could lower borrowing costs, the article notes that these reductions are typically incremental and have a limited, delayed impact on high credit card interest rates, which are also influenced by the prime rate. Given that interest continues to compound daily, waiting for minor rate adjustments may be less effective than exploring immediate debt relief options like forgiveness programs, credit counseling, or consolidation loans.

          <p>Alec Baldwin's lawsuit alleging malicious prosecution by New Mexico officials has been transferred from state to federal court. The lawsuit stems from the involuntary manslaughter charge brought against him following the fatal 2021 shooting on the "Rust" movie set, a charge that was later dismissed. Baldwin claims he was made a celebrity scapegoat by the district attorney and special prosecutors, who have now exercised their right to move the case to a federal venue because the actor's suit includes federal civil rights claims. This development marks the latest turn in the protracted legal aftermath of the on-set tragedy.</p>

          <p>According to a master jeweler and Parisian gem appraiser, the thieves who stole priceless jewels from the Louvre will find it extremely difficult to profit from their heist. The expert, Stephen Portier, explained that the items are too famous to be sold intact on the black market, as the tight-knit network of dealers would immediately recognize them. If the thieves dismantle the pieces to sell the stones and metal separately, their value would plummet by as much as 90%. The unique characteristics of the centuries-old gems, including their distinctive cut and specific properties, make them easily identifiable even if removed from their settings.</p>

Despite Trump's earlier claims that the new structure would not touch the existing building, demolition crews are now razing most of the wing. The project has drawn criticism from figures like former first lady Hillary Clinton and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which has called for a pause until legally required public reviews are conducted.

He discusses balancing the triumphalist story of liberty with the tragic aspects, including its impact on enslaved people and Indigenous nations, framing it as a complex civil and world war. Burns emphasizes that embracing these contradictions does not diminish the power of the Revolution's ideas but rather enlarges them. The conversation also touches upon the historical significance of the event, the moral complexities of the Founding Fathers, and how its unresolved tensions continue to shape the United States today.</p>

The move aligns with the Trump administration's broader effort to promote fossil fuels globally, coming just as it approved a controversial new LNG export terminal in Louisiana.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to make further interest rate cuts, potential homebuyers are weighing the pros and cons of locking in a mortgage rate now versus waiting for them to fall further. Locking a rate in the low 6% range provides certainty for budgeting and protection against unexpected market spikes. However, waiting could lead to additional savings if the Fed's actions push rates down, although there is no guarantee of this outcome. The article advises borrowers to consider potential "float down" fees for changing a locked rate and to be realistic about how much they could save by delaying. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the recent decline, gold remains up over 50% for the year.
