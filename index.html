          <p>Samsung Electronics reported first-quarter operating profit and revenue that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by robust sales of its Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips. The South Korean tech giant posted a record quarterly revenue, marking a 10% increase year-over-year, while its operating profit rose by 1.5%. While the company acknowledged macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and global growth slowdown, it anticipates improved performance in the second half of the year, contingent on the reduction of these uncertainties. Samsung's financial performance underscores its leading position in memory chip manufacturing and as the world's second-largest smartphone maker.</p>

          <p>Rodney Scott, President Trump's nominee to lead Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is facing accusations from a former CBP official of orchestrating a "cover-up" in the 2010 death of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, who died after being beaten and tased by CBP agents. James Wong, the former official, alleges that Scott, then a top Border Patrol official, oversaw a critical incident team (CIT) that aimed to mitigate liability for Border Patrol senior management rather than conduct a genuine investigation. The CIT allegedly used unlawful subpoenas to obtain Hernández Rojas’s medical records in an effort to manipulate information for public relations purposes, raising concerns about Scott's suitability to lead one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the country.</p>

          <p>A California judge has ruled that Border Patrol agents in the Eastern District of California must obtain a warrant or have reason to believe an individual may flee before arresting them on suspicion of living in the U.S. illegally. This decision follows arrests made during "Operation Return to Sender" in January, which the ACLU challenged, alleging that agents unconstitutionally detained individuals based on their appearance. The judge found that Border Patrol agents violated constitutional rights and will now require the agency to submit regular reports detailing arrests and detentions. While CBP claims the ruling is moot due to updated guidance and training, the judge expressed concern that the policy could be changed again in the future.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to disburse $12 million in congressionally approved grant money to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), a news organization providing independent reporting in countries with limited press freedom. Judge Royce C. Lamberth criticized the administration for withholding funds despite a previous ruling blocking the grant termination, accusing them of employing delay tactics to evade judicial review. The judge emphasized that Congress and President Trump himself had enacted the law allocating funds to RFE/RL, which reports in nearly 30 languages and reaches 47 million people weekly, and was on the brink of collapse due to the funding holdup. This is a second ruling from Judge Lamberth, who also ordered the administration to restore operations at Voice of America.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump discussed his first 100 days in office in an exclusive interview with ABC News, addressing topics ranging from the economy and immigration to executive powers and foreign policy. He defended his administration's immigration policies, claiming they "seem to work" in cutting down on illegal crossings along the southern border, while also acknowledging the need to be "careful" in deportation efforts. Trump also framed his use of presidential powers as necessary to heal a "sick" country and addressed concerns about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting that Putin might be "tapping" him along in Ukraine peace talks. The president defended the work of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in cutting waste and fraud, stating that fraud referrals have been made to the Justice Department.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders that partially rolled back some auto tariffs, removing levies that carmakers argued would raise production costs and harm U.S. manufacturing. The changes exempt carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports from additional levies on steel, aluminum, and certain imports from Canada and Mexico, but suppliers remain subject to tariffs. Automakers can also qualify for tariff relief on a portion of imported components for two years, after which the benefits will be phased out, prompting concerns about the long-term impact on car prices and the financial health of automakers. While auto executives expressed gratitude for the relief measures, analysts cautioned that the changes do not fully address the challenges posed by tariffs and could lead to higher car prices as economic momentum fades.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to soften some of the automotive tariffs put into place earlier this month, as the car industry grapples with regulatory uncertainty and additional costs. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies. Additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years. It's unclear how an automaker would get such a reimbursement, but the offer is retroactive to when the tariffs took effect on April 3.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has unanimously approved a $4 billion settlement, the largest sexual assault settlement in U.S. history, for victims abused as children in county-run juvenile facilities and foster homes. The settlement includes nearly 7,000 claims, primarily from the 1980s through the 2000s, detailing a history of inadequate screening for abusers and a lack of disciplinary action against staff. The county plans to fund the settlement through bonds and its rainy day fund, which will impact future investments in community services, while implementing measures to prevent future abuse. The settlement arose from Assembly Bill 218, which extended the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse cases, leading to a surge of litigation against the county.</p>

The White House defends the cuts, citing financial mismanagement and improper payments within AmeriCorps, while critics argue the cuts will harm communities and disrupt critical services provided by volunteers.

          <p>Florida is experiencing heightened tension and fear within its immigrant communities following the implementation of new, aggressive immigration enforcement measures demanded by Governor Ron DeSantis. The Trump administration has made numerous immigration arrests in the state with Florida's assistance, leading to overcrowding in detention centers and threats against local officials who oppose cooperation with federal authorities. Despite a federal judge's order temporarily blocking part of one law, the state's attorney general has seemingly defied the order, creating confusion and legal challenges. The new policies are affecting various cities in South Florida, which is heavily Hispanic, and raising concerns about racial profiling and due process violations.</p>

Cramer highlighted the widespread exposure to the stock market through 401k and IRA accounts, emphasizing the tax advantages of investing and advocating for the importance of understanding and navigating the stock market.

          <p>Turkey's war with the Kurdish militant group PKK has led to the creation of a "Forbidden Zone" in northern Iraq, impacting the lives of villagers and forcing thousands off their land. The Turkish military has built at least 136 fixed military installations across northern Iraq, effectively controlling over 2,000 sq km of Iraqi land. While Iraq's government has condemned Turkey's military presence, it has also accommodated some of Ankara's demands due to trade and water security dependencies.

He suggested the possibility of a slowing economy unless the Fed lowers interest rates, continuing his pressure on the Fed to implement pre-emptive rate cuts.

          <p>A new study reveals that human wounds heal more than twice as slowly as those of other mammals, including chimpanzees, monkeys, and mice. This slower healing rate is attributed to the evolutionary trade-off where humans lost fur in favor of sweat glands, which are less efficient at repairing wounds. While furry animals rely on hair follicle stem cells for rapid skin regeneration, humans depend on sweat gland stem cells, resulting in a slower healing process. Despite this disadvantage, humans gained evolutionary advantages by losing hair, such as improved cooling and physical endurance.</p>
