        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Newark, New Jersey. According to the interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, Baraka ignored multiple warnings from Department of Homeland Security officials to leave the facility, leading to his arrest. Baraka, a Democrat running for governor of New Jersey, has been a vocal opponent of the detention center, even filing a lawsuit to block its opening. Homeland Security officials described the incident as a political stunt, claiming protesters stormed the gate and broke into the facility as a busload of detainees entered. This article describes the arrest and the context of Baraka's opposition to the facility.</p>

The New York Times article notes that while both artists have enjoyed immense success, their approaches to sentimentality differ, with Lamar treating remembrance as a moral act and SZA expressing agitation about looking backward. The concert balanced Lamar's introspective and bellicose energy with SZA's exuberant moodiness, creating a dynamic performance that kept the audience engaged. The article highlights how Lamar's set list acknowledged his recent feud with Drake while emphasizing his shift towards anthemic songs filled with grit and triumphalism, while SZA focused on spiritual rebirth after emotional abrasion.</p>

While Social Security benefits are a valuable foundation, they may not cover all expenses, especially with rising living costs and market volatility. The article explains that collecting both Social Security and annuity payments is possible, but it's important to consider factors like the age at which you claim Social Security and the type of annuity you own. Strategies for maximizing income include delaying Social Security, laddering annuities for flexibility, and being mindful of income thresholds to minimize taxes.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has submitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store, following a court ruling that favored the game maker in a contempt ruling. The CNBC article reports that Fortnite was removed from iPhones in 2020 after Epic Games circumvented Apple's commission fees. The ruling prevents Apple from charging commissions on link-outs or dictating their appearance, paving the way for Fortnite's return. Apple could still reject Fortnite's submission and is appealing last month's contempt ruling.</p>
