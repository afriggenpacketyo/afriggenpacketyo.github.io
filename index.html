        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has identified recent bankruptcies in the U.S. auto market as an early warning sign of overly lax corporate lending standards. Citing the collapses of First Brands and Tricolor Holdings, Dimon suggested that a credit bull market lasting over a decade may have created hidden excesses. He cautioned that a future economic downturn could expose significantly more credit-related problems across the financial system, comparing the situation to seeing one cockroach and assuming there are more. Despite the concern, JPMorgan's overall credit metrics are reported as stable and better than expected for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Research from Peking University has been instrumental in advancing China's hypersonic weapons capabilities, with key figures like Professor Huang Lin playing a pivotal role for the last two decades. Despite U.S. sanctions on many Chinese universities for military-related projects, Peking University has not been targeted, highlighting the difficulty in separating basic scientific research from military applications. The work was reportedly inspired by a national directive to align research with major strategic needs, tracing back to China's development of nuclear missile capabilities in the 1960s. This connection underscores the deep integration of academic institutions in the nation's military modernization efforts.</p>

          <p>Following Congress's failure to pass a funding deal, a government shutdown is forcing active-duty U.S. military personnel to continue their service without receiving timely pay. While essential civilian employees at the Defense Department will also work, others face furloughs. A 2019 law ensures all government employees will eventually receive back pay, but military pay requires separate legislation, which has not yet passed. To mitigate the financial strain, financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering 0% APR loans to affected service members, a measure also taken during previous shutdowns.</p>

          <p>While most FAA and TSA employees are deemed essential and must work without pay during the government shutdown, a prolonged impasse could lead to significant travel disruptions. Experts warn that if the shutdown extends, financially strained workers like TSA officers may stop reporting for duty, leading to labor shortages and long security lines, as seen in the 2018-2019 shutdown. The U.S. Travel Association estimates the shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, worsening an existing shortage. Train travel and passport services are expected to remain largely unaffected in the short term.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly benefit checks during the government shutdown, as the program's funding is mandatory and not subject to annual appropriation battles. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which will disrupt customer service functions. Key services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards will be halted.

          <p>A UK government minister has expressed outrage over a charity run in a public London park that barred women from participating. The event, organized by the East London Mosque, was advertised as inclusive but was only open to men, boys, and girls under 12. Communities Secretary Steve Reed called the exclusion "absolutely unacceptable" and stated that the Equality and Human Rights Commission would investigate the matter. While the mosque defended its commitment to supporting women in sports, the incident has sparked a debate about gender equality and the use of public spaces for exclusive events.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has officially shut down after lawmakers failed to approve new funding before the fiscal year deadline. A government shutdown occurs when Congress does not pass the necessary appropriations bills, forcing federal agencies to cease all non-essential functions. During this period, essential employees, such as active-duty military and air traffic controllers, must continue to work without immediate pay, while other federal workers are furloughed. Programs with permanent funding like Social Security continue, but the shutdown disrupts a wide range of government services and creates economic uncertainty until a new funding agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>China has imposed sweeping new export restrictions on rare earth materials, a move that could significantly disrupt the U.S. defense industry and escalate trade tensions. The new rules specifically target the use of these critical minerals by foreign militaries, requiring export licenses that Beijing has indicated it will deny. Since the U.S. is heavily dependent on China for rare earths, which are essential for manufacturing advanced weapons like F-35 jets and Tomahawk missiles, the policy gives Beijing powerful leverage. The restrictions are viewed as a negotiating tactic that directly undermines U.S. national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Iranian court has convicted and jailed two French citizens, identified as Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris, on multiple charges including espionage for France and Israel. The sentences are lengthy, with one individual receiving a 20-year term for assisting Israeli intelligence. France has long maintained that the two, who were detained in May 2022, are being held arbitrarily and has called for their release. The convictions come amid discussions of a potential prisoner swap involving an Iranian student detained in France, a practice that rights groups describe as Tehran using foreign nationals as political bargaining chips.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates fall from recent highs, housing experts anticipate a mixed impact on the U.S. real estate market. While lower rates increase affordability and may entice buyers who were waiting on the sidelines, this surge in demand is likely to intensify competition for a still-limited housing inventory. This increased competition could, in turn, drive home prices higher, potentially offsetting the savings from a lower interest rate. Lenders are also seeing a spike in both new purchase and refinance applications, which could lead to slower processing times and delays in closing for prospective homebuyers.

          <p>Retired England bowler Stuart Broad has stoked the rivalry ahead of this winter's Ashes series, claiming that Australia's current team is their "worst since 2010." That year marked England's last series victory down under. Broad argues that while Australia remains the favorite at home, they face question marks over their lineup and the fitness of their captain, Pat Cummins. He contrasted this with what he calls the "best English team since 2010," suggesting the matchup could lead to a highly competitive series. The comments add a layer of psychological pressure on an Australian side already dealing with injury concerns.</p>

An army colonel announced on national radio that the military was dissolving all state institutions except the lower house of parliament, which had just voted to impeach the president. The takeover follows weeks of demonstrations, initially against utility shortages, that grew into a movement demanding the government's resignation.

          <p>The Federal Election Commission (FEC), the agency responsible for regulating money in U.S. politics, is currently unable to conduct its most important business due to a lack of commissioners. In an opinion piece, a former chair warns that with another commissioner departing, the FEC will be down to two members, far short of the four required for a quorum to enforce the law. This incapacitation, which has occurred multiple times under the Trump administration, effectively leaves "no cop on the beat" to address potential campaign finance violations. The situation emboldens illicit political actors and undermines transparency ahead of another multi-billion dollar election cycle.</p>

          <p>In the New York City mayoral race, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is playing a potentially decisive role despite having little chance of winning himself. Polling shows that Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, is drawing enough votes to potentially act as a spoiler, complicating the path for independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and benefiting Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani. Despite pressure from prominent Republicans and wealthy donors to drop out and consolidate the anti-Mamdani vote behind Cuomo, Sliwa has adamantly refused. His persistence ensures a fractured opposition, which could ultimately pave the way for a Mamdani victory in the overwhelmingly Democratic city.</p>

The changes include killing the confusing standalone "Wagoneer" nameplate, simplifying the trim levels, and lowering the starting price to under $65,000 to better compete in the market. A new extended-range electric powertrain will also be introduced, aiming to make the Grand Wagoneer a leader in its class. These adjustments are a direct response to disappointing sales and dealer feedback since the vehicle's 2021 launch, reflecting a broader strategy to boost Jeep's declining market share.</p>
