          <p>Syria's presidency has declared an immediate ceasefire in the southern city of Suweida, aiming to end a week of violent sectarian conflict between local Bedouin tribesmen and the Druze community that has killed hundreds. Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for unity as internal security forces deployed to the region, a move approved by Israel to protect the Druze minority. However, the ceasefire's stability is uncertain, with reports of violations already emerging. The violence prompted Israeli airstrikes on Syrian government targets earlier in the week, adding a layer of international complexity to the regional crisis.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Rwanda-backed M23 militia have signed a provisional ceasefire agreement in Qatar, committing to a permanent truce by August 18. The deal, hailed as a major milestone by the African Union, aims to bring stability to the mineral-rich eastern DRC, which has suffered from decades of conflict. The agreement calls for an end to hate propaganda and attempts to seize new territory by force. However, key details regarding concessions, such as the release of captured fighters and the withdrawal of M23 troops, remain to be finalized.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms and heavy rain across much of the UK, signaling a risk of flash flooding, travel disruptions, and power cuts. The alerts follow a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, increasing flood likelihood. Most of England is under a thunderstorm warning, while a separate rain warning covers eastern Scotland. Although a more severe amber warning for London has ended, the potential for torrential downpours remains a concern for many regions throughout the weekend.</p>

Critics argue that Kennedy's anti-vaccine views and the administration's budget cuts are undermining public health institutions and sowing distrust in vaccines amid a measles surge.

          <p>A viral TikTok trend known as the "Gen Z stare" has sparked a cross-generational conversation about social skills and communication norms. Older generations describe it as a blank, unresponsive look from young people in conversation, which they find disconcerting. Psychology experts suggest this behavior may stem from a combination of increased online interaction and social development during pandemic lockdowns, leading to different conversational cues. While some Gen Z individuals are unaware of the phenomenon, the discourse highlights evolving social dynamics and the timeless tradition of older generations complaining about younger ones.</p>

However, critics note these commitments are long-term and uncertain, while the tariffs have begun to increase consumer prices on some imported goods, risking inflation. With an effective tariff rate at its highest since 1910, the administration's fluctuating approach has created significant uncertainty for businesses and the broader economy.

          <p>Recent catastrophic events, including the Texas floods and Los Angeles firestorms, are causing meteorologists to confront the challenge of ensuring their warnings are heeded by officials and the public. Despite issuing alerts days in advance, the scale of devastation has left some forecasters with a sense of regret, wondering if they could have done more to communicate the danger. This disconnect highlights a recurring issue of public complacency and the difficulty in conveying urgency for events that are possible but not certain. The disasters are prompting a re-evaluation of how to effectively translate weather forecasts into life-saving action.</p>

The fallen officers, identified as Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn, were all members of the specialized arson explosives detail. The incident, which marks the department's deadliest in over 160 years, occurred as they were handling explosives removed from an apartment complex in Santa Monica. The FBI and LAPD are assisting in the investigation, which could lead to negligent homicide charges against the person who stored the device.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Donald Trump is trapped by the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories that have become an article of faith for his MAGA base. The author details how right-wing media and Trump allies stoked theories of a deep-state pedophile ring, only for the administration to later state that no incriminating "client list" exists. This has caused an eruption of anger and distrust among his followers, who feel betrayed. The author concludes that Trump's long history with Epstein and his cultivation of paranoia have created a political ghost he cannot dispel.</p>

          <p>Despite White House claims that inflation is under control, economic data indicates that President Trump's tariffs are contributing to rising consumer prices on a range of goods. The aggressive and erratic trade strategy has pushed the average effective tariff rate to its highest level in over a century, with costs ultimately passed to consumers. This has created a tense standoff with the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates on hold to assess the inflationary impact. Trump has responded with increasingly bitter public attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Citing a Trump executive order, the USDA claims the data is for ensuring program integrity, but critics and Democratic senators argue the plan violates federal privacy laws and turns a vital food program into a surveillance tool.

          <p>Texas has enacted a new law, the Life of the Mother Act, intended to clarify when doctors can perform abortions in medical emergencies under the state's restrictive ban. The law specifies that a patient's death does not need to be "imminent" to qualify for an exception and confirms that the burden of proof lies with the state in any prosecution. While supported by a rare bipartisan coalition, reproductive rights advocates and some medical groups are skeptical it will provide sufficient protection for doctors, who still face severe penalties.

          <p>Financial personalities Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman are at odds over the long-standing 4% rule for retirement withdrawals. Ramsey argues the rule is outdated and that retirees can safely withdraw more, up to 8%, based on optimistic projections of 12% annual returns from mutual funds. Conversely, Orman advises a more conservative approach, calling the 4% rule "very dangerous" and suggesting a lower 3% withdrawal rate to account for inflation and market volatility. The debate highlights the different risk philosophies retirees must consider when managing their nest eggs for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

The government has agreed to provide significant funding, reportedly around £35 million, contingent on contributions from other partners like the London Mayor's office. This backing is a major boost for UK Athletics and follows an open letter from over 100 top athletes urging for government support.</p>
