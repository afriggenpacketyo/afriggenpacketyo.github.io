          <p>Novo Nordisk's CEO, Lars Fruergaard JÃ¸rgensen, will step down as the company faces growing competition in the obesity drug market, particularly for its Wegovy medication.

Despite the change in leadership, Novo Nordisk's board has expressed confidence in the company's current business plans and strategy.

          <p>The German government is considering suspending family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status, primarily affecting Syrian families. This controversial move aims to address citizens' concerns about immigration and the country's ability to integrate refugees. While asylum seekers and recognized refugees have the right to family reunification, those with subsidiary protection status, who face serious harm in their country of origin but don't meet Geneva Convention criteria, do not automatically have this right. Critics argue that this separation can cause significant psychological strain and lead to irregular immigration attempts, while legal experts debate its compatibility with human rights laws.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia has elicited a range of reactions from Saudi citizens, with some expressing admiration for his "straight shooter" approach and conservative values. Trump's policies, including the removal of sanctions on Syria and emphasis on traditional gender norms, resonate with certain segments of the population. However, others criticize his economic policies and express concerns about his impact on America and the Middle East. Despite varying opinions, many Saudis appreciate Trump's visit and the attention he gives to their country.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will soon send letters to other nations, informing them of the tariff rates the U.S. will impose on imports. The letters, to be sent by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, will specify rates that are "very fair" but will outline the costs of doing business in the United States. The move follows recent negotiations with major trading partners regarding Trump's April 2 tariffs, which set historically high duties on imported goods.</p>

Both Putin and Zelensky have recently sought to demonstrate responsiveness to Washington's call for direct dialogue, even as Trump has downplayed the likelihood of progress until a meeting with Putin occurs.</p>
