          <p>Financial experts advise college graduates to start saving for retirement immediately to capitalize on compound interest and long-term market benefits. Despite market volatility, focusing on time in the market rather than timing the market is crucial for building wealth. Investing in low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track broad market indexes is recommended for diversification. Experts suggest allocating a higher percentage to stocks when younger, gradually shifting to bonds as retirement nears, and emphasize the importance of understanding individual risk tolerance when making investment decisions.

          <p>FEMA has denied North Carolina's request for a 100% federal cost share for Hurricane Helene cleanup, reverting to the traditional 75/25 cost-sharing model. Governor Josh Stein expressed concern that this decision will cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars, impacting funding for small businesses and infrastructure repairs. The denial comes amid discussions within the Trump administration to potentially eliminate or downsize FEMA, shifting more emergency management control to states. An internal review also indicated that FEMA is not adequately prepared for the upcoming hurricane season due to staffing limitations and reorganization efforts.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has condemned Israel's new aid program in southern Gaza following a chaotic launch where thousands of Palestinians rushed a food distribution site, prompting Israeli forces to fire warning shots. This initiative, intended to bypass both the UN and Hamas, has been criticized by aid groups as dangerously inadequate and a violation of humanitarian principles. The UN accuses Israel of politicizing and militarizing aid, replacing numerous UN distribution sites with just four secured by Israeli soldiers and private U.S. contractors. European diplomats have also criticized the program and Israel's offensive, emphasizing that aid should never be politicized or militarized.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump defended his tariff strategy, rejecting the "TACO trade" critique, which suggests he announces tariffs only to later soften them. Trump argued his tariff threats have spurred trade negotiations, citing the European Union's willingness to meet after a 50% tariff was proposed. He dismissed the idea that delaying the tariff deadline was "chickening out," instead framing it as a negotiation tactic. Stocks initially fell after Trump's tariff announcement but rallied after the deadline was delayed, highlighting the market's sensitivity to trade policy.</p>

TRNSMT promoters cited police concerns as the reason for the cancellation, while Kneecap announced a new show at Glasgow's O2 Academy to compensate fans.

          <p>Porsche is facing significant challenges due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, declining sales in China, and weaker demand for electric vehicles. The tariffs, particularly on cars imported to the United States, have exacerbated existing issues, leading to a scaled-back forecast for the year and a drop in profit margin expectations. CEO Oliver Blume described the situation as a "violent storm," noting the collapse of the Chinese market and the impact of U.S. import tariffs. The company is now scaling back its EV goals, reintroducing combustion engine models, and cutting costs to navigate these headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fannie Mae is partnering with Palantir to enhance mortgage fraud detection using artificial intelligence, deepening ties between the federal government and the technology company. The partnership aims to proactively identify fraud, starting with Fannie Mae's multi-family housing business. Early tests showed Palantir's technology could identify fraud in seconds, a process that previously took human investigators two months. The program may be expanded to Freddie Mac in the future, and the agency is also considering a partnership with Elon Musk's xAI firm to further streamline operations and reduce costs.

Trump responded by emphasizing the need to pass the bill through the House, highlighting political compromises.

Musk has also pulled back from his DOGE work to focus on his companies, citing it becoming a scapegoat.</p>

GE Vernova recently received approval to deploy its BWRX-300 reactor in Ontario, Canada, marking the first SMR deployment in the West.

          <p>President Trump has suggested redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools, but education experts say this faces significant obstacles. Federal grants are awarded competitively for specific research purposes, requiring specialized faculty, researchers, and facilities, which trade schools typically lack. Experts argue that it is illegal and unrealistic to simply redirect funds, as the money is allocated based on merit and specific research proposals. While trade schools could apply for different types of federal funding, they generally do not conduct the academic and scientific research that qualifies for grants awarded to institutions like Harvard.
