          <p>Authorities in Cheshire have initiated an underwater search for Rachel Booth, a 38-year-old woman who went missing early Saturday. She was last seen on CCTV footage at a garage in Northwich, and police believe she may have traveled to the Oakmere area. A local outdoor activity center has temporarily closed its lake to assist with the search as police express growing concern for her welfare. The public has been asked for any information regarding her whereabouts.</p>

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, continues to advocate for the release of Department of Justice files related to Jeffrey Epstein. While pushing for transparency, he emphasized the need to protect the identities of victims and innocent individuals mentioned in the documents. Burchett also addressed criticism from President Trump, who dismissed the calls as a "hoax," stating he remains committed to uncovering the truth despite political pressure. He expressed skepticism that the full extent of the case will ever be revealed.</p>

          <p>American Vice President JD Vance is expected to take a family holiday in the Cotswolds and London, despite his previous critical remarks about the UK and Europe. Vance has previously accused European governments of suppressing free speech and failing to control migration, specifically criticizing the UK and Scotland. His planned trip comes as his past comments, including an inaccurate claim about Scotland's abortion "safe access zones," are being revisited. The visit highlights a contrast between his political rhetoric and personal travel choices.</p>

          <p>An investigation in China's Gansu province has revealed that the provincial disease control agency and a local hospital falsified test results in a major lead poisoning scandal involving kindergarten children. Ten officials are now under investigation for their roles in the cover-up, which manipulated testing procedures for affected children. Senior provincial leaders have issued a public apology and promised to provide free medical treatment and reimbursement for all costs incurred by the families. The incident has caused national shock and outrage over the systemic failure.</p>

          <p>While corporate layoffs are often attributed to restructuring or optimization, experts suspect artificial intelligence is a larger, unstated factor. Companies like IBM and Klarna have been transparent about replacing roles with AI, but many others use vague language to avoid potential backlash from the public and employees. This "AI-driven workforce reshaping" is particularly evident in roles like content creation, customer service, and HR. Experts suggest this strategic silence helps manage optics, though it raises questions about the long-term impact on the labor market.</p>

He suggests that seeking "neutral ground"—shared activities that are not focused on differences—is a more achievable and valuable goal. Using his experience of surfing with his politically different brother-in-law as an example, Litt argues that these shared, neutral spaces can foster friendship and lead to more meaningful discussions. This approach, he contends, is crucial for navigating disagreements without being disagreeable.</p>

This skill is foundational for emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, serving as a buffer against anxiety and self-doubt. Raouda suggests that parents can foster this by validating their child's feelings, welcoming their full selves, and modeling their own emotional regulation. Small shifts in parenting can help build a child's inner voice and protect long-term mental health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the company Create & Cultivate, identifies a lack of preparation as the biggest red flag in a job interview. She states that a candidate showing up without a solid understanding of the company or the role they are applying for is a major concern. Conversely, she is most impressed when a candidate has done their due diligence and can offer real, constructive feedback on the business's current operations. For Johnson, this demonstrates genuine interest and critical thinking, crucial traits for a fast-moving startup environment.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for restoring the Confederate-era names of several U.S. army bases, an action that appears to circumvent a 2021 law. Congress had mandated the renaming of bases originally named for Confederate leaders, but Hegseth claims to be renaming them for different soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names. This move has been called an "insult" and an attempt to "stick his finger in the eye of Congress." The controversy highlights a broader debate over honoring figures who fought against the United States to preserve slavery.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir, Carol Moseley Braun, the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate, recounts her trailblazing career and the challenges she faced. She recalls incidents of racism and argues that sexism is often a more difficult barrier to overcome. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is "walking around in a daze" in its response to Donald Trump. Despite recent political backsliding, she remains optimistic that Americans value democracy and will ultimately resist authoritarianism, believing the pendulum of history will swing back.</p>

The author recounts learning a sanitized version of state history that celebrated "Sooners" while erasing the brutal displacement of Indigenous peoples. The article posits that the state's current efforts to rebrand itself mirror its foundational strategy of prioritizing outsiders over addressing its past. To understand America's current cultural collisions, one must reckon with Oklahoma's unvarnished legacy.</p>
