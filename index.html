          <p>Two 16-year-olds have received life sentences for the murder of 14-year-old Kelyan Bokassa on a bus in Woolwich, London. The court heard the assailants attacked Bokassa with machetes in a planned and brutal 14-second assault, reportedly smiling as they did so. Kelyan's mother delivered a heartbreaking victim impact statement, describing herself as a 'broken soul.' The judge sentenced the teens to a minimum of 15 years and 10 months, as overwhelming CCTV evidence left them no choice but to plead guilty to the crime.</p>

          <p>As former President Trump prepares to visit his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, local opinions remain divided. Some residents, like David Milne, resent the development for altering the natural landscape and hold a grudge over past disputes with the former president. Others point to the economic benefits and employment the course brings to the region, choosing to separate the business from the politics. Despite planned protests and polls showing widespread disapproval of Trump in Scotland, the golf course continues to be a significant local employer and attraction.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has acknowledged the NHS faces a difficult period as thousands of resident doctors in England commence a five-day strike over pay and working conditions. While the government aims to minimize disruption by keeping non-urgent services running with senior doctor coverage, the British Medical Association (BMA) warns of stretched staff. This marks the 12th strike since March 2023, with over a million appointments canceled in previous walkouts. The government maintains that pay is not negotiable, while the BMA argues that real-term wages have fallen significantly since 2008.</p>

          <p>Actress Candace Cameron Bure recently shared that she was placed on a diet at age 12 while starring on the show 'Full House.' She explained her parents made the decision out of fear she might develop an eating disorder, influenced by the public struggles of another child actor at the time. While her parents framed it as a lesson in healthy choices, Bure admits the focus on her weight and food shaped her body image negatively from a young age. This experience, she says, started a pattern of insecurity that continued through her teenage years.</p>

          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick states that while AI is not yet ready to fully replace human jobs, it poses a 'huge concern' for the entry-level workforce. He argues that AI's proficiency in completing basic tasks challenges the traditional apprenticeship model, making it harder for new workers to gain essential expertise. Mollick advises that skills like judgment, taste, and deep knowledge will become more critical, and that companies must rethink entry-level roles as training opportunities. He suggests that jobs with a variety of 'bundled' tasks are more resilient to being fully automated by artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>An inquest has concluded that there were failings in the care of former England cricketer Graham Thorpe, who took his own life in August 2024. The court heard that healthcare professionals did not perceive the 55-year-old to be in a crisis situation, even after his wife reported he was asking for help to end his life. A consultant psychiatrist admitted in hindsight that a home visit would have been clinically indicated but was not performed. The coroner noted Thorpe had spiraled into depression after losing his coaching job, leading to this tragic outcome.</p>

Experts suggest this could be due to a generational shift, as younger, digital-native collectors may have different tastes than the baby boomers who previously drove the market.

          <p>A growing number of Americans are claiming Social Security at age 62, the earliest possible age, which locks in a permanently reduced monthly benefit. This article outlines several strategies to avoid this, thereby maximizing lifetime payouts by delaying claims. These include investing in an annuity to create a private income bridge, using a reverse mortgage to tap into home equity for funds, or maximizing catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts in the years leading up to retirement. These methods can provide the financial flexibility needed to wait until age 70, when benefits are highest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A provision from the 2021 American Rescue Plan that made student loan forgiveness federally tax-free is set to expire at the end of 2025. Unless Congress acts, borrowers who receive debt cancellation under Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans will once again face a significant federal tax bill on the forgiven amount. The IRS typically treats forgiven debt as taxable income, meaning a borrower with an average balance of $57,000 could owe over $12,000 in taxes. Consumer advocates argue this policy is cruel, as it replaces one form of debt with another for financially struggling borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

The process of getting licensed everywhere was arduous and cost her $180,000, but the investment has paid off, as she earned over $870,000 last year.

          <p>As President Trump departed for a trip to Scotland, the controversy surrounding his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein intensified with new reports. The New York Times reported Trump's name appeared on a contributor list for a book celebrating Epstein's 50th birthday, corroborating earlier stories about his involvement. This comes as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche is meeting with the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell for a second day. Trump has denied the reports, sued the Wall Street Journal for libel, and deflected questions about a potential pardon for Maxwell, stating he hasn't thought about it.</p>

          <p>As global powers like China, India, and the Gulf States increase their investment and trade in Africa, Germany is being warned that it risks being left behind. German exports to the region have been stagnant for a decade, despite robust economic growth in many African nations. Business leaders and policymakers are calling for a strategic 'Africa turnaround,' arguing that Germany's reputation for quality and its focus on sustainable local partnerships could be a competitive advantage. However, practical hurdles and a prevailing narrative that perceives the continent as too risky are significant obstacles to increasing German economic engagement.</p>

Lawmakers are also reportedly discussing the deployment of the EU's 'anti-coercion instrument,' a powerful tool designed to deter economic pressure from other countries.

          <p>President Trump is intensifying his use of the legal system to punish media outlets, highlighted by a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch. The suit concerns a story about a suggestive birthday card Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. This legal action is part of a broader pattern in which Trump has sued or targeted numerous news organizations, dismissing them as 'fake news' and the 'enemy of the American people.' Media analysts see this strategy as an attempt to discredit critical reporting, warn other outlets, and control the public narrative.</p>

The proscription, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense, was enacted after activists damaged military aircraft. Turk argued that the UK's broad definition of terrorism misuses the term to encompass property damage that is already criminal under other laws.</p>
