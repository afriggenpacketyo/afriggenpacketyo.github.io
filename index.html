          <p>Amidst rising trade tensions with the United States, China is drawing parallels to the 1955 Bandung Conference, where Asian and African nations sought to build solidarity and promote a fairer international system. The Bandung Conference advocated for economic and political cooperation, decolonization, and a rejection of Cold War bipolarization. The U.S. attempted to undermine the conference, fearing it would strengthen China's influence and provide a platform for the Soviet Union. This historical context highlights China's current efforts to forge alliances and advocate for a multipolar world order.</p>
