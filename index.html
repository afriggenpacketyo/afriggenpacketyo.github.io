          <p>SoftBank's Vision Fund business reported a loss for the fiscal year ending in March, with investment gains slowing by 40% compared to the previous year. The Vision Funds notched a gain of 434.9 billion yen, a significant drop from the 724.3 billion yen recorded the year before. This downturn is attributed to a drop in the value of companies like AutoStore, despite gains from investments in Didi and Coupang. Investors are closely monitoring SoftBank's investment arm for signs of improvement amid market volatility and macroeconomic concerns, which have caused SoftBank's stock to fall by about 17% this year.</p>

          <p>An article explores why India struggles to produce top-tier footballers despite its dominance in cricket. While cricket boasts young stars and a well-structured system, football lacks role models and a clear pathway for talent development.

The Indian Super League (ISL) lags behind the Indian Premier League (IPL) in terms of revenue and commercial success, hindering clubs' ability to invest in player development.

          <p>The Reichsb√ºrger movement in Germany, composed of individuals and groups denying the legitimacy of the country's post-World War II Federal Republic, has drawn increasing attention from authorities. The movement adheres to debunked claims that the pre-war German Reich still exists and that the Federal Republic is a private company. While initially dismissed as harmless, the movement has shown a propensity for violence and far-right ideology, leading to increased surveillance and law enforcement actions. In 2022, authorities uncovered a plot to overthrow the government, underscoring the potential threat posed by the Reichsb√ºrger.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% in the January to March period. The number of employees on companies' payrolls fell in March and April, and job vacancy numbers also declined. While wage growth has slowed, it remains relatively strong, posing a challenge for the Bank of England's interest rate decisions. Increases in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage are believed to be contributing factors to the softening employment conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article examines the potential for public transportation to replace cars in cities worldwide, focusing on reducing air pollution and congestion. Some cities, like Tallinn, Estonia, have implemented free public transport, but results have been mixed, with ridership falling and car use increasing. Behavioral scientists emphasize the psychological aspects of car ownership, including status, pride, and comfort. Successful public transport systems, like TransJakarta, prioritize safety, comfort, and reliability. Cities are also exploring disincentives for car ownership, such as levies and congestion charges, and redesigning urban spaces to favor public transport.</p>
