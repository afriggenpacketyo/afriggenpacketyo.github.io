        <p>The House narrowly passed a government spending bill, preventing an immediate shutdown.  The bill now faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where Democrats are deeply divided on whether to support it or risk a government shutdown.  The bill includes increased military spending and cuts to non-defense programs.  House Speaker Mike Johnson secured passage with the help of President Trump, while some Senate Democrats are considering opposing the measure.</p>

        <h2>Trump Escalates Tensions with Canada, Threatening Statehood</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 20:12:48 EDT</div>

        <p>President Trump intensified his attacks on Canada, threatening further tariffs and hinting at making Canada a 51st state.  The threats followed a decision by Ontario's premier to impose a surcharge on electricity exports to the US, a decision that was later reversed. Trump's actions are linked to his belief that existing trade agreements do not sufficiently benefit the US.</p>
