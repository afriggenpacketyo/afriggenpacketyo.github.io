          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has launched its annual Fat Bear Week contest for 2025, inviting the public to vote for the largest brown bear preparing for hibernation. This popular event, which began in 2014, highlights the importance of bears gaining significant weight—up to 700 pounds—to survive the winter. Twelve contenders are vying for the title, with voting open online from September 23-30. The competition helps make the remote park more accessible and educates about bear health and resilience.</p>

          <p>An inexpensive, generic drug called leucovorin, typically used to treat chemotherapy side effects, is showing promise in helping nonverbal children with autism improve their speech. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, is leading research suggesting the drug bypasses a folic acid transport blockage in the brain linked to autism. The FDA has begun the approval process despite a lack of large-scale phase 3 trials, with preliminary evidence indicating substantial positive impact. Further research is needed to optimize dosing and identify the most responsive children.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered the transfer of eight federal inmates, whose death sentences were commuted by President Biden, to the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado. These individuals, convicted of heinous murders, are among 37 whose sentences Biden commuted, a move criticized for lacking proper vetting. Bondi aims to ensure their confinement conditions reflect the security risks of their crimes, with more transfers expected early next year. This action seeks to reverse aspects of the previous administration's criminal justice reforms.</p>

          <p>A former stylist for Sean "Diddy" Combs, Deonte Nash, has filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles, accusing the music mogul of sexual abuse, violence, sexual battery, human trafficking, and false imprisonment.

While these promising results are yet to be peer-reviewed and published, they offer hope for the 100,000 Americans affected by the condition.
