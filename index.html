          <p>Son Heung-min has announced his departure from Tottenham Hotspur after a decade with the club, a tenure that saw him become a fan favorite and a Premier League star. The South Korean forward, who joined in 2015, scored 173 goals and recently captained the team to a Europa League victory, ending the club's 17-year trophy drought. Teammates and club legends praise his on-field brilliance, including a Puskas award-winning goal, and his off-field generosity and character. His departure for a potential move to the MLS is seen as the end of an era for Spurs, leaving a significant legacy both at the club and in his home country.</p>

          <p>Australian cricketer David Warner has cast doubt on English batter Joe Root's potential performance in the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. Speaking while in England for The Hundred tournament, Warner pointed out that Root has never scored a century in Australia and is often dismissed by bowler Josh Hazlewood. Warner, who retired from international cricket last year, suggested that England's success hinges on their bowlers making an impact on Australia's top-order batters. The article also touches on Warner's positive reception from English fans during his last appearance, which he found touching despite their historic rivalry.</p>

          <p>As part of the Trump administration's focus on election integrity, the Department of Justice, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, is actively investigating state election practices. The DOJ's Civil Rights Division is seeking voter registration lists from various states to identify and remove noncitizens, an effort a DOJ source described as cracking down on noncompliance. While some states have cooperated, others, like New Hampshire, have rejected the data requests, and Orange County, California, is being sued for resisting. Critics, such as Senator Dick Durbin, argue these actions could disproportionately hinder the voting rights of minority communities.</p>

          <h2>New Comic Explores the Social Awkwardness of Receiving Compliments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new informational comic explores why many people feel awkward or uncomfortable when receiving compliments. According to social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao, a person's reaction to praise often reveals their underlying self-perception. Dismissing a compliment can not only reflect personal insecurity but also negatively affect the person offering the kind words. The researchers make a case for learning to graciously accept compliments, highlighting the social and psychological benefits of doing so. This piece aims to help readers understand the science behind this common social interaction and encourage more positive exchanges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A notable pattern has emerged in President Trump's second term, with world leaders increasingly using praise and flattery as a diplomatic tool. Examples include the UK Prime Minister presenting a rare second state visit invitation from the King and the Israeli Prime Minister nominating Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Analysts suggest this obsequious approach is a strategic shift from Trump's first term, as leaders now recognize his personal authority and believe flattery is necessary to secure favorable outcomes, such as trade deals and defense commitments. This contrasts with their previous attempts to work through his advisors, acknowledging that Trump alone is the ultimate decision-maker.</p>

The extreme heat, which saw temperatures reach 41.2°C in one region, is expected to persist through August, particularly in northern and western parts of the country. This record-breaking heat, coupled with lower-than-average rainfall, has also led to an unusually early end to the rainy season. Experts warn that this trend, driven by climate change, is impacting the nation's iconic cherry blossoms, causing them to bloom irregularly or not at all.</p>

The article highlights the profound human suffering, with families living on canned goods and children facing malnutrition, rendering diplomatic discussions on Palestinian statehood feel disconnected from their immediate struggle for survival.

          <p>President Trump has fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the agency released a jobs report showing significantly weaker growth than anticipated. The move, which Trump defended by claiming the data was "rigged," has drawn sharp criticism for politicizing a vital government statistical agency, with some comparing it to actions in authoritarian countries. This decision occurred as US stock markets fell, rattled by the weak employment figures and the economic uncertainty caused by Trump's escalating global tariff strategy. The labor market's deterioration is seen by some economists as a direct consequence of this uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

This pioneering study, published in the journal Cell, concludes that this ancient cross-breeding was the key evolutionary driver for the development of tubers.

This move has been described as a major strategic gambit that breaks with decades of U.S. military protocol, as the movement of nuclear assets has historically been kept secret except during extreme geopolitical crises like the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. The decision raises the stakes in the trial of strength between the U.S. and Russia, signaling a new level of overt posturing in their complex relationship and creating significant international concern.</p>

          <p>Amid a scorching summer that has fueled wildfires across Greece, Turkey, and other European destinations, travel experts are offering advice to concerned holidaymakers. While the UK Foreign Office currently deems travel to these areas safe, the situation remains volatile. Experts advise that standard travel insurance should cover cancellations or curtailments if official advice changes to "do not travel." However, if travelers choose to cancel a trip out of personal concern while it is still deemed safe, they are unlikely to be covered unless they purchased specific catastrophe coverage. The best course of action is to communicate directly with airlines, hotels, and insurers to understand bespoke options.</p>

          <h2>Kim Kardashian's SKIMS Launches Controversial 'Face Shapewear' Mask</h2>

          <p>Kim Kardashian's brand, Skims, has released a new product: a facial wrap marketed as shapewear for the face, intended to provide a "sculpted" jawline. The £52 mask, which sold out rapidly, is part of a growing social media trend of extreme bedtime beauty rituals. However, the product has drawn criticism and skepticism, with medical professionals stating there is no scientific evidence for its claims of lasting contouring effects, warning it may only offer temporary de-puffing. Critics also argue that such products fuel harmful beauty ideals and insecurities, particularly among younger consumers, by suggesting that natural facial features need to be 'fixed'.</p>

          <p>In response to growing user fatigue with endless swiping and messaging, the online dating industry is experimenting with new app formats. Companies are launching platforms that minimize pre-date chat to encourage in-person meetings, facilitate group dates, or cater to niche communities. This shift comes as major apps like Tinder and Hinge have seen a decline in UK usage, and lawsuits have accused them of using addictive features. The article explores a personal experience with an app that books dates directly, suggesting that while the new approaches may not guarantee a romantic spark, they can offer a more human and less draining alternative to the traditional online dating model.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's customs administration has tightened import regulations for durians from Vietnam after detecting contaminants that pose a serious health risk to consumers. The new rules mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and require all shipments to be accompanied by qualified test reports. Chinese authorities will now conduct "batch by batch" testing for the compound alkaline yellow and the metal cadmium, with any non-compliant fruit being returned or destroyed and the exporter suspended. This crackdown has already impacted trade, with the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China falling by approximately 45% in the first half of 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent EU-US trade deal, negotiated by Ursula von der Leyen, represents a disastrous capitulation to Donald Trump's coercive tactics. The authors contend that the agreement is economically one-sided, damages Europe's international credibility, and unwisely commits to massive EU investment in the US. They assert that von der Leyen was unprepared to reject the lopsided terms and that the deal was a result of pressure from specific member states and corporate interests. The piece calls for EU governments and the European Parliament to reject the current accord and renegotiate a more balanced agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla liable in a 2019 fatal crash, ordering the electric vehicle company to pay $243 million in damages to the victim's family and her injured boyfriend. The lawsuit argued that Tesla was partly responsible because its Autopilot technology failed to prevent the crash, which occurred after the driver became distracted looking for a fallen phone. The plaintiffs' attorney contended that Tesla irresponsibly marketed the system's capabilities without restricting its use to appropriate environments like highways. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, maintaining that the driver is solely responsible and that Autopilot is a driver assistance system requiring full attentiveness.</p>

          <p>Two Los Angeles County men who allegedly ran an illegal cannabis extraction operation have been charged with murder following the deaths of five of their workers in two separate incidents. Prosecutors state that four workers were killed in an explosion at a warehouse in Irwindale in 2023, and another died in a fire at a South El Monte lab a year later. The accused, Ted Chien and Han Quan Jiao, allegedly continued their illicit operations even after the fatalities. The district attorney described the case as a stark example of greed leading to deadly consequences in the unregulated cannabis market.</p>

          <p>HBO has announced that "And Just Like That...," the reboot of the popular series "Sex and the City," will end after its upcoming third season. Showrunner Michael Patrick King stated that as he wrote the final episode, it felt like a natural and wonderful place to stop the story. The series, which follows three of the original main characters navigating life in their 50s, has faced declining viewership and criticism over its attempts to diversify the cast. Star Sarah Jessica Parker shared that the role of Carrie Bradshaw has been a huge part of her life for 27 years and that this chapter is now complete.</p>
