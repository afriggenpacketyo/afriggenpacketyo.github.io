          <p>Amid escalating tensions in the Kashmir region, the Indian government has ordered the blocking of thousands of social media accounts and imposed restrictions on news portals, raising concerns about freedom of speech. The actions include blocking accounts of Pakistani journalists and news organizations, as well as Indian media outlets critical of the government. Press freedom activists have condemned these measures as censorship, particularly during a period of competing narratives and heightened security concerns. A recent report highlighted persistent challenges to press freedom in India, despite the country's slight rise in the World Press Freedom Index, with activists fearing further restrictions under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act of 2023.</p>

According to interviews with individuals close to both leaders, the two presidents communicate frequently via secure lines and personal calls, discussing strategic matters and offering support during difficult times. Macron's early support for Zelensky's campaign helped the Ukrainian leader gain credibility, and their bond has deepened since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.

          <p>A Nigerian Doctor Who fan, Adesoji Kukoyi, expressed his excitement about an upcoming episode set in Lagos, Nigeria, marking the first time the show is primarily set in Africa. The episode features a vibrant barber shop, a Lagos market, and a monstrous spider, possibly Anansi from West African folklore. Writer Inua Ellams suggests the Doctor's character aligns with Nigerian traits, but also considers why the show has rarely visited Africa in its 62-year history. The episode's setting is momentous, especially considering the unearthing of nine lost Doctor Who episodes from the 1960s in a Nigerian TV facility back in 2013.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has been implementing a strategy to make the world dependent on China's exports and know-how, aiming to counter foreign pressure and dominate global supplies. This involves increasing exports, deepening China's manufacturing base, and using economic tools like export controls and antimonopoly laws. While China still relies on the West for advanced technologies, its willingness to weaponize the supply chain challenges the supremacy of the United States. This rivalry may divide the world into competing spheres of influence, with countries pressured to choose sides, though the costs to China include strained relations with trading partners and economic challenges for its own citizens.</p>

          <p>Japan's former Emperor Akihito was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing medical tests for a heart condition. The 91-year-old was diagnosed with myocardial ischemia but showed no symptoms, requiring careful follow-up care. He had been admitted to the hospital after an earlier checkup detected signs of the condition. Akihito stepped down from the throne in April 2019, becoming the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in around 200 years.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years, slowly spiraling back towards Earth. Experts predict the re-entry will occur within the next few days, but the exact location of impact remains unknown. The spacecraft's protective heat shield increases the likelihood that it will survive re-entry and reach the surface partially intact.</p>

          <p>Fighting between India and Pakistan has intensified, with both sides targeting air bases and military sites, each accusing the other of initiating the attacks. Pakistan stated that India targeted its air bases with missiles, while India claimed it struck Pakistani military targets in response to drone attacks. The escalating conflict has prompted international alarm and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to de-escalate the situation. Both countries maintain they seek de-escalation, but the confrontation has only worsened since India conducted airstrikes in Pakistan.</p>

          <p>A South Korean temple returned a 14th-century Buddha statue to its Japanese owner after it was stolen in 2012. Buseoksa Temple claimed the statue was looted by Japanese pirates centuries ago, but ultimately handed it over to representatives from Kannonji Temple in Japan. The South Korean temple had displayed the statue for 100 days before its return. The decision follows a series of court rulings, including a Supreme Court decision in 2023, overturning an earlier order to transfer the statue to Buseoksa Temple.</p>
