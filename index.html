          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff issued an apology for his earlier remarks supporting President Trump's suggestion of deploying federal troops to San Francisco. His initial comments, made to The New York Times, faced significant backlash from local officials and leaders who asserted that federal intervention was unnecessary and that crime rates were declining. The controversy led to prominent investor Ron Conway resigning from the Salesforce Foundation board, citing misaligned values. Benioff's subsequent apology on X aimed to clarify his stance, emphasizing local leadership's responsibility for city safety.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court order that currently blocks the federalization and deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois. The Justice Department, through Solicitor General D. John Sauer, argues that the district court's decision oversteps the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief. This legal challenge comes after a U.S. appeals court upheld the deployment block but allowed the Guard to remain under federal service during ongoing legal proceedings. The situation highlights a significant constitutional dispute regarding federal versus state control over military forces.</p>

          <p>CBS News has ceased its over 60-year physical presence at the Pentagon, along with most major news organizations, due to new press requirements deemed restrictive. The Pentagon's new policy mandates formal authorization for publishing even unclassified information, which press associations argue infringes on First Amendment rights. CBS News chief national security correspondent David Martin highlighted the importance of in-person access for building trust and breaking stories. This move raises significant concerns about transparency and the public's access to information regarding military affairs.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including Duke of York, following discussions with King Charles III and the wider Royal Family. This decision comes after excerpts from Virginia Roberts Giuffre's posthumous memoir resurfaced her allegations of sexual assault by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, which Giuffre claims involved Andrew when she was 17. Andrew has consistently and vigorously denied these accusations, but acknowledged the ongoing scrutiny distracts from the Royal Family's work. He had previously stepped down from public duties in 2019 due to the scandal.</p>

          <p>Instagram's parent company, Meta, is implementing a new 'PG-13' content restriction system for all users under 18, aiming to display only age-appropriate content by default.

          <h2>Trump's Venezuela Policy Raises Concerns of Renewed US Meddling in Latin America</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive stance towards Venezuela, including authorized CIA covert operations and naval strikes against alleged narco-submarines, is sparking concerns about renewed US interventionism in Latin America. President Trump confirmed the CIA's activity, an unusual admission that fueled Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro's accusations of regime change attempts. This policy, driven by Trump's focus on Venezuelan migration and drug cartels, draws parallels to the US's checkered history of interventions in the region. Experts debate whether this represents a broader shift or a 'special case' driven by specific grievances and economic interests in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The New York Republican State Committee has suspended its Young Republicans group after a leak revealed racist and antisemitic messages, including racial slurs and jokes about gas chambers, within a group chat. The party chair, Ed Cox, condemned the 'vile language' and mismanagement, asserting such comments have no place in the organization. The scandal led to the firing of several members, including the group's former chair, who had joked about opponents going to the 'gas chamber.' This incident, alongside a similar disbandment in Kansas, highlights a broader issue of hate speech within some youth political groups.</p>

          <p>The Monterey Bay Aquarium has launched a highly successful fundraising campaign for sea otter conservation, inspired by Taylor Swift wearing a vintage 1993 aquarium T-shirt. After noticing a surge of $13 donations from 'Swifties,' the aquarium re-released eco-conscious reprints of the iconic sea otter shirt. The limited-time fundraiser, offering the shirt for $65.13, surpassed its initial goal within seven hours, raising nearly $2.2 million for marine conservation. This unexpected celebrity endorsement has brought a 'new era of support and awareness' to the aquarium's long-standing efforts.</p>

          <p>Nuclear submarines represent the pinnacle of advanced military technology, with only six nations—the U.S., China, Russia, France, the U.K., and India—employing them for propulsion. These vessels offer unparalleled submerged endurance, speed, and strategic capabilities for reconnaissance and attack missions, though they are generally louder and larger than traditional submarines. The article highlights some of the most impressive models, including the UK's Astute-class, Russia's Borei-A-class, and the US Virginia-class, detailing their unique features, armaments like Tomahawk missiles, and their critical role in global sea power and nuclear deterrence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices soared to a new record this week, topping $4,300 per troy ounce, as investors sought a 'safe haven' amidst deepening economic uncertainty. Factors contributing to the surge include the ongoing government shutdown, President Trump's trade wars and tariffs, and the prospect of lower interest rates. Silver also saw a significant percentage jump. While gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation and instability, critics caution against its volatility and note that sellers often profit most during anxious times. The demand from central banks and geopolitical tensions further fuel its appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI has accused Mahmoud Amin Ya’qub al-Muhtadi, a Louisiana resident, of participating in the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel and subsequently fraudulently obtaining a US visa.

He later denied terrorist involvement on his visa application and became a legal permanent resident. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that al-Muhtadi, now charged with visa fraud and conspiring to support a foreign terrorist organization, was located by the Joint Task Force October 7.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has seized survivors following a strike on a suspected drug-carrying 'narco-submarine' in the Caribbean, confirmed by President Trump as part of escalating actions against drug cartels. This incident marks at least the sixth strike in the region since September, bringing the death toll to at least 28. The survivors' legal status—whether prisoners of war or criminal defendants—remains unclear, raising questions about international law and human rights. Human Rights Watch criticized the attacks as potential extrajudicial executions, arguing the US is not in an armed conflict with Venezuela or criminal groups, and lethal force standards were not met.</p>

          <p>Faculty at the University of Texas at Austin are expressing deep concerns that entire liberal arts departments, particularly ethnic and regional studies, may be eliminated or restructured. This fear stems from the quiet appointment of a committee to review liberal arts programs and the new provost's manifesto, which criticizes 'identity-studies framework' and universities' 'ideological imbalance.' The situation is exacerbated by a new state law granting administrators near-absolute control over university governance. Faculty view these developments, alongside reports from conservative think tanks targeting such disciplines, as a hostile environment threatening academic freedom and diversity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed interest in a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, linking Russia and Alaska. Russian investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev suggested the project, estimated at $65 billion but potentially reduced to $8 billion with Musk's technology, could be completed in eight years. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy reacted negatively to the idea. The proposal follows a call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the Ukraine War.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current unpredictable economic climate, fixed annuities are highlighted as the safest option for investors seeking retirement security due to their guaranteed interest rates and protection from market volatility. These annuities function similarly to CDs, offering predictable growth, often in the 5-6% range, which is superior to traditional savings accounts. Multi-year guaranteed annuities (MYGAs) further enhance stability by locking in rates for the contract term, while single premium immediate annuities (SPIAs) provide guaranteed lifetime income, mitigating longevity risk. The article advises considering personal goals, time horizon, and issuer financial strength when choosing an annuity. (not investment advice)</p>

Democrats are wary that Trump could derail any agreement reached with Republican lawmakers, citing past instances where he publicly opposed bipartisan proposals. They are demanding an 'ironclad path forward' on key issues like Affordable Care Act subsidies, rather than a handshake deal. This political impasse highlights deep partisan divisions and a lack of faith in the President's willingness to honor agreements, prolonging the shutdown.</p>
