          <p>Coco Gauff triumphed over Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set match to win her first French Open women's title, becoming the first American to do so since Serena Williams in 2015 and securing her second major overall. The match, characterized by tension and momentum swings due to windy conditions, saw Sabalenka take the first set before Gauff rallied to win the next two. Gauff expressed gratitude to the supportive crowd and acknowledged her past struggles, while Sabalenka praised Gauff's performance despite the challenging conditions.

          <p>Zia Yusuf, who resigned as Reform UK chairman, is returning to the party in a new role leading the "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf initially cited that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time" as the reason for his departure. Reform leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf regretted his actions, attributing them to exhaustion from 11 months of hard work. Yusuf expressed his continued belief in Nigel Farage's leadership and his commitment to the party's goals; Yusuf's return comes after criticism of a party member's stance on banning the burka.</p>

The SPCA of Wake County removed the dogs, which were packed into cages and surrounded by waste, with many suffering from skin and dental issues.

Parliament voted to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer wrongly accused of treason, to the rank of brigadier general. The National Assembly also passed a law to recognize and compensate former returnees from French Indochina after the end of colonial rule in 1954. Additionally, a resolution was adopted addressing Haiti's "double debt" to France, calling for recognition, repayment, and reparations for Haiti.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough expressed his dismay at the damage inflicted on the world's oceans due to destructive fishing methods such as bottom trawling in an interview with Prince William. The interview took place ahead of the UN Oceans Conference, where countries will discuss ocean protection amidst threats from pollution, climate change, and over-exploitation. Attenborough emphasized the importance of the oceans and urged leaders to recognize their significance to global citizens. The UN aims to ratify the High Seas Treaty, seeking to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030, but concerns remain about the effectiveness of protected areas if practices like bottom trawling are not addressed.</p>

Gaines, who has become an activist against transgender athletes since tying with transgender swimmer Lia Thomas in a 2022 NCAA championship, recently targeted a high school team with a trans-athlete. Biles called Gaines a "sore loser" and suggested she should be "uplifting the trans community" instead of bullying them.

          <p>Immigration raids in downtown Los Angeles resulted in the arrest of dozens of people, leading to protests and clashes between demonstrators and federal agents. Federal agents targeted several locations, including a garment district business and a Home Depot, detaining individuals and using flash-bang grenades and pepper spray to disperse protesters. Service Employees International Union California President David Huerta was injured and detained while documenting a raid, sparking outrage from elected officials. The raids prompted condemnation from politicians, while the White House defended the enforcement of federal law.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal charges of conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said El Salvador agreed to release Mr Ábrego García after the U.S. presented it with an arrest warrant. The charges, dating back to 2016, allege he transported undocumented individuals between Texas and Maryland and other states more than 100 times, and transported members of MS-13. His lawyer called the charges "preposterous."</p>

          <p>Dave Ramsey warns that nearly 50% of Americans are making a significant mistake regarding Social Security, with many not saving adequately for retirement. Ramsey's research indicates that a large percentage of Americans are not actively saving for the future, which can lead to dire retirement prospects. Social Security benefits often replace only a portion of pre-retirement income, making it crucial for individuals to supplement their retirement savings. Ramsey advises creating a savings benchmark, aiming for a 15% savings rate, and investing in retirement accounts to secure financial stability in their golden years. (not investment advice)</p>

The university published a statement condemning such comments as a "tired and racist conspiracy theory," but Marya claims her posts never impeded her duties and were aimed at state policy and supremacist ideologies.

Merz has made something of a U-turn in Germany's policy toward Israel, criticizing Israel's actions in the Gaza war and saying they could no longer be justified as a legitimate fight against Hamas terrorism.
