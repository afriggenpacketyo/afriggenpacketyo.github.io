          <p>The Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) has agreed to disband after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a decision greeted with both celebration and questions. Political experts, such as Seren Selvin Korkmaz from IstanPol, believe this could fundamentally alter Turkey's political power dynamics, requiring parties to adapt their programs and discourse. The future of pro-Kurdish politicians in prison, like Selahattin Demirtas, remains uncertain, and discussions about the Kurdish issue within a constitutional framework are needed to create a more democratic model for Turkey. The fate of PKK members and the surrender of their weapons also remain unclear, with resistance to the group's dissolution existing within the PKK itself.</p>

Zelensky stated he is awaiting to see who Russia sends before deciding on Ukraine's next steps and urged strong Western sanctions if Putin rejects the meeting. The Russian delegation will be led by Vladimir Medinsky, a hard-line aide to Putin, with talks scheduled to begin on Thursday at the Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has issued a decree tightening immigration policies, drawing comparisons to the Trump administration's approach. The decree introduces stricter requirements for citizenship, mandating two years of uninterrupted residency or significant financial investment. It also mandates proof of income and clean criminal records for permanent residency applicants and eases the deportation process for migrants entering illegally or committing minor crimes. Furthermore, it charges foreigners for access to public healthcare and education, aiming to ensure the sustainability of the public health system. Critics fear these measures will undermine Argentina's tradition of openness to immigrants, while the government defends them as necessary to "make Argentina great again."</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom driven by pharmaceutical exports, particularly Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications like Wegovy and Ozempic. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a moderation in Denmark's economic growth from 3.7% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and 1.8% in 2026, due to anticipated weakness in export growth. However, the IMF notes that Denmark is shielded from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports because most Danish drug products are not produced in the country or crossing its borders. Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system, where the value is in intellectual property, and manufacturing is contracted to other countries.</p>

The government may release 100,000 tons of reserve rice monthly through July, adding to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. This action comes in response to a rice shortage caused by a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average cost of private school in the UK has risen by 22.6% in the last year, exceeding government predictions, following the introduction of VAT on fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) expects a decrease in private school applications due to the increased costs. The average termly fee for a day school in January was £7,382, including 20% VAT, compared to £6,021 last year. The ISC attributes the increase to a "triple whammy" of national insurance changes, the end of charitable business rates relief, and VAT on fees, while the government maintains that VAT is not the sole cause of the increase.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a tax bill to cut climate-related funding, reduce regulations, and prematurely phase out clean energy tax credits to fund President Trump's tax cuts. This legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, impacting renewable energy, manufacturing, and electric vehicles. The proposal includes streamlining permits for fossil fuels, rescinding Clean Air Act pollution funding, and allocating $2 billion to the strategic petroleum reserve. Environmental groups and renewable energy companies are lobbying against the cuts, arguing they are vital for supporting new industries and local economies, particularly in Republican districts.</p>

          <p>Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, numerous attempts to establish a lasting ceasefire in Ukraine have failed. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed new negotiations in Istanbul on May 15, but European leaders have rejected direct talks without an unconditional ceasefire. Previous agreements, such as the Budapest Memorandum and the Minsk agreements, have been repeatedly violated. Short-term ceasefires declared during the conflict have also collapsed amid accusations of violations from both sides.

Avoid being a novelty act, instead aiming for spectacular, inspiring, and slightly weird.
