          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a personal meeting in Turkey to discuss a ceasefire, amidst a series of proposals and counter-proposals between the two nations. This comes after U.S. President Donald Trump urged Ukraine to accept Russia's offer for direct talks in Turkey, while Ukraine and its European allies insisted on a 30-day ceasefire as a precondition. Despite previous rebuffs and a decree by Zelenskyy declaring negotiations with Putin impossible, Zelenskyy expressed hope that Russia is considering ending the war and is awaiting a clear answer regarding the ceasefire, which has been complicated by resumed Russian drone attacks and accusations of truce violations from both sides.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, currently detained at The Hague awaiting trial for crimes against humanity, is running for mayor of Davao City in Monday's midterm elections, which are seen as crucial for the Duterte family's political survival. The elections will decide the composition of the Senate, which will determine the fate of Vice President Sara Duterte's impeachment trial over accusations of plotting to assassinate President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and corruption. The unraveling of ties between Marcos and Sara Duterte has intensified the political stakes, with the election results potentially signaling the end of the Duterte family's dominance in Philippine politics, as other family members also vie for various positions.</p>

          <p>Bridgend council in Wales is facing criticism for a draft PowerPoint presentation intended for schools that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex, including the line: "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first." Although the council claims the slide was part of a draft and was removed following professional feedback, experts and politicians have raised concerns about why such material was deemed appropriate at any stage. The incident has sparked broader worries about the content of relationships and sexuality education in Welsh schools, with calls for greater transparency and government oversight of educational materials.</p>

          <p>Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has launched a joint leadership bid with Ellie Chowns, the MP for North Herefordshire, joining the race alongside deputy leader Zack Polanski.

Polanski is campaigning on a platform of building a "mass movement" to counter Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. The Green Party had its best-ever result in the 2024 general election, securing seats in four constituencies.</p>

          <p>A guest essay in the New York Times describes a growing student-led movement in Serbia challenging the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic. Sparked by corruption concerns following a train station collapse that killed 16 people, the protests have grown into the largest and most extensive movement in years, uniting diverse groups across Serbian society. Despite government attempts to quell the unrest through resignations and financial incentives, protesters are demanding accountability and early elections, employing non-hierarchical, horizontal decision-making. The movement faces challenges including government intimidation and police brutality, but continues to organize and seek international awareness.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as a gesture to facilitate a ceasefire agreement and humanitarian aid entry into Gaza, ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East. The Israeli PM's office said it had not committed to any ceasefire but only to a "safe corridor" for Mr Alexander's release, and that preparations to intensify fighting were still continuing, and the release of Mr Alexander had been made possible because of military pressure on Hamas. Negotiations between Hamas and the US are ongoing in Qatar amid reports of growing frustration within the Trump administration regarding Netanyahu's stance, while Israel plans to expand its offensive if no deal is reached by the end of Trump's visit.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion, primarily from Medicaid, to fund $4.5 trillion in tax breaks, touching off a major political battle over healthcare. Republicans claim they are eliminating waste and abuse through new work and eligibility requirements, while Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposals would reduce the number of people with healthcare by 8.6 million over the next decade. The plan faces uncertain prospects as some Republicans have expressed reluctance to support cuts to healthcare safety net programs, and Trump has previously vowed not to cut Medicaid.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan over Kashmir has ended days of intense hostilities, but experts believe it will take much more to address the long-term distrust between the two countries. While the US played a crucial role in mediating the ceasefire, analysts from both countries emphasize that the agreement does not guarantee enduring peace, with issues like terrorism and water security still posing significant challenges. Saudi Arabia and Iran also emerged as key mediators, leveraging their economic and diplomatic ties with both nations. Despite mutual accusations of violations, the ceasefire is expected to hold in the short term due to international pressure and the recognition of the costs of escalation.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its third system outage in less than two weeks, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. The latest incident involved a momentary failure of a backup air traffic control system, prompting a 45-minute ground stop to ensure the system was functioning properly. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the number of flights will be temporarily reduced to address the airport's problems, and a new line will be built to connect Newark directly to the Philly TRACON. Passengers expressed frustration with the ongoing disruptions, calling for a swift resolution to the issues.</p>

          <p>The Philippines is holding midterm elections amidst a growing feud between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte, with the results expected to significantly impact their political futures. The elections will determine over 18,000 positions, including seats in the Senate, which will decide on Duterte's impeachment trial for alleged high crimes and an assassination plot against the president. Meanwhile, Marcos is vying to advance his political and economic agenda, with the election outcome potentially influencing the succession in 2028. The elections are under tight security due to the history of violence in Philippine politics.</p>

          <p>Immigration into the UK has been a significant demographic change in the 21st century, with net migration consistently exceeding emigration since the mid-1990s. Despite various government efforts, including Brexit and the implementation of a points-based system, net migration figures have remained high. The Labour Party aims to buck this 25-year trend of rising legal migration, although the latest data is expected to show a significant fall in the calendar year 2024 due to a dramatic decrease in visas granted last year.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" aimed at restricting federal payments to abortion providers is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans, potentially sparking a rebellion within the party. The provision, which targets "large groups who provide abortion services," has raised concerns among moderate Republicans who question its definition and argue that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal funding for abortion services. With a narrow majority in the House, Republican leaders face the challenge of maintaining party unity as they seek to pass the spending bill.</p>
