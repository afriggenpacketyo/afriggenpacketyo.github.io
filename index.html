          <p>The Hamas-run civil defense reported that nearly 100 people, including children, were killed in a large-scale Israeli ground, air, and sea attack in northern Gaza. The Israeli military stated they were operating to locate and dismantle terrorist infrastructure sites and had eliminated several terrorists. Witnesses described intense bombing, artillery shelling, and the presence of tanks in Beit Lahia. This operation marks the largest ground assault on north Gaza since March, amidst growing concerns about a humanitarian crisis due to a prolonged blockade on aid, with a recent UN report warning of a critical risk of famine for Gaza's population. The attack comes after air strikes killed more than 120 people, mostly in the south, on Thursday. </p>

          <p>Nvidia clarified that it is not sending GPU designs to China for modification to comply with U.S. export controls, following reports of a potential research and development center in Shanghai. The company spokesperson stated that while CEO Jensen Huang discussed the possibility of a new center with Shanghai's mayor, production and design would remain outside China. The center would assess ways to meet U.S. restrictions while catering to the local market. The Financial Times initially reported that Nvidia was working on the R&D center to navigate recent U.S. export curbs. </p>

          <p>The University of Michigan's survey revealed a drop in consumer sentiment for May, falling to 50.8 from 52.2 in April, driven by increasing concerns that tariffs will lead to higher inflation. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3% from 6.5% the previous month, while long-term inflation expectations increased to 4.6% from 4.4%. The survey indicated that tariffs were spontaneously mentioned by nearly three-quarters of consumers, up from almost 60% in April, highlighting uncertainty over trade policy as a key factor affecting economic outlook. The survey was mostly completed before the U.S. and China announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs between the two countries. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a since-deleted Instagram post featuring the numbers "8647." Trump claimed Comey knew the numbers meant assassination and was aware of the implications. Comey denied the accusation, stating that he posted a picture of shells he found on a beach walk and did not realize the numbers were associated with violence, prompting him to remove the post. The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service reportedly opened an investigation into Comey's post. </p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being afraid to meet him in person, dismissing the Istanbul talks as a staged process and demanding new sanctions against Russia.

          <p>A new report indicates a growing gap between Americans' earnings and the income required for a basic standard of living, considering necessities, technology, education, and healthcare. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that a minimal quality of life is out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. LISEP's Minimal Quality of Life index captures the annual change in costs for low- and moderate-income households, revealing that while traditional economic indicators suggest a thriving economy, the lived reality for most Americans is one of economic distress. The report also suggests that the official unemployment rate significantly understates the level of economic distress around the U.S.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday, causing a complete shutdown of rail service and affecting Metro-North's west of Hudson service, impacting over 300,000 daily commuters. The strike stems from a dispute over pay raises, with the union claiming stagnant wages for five years amidst rising living costs. NJ Transit has suggested commuters work from home and is implementing a contingency plan with additional bus services on 19 routes, though this can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders.

          <p>A new report indicates that individuals and small businesses may face higher electricity rates as the costs of grid upgrades needed for large power users, such as data centers and factories, are spread across all electricity consumers. The report found that the payments from large energy users often do not cover the cost of the necessary equipment, leaving other customers or the utilities to bear the remaining expenses. This issue is exacerbated by the rapid growth of data centers and the increasing use of electric vehicles, straining existing power grids. Some states, like Texas, have policies to protect individuals from these higher rates, but most states do not.</p>

          <p>An Indian PhD graduate, Priya Saxena, who was facing deportation by the Trump administration, was granted an injunction by a federal judge, allowing her to remain in the country after receiving her degree. Saxena's student visa was terminated due to a minor traffic violation, which her attorney argued was not a deportable offense. The judge ruled that the Department of Homeland Security's actions appeared unlawful and were likely to cause Saxena irreparable harm. The Trump administration has been pursuing international students throughout the country, targeting them for minor infractions or pro-Palestinian activism.</p>

The company cited "recent market challenges" as a key factor in the change, with the board and Jørgensen agreeing that a CEO succession is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.

Robert F Kennedy Jr, famous for his unconventional views about medicine and his revelation that a parasite ate part of his brain, seemed to think it was strange that lawmakers were asking him about vaccines. Meanwhile, Trump is considering Dr Casey Means, who was nominated for US surgeon general last week. Means has got “Dr” in front of her name, which sounds promising, but she’s more of an influencer than a practitioner. In short: she wouldn’t be able to get a job as a doctor at your local hospital but she’s being considered for the role of “the nation’s doctor”. As for experience working in government? She doesn’t have any of that, either.</p>
