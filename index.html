          <p>A Bangladeshi air force training jet crashed into a school campus in Dhaka, resulting in at least 27 deaths and injuring over 170 people. The F-7 jet reportedly experienced a mechanical failure shortly after takeoff, with the pilot, who also died, attempting to steer it toward a less populated area. Eyewitnesses, including students and teachers, described the horrific scene of the plane hitting a building and bursting into flames at the end of the school day. The interim government has declared a national day of mourning for the victims, many of whom were children.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old Brooklyn man has been arrested and charged with arson in connection with a fire that destroyed 11 New York Police Department vehicles in June. The suspect, who has a history of arrests at pro-Palestinian protests, allegedly scaled a fence into a police lot and set the vehicles ablaze, causing an estimated $800,000 in damages. According to the criminal complaint, investigators found a lighter and sunglasses with the suspect's fingerprints at the scene.

          <p>A trial has revealed the disturbing details behind the murders of two men, Albert Alfonso and Paul Longworth, by Yostin Mosquera in London. The case exposed a complex relationship based on paid, extreme sexual content, which Albert filmed and shared online, apparently for profit. The court heard that Mosquera's motive was financial, as he attempted to transfer thousands of pounds from Albert's account after the killings. Mosquera brutally murdered both men, dismembered their bodies, and transported them in suitcases to Bristol, where he was apprehended.</p>

          <p>The historic Ryde Hotel in the Sacramento River Delta is mourning the apparent theft of most of its resident peacock flock. A guest witnessed men forcing a peacock into a cage, and a subsequent headcount revealed that only four of the several dozen birds remain. The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident as a felony, with the estimated value of the missing birds being thousands of dollars. Staff are concerned the peacocks may have been stolen for illegal fighting or the exotic animal trade, and they have installed additional security to protect the remaining few.</p>

          <p>National Archives documents reveal that former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothing while at 10 Downing Street. Between 2001 and 2002, Cherie Blair acquired over £75,000 worth of clothes for just £31,000, thanks to "wholesale" discounts negotiated by her personal shopper. The files show that Downing Street officials were concerned about the public perception and whether these benefits needed to be declared under a new ministerial code. Officials advised the Blairs to repay some of the discount, though it is unclear from the documents if this occurred.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis by property portal Zoopla, the average monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has risen by £221 over the past three years. This 21% increase has put significant pressure on tenants, with some forced to turn down job opportunities or seek financial help from parents. The sharp rise is attributed to high demand and a shortage of available rental properties. While the rate of increase is now slowing, particularly in major cities, more affordable areas are still seeing significant annual rent hikes, making it difficult for many to save for a home purchase.</p>

          <p>Recently circulated air-to-air images of China's J-35 stealth fighter provide strong evidence that the aircraft has entered production and is nearing operational readiness. The photos show two jets with official naval markings, including "Chinese navy" on the fuselages and "Flying Shark" insignia on the tails. Military analysts suggest the clear identification marks and serial numbers indicate the fifth-generation fighters are part of an initial production run. This development signals that the jets are likely being prepared for deployment on China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, marking a significant step in its naval aviation capabilities.</p>

          <p>The preliminary report on the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, has sparked controversy rather than providing closure. A key detail from the cockpit voice recorder indicates that both fuel-control switches were moved to "cut-off" moments after takeoff, causing a total loss of power. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he performed the cut-off, with the other denying it, leading to widespread speculation about pilot error or intentional action. Investigators and pilot associations have condemned the rush to judgment, urging patience until the final report is released in about a year.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 individuals from Afghanistan and Cameroon. This decision lifts a temporary block, allowing the administration to end the program that grants work permits and protection from deportation to people from countries deemed unsafe. While the court acknowledged that the plaintiffs have a plausible case, it found insufficient evidence to block the policy's implementation while the lawsuit continues.

This flurry of activity comes after the administration announced it would not release additional Epstein files, a move that angered some of his supporters.

These domestic protectionist policies have been a significant drag on their own economies. The piece suggests that the tariff crisis is acting as a catalyst for these nations to pursue internal reforms that could unlock significant economic growth by creating more unified domestic markets.

          <p>Musician Billy Joel has stated he is feeling "good" two months after revealing his diagnosis with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), a rare brain condition. Speaking on a podcast, the 76-year-old singer said he is still undergoing treatment and struggles with his balance. The condition, which involves a buildup of fluid in the brain, forced him to cancel a series of concerts for 2025 and 2026. NPH can affect mobility, vision, and hearing, and Joel is undergoing specific physical therapy as part of his recovery.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has initiated procedures to deport lawful permanent residents who are accused of supporting violent gangs in Haiti. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the move targets individuals who have collaborated with Viv Ansanm, an armed alliance controlling much of Port-au-Prince, which the Trump administration designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The announcement coincided with the reported arrest in Miami of a prominent Haitian businessman and former presidential hopeful. This policy is being enacted amid spiraling gang violence in Haiti that has caused thousands of deaths and widespread displacement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 200,000 pages of FBI records related to the surveillance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from his family. The release follows a presidential directive to declassify files connected to the assassinations of Dr. King, JFK, and Robert F. Kennedy. Dr. King's children issued a statement urging the public to view the files in the context of the FBI's historical campaign to discredit their father and the Civil Rights Movement. Some critics have framed the release as a distraction from current political controversies, including pressure to release files on Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer has highlighted four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase (dubbed "PARC")—that he believes will maintain their upward momentum, driven by strong interest from retail investors. He noted that these companies represent a "two-track market" where certain trendy names are relentlessly pursued by individual investors, sometimes disconnected from traditional metrics. While Cramer acknowledged these stocks are speculative, he suggested there is money to be made if investors remain disciplined and take profits. He believes their rally could continue until a wave of new IPOs increases market supply. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, making days marginally shorter and raising unique challenges for global timekeeping. This acceleration could eventually require the unprecedented removal of a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an event known as a "negative leap second." While leap seconds have been added in the past to account for a slower rotation, the current trend could disrupt computer systems and telecommunications that rely on precise time. Interestingly, scientists note that the melting of polar ice due to climate change is creating a counteracting drag, slowing the planet's rotation and delaying this adjustment.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of the Trump administration's relationship with the U.S. judiciary, arguing it is reshaping presidential power. The piece details how the administration has used a blizzard of executive orders to enact policy, leading to numerous legal challenges and a war of words against judges who rule against it. Recent Supreme Court decisions have emboldened the administration, curbing the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions against its policies. The analysis suggests this dynamic is creating an unprecedented assault on the judiciary and potentially altering the balance of powers.</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has filed a complaint asking the Department of Justice to investigate Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The complaint alleges that the university uses race-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, thereby violating civil rights laws and the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action. The group specifically criticizes programs aimed at increasing diversity in the medical field, arguing that competence must come first. This action is part of a broader conservative legal effort targeting DEI programs.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Kentucky police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. A jury found Hankison guilty of using excessive force by firing 10 shots blindly into her apartment. The sentencing judge rejected a recommendation from the Trump-led Justice Department for only a one-day sentence, a position that contrasted sharply with the previous administration which brought the charges. Hankison is the only officer to be convicted and sentenced to prison in direct connection with the raid.</p>
