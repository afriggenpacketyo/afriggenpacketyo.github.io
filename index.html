          <h2>Chinese Researchers Develop New Superalloy Technique to Advance Aircraft Engine Manufacturing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 21:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Dalian University of Technology have developed a new technique for rapidly cooling superalloy turbine discs during manufacturing. This breakthrough addresses a long-standing challenge in China's aviation industry, as the quality of these core components determines an engine's power, efficiency, and lifespan. The advancement could significantly improve the performance of homegrown aircraft engines, potentially resolving critical issues for China's current and future sixth-generation fighter jets, an area where the country has historically lagged behind Western nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to deny Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her sex-trafficking conviction. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Jeffrey Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have prevented her prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to Florida and did not have the authority to bind other federal districts, nor was Maxwell an intended beneficiary of the deal. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls.</p>

          <p>A man in Victorville, California, was arrested for allegedly filing a false police report after a prank involving a macabre teddy bear went awry. The bear, which appeared to be made of human skin, was left at a gas station, prompting a police and coroner investigation. Authorities determined the object was not made of human remains and later identified it as a prop created by a South Carolina artist. The suspect, Hector Corona Villanueva, was arrested for wasting valuable emergency resources with the hoax.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of firings at the Department of Justice under the Trump administration is complicating the criminal case against a Florida businessman accused of a $100 million fraud scheme targeting children with special needs. The lead prosecutor, Michael Gordon, was among those dismissed, prompting concerns from victims' families and a Democratic congresswoman that justice could be delayed or denied. Critics allege the firings are politically motivated retribution for roles in Jan. 6 and other Trump-related investigations, jeopardizing accountability for thousands of vulnerable victims.</p>

While droughts are natural, experts note that climate change and increased water usage are exacerbating the risk of shortages. A drought declaration allows water companies to implement their management plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans to conserve resources.</p>

          <p>Shares of major fintech companies like Block and PayPal rallied after experiencing a dip late last week. The initial drop was triggered by reports that JPMorgan Chase planned to charge data aggregators like Plaid for access to customer financial information, raising concerns about fintech business models. However, market analysts have since downplayed the risk, with firms like Evercore ISI stating the potential fees are "far from a 'business model-breaking' cost increase." This reassurance, coupled with broader market momentum, helped the sector recover its losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the second year in a row, homelessness has declined in Los Angeles County, with the estimated unhoused population dropping by 4% to 72,308 people in 2025. The data, from the annual point-in-time count, shows a 7.9% drop in unsheltered homelessness within the city of Los Angeles itself. Mayor Karen Bass and other officials credited programs aimed at resolving encampments and providing housing, stating that reducing homelessness is now a "trend." Despite the progress, the issue remains a humanitarian crisis, and the future of the agency conducting the count is uncertain due to budget changes.</p>

Lopez, who has been a starter for most of his career, stated he is willing to contribute in any capacity, including coming off the bench, to help the team pursue a championship.

Calhoun believes the current political climate, which she says is fueled by anti-trans rhetoric from politicians, contributes to such violence.

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, in his role as administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has drawn widespread criticism for his comments regarding recent cuts to the Medicaid program. During a Fox Business interview, Oz advised Americans at risk of losing their health care to "be vital" and "do the most that you can do" to stay healthy. He then offered the specific, and widely mocked, advice to "not eat carrot cake," which many interpreted as a trivializing and out-of-touch response to millions of people facing the loss of their health coverage.</p>

          <p>An article argues that Major League Baseball's annual Home Run Derby is diminished by the absence of its biggest power hitters, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge. Ohtani has cited the physical toll of the current format as his reason for not participating, having struggled in the second half of the season after his only appearance in 2021. The author suggests that MLB should be flexible and modify the rules, perhaps by limiting swings or focusing on distance, to accommodate its superstars. The piece contends that securing their involvement is crucial for the event's relevance and for maximizing the sport's exposure.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis in The Atlantic, President Trump's recent policy shift against Russia is motivated less by a new strategic vision and more by personal frustration and humiliation. The article posits that after months of having his calls for a ceasefire ignored, Trump felt that Vladimir Putin was making him look weak and like a junior partner. Putin's continued escalation of the war in Ukraine, despite Trump's direct pleas, reportedly insulted the president. This perceived defiance, rather than a newfound support for Ukraine, is presented as the primary driver behind the new threats of tariffs and weapons shipments.</p>
