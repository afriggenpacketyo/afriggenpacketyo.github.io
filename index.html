          <p>Russia launched one of its largest air assaults on Ukraine, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across several regions. The Ukrainian Air Force reported shooting down two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all drones, but the attacks underscore an escalation in violence despite ongoing cease-fire negotiations. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks and called for increased international pressure on Russia, while also reporting a major prisoner exchange between the two countries. The article details the devastation in multiple cities and the rising civilian death toll, highlighting the failure of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has committed to reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolishing the two-child benefit cap, policies they aim to fund by cutting net-zero projects and asylum seeker hotels. This announcement intensifies the policy divisions within Labour, as Prime Minister Starmer faces pressure from his own party to address these issues. The current winter fuel payment scheme restricts the top-up to only those receiving pension credit, while the two-child benefit cap affects approximately 1.5 million families. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the proposals as unaffordable promises, adding to the political debate surrounding these welfare policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American economy has demonstrated surprising resilience despite facing a series of shocks over the past five years, including a pandemic, recession, and trade war, leading some to call this period the "era of thrash." While uncertainty typically dampens investment and slows growth, corporate profits remain high, unemployment is low, and new businesses are flourishing. Experts attribute this resilience to factors such as the coronavirus crisis disrupting markets and government responses like near-zero interest rates and trillions in support to families and companies. However, there are concerns that the economy is becoming more vulnerable due to rising interest rates, high personal debt levels, and political instability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essayist examines the decline of young, white, male writers in contemporary literary fiction, noting a shift towards women and diverse voices dominating bestseller lists and critical acclaim. While men still publish a significant number of books, the prominence of young, straight, white men has decreased in recent years, raising questions about the perspectives being lost. The essayist suggests that the literary world may be less interested in straight male perspectives, while young male writers may be less interested in fiction, leading to fewer portrayals of toxic masculinity and complex male characters. Despite the privilege afforded to white men in the real world, the literary world may be prioritizing diversity, resulting in a rebalancing of voices and perspectives.</p>

For Hasselback potatoes, he recommends Yukon golds with olive oil, rosemary, and thyme, while Mexican street corn benefits from Katia cheese, mayonnaise, Mexican cream, and lime juice.

Critics are worried about potential conflicts of interest, foreign influence, and the impact on regulatory oversight of the crypto industry.

          <p>House Republicans are referencing Bill Clinton's 1996 welfare reform to justify work requirements in their proposed Medicaid cuts, despite evidence suggesting such requirements don't effectively encourage employment and often lead to loss of benefits due to paperwork burdens. Democrats are grappling with this invocation of a Democratic president to support policies that could result in millions losing healthcare coverage and food assistance. While Republicans argue these work requirements aren't cuts, critics point out that the approach contrasts with Clinton's emphasis on state support for child care and transportation to facilitate workforce participation.

          <p>A senior editor reflects on her enjoyment of Nathan Fielder's series, 'The Rehearsal,' which stages rehearsals to help people prepare for difficult moments. Initially hesitant due to discomfort with Fielder's previous work, the editor found the show to be thought-provoking and humorous, appreciating its exploration of comedy's potential to effect real-life change. The series pairs Fielder’s monotonous tone with outrageous conceits, but this time, the premise is staging “rehearsals” to help people prepare for difficult moments. Though he’s still cringey (and still allegedly misleading real people), he also poses questions about how comedy can effect real-life change, and reveals some insights about his own role in the entertainment industry’s worst impulses.</p>

          <p>A dermatologist discusses the increasing trend of younger individuals seeking "baby Botox" and other cosmetic procedures, expressing concern that they may not fully consider the long-term costs and maintenance required. The demand for these interventions is attributed to increased online presence and exposure to filtered images, leading to a heightened focus on perceived flaws. The doctor highlights the potential risks of unnecessary procedures, including psychological dependence and perception drift, where individuals continually seek minor tweaks until they appear unnatural. The article raises questions about the ethics of the cosmetic dermatology industry and the potential harm caused by incentivizing procedures that may not be medically necessary.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner declined to confirm whether the government plans to abolish the two-child benefit cap, despite reports suggesting Prime Minister Starmer's support for the move.

She also denied being behind a leaked memo proposing to "claw back" child benefit payments from wealthier families. The questions arise amid pressure from Nigel Farage, who pledged to scrap the cap if Reform UK gains power, and criticism from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who deemed the proposal unaffordable.</p>

          <p>The U.S. clean energy sector faces potential setbacks if President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" becomes law, as it would terminate key tax credits supporting solar and wind energy projects. This legislation could reverse the clean energy boom fueled by the Inflation Reduction Act, potentially resulting in job losses and increased electricity costs. Analysts predict a significant decline in clean energy deployment, with some projects facing immediate challenges due to restrictions on sourcing materials from foreign entities. While some Republican senators have expressed reservations about the bill, its passage could significantly impact the growth of renewable energy in the U.S. (not investment advice).</p>

Key evidence includes data from Read's car and the victim's phone, as well as testimony from medical and forensic experts.

While state officials maintain they cooperate with federal officials on immigrants who have committed crimes, the Trump administration views this as a way to enforce immigration laws in sanctuary jurisdictions.
