            <p>Kenan Malik argues that Donald Trump's attempts to impose political authority over academic life at Harvard University, by demanding viewpoint diversity through mandated hiring practices, are counterproductive. Malik critiques the idea of affirmative action for conservatives, suggesting it undermines scholarly objectivity and creates a pernicious form of identity politics. He contends that fostering a richer culture of debate requires encouraging intellectual engagement and freedom of expression, rather than enforcing political quotas. Ultimately, Malik suggests that true diversity of thought stems from the capacity to navigate different perspectives, not from state mandates or bureaucratic procedures.</p>
