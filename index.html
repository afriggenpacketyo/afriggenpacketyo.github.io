          <p>Poundland, the budget retail chain, has been sold for Â£1 to US investment firm Gordon Brothers by its owner, Polish firm Pepco, following struggles to compete with other discount stores and declining sales. The sale is part of a proposed restructure that could lead to the closure of up to 100 of its 825 UK stores. Despite the challenges, Pepco maintains that Poundland remains a popular brand with millions of customers annually. Barry Williams will continue to lead the business, which will operate under the Poundland brand in the UK and the Dealz brand in the Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland. The transaction aims to offload an unprofitable part of Pepco's business amid an increasingly challenging UK retail landscape.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new members to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), some of whom have expressed skepticism about vaccines, particularly those related to COVID-19. This decision follows Kennedy's removal of all 17 previous members of the ACIP, citing conflicts of interest. The new members include scientists, public health experts, and physicians, with varying degrees of experience in immunology, virology, and vaccinology. Some appointees have previously spread misinformation regarding COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA technology, while others have been critical of lockdown measures and promoted alternative approaches to managing the pandemic. The ACIP is scheduled to convene between June 25 and June 27 to discuss recommendations for several vaccines, including HPV and COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

          <p>Council tax in the UK is projected to rise by 5% annually to fund local services, according to documents in the Spending Review, with additional increases expected to support police funding. Local authorities have the discretion to raise taxes up to this cap, with the Spending Review assuming they will maximize this allowance. Chancellor Rachel Reeves clarified that councils are not obligated to impose the full 5% increase, which is intended to fund social care and policing. These increases come amid rising household bills, placing additional financial strain on residents, as local services ranging from social care to waste management are funded through council tax.</p>

Fetterman's message has garnered support from both sides of the aisle, with Republican Sen. Dave McCormick (R-PA) expressing agreement with his colleague's sentiments. This follows Fetterman's earlier statement emphasizing the importance of condemning violence and destruction, even amidst support for free speech and peaceful demonstrations.

          <p>The UK economy experienced a sharp contraction of 0.3% in April, according to data from the Office for National Statistics, following a 0.2% growth in March. This decline is attributed to the introduction of global trade tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump and domestic tax increases, which have created uncertainty for businesses. Goods exports to the United States saw the largest monthly fall on record due to the new tariffs, particularly impacting industrial production and services output. The UK faced a 10% "reciprocal tariff" from the U.S., while EU exports were hit with a 20% levy; however, Britain has since negotiated a trade deal with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning jazz drummer Terri Lyne Carrington is paying tribute to Max Roach with her album "We Insist 2025!", revisiting his 1961 album "We Insist!". The project is more than a musical tribute, reflecting on issues of inequality and racism that Roach fought against, which remain prevalent today. Carrington has called on the younger generation to help share her vision, including vocalist Christie Dashiell and trombonist Julian Priester, who appeared on Roach's original work. She hopes the record will introduce new fans to Roachâ€™s legacy and revive the soul of protest music, with plans to collaborate with Roach's son on future shows.</p>

          <p>The classic western drama "Gunsmoke," which concluded its 20-year run on CBS in 1975, has found renewed success as a streaming hit. The series has twice ranked among Nielsen's top 10 most-streamed acquired series, demonstrating the enduring appeal of vintage titles in the digital age. "Gunsmoke" is available on Paramount+ and Peacock, but it gets the bulk of its audience from Pluto TV, Paramount Global's free advertising-supported streaming service. The show's success reflects a trend of audiences seeking familiarity and comfort during uncertain times, as well as the appeal of a hero with a strong moral compass.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson's unreleased rap song, "Smart Girls," was intended to be a centerpiece of his Sire Records album "Sweet Insanity," but became a reason for the album's shelving. The song, produced by Matt Dike, aimed to uplift women in contrast to the negative portrayals in many rap songs at the time. Despite Wilson's initial enthusiasm, the album was rejected by Sire, and "Smart Girls" remained unreleased, circulating among fans through bootlegs. The song reflects Wilson's openness to experimentation and his willingness to collaborate with hip-hop producers, even if the results were unconventional.</p>

          <p>A group of 105 South Korean citizens is suing former President Yoon Suk Yeol for emotional damages related to his declaration of martial law, which sent special forces soldiers to occupy the National Assembly. The lawsuit demands compensation of 100,000 won ($73) for each plaintiff, arguing that Yoon's actions violated their basic rights and caused mental harm. The suit is largely symbolic, representing a final rebuke of Yoon, who was previously impeached. The success rate of emotional damages claims against former presidents is low, but the plaintiffs argue that Yoon's actions directly threatened people's right to life, drawing on South Korea's history with authoritarianism.</p>

In contrast, the recent protests are more limited in scope, with Mayor Karen Bass emphasizing that there is no need for federal troops. A key distinction is the lack of bipartisan coordination between local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, as the Trump administration deployed troops without the governor's request.</p>

The Mixteco Indigena Community Organizing Project (MICOP) reports at least 35 people detained, with federal agents targeting fields and packinghouses. California's agricultural sector, heavily reliant on undocumented labor, faces potential disruption, with concerns about food rotting in fields and rising grocery prices. While some farm owners refused access to agents without warrants, undocumented workers remain vulnerable on their way to and from work, prompting community leaders to urge families to stay home and seek legal assistance if detained.

Protests, often rooted in perceived denials of civil rights or safety, can leave emotional scars on both protesters and those protested against. Feelings of frustration and despair can persist, especially when violence is involved, and research shows increased rates of depression and PTSD in affected communities. The militarization of communities in response to protests can be detrimental, and while dissent is vital for a healthy democracy, the psychological toll of constant unrest is significant.

While extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may prevent economic pain, it is unlikely to unleash significant new growth. The bill also includes various tax breaks and spending hikes that are not pro-growth, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates it will add $2.4 trillion to the national debt. The drag from tariffs is expected to outweigh any modest benefits from the tax cuts, and true pro-growth reform would extend tax provisions while limiting the debt impact by cutting wasteful spending.

          <p>Retired figure skater Mao Asada, who won silver for Japan at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, is embarking on a full-time coaching career. The 34-year-old hopes to train some of the sport's future stars at her school, the Kinoshita MAO Academy, which is scheduled to open on Aug. 1. Asada, a three-time world champion, has stayed active, performing in ice shows since retiring from competition in 2017. The school has been developed with the backing of the Tokyo-based Kinoshita Group, which operates construction and nursing care businesses.</p>
