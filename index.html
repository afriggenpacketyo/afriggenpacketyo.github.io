          <p>Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a Homeland Security briefing in Los Angeles after interrupting Secretary Kristi Noem's update on immigration enforcement. Video footage shows Senator Padilla struggling with Secret Service agents before being dragged out of the room and placed in handcuffs. The incident sparked immediate condemnation from fellow Democratic members of Congress, who called the arrest a "sickening disgrace" and an "affront to democracy". The Trump administration defended the action, stating that Padilla lunged at Secretary Noem and did not comply with officers' commands. The senator said he was already in the federal building for a meeting and wanted to ask questions regarding immigration policies. The incident has raised concerns about the treatment of protesters and political opposition. </p>

          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, prompting retaliatory drone attacks from Tehran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced "Operation Rising Lion" aimed at rolling back Iran's nuclear capabilities and eliminating security leadership. Iran responded by launching over 100 drones at Israel, which Israel claimed to have largely intercepted. The exchange of fire has disrupted international air travel in the region, with Dubai International Airport reporting cancellations and delays. The United States was not involved in Israel's strikes, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests or personnel. The attacks have also cast doubt on the future of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks. </p>

          <p>Tyrese Haliburton of the Indiana Pacers has transformed from a bench player at the Olympics to a clutch performer in the NBA Finals. His late-game heroics have been instrumental in the Pacers' success, with game-tying or game-winning shots in every round of the playoffs. Haliburton's ability to deliver in critical moments has earned him nicknames like "The Haliban," though the NBA is attempting to promote the moniker "The Moment" instead. Despite past criticisms and doubts, Haliburton's confidence and skill have propelled the Pacers to within two wins of their first NBA title. </p>

This move comes as Huawei faces US sanctions that have restricted its access to American technology.

          <p>The price of Obamacare plans could surge next year as extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic are set to expire. Without these enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise significantly, potentially more than doubling in some states. Low-income enrollees would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums, while middle-income enrollees may no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Experts warn that letting the enhanced subsidies expire could increase the number of uninsured Americans by millions and destabilize the insurance marketplace. </p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has overhauled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccine advisory panel, raising concerns among immunization specialists. Kennedy dismissed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and replaced them with individuals who have criticized government policies on COVID-19 and mRNA vaccines. The ACIP plays a crucial role in determining which vaccines are recommended for children and adults, affecting insurance coverage and access to free vaccines for low-income children. Experts fear the new committee's skepticism towards vaccines could lead to downgraded recommendations and reduced access for families. </p>

          <p>Israel launched a significant air campaign on Iran, targeting military leadership and nuclear infrastructure, leading to swift retaliation from Iran. Explosions rocked Tehran as Israeli warplanes struck over 100 sites, including nuclear facilities and ballistic missile factories. Iranian state media confirmed the deaths of top military leaders and nuclear scientists. The attacks have raised fears of a full-scale regional conflict involving the U.S., prompting airspace closures and flight cancellations across the region. </p>

          <p>India is seeking to develop its domestic rare earth element (REE) supplies to reduce reliance on China. Experts believe India could become an alternative to China in the REE sector with increased public and private investment. The move comes in response to recent restrictions on REE exports from China, which have impacted manufacturers globally. India possesses substantial REE reserves, ranking third-largest globally, and aims to leverage its government-owned company, Indian Rare Earths (IREL), to boost production.

          <p>DW's Iran expert, Theresa Tropper, discusses how regular Iranians might react to the recent Israeli strikes. She notes that the strikes hit wealthier areas of Tehran, potentially causing civilian casualties. While many may not mourn the deaths of senior military commanders, attacks by a foreign state on residential areas could evoke a different response. Tropper suggests that Iranians may feel defenseless due to Iran's weak air defenses and lack of strong allies, leading to a sense that the regime is primarily interested in its own survival. </p>
