          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 18:11:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Florida Supreme Court has upheld a controversial congressional map, rejecting challenges that it diminishes the influence of Black voters. The decision solidifies a map championed by Governor Ron DeSantis, which dismantled a district where Black voters consistently elected their preferred candidate. Critics argue this ruling significantly weakens the state's Fair Districts Amendment, which was designed to prevent gerrymandering and protect minority voting rights. This outcome is seen as a major victory for Republicans, potentially making it easier to draw partisan maps in the future.</p>

          <p>Nine-time NBA All-Star Damian Lillard is reportedly finalizing a three-year, $42 million contract to return to the Portland Trail Blazers, the team where he played for 11 seasons. The deal is said to include a player option and a no-trade clause, signaling a strong commitment from both sides. This reunion comes after Lillard was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks, where he spent one season. Despite being expected to miss the upcoming season while recovering from Achilles surgery, Lillard chose to return to Portland, where his family resides, over offers from other contending teams.</p>

          <p>A Mexican woman residing in Los Angeles without legal status has been federally charged with conspiracy and making false statements after allegedly faking her own kidnapping. Authorities state that Yuriana Julia Pelaez Calderon orchestrated the hoax, which involved claims of being abducted by men dressed as ICE agents, to solicit thousands of dollars in donations through a GoFundMe campaign. The Department of Justice reported that an investigation uncovered inconsistencies, including surveillance video showing her leaving calmly and phone records contradicting her story. The case has drawn attention to the resources diverted from genuine law enforcement activities.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has suspended Diane Abbott, the UK's longest-serving female MP, pending an investigation into her recent comments about racism. The suspension follows a BBC interview where she reiterated controversial views, suggesting that racism against Black people is distinct from and more overt than prejudice faced by Jewish or Traveller communities. Abbott defended her comments as "factually correct" and claimed the party leadership wants her out. The move has sparked debate within the party, with some colleagues defending her right to discuss different forms of racism while others condemned her remarks.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has recommended a sentence of just one day in prison for Brett Hankison, the former Louisville police officer convicted of excessive force in the 2020 raid that killed Breonna Taylor. Hankison fired ten shots into Taylor's apartment, though none struck anyone inside. Attorneys for Taylor's family condemned the recommendation as an "insult" and a "betrayal of the jury's decision," arguing it sends a message that officers can violate civil rights with impunity. The final sentencing decision rests with a federal judge and could still result in a multi-year prison term.</p>

The proposal has been met with strong opposition from California leaders, including San Francisco's mayor and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who criticized it as a costly and impractical plan.

According to a report from the China-Brazil Business Council, this shift reflects China's strategy to diversify its sources for strategic minerals and the broader ripple effects of U.S.-China trade tensions. Analysts suggest that as Washington and Beijing impose stricter trade barriers on each other, emerging economies like Brazil are absorbing the impact and seeing their trade patterns rerouted.

The lawsuit claims the NCAA's decision will cost him a substantial NIL contract and a crucial opportunity to enhance his professional prospects.

          <h2>Explaining Chronic Venous Insufficiency, the Vein Condition Diagnosed in President Trump</h2>

          <p>Following the White House's announcement of President Trump's diagnosis, this article explains chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). The condition occurs when veins in the legs struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing blood to pool and leading to symptoms like swelling, achiness, and varicose veins. CVI is common in older adults, and risk factors include age, blood clots, and being overweight. While the condition itself is often benign, doctors must first rule out more serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart or kidney disease, typically using ultrasound exams to confirm the diagnosis.</p>

          <p>A major data breach has compromised the secret personal data of over 100 British officials, including members of the SAS special forces and MI6 intelligence agency. The leak occurred when a database of nearly 19,000 Afghan resettlement applications was inadvertently emailed to an unauthorized individual in 2022. This information, which also put thousands of Afghan allies at risk of Taliban reprisal, was kept secret by a court injunction until recently. The UK's Ministry of Defence acknowledged the "serious departmental error," which has forced the government to create a costly and covert resettlement route for those affected.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after he experienced swelling in his legs. A memo from the White House physician described the condition as "benign and common" in people over 70 and confirmed that more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis were ruled out. The announcement came after days of public speculation fueled by photographs showing bruising on the president's hand and swollen legs. The press secretary attributed the hand bruising to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use, stating that the president remains in "excellent health."</p>

The creation of the robotic figure has been a topic of curiosity and controversy, with some, including Disney's granddaughter, questioning whether he would have wanted to be immortalized this way.

Cleary was extradited from France earlier this year to face the charges after a decade-long effort by Keeler to see the case prosecuted.

          <p>Calls from some Trump allies to appoint a special counsel for the Jeffrey Epstein files face a significant political and legal hurdle: top Justice Department officials have a history of arguing that such appointments are unconstitutional. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy AG Todd Blanche, and other senior leaders were instrumental in developing the legal arguments that successfully challenged special counsel Jack Smith's authority in a case against Trump. This history makes it highly unlikely they would reverse their stance to appoint an independent prosecutor for the Epstein case, a move that President Trump himself has also indicated he would not recommend.</p>
