          <p>Russia has launched extensive overnight missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's capital, causing significant power and water supply disruptions in Kyiv. The strikes, which injured nine people in the city, are part of a broader escalation targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure across the country. A separate drone attack in the Zaporizhzhia region resulted in the death of a seven-year-old child, as Ukrainian officials accuse Moscow of deliberately trying to demolish the nation's energy grid.</p>

The legislation, part of the annual defense policy bill, is intended to bolster American competitiveness in key technology sectors.

          <p>A powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake has struck off the coast of the southern Philippines, resulting in at least two fatalities and causing significant damage to infrastructure, including a hospital and schools. The quake, which originated in the Philippine Trench, prompted initial tsunami warnings and evacuations in coastal areas, though the warning was later canceled after only small waves were detected. The event has compounded the challenges for the nation, which is still recovering from a recent deadly earthquake and is frequently impacted by severe natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Facing significant political turmoil and instability, France is being compared to Italy as "Europe's new bad boy," prompting discussions about the possibility of appointing a technocratic government. President Emmanuel Macron is expected to name a new prime minister to break the political deadlock, with suggestions that the appointee should be disconnected from the 2027 presidential race to focus on solving the country's immediate problems. This approach, similar to models used in Italy, could help reassure investors but may face resistance from a French public accustomed to passionate political engagement.</p>

          <p>The chief spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department, Jennifer Forkish, has resigned from her position following accusations from the acting U.S. Attorney that her office was leaking information to the media. Forkish has categorically denied the allegations, stating the claim was never discussed with her and is entirely false. Her departure was reportedly requested by LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, with sources suggesting that pressure from the U.S. Attorney's office regarding a leak about a press conference may have been the final catalyst.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Drake against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's hit song "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the song's lyrics, which accused Drake of serious misconduct, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a highly publicized rap battle and would not be taken as verifiable facts by a reasonable listener. Drake had sued the record label for allowing the song's publication, but the court's decision marks a significant moment in one of modern music's most infamous rivalries.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois, including the city of Chicago. The administration had ordered the deployment to protect federal facilities and personnel from what it termed violent protesters, but local officials argued the move was an unnecessary escalation. The judge stated that allowing the troops would "add fuel to the fire" and expressed doubt about the federal government's narrative, suggesting the action was rooted in political animus toward the state's Democratic leadership.</p>
