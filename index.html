          <p>England's goalkeeper Mary Earps has announced her retirement from international football just weeks before the Lionesses begin their European Championship defense. The 32-year-old played a vital role in England's Euro 2022 victory but had recently lost her starting position. Earps made 53 senior appearances over eight years, winning the 2023 Women's Finalissima and reaching the 2023 Women's World Cup final. She expressed that this is the right time for her to step aside and allow the younger generation to thrive, while also rooting for the team to win again this summer.</p>

          <p>Sri Lankan authorities have seized a large quantity of synthetic cannabis, with the majority allegedly found in the suitcases of a former flight attendant from England. The 21-year-old British woman, identified as Charlotte May Lee, was arrested on May 12 with over 100 pounds of the drug, known as kush. Lee claims the drugs were planted in her luggage at a hotel in Bangkok and denies any knowledge of them. Two other men, one from India and one from Thailand, were also arrested in separate cases for attempting to smuggle kush into the country; all three suspects could face life imprisonment if convicted.</p>

          <p>Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina, has voiced agreement with President Trump's assessment of Vladimir Putin as "crazy," while advocating for stronger support for Ukraine. Wilson called for secondary sanctions and arms support for Ukraine to help them repel Russia's invasion. This statement follows Trump's Truth Social post where he also criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, urging him to stop causing problems. Wilson's support for Ukraine is part of a bipartisan effort, with a coalition of senators supporting sanctions measures, as Zelenskyy also advocates for increased sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Ten people sustained minor injuries in eastern Tokyo after explosions occurred at a construction site, potentially due to a gas leak. Gas was detected at the site in Edogawa Ward, where a fragment of a gas cylinder was recovered, with police suspecting workers struck the cylinder during piling work. An emergency call reported the sound of explosions around 9:35 a.m., resulting in a service vehicle catching fire and damage to approximately 40 buildings. The affected area extended up to a 100-meter radius from the site, located near Tokyo Metro's Kasai Station.</p>

          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. increased by an estimated 76% in April year-on-year, while shipments from China fell by about 76%. This surge reflects Apple's efforts to diversify its manufacturing base amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China. However, analysts predict that this growth may plateau due to limitations in India's manufacturing capacity. The Trump administration's tariffs continue to impact iPhones imported from China, while iPhones from India face a lower baseline tariff rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Higher beef and fresh produce prices have pushed UK food inflation up for the fourth consecutive month, reaching an annual high, according to industry data. Food prices increased by 2.8% in the year to May, up from 2.6% in April, according to the British Retail Consortium. The increase is attributed to shops passing on the costs of higher minimum wages and increased employer National Insurance contributions. The price of beef has risen to record levels due to strong demand and lower supply, with the industry struggling to keep up with the demand.</p>

          <p>Robert Reich argues that the Republican budget bill contains a hidden provision that would significantly weaken the power of federal courts, potentially allowing Trump to act without restraint. This provision would block courts from using contempt to enforce their orders, making injunctions unenforceable and effectively ending American democracy. Reich contends that this measure would remove the last remaining constraint on Trump, preventing Congress and the courts from stopping him. The measure is viewed as a way to keep the Trump administration from being restrained when it violates the Constitution or otherwise breaks the law.</p>

          <p>Abigail Leonard's new book, *Four Mothers*, compares the experiences of mothers in Japan, Kenya, Finland, and the US, revealing significant disparities in support systems. The US is the only wealthy nation without national paid leave, and childbirth costs are significantly higher compared to other countries. Leonard argues that pronatalist policies, aimed at increasing birth rates, are not the same as being pro-woman, emphasizing the need for extensive support like affordable maternity care and childcare. The book highlights how government policies greatly affect parents' lives, making parenthood much harder in the US due to privatization and limited government aid.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio, in his new book, warns that Donald Trump's policies are similar to those of far-right regimes in the 1930s, accusing Trump of seeking to expand executive power. Dalio notes that Trump is acting like a chief executive without a board, bypassing other branches of government, and concentrating power through executive orders. He also condemns the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures, predicting they will have negative consequences and lead to resistance. Dalio suggests that Trump's strongman style is a symptom of America's polarized politics and recommends regularly checking on the well-being of those in the bottom 60% of the population.</p>

He notes that the superintendent's responsibilities have been reduced over the years, focusing more on technical administration than direct oversight of schools. Newman contends that appointing an experienced administrator would improve accountability and coordination between the executive branch and the Legislature. He suggests that this change is needed to address California's lack of progress in improving learning conditions and student outcomes, despite increased per-student spending.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in the United States, was rapidly carved 2.1 million years ago when a shifting landscape in Idaho caused a giant lake to overflow. Researchers analyzed ancient river sediments found inside caves within the canyon. The findings indicate the canyon emerged when a huge lake in present-day Idaho drained away, leading to a "fill and spill" episode. This makes Hells Canyon younger than the Grand Canyon, whose youngest stretches are about 5 million years old.</p>
