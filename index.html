It breaks down the differences between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC). While initial monthly payments may be similar, the key distinction is stability versus flexibility; a loan offers a predictable payment, whereas a HELOC's payments can change with market interest rates over the life of the credit line.
