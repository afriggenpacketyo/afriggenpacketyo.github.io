          <p>Elon Musk stated that while he is a strong ally of President Trump, he is hesitant to fully endorse all of the administration's policies. Musk, who recently concluded his four-month tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), expressed concerns about the GOP's multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, which he believes undermines DOGE's work. He acknowledged that DOGE became a scapegoat for budget cuts, whether real or perceived, and that he felt stuck between supporting the administration and disagreeing with certain policies. Musk emphasized his disappointment with the massive spending bill, which is projected to increase the U.S. debt. </p>

Goals from Lucas Sanabria and Joseph Paintsil provided a much-needed boost for the defending league champions, who have struggled this season. Coach Greg Vanney expressed relief and pride in his team's resilience, emphasizing their commitment throughout the match. Despite the win, the article suggests caution, noting that Real Salt Lake is also facing its own crisis, and the victory may not necessarily indicate a significant turnaround for the LA Galaxy. </p>

These short-term instruments offer stable yields with less volatility compared to longer-duration bonds.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the Trump administration's tariff policies, asserting that while some companies have announced price hikes, others will choose not to. He cited companies like Home Depot and Amazon that have indicated they will not pass on tariff costs to consumers. Bessent emphasized that the White House's intention is to "de-risk" from China, not to "decouple," and defended the trade stance as essential to national and economic security. Despite retailer concerns about potential price increases, Bessent argued that companies often present worst-case scenarios to mitigate legal risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three large wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearing containment after burning for several weeks. Firefighters have made significant progress since the fires began around May 12, leading to the lifting of all evacuation orders on Memorial Day. Despite the progress, the entire state of Minnesota remains under an air quality alert due to lingering smoke. Interactive maps from the National Interagency Fire Center provide updated information on the extent of the fires, which have collectively covered approximately 30,000 acres.</p>

          <p>David Challen successfully campaigned to free his mother, Sally Challen, from prison after she killed his father, Richard, with a hammer. Sally had suffered decades of coercive control by her husband, which had become "normalised" within the family home. A law passed in 2015, which recognises psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse, helped secure Mrs Challen's release from prison after she had been jailed for life for murder in 2011. David now uses his experience of "intergenerational trauma" to help others, with a book telling the family's story being released on Thursday.</p>
