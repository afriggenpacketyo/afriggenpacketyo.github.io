          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.1% in May, below economists' expectations, with the annual inflation rate at 2.4%. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also showed a 0.1% increase, raising concerns among Federal Reserve officials about the potential impact of tariffs on inflation. Energy prices decreased, while vehicle and apparel prices declined, offsetting increases in food and shelter costs. Despite the modest inflation figures, some economists caution that tariff-driven price increases may still materialize in the coming months, and the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates until at least September as they evaluate the tariff impact.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance echoed President Trump's call for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates following a Bureau of Labor Statistics report showing modest inflation increases. Vance stated that the Fed's refusal to cut rates is "monetary malpractice," aligning with Trump's view that easing monetary policy is necessary. The report indicated a 0.1% increase in the consumer price index, with annual inflation levels at 2.4% and 2.8%, both above the Fed's 2% target.

The article compares national average CD rates with top CD rates available from online banks and credit unions, noting that short-term CDs often have higher interest rates due to the inverted yield curve.

          <p>The article examines the debate surrounding President Trump's proposed tax and immigration bill, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and its potential impact on the national debt. Elon Musk and some Republican budget hawks have criticized the bill, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating it would add $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The White House disputes the CBO estimate, while experts emphasize that the score is based on the bill as written and doesn't account for potential extensions of spending and tax provisions. Experts warn that the rising national debt could lead to increased interest rates, bond market issues, and slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

HELOC rates are tied to the Prime Rate, which closely follows the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate, while home equity loans connect more to the bond market and broader economic conditions. Experts advise homeowners to understand their borrowing purpose, consider their home sale timeline and long-term goals, and ensure they can handle the payments. The article emphasizes the importance of thoughtful borrowing and consulting with home lenders to determine if tapping into home equity aligns with financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seventeen police officers were injured during a second night of violence in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault. Protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. Five people were arrested, bringing the total number of injured officers to 32. The unrest has been described by police as "racist thuggery," with some homes displaying stickers outlining the residents' nationalities.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp is supporting Apple in its legal battle against the UK Home Office over user data privacy, arguing that the case "could set a dangerous precedent." WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart said the case could embolden other nations to seek to break encryption, compromising user data privacy. Apple is challenging the Home Office's request for access to global customer data in the interests of national security. WhatsApp has applied to submit evidence to the court, asserting its commitment to defending people's right to private online conversations.</p>

Peskov added that Russia has gained valuable experience to minimize the adverse effects of these measures, which it considers unlawful. The EU aims to reduce the current price ceiling from $60 per barrel to $45 as part of efforts to tighten sanctions on Moscow.

This offer extends to any player ranked within the world's top 750 who spends over 10 weeks away from competition. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, expressed that this new rule will alleviate the pressure on players to return to the court too quickly after the procedure.

          <p>Experts say that Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, in response to immigration protests, is a show of force that has been years in the making. This action aligns with Trump's goals of bringing state and local officials to heel, maximizing resources for deportation, and targeting protesters. Some view it as a test case for exerting federal authority over local governments that resist his agenda. The deployment has sparked concerns about the militarization of responses to protests and the impact on immigrant communities.</p>
