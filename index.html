          <p>A tourist boat carrying 53 people, predominantly Vietnamese families, capsized during a sudden storm in Vietnam's popular Ha Long Bay. The incident has resulted in at least 28 deaths, including eight children, with 14 individuals still reported as missing. Rescue efforts have been complicated by heavy rain but have successfully saved 11 people, including a boy who survived for hours in an air pocket. Vietnam's Prime Minister has extended condolences to the victims' families as the search for the missing continues.</p>

          <p>In East Hollywood, a vehicle plowed into a crowd waiting to enter the Vermont Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 people, with at least seven in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday morning after a fight reportedly broke out nearby. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the car and assaulted him; police later discovered the driver had also been shot by a separate suspect who fled the scene. Authorities are now investigating both the crash and the subsequent shooting.</p>

          <p>Over 80 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense, followed a break-in at an RAF base where activists damaged military aircraft. Protests occurred in London, Bristol, and other cities, with many arrests made under the Terrorism Act for displaying supportive placards. The group's co-founder is set to challenge the proscription in the High Court.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility has killed three veteran officers from the arson explosives detail. The blast, which occurred in a parking lot at the Biscailuz Center, is being treated as an isolated incident with no other injuries reported. The officers, identified as Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn, were reportedly working to render safe a grenade that had been transported to the facility. This event marks the department's largest single loss of life since its founding in 1857.</p>

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the 2024 building collapse in George, which killed 34 construction workers, was "entirely preventable."

Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated that workers had reported vibrations and were told to cover up defects, calling for criminal accountability for the negligence.

This action follows President Trump's announcement of 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, which Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned as "unacceptable blackmail."

          <p>The UK is under multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, bringing a continued threat of flash floods, power cuts, and travel disruptions. While a more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the widespread flooding initially feared, localized impacts remain possible. The recent heatwave has left the ground dry and less able to absorb heavy rainfall, increasing the flood risk. The unsettled weather pattern is expected to persist, with further alerts covering parts of England, Scotland, and Wales into Monday.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, a move the player has favored since falling out with his club's management. The proposed deal is structured as an initial loan with an option to buy, which would provide significant wage bill relief for Manchester United. Rashford, one of the club's highest-paid players, has been training separately from the first team and was not given a squad number for the new season. The transfer would see him join the Spanish champions under manager Hansi Flick.</p>

          <p>One month after U.S. airstrikes targeted three of Iran's key nuclear sites, the full extent of the damage and the resulting safety risks remain unclear. The operation, which hit fortified enrichment facilities in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, has raised concerns about the potential release of hazardous materials like uranium hexafluoride gas. While the IAEA has not detected increased radiation levels in the region, experts note that a release confined to the sites could still pose severe chemical and radiological dangers to workers. The fate of Iran's existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium is also uncertain.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in previously approved federal spending, a move that analysts suggest could be a test case for future budget battles. Unlike regular appropriations bills that require 60 votes in the Senate, rescissions can pass with a simple majority of 51 votes. This allows the controlling party to claw back funds for programs like foreign aid and public broadcasting without bipartisan support. Some observers argue this could fundamentally alter the federal budgeting process, making it more partisan and less collaborative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being violently pulled into an MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress, ignoring orders to stay out. The powerful magnetic force of the machine reportedly drew the chain, and consequently the man, into the device, causing fatal injuries. Medical experts stress that such incidents are rare but underscore the critical importance of strict safety protocols that prohibit metal objects near active MRI machines.</p>

          <p>Despite a large parliamentary majority, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's authority is being questioned due to both internal and external pressures. The recent expulsion of several backbench MPs for opposing government plans was intended to enforce discipline but has also highlighted a surprising lack of control over his party. Meanwhile, the government faces significant constraints from financial markets due to massive national debt, limiting its policy options. This analysis suggests that a combination of a restless party, market pressures, and public opinion leaves the government looking less in control than its majority would imply.</p>
