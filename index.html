            <p>Shares of LVMH experienced a significant drop following a disappointing first-quarter sales report, sparking concerns about its position as the world's top luxury stock. The decline, attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China, particularly for wines and spirits, also impacted other luxury brands. Analysts cite broader economic uncertainty and potential tariff implications as headwinds for the sector, which relies on global supply chains and U.S. consumer spending. The company is considering repricing strategies to offset inflation and currency fluctuations, but the overall outlook remains cautious amid trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Xi Jinping's 2017 prediction of "profound changes unseen in a century" reshaping the world is gaining credence among Chinese experts, fueled by Donald Trump's turbulent return to power. Analysts suggest Trump's policies signal a seismic global reordering with waning American influence and the rise of new powers. Xi's alignment with Vladimir Putin against Washington further underscores this shift, highlighting a growing perception of American decline and China's ascendance on the world stage. This view is influencing Beijing's strategic calculations and international relations.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff policy, particularly towards China, aims to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., address national security concerns, and boost exports. Advisers hope to incentivize a U.S. manufacturing boom and restructure the global currency system by weakening the dollar. However, tariffs could increase costs for both consumers and manufacturers, potentially leading to economic damage and reduced investment. The erratic implementation of the policy and the exemption of certain goods further undermine its effectiveness in achieving these ambitious goals. (not investment advice)</p>

            <h2>Defining Classical Music by Creative Process, Not Sound</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-15 07:00:00 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The author argues that classical music should be defined not by its sound or aesthetic, but by its creative process: written music. Classical music is music that comes into being through the act of composition and prioritizes the score over live performance or recording. This definition welcomes a broader range of music into the tradition, including the works of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn. The author champions the freedom and complexity that comes from writing music down, arguing it is essential for creativity and communication.</p>

            <p>Meta's new content-moderation policy, which relies on user reporting for lower-severity violations, is failing to protect content creators from harassment. The Maccabeats, a Jewish a cappella group, experienced a barrage of anti-Semitic comments on their Instagram post, highlighting the inadequacy of Meta's current system. The article suggests Meta should implement features like "megablocks" and a straightforward way to report pages targeted for brigading to empower users to police content on their own pages.</p>

            <p>While Russia was conspicuously left off the list of countries targeted by Donald Trump's tariffs, the policy is inadvertently disrupting the Russian economy. Falling oil prices, triggered by fears of a global recession due to the trade war, are negatively impacting Russia's oil and gas revenues, which are crucial for funding its war in Ukraine. This development could potentially shift the dynamics of the conflict, as Russia faces economic constraints due to lower oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A third federal judge has temporarily blocked some deportations under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), issuing an order that prevents the Trump administration from removing noncitizens in Colorado who are subject to the AEA proclamation. This decision follows similar rulings by judges in New York and Texas, forming a growing patchwork of district-level protections to limit the use of the AEA. The judge declined to rule on the lawfulness of the AEA proclamation, instead blocking removals to preserve the court’s jurisdiction.</p>

            <p>China has reportedly ordered its airlines to cease further deliveries of Boeing jets, escalating its trade war with the U.S. The Chinese government has also requested carriers to halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from American companies. This restriction marks a serious blow for Boeing and other manufacturers trying to navigate the trade tensions between the two largest economies. The move is in retaliation to the U.S.'s tariff policies, creating uncertainty for the aviation industry.</p>

            <p>The IRS recommends filing income tax returns as early as possible, but for those who need more time, a tax extension can provide an additional six months to file. Filing a tax extension gives people extra time to assemble their forms, work through complex tax situations and submit everything to the government without penalty. Taxpayers can file for an extension online through the IRS website or by mailing Form 4868. It's important to remember that an extension only gives more time to file, not to pay any taxes owed.</p>
