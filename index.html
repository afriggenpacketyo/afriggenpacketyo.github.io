          <p>The owner of a nightclub in the Dominican Republic, where a roof collapse resulted in 236 deaths, was arrested along with his sister. Antonio Espaillat and Maribel Espaillat have not yet been formally charged, but authorities have 48 hours to present charges before a judge. The Attorney General's Office accused them of irresponsibility and negligence for failing to prevent the collapse, which also caused over 180 injuries. Prosecutors allege the Espaillats tried to intimidate employees who could serve as witnesses. The arrests followed hours of interrogation, and a government committee is investigating the collapse's cause. Espaillat stated his family had operated the building for about 30 years without structural reviews.</p>

          <p>North Korea announced the successful repair and relaunch of a 5,000-ton destroyer that had been damaged during a failed launch attempt last month. Leader Kim Jong Un attended a ceremony at the Rajin shipyard to mark the event, where he revealed plans to build two more destroyers of the same type annually. The destroyer had tipped over during its initial launch at the Chongjin Shipyard on May 21, causing damage to its lower sections, and Kim ordered its repair before an upcoming Workers' Party of Korea meeting. During the repair work, a worker died, and Kim reportedly met with the worker's family to offer condolences. The newly launched warship is expected to be handed over to the navy around mid-2026.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court delayed an order requiring the Trump administration to return control of the California National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay of the lower court’s order and set a hearing for June 17.

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily delayed an order that would have returned control of the California National Guard from the Trump administration to Governor Gavin Newsom. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay and scheduled a hearing for June 17 after a lower court judge had issued a temporary restraining order blocking Trump's deployment of the Guard during immigration raid protests in Los Angeles. The lower court judge, Charles Breyer, argued that Trump's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment, but the appeals court put this order on hold. Newsom had sought to block what he termed the "unnecessary" and "unlawful militarization" of Los Angeles, claiming Trump inflamed the protests by deploying the military unnecessarily.</p>

The Israeli strikes targeted Iran's nuclear programme and other military sites. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack was necessary due to Iran's continued movement to "weaponise" enriched uranium and was critical to "Israel's very survival".</p>

Padilla was grabbed, shoved, and handcuffed after posing a question about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Los Angeles. Tensions have been high between Democrats and the Trump administration following the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to quell protests against the anti-immigration program. A district judge had issued a temporary restraining order on the deployment, stating that Trump had overstepped his authority.

VA Secretary Doug Collins sent letters to California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, citing the "violent" riots and defacement of the building with graffiti threatening federal immigration officials as the reasons for the closure. Collins criticized the city and state's response, accusing them of prioritizing opposition to President Trump over protecting veterans and maintaining law and order. He requested specific steps to restore order and requested state and local authorities pay to repair the damage to the building.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found evidence of cancer in a dinosaur fossil, suggesting that ancient soft tissue preserved in bones could offer insights into modern cancer research. The team examined a Telmatosaurus transsylvanicus dinosaur and discovered structures resembling red blood cells linked to a tumor in its jaw. This discovery indicates that soft tissue may be preserved in fossils more often than previously thought, providing valuable molecular information about diseases. Understanding how dinosaurs protected themselves against cancer could inform new approaches to cancer prevention or treatment in humans, as large animals like whales and elephants have evolved similar defenses. The dinosaur in the study had an ameloblastoma tumor, a type also found in humans today.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump illegally deployed the California National Guard to suppress protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, ordering the troops to be returned to state control under Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that Trump failed to demonstrate a "rebellion" in Los Angeles and did not comply with the necessary procedural steps to notify the governor. However, a three-judge panel at the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit paused the ruling while they assess the case. Newsom hailed the initial ruling as a victory for American democracy, while the Justice Department argued that Trump had the sole authority to decide whether federal intervention was needed. The temporary restraining order did not address the deployment of Marines, who were reportedly used only to protect federal buildings.</p>

          <p>Dan Wang, a keen observer of China, has termed the country the “engineering state” due to its focus on building large public works and technological advancements. China's integrated transport system, including subway trains and high-speed rail, showcases the nation's engineering prowess. The country has built more dams, bridges, and high-rises than any other nation, with a strong emphasis on STEM fields. China's STEM graduates significantly outnumber those in the US, and many top officials are engineers. This contrasts with the US, which Wang calls the “lawyerly state,” highlighting the different priorities and expertise of the two countries.</p>

The judge, Charles Breyer, ruled that Trump did not follow the law set by Congress regarding the deployment of a state's National Guard.

Newsom stated that the military belongs on the battlefield, not on city streets. The Trump administration claimed it took over the National Guard to restore order and protect ICE agents, but California argued that the protests did not rise to the level of a rebellion.</p>

The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Governor Gavin Newsom by noon Friday. The ruling could be appealed, but it is a setback for the White House in its dispute over immigration enforcement powers. Judge Charles Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the courts do not have the authority to review a president's decision on the National Guard's necessity. Trump deployed 4,000 California National Guard and several hundred U.S. Marines to Los Angeles over Newsom's objections.</p>

          <p>Research by archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding that pigs were eating humans’ cooked foods and waste. This indicates that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient society. The conventional view is that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East, but this study challenges that notion. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p>
