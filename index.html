          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 leaders' meeting in Canada in mid-June. Before the G7 gathering, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit Washington for another round of ministerial-level negotiations on the Trump tariffs, setting the stage for the leaders' meeting. Japan has been pushing for the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced rates due to the United States' consistent refusal to eliminate the duties. Ishiba has emphasized the need for the allies to focus on boosting investment and creating jobs in the United States, while Trump seeks to reduce his country's trade deficit with Japan. The article highlights the ongoing efforts to bridge the gap between the two nations' trade policies. The optimism score reflects the ongoing diplomatic efforts despite trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recall on cases of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA due to a serious health risk involving mislabeling. Although the cans were labeled as "zero sugar," they contained the full amount of sugar found in a regular can, around 39 grams. The recalled cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company in Jacksonville, Florida, have the product code XXXXRS05165 and a ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This mislabeling poses a health risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, such as diabetics, as high sugar intake can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal complications. The optimism score is based on the fact that no major injuries have occurred and the recall is underway.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Smugglers are exploiting legal loopholes in Europe to traffic ketamine, swapping it for substances like salt and sugar during transit. Criminal gangs are reportedly earning more from ketamine than cocaine, leading to an epidemic-like situation. In the UK, ketamine consumption has risen significantly, with a corresponding increase in deaths linked to the drug. The dual classification of ketamine as a legal medicine in some countries and a narcotic in others complicates law enforcement efforts. The article highlights the preferred smuggling route from India through Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium to the UK, and the increasing use of front companies to import ketamine under the guise of legitimate use. The optimism score is low due to the rise in drug-related deaths and the challenges in combating the illegal trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to curb the elevated prices of the staple food, with Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announcing the measure. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, and is expected to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, and the released rice will be distributed to smaller supermarket operators, specialty shops, and major retailers. The government is taking this action in response to public frustration over the high cost of rice, which has doubled compared to the previous year. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the government's efforts to stabilize food prices, but also acknowledging the underlying issue of potential hoarding. </p>

          <p>Chinese electric-vehicle makers, led by BYD, are now competing with Tesla in the development of self-driving cars, posing a significant challenge to Tesla's future business model.

Tesla is further hindered by Chinese regulations preventing the use of data collected in China to train its AI. Huawei is also a major player, providing autonomous-driving technology to several Chinese automakers.

          <p>Israel's Foreign Ministry announced that passengers on an intercepted aid ship headed to Gaza, including Greta Thunberg, are being deported. The activists were taken to an airport to be flown home. The Israeli military intercepted the ship, which was carrying humanitarian aid, and redirected it to an Israeli port. The move underscores Israel's policy of preventing ships from reaching Gaza without its permission. The optimism score is low due to the ongoing conflict and the interception of humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about potential UK "complicity" in Israel's actions in Gaza were told they could consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy.

Senior civil servants responded that resignation was an "honourable course" for those with profound disagreements over government policy. The response has been met with "outrage" by some officials.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a report warning of an "unprecedented decline" in world fertility rates. The report cites the prohibitive cost of parenthood and the lack of a suitable partner as reasons why many people are unable to have the number of children they want. A UNFPA survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries found that one in five said they haven't had or expect they won't have their desired number of children. The report highlights a shift in focus for the UN agency, which has historically focused on women having more children than they wanted. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the concerns about declining fertility rates but also the agency's efforts to understand and address the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted as the fentanyl crisis eases, with fatal overdoses among those under 35 dropping significantly. This positive trend is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold, more addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens and young adults. However, concerns remain for those with severe addiction, and potential cuts in funding for addiction services could reverse this progress. The shift to cannabis and psychedelics are also being seen as a factor. The optimism score is high, reflecting the significant decline in drug deaths and the potential for continued progress.</p>
