        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced a national inquiry into maternity care in England, prompted by a series of maternity scandals at NHS trusts. The inquiry aims to address failings in maternity and neonatal services across the country, including in Leeds, Sussex, Gloucester, and Mid and South Essex. Streeting apologized on behalf of the NHS to families who have suffered avoidable harm and stated the review will involve victims, giving families a voice into how the inquiry is run. The inquiry is set to begin this summer and report back by December 2025, with the goal of ensuring no parent or baby is ever let down again.</p>

          <p>Liu Yuejin, Chinaâ€™s first counterterrorism commissioner and a former senior police officer, has been sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve after being convicted of accepting bribes exceeding 121 million yuan. The Fuzhou Intermediate Peopleâ€™s Court ordered the confiscation of Liuâ€™s personal properties and the return of his illegal gains to the state. Liu admitted his guilt, showed repentance, and actively returned the money taken, resulting in a lighter punishment. Chinese law stipulates that if Liu commits no further crimes during the reprieve, his sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment, or potentially reduced further for significant contributions.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance asserted that the United States is at war with "Iran's nuclear program," not with Iran itself, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. This statement came after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Iran's "nuclear ambitions have been obliterated" due to the strikes on facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran reserves all options to defend itself after the U.S. attacks, raising concerns about potential escalation. Vance expressed that the U.S. desires peace but insists on Iran not possessing nuclear weapons, which he claims was the mission's objective.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has proposed a plan allowing non-domiciles in the UK to avoid many UK taxes by paying a Â£250,000 fee for a "Britannia Card." This card would exempt them from taxes on wealth, income, and capital gains earned abroad, as well as inheritance tax. Farage claims this initiative would attract "tens of thousands" of talented individuals to the UK, generating between Â£1.5bn to Â£2.5bn annually, which would then be distributed to the lowest-paid 10% of full-time workers. Critics, including Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves, argue that this policy amounts to a "tax cut for foreign billionaires" that would necessitate either raising taxes or cutting public services.

          <p>Amid escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, President Trump hinted at the possibility of regime change in Iran following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Israel has expanded its targets in Iran to include sites linked to the ruling theocracy's domestic authority, such as Evin Prison and the headquarters of Iran's Basij paramilitary forces. Iran launched missiles at Israel, causing disruptions in electricity supply and prompting widespread alerts. While Trump claimed the U.S. strikes "totally obliterated" Iranian nuclear sites, the IAEA believes Iran may have moved some enriched uranium beforehand, leading to calls for renewed negotiations.</p>

          <p>The average price of rice in Japan has fallen below 4,000 yen per 5 kilograms for the first time since March, reaching 3,920 yen, according to the government. This decrease is attributed to increased distribution of rice stockpiles, helping to drive down prices at supermarkets across the nation. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that the release of additional rice reserves has proven effective in lowering prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba aims to reduce the average retail price of 5 kg of rice to the 3,000 yen range by the end of June, addressing concerns about rising consumer prices.</p>

          <p>China has called on the international community to intensify efforts to de-escalate the conflict between Iran and Israel, warning of potential damage to the global economy. The conflict has escalated following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting Iran to consider blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a critical shipping route for global oil and gas flows. A blockade could significantly increase energy prices, risking a global energy and trade crisis. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun emphasized the strategic importance of the Persian Gulf for global trade, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged China to use its diplomatic influence to prevent the strait's closure.</p>

          <p>Iran's parliament approved a measure to close the Strait of Hormuz after U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, risking alienation of its neighbors and trade partners. Experts suggest that closing the strait, which handles about 20% of the world's oil, would harm Iran more than others, particularly its Asian markets like China. While the decision rests with Iran's national security council, the threat has raised fears of higher energy prices and geopolitical tensions. Analysts believe Iran is unlikely to fully close the strait due to the potential for significant self-inflicted harm and the risk of provoking a strong response from the U.S. and Israel.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. engages in military action against Iran's nuclear sites, China's support for Tehran remains firm but restrained, influenced by its limited leverage as a peace broker and its strategic interests. China has drawn closer to Iran in recent years, cooperating on military exercises and economic partnerships. However, Beijing's rhetoric has shifted towards brokering dialogue and a ceasefire, avoiding direct condemnation of Israel. China's primary economic interest lies in access to Iranian oil and the Strait of Hormuz, making stability in the region crucial for its economic and strategic goals.</p>

          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi has urged for a diplomatic solution and de-escalation of the conflict to address the crisis in Iran. Speaking at an emergency board meeting, Grossi emphasized the need for calm to allow IAEA inspectors access to Iran's nuclear sites for damage assessment. He noted that no one, including the IAEA, has fully assessed the underground damage at the Fordo site. Given the explosive payload used and the sensitivity of centrifuges, Grossi expects significant damage to have occurred.</p>

          <p>Critics are raising concerns about Donald Trump's use of emergency declarations to justify policies on immigration, tariffs, and energy, arguing that he is governing in a permanent crisis mode. Legal scholars and watchdog groups say Trump is relying on controversial statutes to implement his agenda, leading to legal challenges. Emergency authorities are intended for unexpected crises, not for enacting policy agendas, and Trump's actions risk undermining the constitution and Congress. Some experts see Trump's actions as autocratic steps that threaten the rule of law.</p>

The proposal would make significant cuts to Medicaid and Obamacare plans, potentially leaving millions without health insurance. Critics argue that the cuts target the most cost-efficient programs and will disproportionately affect low-income individuals. Republicans contend that the bill protects Medicaid by removing ineligible individuals and implementing work requirements, but experts warn of dire consequences for states and individuals.</p>
