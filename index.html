          <h2>IMF Revises Downward U.S. Growth Prediction for 2025 Due to Trade Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 10:21:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund has significantly lowered its U.S. growth forecast for 2025 to 1.8% from 2.7%, primarily due to the adverse effects of President Trump's tariffs and subsequent retaliatory measures from trading partners. These trade tensions are creating a major negative shock to the U.S. and global economies. The IMF also cited weakening consumer confidence and consumption indicators as contributing factors to the downward revision. Recession odds in the U.S. are now viewed at 40%, a notable increase from 25% in October 2024, while the global growth forecast was also reduced to 2.8%.</p>

          <p>Chevron's CEO, Mike Wirth, stated that the company is not currently seeing signs of an imminent U.S. recession, despite the International Monetary Fund's recent downward revision of the U.S. growth outlook. Wirth acknowledged that President Trump's tariffs and OPEC+'s decision to increase production are expected to reduce oil demand. He noted that U.S. onshore oil production, particularly in the Permian Basin, could pull back if prices fall to $60 per barrel, while offshore production is unlikely to be affected. Chevron anticipates that the macroeconomic effects of the tariffs will have a greater impact than direct effects on their business. </p>

The mission, dubbed Operation Highmast, aims to demonstrate the UK's capability to conduct large-scale military operations globally.

          <p>At least five people were killed after gunmen opened fire on a group of domestic tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, specifically in the popular tourist destination of Pahalgam. The attack, described by the region's chief minister as unusually large, has prompted a swift response from the Indian government, with the Home Minister traveling to Srinagar for an emergency meeting. Security forces have been deployed to the area, and a search is underway for the perpetrators. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred in a region with a history of insurgency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has reclaimed the $90,000 level as investors seek alternative assets amidst stock market turbulence and a weakening U.S. dollar, with U.S. Bitcoin ETFs seeing significant inflows. This surge occurred as President Trump intensified pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, raising concerns about the central bank's independence. While bitcoin was previously correlated with stock market volatility, it has recently decoupled, showing resilience as the S&P 500 declined. Analysts note that bitcoin's strength is occurring alongside light trading volumes, requiring a significant catalyst like Fed easing or tariff deals to break above the $93,000 resistance level.

          <p>Sixty theater students from Altadena and Eliot Arts magnet schools, who lost their homes and school in the Eaton fire, demonstrated remarkable resilience by staging a performance of "Shrek the Musical Jr." at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. Despite the trauma and displacement, the students, with the support of their director and choreographer, channeled their experiences into a sold-out performance. The production was made possible by community support, including donations of sets, costumes, and encouragement from Broadway stars. The students' determination to continue the show served as a powerful display of community spirit and the healing power of art.</p>

          <p>Margaret Sullivan argues that President Trump's attacks on NPR and PBS are a predictable move in his broader strategy to control the political narrative and undermine reality-based journalism. Trump's anti-media playbook includes disparaging journalists, limiting access, and dismantling government-funded news organizations like Voice of America. Sullivan contends that public funding for media is crucial to maintaining a fact-based news ecosystem, especially as private media companies are increasingly owned by corporations with their own agendas. She emphasizes the importance of NPR and PBS as critical components of democratic self-governance.</p>

          <p>China is implementing a plan to promote the use of its currency, the yuan, and its own payment system, CIPS, in international trade to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar. The initiative leverages Shanghai's role as a global financial hub to encourage yuan usage, particularly in trade with countries in the Global South. By enhancing CIPS, China aims to strengthen its position in global trade networks and mitigate potential harm from U.S. actions curtailing access to the dollar-based financial system. This move is seen as a strategic response to the escalating trade war with the United States.</p>

          <p>An Indiana lawmaker highlights Guardian Bikes' $19 million investment in a new manufacturing plant in Seymour, Indiana, as a success story stemming from President Trump's tariff policies. The company aims to increase its U.S.-made bicycle production from 100,000 to over 1 million, shifting away from reliance on Chinese imports. The CEO of Guardian Bikes emphasized the company's commitment to local, fast, and data-driven manufacturing, viewing the Indiana location as ideal for workforce, infrastructure, and customer proximity.

          <p>As climate change makes rivers warmer, the $100 billion American fishing industry is increasingly threatened. Recent research found 87% of rivers studied across the U.S. and Europe are warming, with 70% losing oxygen, which is killing off trout. One nonprofit is working to restore river flow by removing old dams and reinforcing banks to keep them from filling up with sediment. For guides, it's worth protecting as the changing climate changes his industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions against Harvard University, including revoking federal research funding, are linked to a broader right-wing strategy to attack and control elite academic institutions. This strategy, influenced by figures like Curtis Yarvin, aims to weaken progressive institutions deemed enemies of the president. Trump's administration demanded audits for “viewpoint diversity” at Harvard, a move seen as an intrusion on a private university. While Harvard is fighting back in court, the attacks highlight a shift in the relationship between universities and the federal government, with potential long-term consequences for academic freedom and funding.</p>

          <p>Joseph Mallord William Turner, one of the greatest Romantic painters, is celebrated 250 years after his birth for his masterful depiction of nature's grandeur and the power of machines. Known for his interplay of light, color, and atmosphere, Turner found inspiration in nature and his travels across Europe. His style evolved over time, particularly during his visits to Venice, where he created mystical, light-filled landscapes. Today, Turner is considered a pioneer of modernism and a forerunner of abstract art, inspiring later Impressionists like Claude Monet.</p>
