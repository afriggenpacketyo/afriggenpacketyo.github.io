          <p>Tesla's board is proposing a new long-term performance-based compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, which requires shareholder approval. The plan consists of 12 tranches of shares that would vest only if the company achieves extremely ambitious market capitalization and operational goals over the next decade, including reaching a $2 trillion market cap and producing 20 million vehicles. If fully realized, the plan would not only provide substantial equity to Musk but also increase his voting power, a demand he has publicly made. The board chair stated the plan is designed to keep Musk motivated and focused on Tesla's future growth.</p>

          <p>German automaker BMW is strategically focusing on its brand value and advanced software capabilities as it prepares to launch its 'Neue Klasse' platform of electric vehicles. CEO Oliver Zipse highlighted the debut of the iX3 SUV, the first model from this new platform, which represents the company's largest single investment ever. By developing a centralized computer system or "superbrain architecture," BMW aims to enhance digital features and automated driving to better compete with software-defined vehicle leaders like Tesla and Chinese brands such as BYD. The company believes its strong brand promise of quality and technology will be a key differentiator in a fiercely competitive market.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race has intensified with a series of strategic debate challenges among the candidates. After independent candidate Andrew Cuomo challenged Democrat Zohran Mamdani to borough-specific debates, Mamdani countered by challenging President Trump directly, framing Cuomo as a puppet for the president. This comes amid reports that the White House is exploring ways to encourage incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa to exit the race, creating a two-person contest. Both Adams and Sliwa have publicly refused to drop out, insisting that voters should decide the outcome, adding further complexity to the contentious election.</p>

          <p>Demonstrators across Israel are marking the 700th day since the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, demanding the government secure the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza. Families of hostages and their supporters are increasing pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to negotiate an end to the war. Meanwhile, Germany's Foreign Minister stated that a partial arms embargo imposed on Israel last month is a sufficient signal for now, citing the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza where over 63,000 Palestinians have been killed. Released hostages spoke at a press conference in Tel Aviv, describing the harrowing conditions of captivity and urging for action.</p>

          <p>A new survey from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs indicates that the Chinese public is divided on whether their nation should seek a dominant or shared leadership role on the world stage. While a vast majority supports active participation in global affairs, 48% favor a shared role versus 41% who prefer a dominant one. The study also found that most Chinese citizens do not view the United States as a friend, identifying U.S. economic competition and potential conflict over Taiwan as major threats. Despite this, a majority of 61% favor a balanced approach of cooperation and containment toward Washington, reflecting a nuanced public perspective on foreign relations.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues U.S. Supreme Court Shows Pattern of Favoritism Toward Donald Trump</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed analysis argues that the U.S. Supreme Court's Republican-appointed majority has established a pattern of behavior that consistently favors former President Donald Trump and related political interests. The article points to numerous instances, including the granting of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts and frequent use of the 'shadow docket' to grant Trump's requests for emergency relief. It contrasts this with the treatment of the Biden administration, which faced newly created legal doctrines like the 'major questions doctrine' to strike down its policies. The author suggests these actions, along with decisions favoring religious conservatives, indicate a departure from impartial jurisprudence toward politically motivated outcomes.</p>

          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom increased by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' expectations. This growth was largely attributed to sunny weather and the women's Euro football tournament, which spurred spending in clothing, footwear, and online retail sectors. The ONS also issued revised data for the past year after admitting to errors in its seasonal adjustments, apologizing for the delay and subsequent concerns over statistical reliability. While the monthly figure was positive, sales over the three-month period to July showed a slight decline. (not investment advice)</p>

This aggressive stance follows a recent U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-trafficking boat in the Caribbean that killed 11 people, an action legal experts suggest may have violated international law.

Wu has been a vocal defender of Boston's Trust Act, arguing it enhances public safety by building trust with immigrant communities.

For living donations, psychological and practical barriers are significant; while many support the idea, few donate to strangers due to the physical and financial costs, which can range from $900 to nearly $20,000 in the first year. Medical mistrust and lack of awareness further contribute to the shortage.</p>

The operation targets one of Georgia's largest economic development projects, prompting a response from the South Korean Foreign Ministry, which urged the U.S. to ensure the rights of Korean companies and citizens are not unfairly infringed upon during law enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is set to release its first monthly jobs report since President Trump fired Commissioner Erika McEntarfer last month. The dismissal followed a weak jobs report and unsubstantiated claims from the president that the data had been manipulated. Economists are forecasting the addition of 75,000 jobs in August, a figure that will heavily influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. A weaker-than-expected number could solidify a rate cut, while a stronger figure might cause the central bank to delay action, adding significant weight to this politically charged data release.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed concern that Europe is not playing a significant enough role in global affairs to protect its interests. Citing the war in Ukraine, Merz stated that Europe lacks the necessary leverage to pressure Russia and remains dependent on American assistance. His comments came as Germany, at a recent meeting, stopped short of committing troops to Ukraine in a post-conflict scenario. Merz emphasized that Berlin must embrace its global responsibilities and drive renewed European unity, particularly as other global powers like China and India deepen their ties with Russia. This news was part of a digest that also reported on a school stabbing in Essen.</p>

The acquisition of the 28-year-old midfielder is the latest high-profile signing for the club, which is funded by American owner Michele Kang and aims to disrupt the established order of the league with significant investment in top-tier talent.</p>

          <p>Thailand's parliament has elected tycoon-turned-politician Anutin Charnvirakul as the new prime minister with 311 votes in the lower house. His election follows the court-ordered removal of Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office last week, ending the Shinawatra family's hold on the premiership. The political transition was further complicated by the abrupt departure of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who left the country for Dubai ahead of a court ruling that could see him imprisoned. Anutin, known for championing cannabis decriminalization, secured the position with support from the opposition, under the condition that new elections are called within four months.</p>

          <p>The world's largest iceberg, A23a, is nearing the end of its nearly 40-year journey as it drifts into the warmer waters of the South Atlantic and rapidly breaks apart. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey report that the iceberg, once the size of Oahu, is now shedding massive chunks and has shrunk to the size of Greater London. A23a calved from Antarctica in 1986 but spent decades grounded on the seafloor before beginning its final journey in late 2023. Its disintegration is considered part of a normal iceberg life cycle and not directly linked to climate change, providing scientists with valuable data on its environmental impact.</p>

          <p>A columnist argues that the NFL is increasingly compromising its integrity, citing the league's recent decision to grant Tom Brady special access to teams for his broadcasting role despite his ownership stake in the Raiders. This "Brady Exception" is presented as part of a larger trend that includes the NFL's own equity stake in ESPN and the pervasive integration of sports betting into its product, a stark reversal of its historical stance. The author contends that these moves, under Commissioner Roger Goodell, undermine objectivity and create an appearance of favoritism, risking the league's credibility and pushing it closer to a pre-scripted entertainment model like professional wrestling.</p>

          <p>A notable trend is emerging ahead of the midterm elections: while over 20 Democrats under 40 are running for Congress, many challenging incumbents, young Republicans are largely remaining on the sidelines. Republican organizers suggest this indicates satisfaction with their party's current leadership and a strategy of waiting for opportunities to arise, rather than forcing them. In contrast, many young Democratic candidates are explicitly calling for a new generation of leaders, citing the party's aging leadership and recent electoral setbacks. This generational difference highlights contrasting dynamics within the two parties as they look toward the future and appeal to younger voters.</p>

          <p>Amid public concern over aggressive tactics, immigration law experts clarify the legal authority of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Federal law grants agents broad powers to question and arrest individuals without a warrant if they have reasonable suspicion the person is in the U.S. illegally and likely to flee. However, court rulings have specified that factors like race or wearing work clothes do not meet this standard of individualized suspicion. While agents can use force deemed "objectively reasonable," their increasing use of masks and unmarked vehicles tests legal boundaries and creates confusion, even as civil rights groups challenge these practices in court.</p>

          <p>Small business owners on platforms like Etsy, particularly in Canada, are facing significant challenges after the Trump administration abruptly ended the 'de minimis' rule. This rule had previously allowed international shipments valued up to $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free, effectively making the American market an extension of their domestic one. Now, sellers face complex paperwork to prove North American origin for tariff exemptions or the prospect of high tariffs, such as 35% on handmade jewelry, which threatens their business models. The change, aimed at large retailers like Temu and Shein, is causing shipping chaos and uncertainty for microbusinesses reliant on U.S. customers. (not investment advice)</p>
