          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts to fund President Trump's agenda are causing concern among low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could leave 8.6 million more people without health insurance by 2034. Many Republicans argue that the cuts aim to eliminate fraud and waste without affecting coverage for those in need, but some Medicaid recipients fear losing essential benefits like nursing home care and medication. The proposed bill also includes work requirements for able-bodied recipients, potentially jeopardizing care for those with substance use disorder despite exemptions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge expressed frustration with the Trump administration's handling of the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, accusing them of withholding details regarding efforts to reverse his deportation to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return after an "administrative error" led to his deportation. The Justice Department invoked state secrets privilege to withhold information, leading to accusations of acting in bad faith. Abrego Garcia's legal team has received few new documents, while the Justice Department claims he is in "good health" in El Salvador. The Supreme Court had previously ruled that the administration must ensure his case is handled as if he had not been improperly deported.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird in the southern Great Plains. Despite being listed as protected in 2023 due to a significant population decline, the administration argues that federal officials erred in the listing process. This move raises concerns about prioritizing oil and gas drilling over wildlife conservation, as the bird's habitat overlaps with these industries. Critics argue that delisting the prairie-chicken would set a precedent for weakening protections for other endangered species, especially those in fossil fuel-rich areas.</p>

          <p>Direct peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul resulted in an agreement to conduct a prisoner swap of 1,000 prisoners each. However, the two sides failed to broker a temporary cease-fire or arrange a meeting between Presidents Zelensky and Putin, indicating persistent challenges in ending the conflict. Russia demanded Ukraine withdraw from annexed regions as a condition for a cease-fire, a condition Ukraine still controls vast swaths of land in, including two regional capitals. The article highlights the ongoing diplomatic efforts and the deep divisions that remain between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team plans to argue "mutual violence" in his relationship with former girlfriend Cassie Ventura during his federal trial on sex trafficking and racketeering charges. This strategy suggests both parties engaged in abusive behavior, but legal experts say "mutual abuse" is not a legal defense. Abuse is defined by a pattern of behavior designed to maintain control, not just physical violence, and power dynamics are critical in differentiating between abuse and fighting back. This strategy may be an attempt to reframe the violence as a consensual part of the sexual relationship.</p>

This move aligns with the Trump administration's push for cost cuts across civil service agencies. The central bank had just under 24,000 employees in 2023, so a 10% reduction would bring that number below 22,000.</p>
