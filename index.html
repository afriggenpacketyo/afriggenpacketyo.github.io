          <p>Colombia's government reported that deforestation increased by 43% in 2024 compared to the previous year, marking a sharp reversal of a downward trend. The Amazon rainforest was the most impacted area, accounting for over 65% of the total 113,608 hectares of destroyed forest. Authorities attribute the surge to factors like land-grabbing for livestock, illegal construction, and wildfires intensified by climate change. Despite the spike, the overall loss remains below 2021 levels, continuing a general downward trend since 2022.</p>

This window may be temporary, as banks could lower rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts, making prompt action advantageous for maximizing savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing rate cuts, relief for those with high-interest credit card debt is postponed, leaving many in a precarious financial position. The article suggests borrowers should assess whether a small rate cut would have made a material difference and instead focus on creating a personal debt-reduction plan. It also outlines proactive strategies, such as the debt snowball method or seeking professional debt relief services, as more effective solutions than waiting for external economic shifts.

However, the company's stock fell over 7% in after-hours trading after it provided a third-quarter operating income forecast that was lighter than anticipated. The guidance raised investor concerns about the high costs associated with its significant investments in artificial intelligence and growing competition in the cloud computing sector.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham strongly refuted critics questioning Caitlin Clark's status as the face of the WNBA, calling the argument "literally dumb." Cunningham, now Clark's teammate after previously playing for the Phoenix Mercury, acknowledged that while all rookies face tough on-court treatment, the intensity directed at Clark is excessive. She emphasized Clark's significant and undeniable role in elevating the league's prominence, viewership, and overall attention this season.</p>

While Mac sales also grew nearly 15%, the company's iPad and wearables divisions experienced revenue declines during the same period, showing mixed performance across its product lines.</p>

          <p>England pace bowler Chris Woakes is expected to miss the remainder of the decisive fifth Test match against India after suffering a shoulder injury on the opening day. Woakes landed awkwardly while tumbling to make a boundary stop and left the field in clear discomfort. The injury is a significant blow to England's already depleted bowling attack in the final, series-deciding match at The Oval, with his participation in the rest of the game considered highly unlikely.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the White House grounds, fulfilling a long-stated desire of the president. The project, with an estimated cost of $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, with construction scheduled to begin in September. The new, permanent venue will be built where the current East Wing sits and is intended to host large functions like state dinners without requiring temporary tents.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: New Federal Student Loan Caps Could Create Barriers for Professional School Students</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 17:26:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that changes to federal student loan programs under a new law will create significant financial hurdles for students pursuing professional degrees. With new annual and lifetime borrowing limits, students in high-cost fields like medicine and law may face a funding gap that private loans, with their stricter requirements, cannot easily fill. The author contends this will limit access to these professions for working-class students and urges California to create its own loan program to bridge the gap.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that Columbia University's recent $200 million settlement with the Trump administration creates a troubling roadmap for pressuring other universities. To restore federal funding, Columbia agreed to slash DEI programs, review its Middle Eastern studies curriculum, and increase crackdowns on student protests. Critics warn that these agreements, reached under financial duress, compromise academic freedom and institutional independence, setting a dangerous precedent for less-resourced schools facing similar federal investigations.</p>

          <p>The new sequel to "The Naked Gun" is being hailed in a new review as a surprisingly effective and hilarious revival of the classic comedy franchise. The film is said to adhere closely to the original's beloved style of silly yet creative humor, with Liam Neeson receiving praise for his unexpectedly entertaining deadpan performance as the son of the original protagonist. Despite a simple plot, the review highlights the film's success in delivering genuine laughs through clever wordplay and well-executed slapstick comedy.</p>
