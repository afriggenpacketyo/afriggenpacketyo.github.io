        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is proceeding with the construction of 36 more miles of border wall in Arizona and New Mexico, waiving environmental regulations to expedite the process. These projects, funded by previous appropriations, aim to fill gaps in the Yuma and El Paso Sectors, with a significant portion allocated to the Tucson Sonoita Project. Supporters, including Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen, praise the move for enhancing national security and restoring the rule of law. Critics, however, raise concerns about the environmental impact of circumventing regulations designed to protect air, water, and ecosystems. The expansion signifies a continuation of the Trump administration's commitment to border security measures.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, acknowledges the party's past mistakes and insists she will improve in her role, emphasizing that growth and change take time. She launched a commission, led by Lord Wolfson, to assess whether withdrawing from international treaties like the European Convention on Human Rights could help tackle illegal migration and facilitate the deportation of foreign criminals. Badenoch stated that leaving the ECHR might be necessary but only with a clear plan and understanding of the consequences. She also distanced the party from Liz Truss's mini-budget, and the Conservative leader seeks to flesh out her party's approach to tackling illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz progressed to the French Open final after Lorenzo Musetti retired due to injury during their match. Alcaraz secured the win after Musetti, who initially showed promise by taking the first set, struggled with movement and physical discomfort. The match was delicately poised until Musetti's decline, with Alcaraz ultimately taking advantage of his opponent's physical limitations. This victory marks a significant step for Alcaraz as he aims for the title, while Musetti's injury cut short what could have been a defining moment in his career.</p>

Musk criticized Trump's bill as "massive, outrageous, pork-filled," leading to a series of social media exchanges where Trump claimed Musk was upset about electric vehicle subsidies being cut.

Unlike other insurers, the FAIR Plan does not publicly disclose financial data or hold open board meetings, leading to concerns about accountability. The plan's rapid growth, fueled by non-renewals from major insurers, has transformed it into a major player in fire insurance. The FAIR Plan's unique status and limited reinsurance leave it vulnerable to large disasters, prompting calls for increased transparency and oversight.</p>

          <p>President Trump has mandated that coal and gas plants continue operating, even though grid operators did not request their continued operation. This decision may result in additional costs for consumers. The move is seen as part of the administration's efforts to support the fossil fuel industry, despite the increasing closure of such plants due to economic and environmental factors. The situation raises questions about energy policy and the balance between economic interests and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>DocuSign's stock price dropped significantly after the company released its earnings report, which exceeded expectations but included a reduced forecast for full-year billings. The company's billings for the fiscal first quarter fell short of both analysts' estimates and DocuSign's own projections. The revised billings outlook has raised concerns among investors, leading to a sharp sell-off of the stock.

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a rebound following a sharp decline triggered by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The stock climbed approximately 5% in premarket trading after the previous day's $152 billion rout, and analysts suggest that a potential truce between Musk and Trump could further boost investor confidence. The initial drop was fueled by Musk's criticism of Trump's policies, leading to a war of words between the two figures. Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives remains optimistic about Tesla's long-term prospects despite the recent volatility.</p>

Expiration of ACA subsidies would also increase coverage costs, while administrative changes could make eligibility and enrollment more difficult.
