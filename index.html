          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA, was shot and killed during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. The incident, which authorities are investigating as a targeted attack, has been labeled a "political assassination" by Utah's governor. A single shot was fired from a distance, striking Kirk in the neck, and a person of interest is now in custody. The event has drawn widespread condemnation from political figures across the ideological spectrum, including President Trump and former President Biden.</p>

          <p>California is set to terminate a long-standing perk that allowed solo drivers of electric and low-emission vehicles to use carpool lanes. The program, which utilized Clean Air Vehicle decals, will end on October 1 because the federal government did not grant an extension. Governor Newsom criticized the decision, attributing it to congressional Republicans and warning of increased traffic and smog. With approximately half a million active decals in the state, the change will require these drivers to meet standard multi-occupant requirements to use the high-occupancy lanes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to stimulate housing construction, California state lawmakers have introduced legislation to significantly reform Measure ULA, Los Angeles's so-called "mansion tax." The proposal, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, would reduce the tax rate on sales of recently built apartment buildings and commercial properties, which critics claim have been negatively impacted by the original measure. Proponents argue the changes will incentivize new development, while some supporters of the original measure fear it will devastate funding for crucial affordable housing and homelessness prevention programs.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," Jim Cramer observed that the current market sentiment mirrors the show's early days, with a renewed investor enthusiasm for individual stocks. He recalled how the program helped democratize market information for the public before the dot-com bubble burst, which led many to favor safer index funds. Cramer suggests that after years of caution, investors are once again recognizing the potential for significant rewards in single stocks, driven by high-performing companies in sectors like data centers and AI, signaling a welcome return to form.</p>

          <p>A top White House science and technology adviser has called for the U.S. to proactively defend its lead in artificial intelligence against China's rapid advancements. The strategy involves exporting "cohesive AI tech stacks," which integrate chips, algorithms, and applications, to allied nations to prevent China from gaining global market share. The adviser warned that the once-comfortable U.S. lead in AI has narrowed significantly, necessitating coordinated action with the Commerce and Defense departments. This initiative is a key part of the administration's latest action plan on artificial intelligence.</p>

She was then approached by two individuals who offered help but instead took her to an apartment where she was allegedly sexually assaulted at knifepoint.

          <p>Scientists are studying Australia's vibrant peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. Researchers believe the key may lie in the spiders' vast amount of "dark DNA," the non-gene portions of the genetic code whose functions are largely unknown. The team hypothesizes that this dark DNA, which is three times more abundant in these spiders than in humans, enables them to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. This research is part of the broader Earth BioGenome Project, which aims to decode the DNA of all known species.</p>

Proponents contended that the decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk misuse for military actions unrelated to their original intent.

          <p>This opinion article interprets China's recent Victory Day parade as a declaration of a new vision for a global order, with President Xi Jinping positioning the nation as a leader for the Global South. The event was used to warn that the world is at a crossroads between peace and war, urging nations to learn from history. However, the commemoration also highlighted unresolved historical tensions, particularly with Japan, and reinforced a narrative that challenges the West's framing of the victory over fascism in World War II, asserting China's own pivotal role.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AT&T CEO John Stankey has stated that the era of massive hardware-driven "super cycles" for Apple's iPhone is likely over. He argued that future consumer demand and blockbuster sales will depend more on incremental but significant software advancements rather than major physical redesigns. Stankey specifically pointed to artificial intelligence as the key area where Apple must deliver compelling and unique features to drive engagement and convince users to upgrade. Without a major leap forward in AI, he does not expect new models to generate the record-breaking launch-day demand seen in the past.</p>

          <p>Citing security concerns, NASA has implemented new restrictions that block Chinese citizens from accessing its facilities, materials, and networks. The move affects not only potential employees but also contractors, graduate students, and university scientists on U.S. visas who previously could contribute to NASA projects. This action reflects the escalating competition between the U.S. and China in space exploration, as both nations are actively pursuing ambitious goals, including crewed missions to the moon within the next decade. The agency described the change as an "internal action" to ensure the security of its work.</p>

          <p>The suspect accused of fatally stabbing 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light rail train has reportedly spoken about the crime from jail. In a recorded call with his sister, Decarlos Brown Jr. allegedly claimed he did not know the victim and that "materials" planted in his brain by the government had "lashed out on her." This statement echoes a previous incident where Brown told police he believed he was being controlled by a "man-made" material.

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly surpassed Elon Musk to become the world's richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. A more than 40% surge in Oracle's stock price, fueled by a positive outlook for its cloud infrastructure and AI businesses, pushed Ellison's net worth to $393 billion. However, as Oracle's shares moderated later in the day, Musk, whose wealth is primarily tied to Tesla, reclaimed the top spot. This momentary shift highlights the dynamic nature of wealth at the highest levels, heavily influenced by daily stock market fluctuations.</p>

          <p>This article summarizes a podcast analyzing the deployment of National Guard troops for domestic policing in Washington, D.C., under President Trump. The discussion, featuring law professor Rosa Brooks, explores the constitutional and societal implications of using military personnel in roles typically reserved for civilian police. Concerns were raised about the blurring lines between military and police functions, the potential for such actions to normalize authoritarian tactics, and the demoralizing effect on Guard members. The analysis suggests these deployments may be a show of force against political opponents rather than an effective crime-fighting strategy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a departure from typical seasonal trends, freight trade into the U.S. has slowed significantly during what should be the peak holiday shipping period. This downturn is largely driven by a sustained, sharp decline in exports from China, with volumes down 27% year-over-year for three consecutive weeks. Analysts suggest that many U.S. retailers front-loaded their inventory earlier in the year to get ahead of tariffs, leading to a subsequent drop in new orders. The slowdown is impacting the entire supply chain, with ocean carriers announcing blank sailings in response to reduced demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant number of Russian drones violated Polish airspace, prompting a military response from Polish and other NATO jets in the first-ever instance of the alliance engaging hostile targets over its own territory. This article frames the incident as a deliberate Russian provocation designed to test NATO's unity and the U.S. commitment to collective defense. The author criticizes the Trump administration's response as inadequate and dismissive, arguing that American disengagement emboldens Russian aggression. The event forced Poland to invoke Article 4 of the NATO treaty, convening all members to address the threat.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has shared her thoughts on the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada." The movie featured a demanding fashion editor, played by Meryl Streep, widely believed to be based on Wintour. In a recent interview, Wintour called the film a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and Streep's "fantastic" performance. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada, uncertain of what to expect, but ultimately found the portrayal to be acceptable, just in time for the film's upcoming sequel.</p>

While Qatar condemned the attack on its sovereign territory, experts believe direct military retaliation against Israel is highly improbable due to Qatar's strategic alliance with the United States. However, the incident has severely strained diplomatic relations and prompted Qatar's emir to state he is "reassessing everything" regarding his country's role as a key mediator in the Gaza ceasefire negotiations, potentially jeopardizing future talks.</p>
