          <p>A search operation is underway for Alec Luhn, an experienced outdoorsman and award-winning climate journalist, who went missing in southwestern Norway. Luhn was on a solo backpacking trip and last made contact on July 31 from Odda, a location near a glacier. His family reported him missing after he failed to board his return flight to the U.K. on Monday. Rescue efforts have been challenged by poor weather, and his family is urging anyone with information to contact local authorities.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible in June 2023 was preventable, blaming owner OceanGate for critical safety failures. The comprehensive report states the company used "intimidation tactics" to avoid regulatory oversight and operated with a "toxic" safety culture. Investigators found the vessel's design was flawed and its structural integrity was likely compromised in prior incidents. The report asserts that co-founder Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, ignored warnings and exhibited negligence.</p>

The agreement comes after Trump's lawyers expressed concerns that the 94-year-old media executive might be too ill to testify later. This unusual stipulation requires Murdoch to submit a sworn declaration on his health and provide ongoing updates on any material changes.</p>

          <p>U.K. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance on disclosing the immigration status of crime suspects needs to change to provide more transparency. The call follows a case involving two men, reportedly Afghan nationals, charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, where police withheld their immigration details, citing national guidelines. Critics, including Reform UK's Nigel Farage, labeled the omission a "cover-up," while proponents of the current rules argue they protect the integrity of legal proceedings and prevent public disorder based on misinformation.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, savers are deciding between short-term and long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). Currently, short-term CDs often offer higher yields than long-term ones, an unusual situation known as an inverted yield curve, which can signal that markets expect future rate cuts. Experts suggest that locking in a long-term CD now could be wise if rates are expected to fall. However, they also advise that personal financial timelines, rather than market predictions, should be the primary factor in choosing a CD term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his criticism of Russia and India, stating that Russia's economy "stinks" and threatening to significantly increase tariffs on India. Trump accused India of "fueling the war machine" by purchasing discounted Russian oil and said he may raise tariffs above the previously mentioned 25% within 24 hours. The aggressive comments mark a souring of relations between Washington and Moscow, which had been more cordial. This escalation follows Trump's recent ultimatum to Russia to secure a peace deal with Ukraine or face severe economic consequences.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society reveals a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This rise is directly linked to an increase in screenings after the recommended age was lowered to 45. One study showed a 62% jump in screenings for this age group between 2019 and 2023. Experts view this as promising news, as early detection makes the cancer highly curable. However, they caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. tariff actions against India for importing Russian goods, analysts believe China is the next likely target but will not cease its oil purchases from Russia. Geopolitical strategists argue that China's strategic need for a stable energy supply outweighs the risk of U.S. tariffs. Russia is currently China's top supplier of crude oil, providing nearly 20% of its total imports in the last year. The U.S. has threatened to implement tariffs if trade with Russia is not curtailed, positioning China for a potential economic confrontation.</p>

          <p>An analysis by The Economist suggests that Democrats are likely at a disadvantage in the ongoing national fight over congressional redistricting. While both parties engage in partisan map-drawing, the article argues that Republicans currently face fewer institutional and legal obstacles to implementing favorable maps. The piece uses the ongoing Texas standoff as a key example of the high-stakes, cynical nature of modern redistricting. The analysis concludes that even if both sides were to abandon principle, the current landscape favors Republican outcomes more than Democratic ones.</p>
