          <p>The UK government has formally requested that Sainsbury's and Morrisons cease advertising heated tobacco products, citing a 2002 law banning tobacco advertising.  Morrisons argues that the law doesn't apply to heated tobacco, which doesn't produce smoke, while Sainsbury's is in contact with the government.  The government maintains that the law does apply to these products, emphasizing the health risks of all tobacco products.  Surveys show that awareness of heated tobacco products has increased, particularly among young adults.</p>
