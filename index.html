          <p>China showcased its advanced military capabilities, including new nuclear missiles and robotic weapons, at a massive parade in Beijing marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The event was notable for the first joint public appearance of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, signaling a deepening alignment against the West. In his address, President Xi emphasized that the world faces a choice between peace and war, framing China as a global power prepared to stand with sanctioned leaders.

          <p>Military analysts suggest that the cutting-edge weaponry displayed during China's recent Victory Day parade indicates the People's Liberation Army is intensifying its preparations for a potential conflict over Taiwan. Although President Xi Jinping did not explicitly mention Taiwan in his speech, the advanced arsenal on display is seen as a direct message about Beijing's focus on safeguarding what it considers its sovereign territory. The showcase of new military technology underscores China's commitment to achieving reunification, by force if necessary. This demonstration of military prowess serves as a key measure of the PLA's evolving capabilities.</p>

          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has called for the government to clarify laws regarding online speech following the controversial arrest of comedian Graham Linehan. Linehan was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence over social media posts critical of transgender people, sparking a debate on free speech. Sir Mark defended the officers' actions based on current legislation but stated that police are in an "impossible position" regarding "toxic culture wars debates." He announced the Met will implement a more stringent triaging process to focus only on cases with a clear risk of harm until the law is updated.</p>

          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its stock rise significantly after a U.S. federal judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in a major antitrust case. The court determined that Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search but will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system. The ruling also permits Google to continue paying companies like Apple to be the default search engine on their devices, though exclusive contracts are now barred. This outcome is viewed as a major victory for Google, removing a significant legal and financial overhang from the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As climate change leads to hotter temperatures, school districts across the U.S. are facing a crisis of unpreparedness, forcing them to cancel classes or dismiss students early. Most American school buildings were designed for a cooler climate, with an estimated 36,000 schools needing HVAC system updates. Experts are calling for comprehensive solutions, including modernizing facilities, increasing green space on campuses to reduce surface heat, and even reconsidering the traditional summer break. The issue disproportionately affects students in low-income areas, raising concerns about both health risks and educational equity as extreme heat becomes more common during the school year.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley are predicting a significant improvement for China's struggling property market in the latter half of the year, following a difficult first half. The report suggests that the pace of decline in sales and profitability for major developers will slow considerably, with a potential sales pickup in the fourth quarter. This optimistic outlook is based on developers' guidance for margin recovery and growth in rental income, as well as a large stock of available homes in major cities. The forecast offers a note of hope for a sector that has been in a slump for nearly five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Lorena has formed in the Pacific Ocean and is forecast to move parallel to the coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula, potentially bringing heavy rainfall and dangerous conditions. The U.S. National Hurricane Center warns of possible "life-threatening flash floods and mudslides," especially in mountainous areas, with some regions expected to receive up to 15 inches of rain. While the storm reached hurricane strength, forecasters anticipate it may weaken back to a tropical storm by Friday as it approaches the coast. A tropical storm warning has been issued for parts of the peninsula.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition in the U.S. Congress is pushing for a vote to compel the Trump administration to release more government files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The move comes after the Justice Department reversed its initial promise to release more details, claiming no further documents exist. Lawmakers, including Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, are using a procedural maneuver to force a vote, hoping to increase pressure on the administration. Several of Epstein's victims are expected at the Capitol to support the effort, framing the release of the files as a critical issue of transparency and human rights.</p>

          <p>An investigation into "CrossPolitic," the flagship podcast of the church denomination to which U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth belongs, reveals it serves as a platform for Christian nationalist and other far-right ideologies. Recent guests have included figures who advocate for theocratic rule, support the criminalization of homosexuality, and praise the rise of authoritarian states like Russia and China. The podcast's themes and hosts' close ties to the denomination's leadership raise questions about the influence of this anti-democratic religious movement on the views of high-level government officials. The content directly opposes principles of liberal democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend among some influential figures on the American right involves questioning the historical consensus on World War II and downplaying the evils of Adolf Hitler. Personalities like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens have used their large platforms to suggest that Hitler was unfairly maligned or that the U.S. should have sided with Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union. This article argues that this revisionism is a deliberate attempt to reverse the post-Holocaust societal taboo against antisemitism in the U.S. By challenging the foundational lessons of the war, these influencers seek to normalize conspiratorial and prejudiced ideas that were prevalent in the pre-war era.</p>

          <p>An analysis of attendance figures for UCLA football games at the Rose Bowl suggests a significant disparity between the announced crowd size and the actual number of people present. The university's announced attendance includes all distributed tickets and credentialed individuals, while scan counts of people entering the stadium are often much lower, sometimes by more than half. This trend highlights a deepening concern for the program, which has seen its five worst home attendance seasons in the last five non-COVID years. The empty seats represent a major loss in revenue and game-day atmosphere for an athletic department that has been operating at a deficit.</p>

          <p>A sports columnist makes a bold prediction that the Los Angeles Rams will make it to the Super Bowl this season, citing several key factors for their potential success. The argument is built on the team's ascending young defense, a strengthened receiving corps with the addition of Davante Adams, and the leadership of coach Sean McVay and quarterback Matthew Stafford. The column suggests that offseason improvements have addressed key weaknesses exposed in last season's narrow playoff loss. With a relatively favorable schedule and a weakened division, the team is positioned for a deep postseason run if it can remain healthy.</p>

          <p>The main building of the British Embassy in Cairo has been temporarily closed after Egyptian authorities removed the concrete security barriers that had surrounded the compound for decades. The move comes amid rising diplomatic tensions over pro-Palestinian protests targeting Egyptian embassies in several Western countries, including the U.K. Egyptian officials have accused host governments of failing to protect their diplomatic missions from vandalism. The removal of the barriers is seen as a retaliatory measure, following calls from a new Egyptian political party to reconsider the security privileges granted to the British mission.</p>
