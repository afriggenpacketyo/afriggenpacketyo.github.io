          <p>The Wimbledon 2025 draw has set up an all-British first-round match between Emma Raducanu and 17-year-old wildcard Mimi Xu. Raducanu, ranked 38th, narrowly missed a seeding and faces a challenging path, potentially meeting 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova in the second round and world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third. Two other British teenage wildcards, Hannah Klugman and Mika Stojsavljevic, also received tough draws against seeded opponents Leylah Fernandez and Ashlyn Krueger, respectively.

          <p>China has expelled two high-profile figures, Vice Admiral Li Hanjun and nuclear scientist Liu Shipeng, from its national legislature, the National People's Congress. Li served as the chief of staff for the People's Liberation Army Navy, while Liu was the deputy chief engineer at the China National Nuclear Corporation. This move is the latest in a wider anti-corruption crackdown within the Chinese military and associated defense industries. The expulsions signal an ongoing and sweeping effort by the government to address corruption and assert control over these critical sectors.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has altered its plan to cut Â£5 billion from the welfare budget, rowing back on more than half of the intended savings. The reversal primarily affects planned changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) for disabled individuals, which will now only apply to new claimants starting in November 2026, protecting 370,000 current recipients. This U-turn, costing an estimated Â£2.5-3 billion, raises questions about the government's fiscal stability and its ability to meet self-imposed borrowing rules, with the shortfall potentially requiring higher taxes or other spending cuts.

          <p>Japan has executed Takahiro Shiraishi, a man convicted of murdering nine people in 2017 after contacting them on social media. This marks the country's first use of capital punishment since July 2022 and the first under Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The execution has reignited debate over Japan's death penalty system, especially following the recent acquittal of a man who spent over four decades on death row. Despite international criticism from groups like Amnesty International, public support for capital punishment in Japan remains high, with a 2024 government survey showing over 80% in favor.</p>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei stock index closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, driven by easing concerns over potential U.S. tariffs and reduced tensions in the Middle East.

The market also saw gains in heavyweight semiconductor stocks, buoyed by optimism for artificial intelligence demand.

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a new rule that removes the 30-day warning period before levying fines on individuals in the United States illegally. The policy, proposed by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, allows for immediate financial penalties for actions such as illegal entry or failure to comply with removal orders. Fines can reach up to $1,000 per day for ignoring a removal order. This approach revives a Trump-era policy that was halted by the Biden administration, with officials stating it is a necessary consequence for breaking immigration laws.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of California, Davis, indicates that illegal disposable vapes may pose a greater health risk than traditional cigarettes. Researchers found hazardous levels of toxic heavy metals, including lead, nickel, and antimony, in popular unregulated vape brands. These substances are classified as carcinogens, with the study noting that all tested vapors exceeded the cancer risk limits for nickel. The lead concentrations in one brand were so high that the lead author initially believed the testing instrument was faulty, highlighting a significant public health concern, particularly for young users.</p>

          <p>The discussion around privatizing the U.S. air traffic control (ATC) system, a topic pushed by President Trump during his first term, has re-emerged. While the current administration is now focused on a multi-billion dollar investment to modernize the FAA's existing infrastructure, some critics still advocate for removing ATC from direct government control, pointing to models in Canada and Europe. Proponents of privatization argue it allows for more flexible investment and efficiency, while opponents express concerns about safety, complexity, and potential disadvantages for smaller airports in the vast U.S. airspace. The aviation industry largely appears to be backing the modernization plan for now.</p>

The legislation proposes major rollbacks in health coverage, including reductions in federal Medicaid spending and stricter eligibility rules.

          <p>The European Commission is expressing growing frustration with China's trade tactics ahead of an important summit, using a "stinking fish" analogy to describe the situation. Brussels feels that Beijing is creating trade barriers, such as tariffs on EU brandy or probes into dairy products, only to then demand concessions for their removal. This sentiment reflects the testy nature of EU-China relations, as Europe finds itself negotiating to undo punitive measures that it believes were unfairly imposed in the first place. The analogy highlights the EU's perception that it is being asked to pay to solve problems created by China.</p>

          <p>A growing number of workers in Germany are unable to cover their living costs on their wages alone, with 826,000 people relying on state benefits in 2024, an increase of 30,000 from the previous year. This has sparked debate over the adequacy of the country's minimum wage, which critics argue has not kept pace with rising living costs. While some economists point to the prevalence of part-time work as the primary issue, others argue that insufficient childcare infrastructure forces many into part-time roles. The figures highlight a deepening challenge of in-work poverty within Europe's largest economy.</p>

The industry also faced disruptions from factory retooling for electric vehicle production. However, there is some optimism as a new deal set to reduce these US import taxes is expected to take effect soon. (not investment advice)</p>

According to a Hotels.com survey, these actions are widely disapproved of by other travelers. Rather than using a heavy-handed approach, many establishments are opting for subtle cues to encourage better decorum. These methods include staff speaking in quieter tones to discourage loud phone calls or providing etiquette guidelines in pre-arrival emails. While some luxury hotels are relaxing traditional standards, others maintain stricter dress codes, especially in specific areas like golf courses.</p>

Immigrants now constitute a record high of nearly one in five U.S. workers, and economists warn that choking off this supply could slow economic growth and fuel inflation. While the administration's stated target is undocumented immigrants, the policies are affecting a much broader group of foreign-born workers who have been living and working legally in the U.S.</p>

Despite official Chinese customs data showing no imports from Iran since 2022, ship tracking indicates that nearly 90% of Iran's crude exports flow to China.

          <p>Safia Middleton-Patel, a 20-year-old goalkeeper for Wales and Manchester United, is preparing for the Women's Euro 2025 while openly sharing her experience with autism. Diagnosed at 18, she describes how she uses hyperfocus to her advantage on the pitch but struggles with sensory overstimulation and social interactions off it. Middleton-Patel explains that misunderstood social cues or overwhelming environments can be debilitating, and she advocates for greater understanding of neurodivergence.
