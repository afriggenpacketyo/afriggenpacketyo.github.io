        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape describes the current U.S. political climate as a "watershed moment" for violent populism, driven by rising political violence and growing public support for it on both the right and left. He explains that this trend is not primarily caused by the internet, but rather rooted in major demographic shifts, specifically the country's transition to a white-minority democracy, which fuels grievances on both sides of the political spectrum. Pape warns that without intervention from political leaders to condemn violence and de-escalate rhetoric, this dangerous era of conflict will likely worsen over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his NFL earnings into a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds, including high-profile companies like Anthropic and Neuralink. Following a strategy inspired by former player Marshawn Lynch, Barkley lives off his endorsement deals while investing his salary to build long-term, generational wealth for his family. Initially focused on safer investments like index funds, he has more recently embraced riskier ventures in startups and cryptocurrency, viewing it as essential for a career that can be cut short by injury at any moment.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders actively sought to avoid being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2025 NFL Draft. Sanders allegedly communicated his desire to join a team where he would have a realistic opportunity to play, rather than being a backup to two-time MVP Lamar Jackson. The Ravens, who had intended to select him, ultimately chose another player, and Sanders was later drafted by the Cleveland Browns. He is now positioned as the third-string quarterback for the Browns, behind Joe Flacco and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel.</p>

          <p>Members of the Sikh community gathered to protest in the West Midlands town of Oldbury after a woman in her 20s was sexually assaulted by two men in what police are treating as a racially aggravated attack. The victim, who was on her way to work, released a statement thanking her family and the community for their support while police hunt for the suspects. Community leaders at the demonstration expressed outrage, calling for politicians to do more to protect communities from division and extremism. The incident has heightened fears among local Sikhs, especially following other recent racially motivated attacks in the region.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The investigation reveals the shooter used a high-powered, bolt-action rifle from a building rooftop, firing a single shot in what is described as a targeted attack. Investigators recovered the weapon and bullet casings with strange inscriptions, and tracked the suspect using security footage, palm prints, and DNA evidence.

          <p>Romania has reported that a Russian drone violated its airspace, making it the second NATO member, after Poland, to experience such an incursion. The drone was detected by Romanian F-16 fighter jets that were monitoring Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure near the Danube border before it disappeared from radar. The incident, which did not pose an immediate danger to populated areas, drew condemnation from the EU and prompted Poland to increase its air defense readiness. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted the breach was a deliberate expansion of the conflict by Russia, a claim Moscow has not yet addressed.</p>

International doctors and nurses describe treating toddlers with horrific burns and shrapnel wounds who have been orphaned or separated from their parents during Israel's intense military offensive in Gaza City. With the healthcare system on the brink of collapse, aid workers highlight that tens of thousands of children have been killed or injured, creating what one agency calls the largest orphan crisis in modern history.

He criticized the fact that Prince Andrew, who has denied all claims and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre, continues to live in a palace.

The results are viewed as a critical test for Merz's federal coalition government, as the AfD's success could increase pressure on national policies related to immigration and security.

          <p>The popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is surging, with nearly half of Americans having used them as an alternative to traditional credit cards. These services allow consumers to split purchases into short-term, interest-free installments, a model that directly challenges the revenue streams of credit card companies by diverting transaction volume. However, for banks and credit rating agencies, the rise of BNPL represents a significant data gap, as these loans are often not reported to credit bureaus. This creates a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile, making it difficult for lenders to accurately assess their overall debt and financial risk. (not investment advice)</p>

The author points out inconsistencies in who is eligible for the tax benefit, questioning why professions like electricians are included while teachers and postal workers are not. The piece ultimately advocates for eliminating tipping altogether, suggesting employers should be mandated to pay a living wage, which would create a more stable and equitable system for workers.

          <p>An Iowa official has publicly refused to comply with the governor's order to fly flags at half-staff in honor of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Jon Green, the Democratic chair of the Johnson County Board of Supervisors, condemned Kirk's killing but stated he would not bestow county honors on a man whose rhetoric he believes was divisive and harmful to marginalized communities. Green also highlighted that the governor did not issue similar orders for other victims of political violence, such as a Democratic lawmaker from Minnesota. The decision has drawn criticism from Republican Governor Kim Reynolds but has been supported by another Democratic supervisor on the board.</p>

          <p>Two men have been arrested on suspicion of metal theft following a house explosion in Bradford, UK, that injured five people. The blast completely destroyed an empty house and caused damage to two neighboring properties, resulting in minor injuries to a man, woman, and child inside them. A 27-year-old man was found seriously injured near the scene and arrested, while a 28-year-old who initially fled was apprehended later. Neighbors described a massive "boom" that shook the entire area, with debris from the destroyed house scattered across the street.</p>

          <p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reports that the 16-year-old who opened fire at a Colorado high school was an active user of a "violent gore" website known for extremist content. The website, which allows users to view graphic violence, has been frequented by several other recent school shooters, suggesting a pattern of online radicalization in these spaces. The shooter, Desmond Holly, had posted images of another school shooter and tactical gear with extremist symbols on social media prior to the attack. The ADL highlights these online platforms as a common thread connecting recent acts of school violence, creating a culture that glorifies such attacks.</p>

          <p>Amazon has introduced an AI-powered feature called "Hear the Highlights," which provides short, AI-voiced audio summaries of products. This tool synthesizes information from product descriptions, customer reviews, and other web sources to give shoppers a quick overview, potentially saving them from sifting through thousands of individual comments. While the feature aims to improve accessibility and convenience, critics raise concerns that it could dilute the nuanced, personal insights found in human reviews. There is also a risk that the AI could blend promotional marketing language with genuine user feedback, potentially blurring the line between advertisement and authentic experience.</p>

          <h2>Commentary: Remembering Charlie Kirk's Divisive Politics is Not an Endorsement of Violence</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary argues that while the assassination of Charlie Kirk is a tragedy that should be unequivocally condemned, it is dishonest to retroactively sanitize his life's work. The article criticizes recent portrayals of Kirk as a virtuous practitioner of good-faith debate, pointing out that his public appearances were often trolling affairs designed to humiliate opponents and spread hateful rhetoric about marginalized groups. The author asserts that one can mourn his death and reject political violence while still being honest about Kirk's opposition to civil rights and his promotion of divisive conspiracy theories. True commitment to democratic values requires opposing both violence and the intolerant politics Kirk championed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary argues that Israeli society has become trapped in a state of denial regarding the suffering in Gaza, normalizing the ongoing war and viewing the conflict through a mythical, zero-sum lens. The author suggests that international actions, such as the planned recognition of a Palestinian state by several Western nations, are crucial for piercing this bubble of indifference. The article critiques the failed peace process, asserting it was doomed by ignoring the historical grievances and existential needs of both sides. It concludes that re-establishing Palestinian rights as a precondition, rather than an outcome, is essential to breaking the cycle of violence and fatalism.</p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are experiencing heightened fear and apprehension following a Supreme Court ruling that allows federal agents to conduct warrantless raids and profile individuals based on appearance. The Department of Homeland Security has vowed to "flood the zone," creating a dilemma for undocumented workers who must choose between risking deportation by going to work or facing eviction by staying home. Community organizers and volunteer groups are mobilizing to monitor for ICE activity and provide support, but they report that the economic pressure is forcing many back into vulnerable public spaces despite the increased danger.</p>

          <p>A new Trump administration report titled "Make Our Children Healthy Again," led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is facing criticism for its near-total omission of nicotine, smoking, and tobacco as health risks. Public health advocates and parents of children harmed by vaping were dismayed that the 20-page strategy to combat childhood chronic disease barely mentions the issue. Critics note this contrasts with President Trump's first-term focus on youth vaping and follows recent administration moves to cut funding for federal tobacco control programs. While the report recommends awareness campaigns about vaping, experts argue this is insufficient without stronger regulation.</p>

          <p>In preparation for the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, New York, Europe's golf team is using a novel training method: virtual reality headsets that simulate a hostile crowd by shouting abuse at them. Rory McIlroy revealed that Captain Luke Donald provided the equipment to help players desensitize themselves to the intense and potentially vitriolic environment they expect to face on U.S. soil. The initiative is part of a detailed strategy to overcome Europe's poor record in away matches, as they have not won a Ryder Cup in America since 2012. Players can even customize the virtual heckling to be as harsh as they want.</p>

          <p>As the WNBA playoffs begin, analysts are predicting a highly competitive postseason, with the Minnesota Lynx and Las Vegas Aces emerging as top contenders for the championship. The Lynx, fueled by a desire for redemption after a controversial finals loss last year, are seen as a dominant force with the league's top defense and MVP candidate Napheesa Collier. However, the reigning champion Aces are entering the playoffs on a 16-game winning streak, led by superstar A'ja Wilson. While the absence of rookies Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese may change the media narrative, the depth of talent across teams like the New York Liberty and Atlanta Dream promises an exciting tournament.</p>
