            <p>China is focusing on increasing household income to mitigate the economic impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. While progress in stimulating domestic spending is debated, many Chinese businesses are catering to both export and domestic markets, reducing vulnerability to external shocks. However, China's export sector is expected to face challenges due to high tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by the United States. Despite pledges to open up to global investment, the external environment may become less favorable for Chinese exporters due to these tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield was relieved of her duties at NATO's military committee in Brussels, marking another dismissal of a senior military officer during Trump's second term. It is unclear what specific reasons were given for her removal, although her name had previously appeared on a list of individuals deemed 'woke' at the Defense Department. Chatfield had served in her NATO role since 2023 and was the first woman to head the Naval War College. The firings of military officers during Trumpâ€™s second term have raised questions about the administration's direction.</p>

            <p>President Trump has defended his administration's tariffs, despite concerns about a potential trade war and market declines. Economists at Goldman Sachs raised the odds of a recession to 45% due to the tariffs, while JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned they could slow the economy and increase inflation. Trump stated he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs and urged Americans to 'hang tough,' claiming China has been hit harder. He also suggested that sometimes 'you have to take medicine to fix something,' indicating a willingness to accept short-term market pain for long-term economic gains. (not investment advice)</p>

News organizations initially reported the false information before retracting it. This incident highlights the dangers of social media in spreading misinformation and its impact on financial markets.

            <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s endorsement of the MMR vaccine has ignited controversy among anti-vaccine activists. Kennedy's statement, made after meeting with families affected by a measles outbreak, contradicts his past skepticism about vaccines. Anti-vaccine figures criticized Kennedy's endorsement, questioning his commitment to challenging the medical establishment. Kennedy also promoted alternative therapies, which experts say are ineffective for treating measles. The endorsement has sparked debate about the role of vaccines in public health and Kennedy's stance on the issue.</p>

            <p>The Dow has dropped significantly since Trump's tariffs were rolled out, reminiscent of the economic shutdown during the Covid-19 pandemic. The tariffs, including a 10% across-the-board tax, have sparked concerns about higher prices and slow economic growth. While some Senate Republicans are attempting to curb Trump's tariff authority, it's unlikely to succeed. Economists predict that if the tariffs remain in place, the country could face a recession.
