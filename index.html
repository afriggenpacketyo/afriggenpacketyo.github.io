          <p>The Florida Panthers clinched their second straight Stanley Cup championship with a decisive 5-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6, marking the NHL's first repeat winners since 2020-21. Sam Reinhart's standout performance included four goals, a feat last achieved in 1957, while Matthew Tkachuk sealed the win with a final goal. Goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar performance, allowing only one goal, further solidified the Panthers' dominance, leading to celebrations filled with rats thrown on the ice. The team's success is attributed to a strong core of players and strategic acquisitions, positioning them as a potential modern-day dynasty with their consistent finals appearances and recent championships. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly approved attack plans targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, specifically the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, but awaits Iran's willingness to negotiate an end to their nuclear program. Sources indicate that Trump is gauging the reaction of his base, engaging with Vice President JD Vance to assess their support for potential strikes against Iran. The President has also been briefed on the security vulnerabilities of U.S. Army bases, given the potential for Iranian retaliation, and the decision comes amidst Israeli discoveries that some Iranian air defenses remain intact. Trump's stance reflects growing concerns over Iran's nuclear capabilities and regional security. </p>

He acknowledged the challenges in preparing the squad due to his recent stint as interim head coach of the senior team, as well as the loss of key players to other clubs.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the strength of the economy, citing solid labor market conditions and low inflation, but cautioned that new tariffs could drive up inflation and slow growth.

          <p>A divergence in views regarding Iran's nuclear program has reportedly caused a rift between President Donald Trump and his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard testified before Congress that U.S. intelligence agencies believe Iran has not resumed its nuclear weapons program, while Trump stated that Iran is "very close" to obtaining a nuclear bomb. This disagreement highlights the growing divide within Trump's "America First" movement regarding potential U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, mirroring debates from the 2003 Iraq War. The differing perspectives underscore the complex considerations surrounding U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that American taxpayers will not fund the appeal of President Donald Trump's $83 million defamation case, denying his request to have Justice Department lawyers argue on his behalf. The case stems from columnist E. Jean Carroll's accusation that Trump sexually assaulted her in the mid-1990s and defamed her in 2019, allegations Trump denies. DOJ lawyers argued that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential role, justifying Justice Department defense, but the court rejected this argument.

          <p>The home of slain Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman was broken into overnight Wednesday, days after she and her husband were fatally shot. Police reported that the plywood covering a rear window had been pried off, and the window was broken to gain entry. While family members do not believe anything was missing, the break-in has outraged neighbors who are already grieving the loss of the Hortmans. The suspect in the killings, Vance Boelter, is in custody and facing murder charges, and authorities believe he also targeted other state lawmakers. </p>

          <p>The federal government announced it will end the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's specialized support for LGBTQ+ youth next month, with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) stating that it will focus on serving all help seekers. The Trevor Project, a nonprofit focusing on suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth, criticized the decision, noting that the program has provided life-saving services to over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people. Studies show that LGBTQ+ youth report higher rates of mental health issues and suicidal thoughts and behaviors than their peers. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, free, confidential help is available 24/7 by calling or texting 988. </p>

The call between the two leaders occurred after Trump claimed to have "stopped the war between Pakistan and India," and compared the conflict to the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran.

          <p>A new study published in JAMA finds a link between addiction to social media, mobile phones, and video games and a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in teenagers. The study, which followed over 4,000 kids starting at ages 9 to 10, found that by age 14, a significant portion of the participants showed signs of addiction to these screens. Teens with high and increasing addiction to mobile phones and social media were associated with a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The study suggests that it is important to look for warning signs of screen addiction, particularly as they may relate to higher depression risk or suicide risk in teenagers. </p>

          <p>Social Security is now projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year earlier than previously forecast, potentially requiring a 19% cut in monthly benefits. The Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report attributes the change partly to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees. The trust fund's depletion is due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population, with spending outpacing income. Experts suggest raising revenue by lifting the income cap or making changes to benefits to address the program's financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>
