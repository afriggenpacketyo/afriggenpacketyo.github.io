        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how student loan borrowers in default may have up to 15% of their Social Security benefits garnished to repay their debt. Experts emphasize that beneficiaries will be left with at least $750 a month after the offset. Borrowers are reportedly receiving less notice of these offsets, limiting their ability to challenge the action. The article advises borrowers to ensure their contact information is current with their loan servicer and to seek help if they receive a notice of offset, as they may be able to contest it due to financial hardship or a pending loan discharge.</p>

          <p>In the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean Combs, Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified about alleged drug-fueled sex sessions with male prostitutes orchestrated by Combs. Ventura described the sessions, referred to as "freak-offs," as lasting for days and leaving her feeling disgusted and humiliated. She detailed how Combs allegedly dictated her appearance and sex acts, and how the sessions grew more elaborately staged over time. Ventura stated she participated initially to please Combs, but eventually felt it became a job, and that she stayed out of fear of his power and potential blackmail. This article describes Ventura's testimony as vital to the prosecution's case, and details the judge's denial of a request to downplay Ventura's visible pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry plans to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, possibly starting in April 2026, to combat the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy involves covering normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system, although epidurals are expected to remain outside coverage. This move aims to standardize childbirth costs nationwide, which currently vary significantly by prefecture. While the government provides a lump-sum payment for each childbirth, costs often exceed this amount, raising concerns among obstetricians about potential financial strain on medical institutions.</p>

          <p>A Hawaii judge denied bail to Dr. Gerhardt Konig, an anesthesiologist charged with attempted second-degree murder for allegedly trying to kill his wife while hiking. Prosecutors argued Konig posed a flight risk and danger to his wife, citing evidence he attempted to hide and a call to his son admitting the crime. Konig's wife told police he pushed her and struck her head with a rock, then attempted to use syringes on her. The defense argued that having such drugs at home is not unusual for doctors, but the judge sided with the prosecution.</p>

Despite President Ahmed al-Sharaa's efforts to reassure religious minorities and the lifting of U.S. sanctions, the country remains unstable due to a centralized government dependent on former jihadists. The article discusses attacks on Alawites and Druze communities, the involvement of Israel and Turkey, and the lack of a real army. It presents differing views on Sharaa's intentions, with some seeing him as trying to unify the country and others viewing him as adopting a strategy of crushing minorities into submitting to Sunni rule.</p>

Warnock contends that providing health care coverage without these requirements would encourage people to work by ensuring they are healthy. He criticizes the Republican proposal, which could put millions at risk of losing Medicaid coverage, and contrasts it with his view that health care is a basic right that supports a stronger economy.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to apply new rules requiring migrants to wait 10 years for permanent settlement to those already in the country, doubling the current five-year period. The move, subject to public consultation, aims to address concerns about a surge in settlement applications. While there will be exceptions for dependents of British citizens and those contributing to the UK's economy and society, the change has been criticized as a betrayal. Some migrants are considering leaving the UK due to the uncertainty, and the Migration Observatory notes the UK would become more restrictive compared to other high-income countries.</p>

          <p>Taiwo Awoniyi's injury, sustained in a collision with the post during a Premier League match, has raised questions about the 'late flag' offside law. Awoniyi required surgery after the incident, which occurred when he attempted to get on the end of a cross by Anthony Elanga. Replays showed Elanga was offside in the build-up, leading to debate about whether the law should be changed to prevent similar injuries. This article states that sources have reported that Awoniyi suffered a ruptured intestine.</p>

          <p>A European court ruled that the European Commission did not adequately explain its denial of a journalist's request for text messages between Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer's CEO regarding Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The court stated the commission failed to provide credible explanations for why the messages could not be found and why they were deemed unimportant. The New York Times, which brought the case, hailed the ruling as a victory for transparency. The case raises questions about public access to negotiations involving taxpayer money and public policy, and comes at a critical time for the Commission's reputation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Trump's attacks on the courts follow a pattern of 'court-baiting' seen in backsliding democracies. By adopting popular but likely illegal policies, the executive branch forces courts into a lose-lose situation, undermining public support for the judiciary. The author compares this strategy to tactics used in Turkey and Mexico, where leaders have leveraged popular policies to weaken judicial checks on executive power. The article emphasizes the importance of defending the judiciary by reframing the executive's policies and upholding constitutional limits.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential impact of Israel's attempt to kill Muhammad Sinwar, a key Hamas leader in Gaza. While his assassination would be a tactical success, it is unlikely to change Hamas's strategic outlook or soften Israel's approach to cease-fire negotiations. The article notes that Hamas has weathered the assassinations of many leaders and that the war's trajectory depends on both Hamas and Israel. It also highlights the views of analysts who believe Israel's insistence on continuing the war is the main obstacle to a cease-fire.</p>
