        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn, with Bitcoin falling to approximately $115,000 after reaching a new record high last week. The sell-off was primarily triggered by higher-than-expected inflation data, which dampened hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut and led to over $576 million in forced liquidations of long positions. Disappointing comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent regarding the strategic bitcoin reserve further contributed to the negative sentiment. The market-wide slump also impacted crypto-related stocks as investors await further economic cues from the upcoming Jackson Hole symposium. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami is hearing arguments to determine if detainees at a temporary migrant facility, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," are being denied their due process rights. Lawyers for the detainees argue that their clients lack adequate access to legal counsel and are being held without formal charges, preventing them from seeking bond. In response, state and federal attorneys claim that initial logistical issues have been resolved and a system for legal communication is now in place. This lawsuit is one of several legal challenges facing the controversial detention center.</p>

          <p>A social media trend is drawing widespread attention to "sorority cold rooms," which are large, communal sleeping dormitories kept at cold temperatures, often found in chapter houses at major universities. The spaces, which feature rows of bunk beds, are designed to be dark and quiet to promote better sleep, with rules against lights and audible alarms. While the concept has been around for decades, its recent viral fame on platforms like TikTok has sparked a debate, with some users praising it as a dream sleeping situation while others raise concerns about hygiene and fire safety.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth has successfully negotiated a deal to sign 19-year-old Scottish winger Ben Doak from Liverpool for an initial fee of £20 million, with an additional £5 million in potential add-ons. The move is expected to provide Doak with more consistent first-team football opportunities, which were limited at Liverpool. This transfer is part of a broader summer sales strategy for Liverpool that has generated significant funds and helps with profit and sustainability rule calculations. Bournemouth has also been active in the transfer market, rebuilding its squad after several high-profile departures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study in rural Kenya has revealed that unconditional cash transfers of $1,000 to low-income households can be as effective as medical interventions in saving infants' lives. The research, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that infant mortality was nearly halved for babies born to families who received the payment. The funds enabled families to access better healthcare, particularly for hospital deliveries, and improved nutrition. The positive results suggest that direct cash aid is a powerful tool for improving child survival rates in low-income regions.</p>

          <p>The cable news network MSNBC will be renamed My Source News Opinion World, or MS Now, later this year as part of its parent company's separation from Comcast's NBCUniversal. The rebranding includes dropping the iconic peacock logo to establish a distinct identity for the new standalone media company, Versant. This change accompanies an aggressive hiring push to create a newsroom independent from NBC News, including its first-ever Washington, D.C., bureau. The network's leadership has assured employees that while the name is changing, its core mission and commitment to its audience will remain the same.</p>

          <p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the 28-year-old son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been officially charged with multiple offenses, including sexual assault, domestic violence, and assault, following a year-long police investigation. The charges encompass 32 criminal acts, and Hoiby could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years if convicted on the most serious counts. Hoiby, who does not hold a royal title, has denied the most severe accusations through his lawyer. The royal palace has stated that it is up to the courts to decide the outcome of the case.</p>

          <p>A research associate from the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations has criticized Donald Trump's mediation tactics, describing them as a heavy-handed approach that uses America's dominant position to force short-term agreements. In an article, Zhang Luwei argued that this style of power politics fails to address the deep-rooted historical grievances underlying complex geopolitical conflicts. She suggested that such methods reduce intricate disputes to "schoolyard fights" and may sow the seeds for long-term friction, despite any temporary peace deals achieved.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the ongoing peace negotiations for the war in Ukraine, arguing that Russia's current demands for territory and demilitarization remain maximalist and unacceptable for Kyiv. It suggests that any perceived concessions from Moscow, such as allowing a European security presence, may be a tactic to obscure its core demands and weaken Western resolve. The author concludes that the only plausible way to achieve a lasting peace is for the U.S. and its allies to significantly arm Ukraine for a protracted conflict, creating a battlefield reality that convinces Russia it cannot achieve its goals militarily.</p>

          <p>As peace talks continue, this article provides a detailed overview of the Ukrainian territories currently under Russian control and the significant legal obstacles to any potential land-for-peace agreement. Russia has amended its constitution to claim the annexed regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, making any reversal politically difficult. Conversely, Ukraine's constitution explicitly lists these regions as indivisible parts of its sovereign territory, legally barring the government from ceding them. These conflicting constitutional realities, alongside the geopolitical importance of the Donbas region, create a formidable challenge for diplomatic efforts to end the war.</p>

          <p>A 33-year-old man, Javon Riley, has been found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent for his involvement in a gangland shooting in Dalston, London. The attack left a nine-year-old girl with a bullet permanently lodged in her brain after she was struck while eating ice cream with her family. Riley was also convicted of the attempted murder of three men who were the intended targets in what prosecutors described as a feud between rival Turkish gangs. While Riley was found to have played a key role in the operation, the gunman who fired the weapon has not been identified.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undertaking a major overhaul of its tax system, with plans to abolish the simplified lump-sum tax method used by millions of small businesses by 2026. All businesses will be required to switch to a more complex declaration system, which involves formal accounting and record-keeping. The reform is part of a national strategy to boost the private sector, increase government revenue for infrastructure projects, and combat corruption. However, the transition is causing significant distress for many small business owners, who face steep tax hikes and increased administrative burdens.</p>

          <p>China is carefully observing the diplomatic engagement between the U.S. and Russia regarding the war in Ukraine, viewing the Trump-Putin summit as a key indicator of Trump's high-stakes negotiating style. While Beijing publicly welcomes peace efforts, analysts suggest that Trump's transactional approach and unpredictability are being studied for lessons applicable to U.S.-China relations, including disputes over trade and Taiwan. The article posits that China is unlikely to alter its pro-Russia stance but will use the summit to gauge potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy and its own strategic leverage.</p>

          <p>China's market for public cloud services supporting artificial intelligence experienced a massive 55% increase in 2024, reaching a value of $2.7 billion.

This move is a direct response to intense price competition and significant overcapacity within China's home market, where EV and battery factories are operating at well below half their potential capacity. The push abroad represents a key part of the Chinese government's strategy to build a global economic presence and find new markets for its leading industries, despite the higher costs and risks associated with foreign investment.</p>
