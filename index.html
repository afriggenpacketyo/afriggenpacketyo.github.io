          <p>Retired Army General Stanley McChrystal spoke on "Face the Nation" about his new book, "On Character: Choices That Define a Life," emphasizing the importance of character at the individual level. He argues that national leaders are a symptom, not the cause, of a decline in trust and values. McChrystal also addressed the role of the military, aligning with Secretary Hegseth on the need for a strong warrior ethos but differing on the impact of DEI programs, viewing them as a distraction. The General also expressed disappointment with decisions regarding Afghan allies, stressing the importance of upholding American values and commitments. He also suggests that America needs to harness talent from every corner of our society, everyone.</p>

          <p>Student loan borrowers are facing the resumption of wage garnishment after a half-decade pause, with the Trump administration set to seize federal tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits from defaulted borrowers. More than 5 million borrowers are currently in default, a number that could rise to 10 million. This policy shift is causing anxiety among borrowers, many of whom struggle to afford their payments due to the high cost of living. Marceline Paul, a retiree, fears she will be unable to visit her home country if her Social Security benefits are garnished.

          <p>A Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Scarlett Johansson and Bad Bunny explores the nuances of relationships and cultural misunderstandings. The sketch revolves around two couples vying for a table at a bar, with the men speaking in Spanish, which is misinterpreted by eavesdropping barflies. The humor lies in the contrast between the macho image projected by the men and their actual feelings of being trapped in difficult relationships. The article emphasizes how the live show's limitations and the terse subtitles elided the subtleties of Hernández and Bad Bunny’s banter in Caribbean-inflected Spanish, and how much truth can we really discern from a stranger we watch from across the distance of a bar table or a language barrier.</p>

Despite a Kamala Harris cameo, SNL hasn't quite figured out a consistently groundbreaking way to lampoon modern politics, but that's okay.

Nike offered Michael Jordan $2.5 million to wear their shoes, triple what anyone else in the league was making. Nike hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years, but they sold $126 million in year one. The Jordan Brand, a standalone division within Nike, generates some $7 billion for Nike annually. Jason Mayden, chief design officer for the Jordan Brand, says Jordan is still involved with the Air Jordan brand.
