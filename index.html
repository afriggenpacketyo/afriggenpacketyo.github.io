          <p>Shares for ad-tech company The Trade Desk experienced a record-breaking drop of nearly 40% following the announcement of its CFO's departure. While the company's quarterly earnings beat expectations, investors were more concerned about the growing competition from Amazon's advertising platform and the potential impact of tariffs on ad spending. Amazon's demand-side platform is gaining traction, leading analysts to question The Trade Desk's long-term value proposition and prompting a ratings downgrade from Wedbush.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James, seeking information on her office's civil fraud investigation into former President Trump and a separate probe into the National Rifle Association. According to sources, the investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York, is examining whether James's actions violated the civil rights of the subjects in those cases. A spokesperson for James condemned the move as a blatant "weaponization of the justice system" and a form of political retribution by the current administration. The AG's office affirmed it stands by its successful litigation.</p>

          <p>Over two years after declaring bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond is relaunching with its first new brick-and-mortar store, 'Bed Bath & Beyond Home,' opening in Nashville. The new venture, managed by The Brand House Collective, aims to recapture its former customer base by honoring the brand's iconic legacy coupons. The store will feature a more focused inventory on home decor, bedroom, bath, and laundry products. While this marks a significant step in resurrecting the brand, which previously closed all its locations, experts note the company's underlying financials remain troubled, posing an uphill battle for the relaunch's success.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe publicly mistook a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast for "illegal migrants," posting a picture on social media and alerting authorities. The crew was actually a team of four attempting to row from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research. After the confusion was clarified by HM Coastguard, Lowe issued an apology and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowers, one of whom is a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" and noted the "vigilante-style" response it provoked on the shore.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deadline for Russia to cease its war in Ukraine is set to expire, with the White House threatening to impose secondary tariffs of around 100% on Russia's trade partners if Moscow fails to comply. This marks a significant escalation in pressure, reversing an earlier, more conciliatory stance toward the Kremlin. Despite a recent, last-minute meeting between U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and President Putin, which President Trump called "highly productive," progress on a ceasefire remains stalled over Russia's maximalist demands. The potential tariffs could devastate Russia's remaining client base for its oil exports.</p>

The author argues that the book is a masterpiece of the midlife crisis, a theme that becomes more profound upon rereading at different stages of life. Initially perceived in youth as a commentary on post-war society, the novel's juxtaposition of its 51-year-old protagonist's party preparations with a war veteran's suicide reveals deeper meanings about mortality and existence. The author looks forward to rereading the book again at Clarissa Dalloway's age, anticipating new insights that only time can provide.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, Birmingham Phoenix secured an 11-run victory over Trent Rockets. Trent Rockets captain Nat Sciver-Brunt delivered an impressive performance, scoring 64 runs off 40 balls in an effort to chase down Phoenix's target of 149. Despite her dominant innings, her teammates struggled, and her dismissal on the 96th ball effectively ended the Rockets' chances, finishing at 137-6. For Birmingham Phoenix, opener Emma Lamb's 55 runs and a key partnership with Ellyse Perry were instrumental in setting their winning score of 148-5.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies like Meta and Alphabet are seeing significant boosts in digital advertising revenue, largely driven by their substantial investments in artificial intelligence.

In contrast, smaller platforms such as Snap and Pinterest reported lukewarm results, struggling with issues like botched ad platform updates and tariff-related uncertainty. The trend suggests that amid economic caution, advertisers are gravitating toward larger, more stable platforms, leaving little room for error for their smaller competitors.

The case stems from a dispute where a district judge, James Boasberg, ordered the government to halt the removal of migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, but planes had already left U.S. airspace. Judge Boasberg found officials in contempt for what he called "willful disregard" of his order. However, the D.C.

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to U.S. courts against blocking his tariff policies, claiming such a move would be impossible to recover from and could trigger a severe economic downturn comparable to the 1929 Great Depression. His comments come as a federal appeals court considers legal challenges to the tariffs, which argue the president may have exceeded the emergency powers granted by Congress. Trump asserted on social media that the tariffs have had a "huge positive impact" on the stock market and that overturning them would jeopardize the nation's wealth and power.

          <p>Market analysts are observing signs that bitcoin's predictable four-year price cycle, which has historically revolved around its "halving" event, may be ending. The recent approval of bitcoin ETFs has introduced significant institutional investment, altering traditional market dynamics and causing bitcoin to hit a new all-time high before the last halving, rather than after. Experts suggest that a more mature market, supportive regulatory shifts, and reduced risk of major crypto-specific blowups are replacing the old pattern with behavior more correlated to macroeconomic factors. This could mean the era of 80% price crashes is over. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) will take over the investigation into allegations that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused vulnerable children in Rotherham during the 1990s and early 2000s. The decision follows public outcry and calls for transparency after the BBC reported that five women, who were victims of grooming gangs, also claimed abuse by police officers. South Yorkshire Police requested the handover to ensure the investigation is victim-centered and to encourage other potential survivors to come forward. The inquiry will now be managed by Operation Stovewood, the NCA's long-running investigation into child sexual abuse in Rotherham.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling with debt but unable to afford a consolidation loan due to high interest rates or other financial pressures, there are several viable alternatives. This article outlines five strategies to consider, including negotiating directly with creditors for lower rates or extended payment terms. Other options involve debt settlement, where you pay less than the total amount owed in a lump sum, or transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card to halt interest accumulation temporarily. Additionally, working with a nonprofit credit counseling agency to create a structured debt management plan can provide a more affordable path to financial freedom.</p>

          <p>After a significant surge over the past 20 months, the price of gold could soon experience a temporary decline, offering a more affordable entry point for investors. This article suggests that a few key factors could contribute to this drop, including cooling inflation, as gold prices often move in tandem with the inflation rate. A de-escalation of geopolitical tensions, which historically drive demand for safe-haven assets, could also cause prices to retreat. Consequently, a combination of these factors might lead to lower investor demand, which would further pressure the price of gold downward. (not investment advice)</p>

The program aimed to reduce pollution and utility bills by funding rooftop solar, community solar farms, and battery storage. Critics of the move argue it will prevent the most vulnerable households from accessing cost-saving clean energy.</p>

Altman expressed that as long as the models are on a steep improvement curve, it is rational to run at a loss.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz cited deep concern for the suffering civilian population and called on Israel to improve the humanitarian situation.
