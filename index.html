          <p>The head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Holger Münch, has warned that some young people are organizing themselves into groups to commit serious crimes after being radicalized by far-right ideologies. This warning comes after German police cracked down on a far-right extremist cell with members as young as 14. Separately, train services at Hamburg's main station have returned to normal after a knife attack by a female suspect injured 18 people on Friday.

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments, according to the NHS. These centers will be open to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, providing specialized care for those in acute mental distress. The NHS aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, avoiding long waits in A&E. However, some experts are skeptical of the scheme, calling for better funding of NHS mental health services and more robust testing of the model.</p>

          <p>A former British soldier-turned-smuggler has revealed how he transported Vietnamese migrants to the UK via yachts into private marinas, which he described as having minimal security. The smuggler, identified as Nick, also detailed how he smuggled Albanian people in cars onto ferries, where they would jump into lorries mid-journey. He claims the routes were "easy" and "low risk", expressing anger that he was jailed for a crime still easily committed.

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan’s representative office, relocating it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, as it strengthens its relationship with Beijing. This move underscores a growing alignment between African nations and China, driven by robust economic ties. Meanwhile, Somalia has banned Taiwanese passport holders, a move seen as retaliation for Taiwan’s growing ties with Somaliland. Taiwan's only official diplomatic ally in Africa is eSwatini, and only a limited number of countries host commercial or trade offices for the island.</p>

          <p>Germany is often praised for confronting its Nazi past, but this reckoning is selectively applied, embraced when it enhances Germany's self-image but ignored when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. The Herbert Quandt Media prize, which celebrates the legacy of an early SS supporter who oversaw slave labor, is awarded to journalists from leading media outlets, effectively whitewashing the legacy of a figure who should have faced war crimes charges. This selective amnesia extends to street names honoring colonial administrators and a refusal to pay reparations to descendants of genocide victims in Namibia.</p>
