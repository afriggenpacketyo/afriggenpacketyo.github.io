          <p>Officials from the United States and China commenced trade talks in Geneva, marking the first face-to-face discussions since President Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. The meetings aim to resolve a trade war that has disrupted financial markets and import activities in both countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent leads the U.S. delegation, while Vice Premier He Lifeng represents China. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter expressed hope that the talks would yield positive results for the global economy, though a swift resolution is unlikely as negotiations are expected to be a long and complex process.</p>

          <p>Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital reached a $750 million settlement with victims of gynecologist Robert Hadden, who sexually assaulted patients for over two decades. The settlement raises questions about how Hadden was able to continue his crimes for so long, with accusations that his employers knew about his behavior and allowed him to continue practicing medicine. Hadden was convicted in 2023 and sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients across state lines to sexually abuse them. Victims express gratitude for the settlement but emphasize the need for ongoing vigilance to prevent future abuse and hold institutions accountable.</p>

          <p>Universities in Republican-led states are facing increasing pressure from both state legislators and the federal government, creating a challenging environment for academic freedom and diversity initiatives. Many private colleges are pushing back against federal funding cuts and diversity bans, while faculty at public universities are calling for mutual support against government repression. In states like Indiana and Florida, conservative legislators are implementing measures to restrict academic freedom and target diversity programs.

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct and common sense in decision-making, contrasting it with over-reliance on data and research. Diller recounts his experiences at ABC, where he championed the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week," and emphasizes that predicting public appetite is impossible. He praises the use of instinct over data, noting that too much information can overload and obscure good ideas. Diller shares anecdotes about greenlighting projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" based on their compelling stories.</p>

          <p>At least seven people died in Mogadishu, Somalia, after heavy rains overwhelmed the city's drainage system, leading to severe flooding. Major roads were cut off, and several houses collapsed due to the intense rainfall, which lasted about eight hours. Rescue efforts are underway as residents were trapped in their homes, and some were forced to seek shelter on rooftops. The floodwaters also disrupted operations at Aden Abdulle International Airport, though flights have since resumed.

President Trump announced the ceasefire, claiming U.S. mediation, a claim India disputed, while Pakistan thanked Trump for his proactive role.

The New York Times article notes that cross-border firing was reported in some areas, and that some of the heaviest fighting took place earlier on Saturday. This initial agreement seeks to de-escalate tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals.</p>

          <p>In "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," journalist Mark Whitaker examines the lasting impact of Malcolm X on American culture and civil rights. The excerpt focuses on Spike Lee's 1992 biopic, "Malcolm X," detailing the artistic choices made by Lee and Denzel Washington to portray Malcolm's life. The filming began in Brooklyn, with significant investment in recreating the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. Lee aimed to capture Malcolm's premonition of his own death, using dialogue, music, and camera work to create a haunting atmosphere. The book explores Malcolm's complex legacy and its continued relevance.</p>

          <p>Charles Barkley has voiced strong disapproval of the NCAA's management of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals and the transfer portal, calling the NCAA a "bunch of idiots and fools." Barkley is not against college players getting paid but questions the sustainability of the current system, where players can frequently switch schools and earn large sums of money. He prefers to donate to causes like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and rebuilding houses in his hometown, rather than contributing to what he sees as a problematic college athletics landscape. Barkley doubts the return on investment for NIL deals, given the short tenure of players at colleges.</p>

          <p>Climate change is significantly altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed and breed. Rising sea levels are impacting coastal stopover locations, and ocean acidification is reducing the availability of small crustaceans, a crucial food source.

The article emphasizes the importance of protecting habitats and reducing pollution to help migratory birds adapt to these changes.

          <p>Work to recover the "Bayesian" superyacht, which sank off Sicily last year, was halted after a diver died during the operation. The yacht's sinking resulted in the deaths of British tech mogul Mike Lynch and six others. The diver was part of a team working to cut and remove the mast, a preliminary step in the yacht's recovery. Authorities have launched an investigation into the diver's death. The recovery operation, which began last week, is expected to take up to 25 days. Inquests are ongoing into the deaths of the four British victims.</p>

          <p>A Soviet space probe launched in 1972, Kosmos 482, reentered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean after failing to reach Venus due to a launch vehicle malfunction. The planetary lander, part of the Venera program, was designed to study Venus's surface and atmosphere. Roscosmos confirmed the reentry, and the European Space Agency supported the conclusion. Despite concerns about potential dangers upon reentry due to its sturdy construction, Roscosmos stated that "Kosmos 482 no longer exists." Russia plans to continue the Venera program with a new mission to Venus.</p>

          <p>The Channel Islands, often called California’s Galapagos, are home to a vast underwater ecosystem teeming with life, including giant sea bass and vibrant kelp forests. Marine protected areas (MPAs) around the islands preserve roughly 21% of their waters, supporting thousands of species. However, the California Fish and Game Commission is reviewing these MPAs, considering proposals to either expand or reduce protections. While scientists and conservationists advocate for continued preservation, commercial fishers express concerns about potential restrictions on their fishing rights. The article emphasizes the ecological and economic benefits of the MPAs and the challenges of balancing conservation with human activities.</p>

The order aims to eliminate materials deemed incompatible with the department’s core mission. This follows a similar action at military academies, where hundreds of books were removed. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to purge DEI initiatives from the federal government. Librarians and staff are instructed to use specific search terms to identify books subject to removal.</p>
