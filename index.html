          <p>President Trump's intensified attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates, triggered a slide in US stocks and the dollar. Trump's pressure on Powell to cut rates pre-emptively to boost the economy exacerbated market turmoil already fueled by tariff plans and recession fears. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all experienced significant drops, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022. Investors sought safe-haven assets, driving gold prices to record highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge the freeze on over $2.2 billion in federal grants. This action was taken after Harvard refused to comply with demands to limit campus activism and reform admissions policies, following accusations of unchecked antisemitism during protests against Israel's war in Gaza. Harvard President Alan Garber asserted that the university would not yield to these demands, citing First Amendment rights and the importance of academic autonomy. The White House responded that taxpayer funds are a privilege, not a right, escalating the conflict.</p>

          <p>Time blindness, a common challenge for individuals with ADHD, involves difficulty perceiving and managing time accurately, impacting work, relationships, and daily life. This neurological condition affects executive functions, making it hard to estimate task duration, adhere to schedules, and initiate activities. Time blindness stems from differences in brain structure and function, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, affecting neurotransmitter activity related to time estimation. Understanding and addressing time blindness can help individuals with ADHD better manage their schedules and commitments.</p>

          <p>The design team behind China's J-36 stealth fighter is developing a computer system to assist pilots in landing the sixth-generation jet on aircraft carriers. This tri-engine, tailless flying-wing aircraft requires advanced technology to manage the complex and dangerous maneuver of carrier landings. The research, published in Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica, indicates that the J-36 design team is in the early stages of creating a naval variant for the PLA Navy's growing fleet of aircraft carriers.</p>
