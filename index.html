          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a new international agreement to address Iran's nuclear program, emphasizing the need for strict IAEA supervision. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and the risk of a nuclear disaster following recent US and Israeli strikes. He positioned China as a mediator, urging all parties to negotiate and asserting that peaceful resolution is paramount for global stability.</p>

          <p>England and Wales face a difficult path in the Women's Euro 2025, having been drawn into what experts call the "toughest group" alongside France and the Netherlands. This places three top-11 ranked teams in the same group, creating high-stakes opening matches. While England are defending champions and the Netherlands won in 2017, France is on an impressive winning streak, making progression for any team uncertain. Wales, as tournament debutants, are considered underdogs but hope to leverage that status to their advantage.</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities have arrested the mayors of three major southern cities—Adiyaman, Adana, and Antalya—all from the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP). The arrests are part of a wider investigation into allegations of organized crime and bribery, which critics view as a politically motivated crackdown. This follows the recent imprisonment of Istanbul's popular mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and detentions of other CHP officials. These actions are seen by many as an attempt to weaken the opposition ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have made a significant breakthrough by discovering a "genetic switch" that enabled the complete regeneration of damaged ear tissue, including cartilage, in mice. The study, published in *Science*, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. By reactivating a dormant gene, they successfully restored the lost tissue, offering hope that similar mechanisms could exist for other organs. While human application is still a distant goal, the findings provide a promising new avenue for regenerative medicine research.</p>

The piece contends that such framing misrepresents public sentiment, which is increasingly critical of Israel's military actions.

Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of disaster, mobilizing extensive state resources for the response.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy, who is expected to miss about six weeks. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were allayed when tests revealed only a bone bruise with no ligament damage. The team is confident that Muncy will have sufficient time to return and regain his form before the playoffs begin. In the interim, the Dodgers will use internal options like Tommy Edman and Kiké Hernández to cover the third base position.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Rockaway peninsula in Queens, New York, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings close to the shore. Drones operated by city officials confirmed the sharks' proximity to swimmers, leading authorities to briefly shut down access to the water as a safety precaution. The incident occurred just days after New York state officials announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend. Officials are continuing to monitor the situation to ensure the safety of all beachgoers.</p>

          <p>As the United States increases pressure on China's dominant shipbuilding industry, competitors South Korea and Japan are looking to strengthen their own sectors. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic industry as being in a "major crisis" and has pledged support to reclaim its global leadership. The government's plans focus on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and better working conditions. The move signals a potential shift in the global shipbuilding landscape driven by geopolitical competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a last-minute appeal to stop the deportation of eight immigrants, clearing the way for their removal to countries including war-torn South Sudan. Lawyers for the men had argued they could face perilous conditions, but the court ruled that their claims were substantially similar to ones previously rejected. The case is part of the Trump administration's broader campaign of using high-profile deportations as a deterrent to immigration. All eight men have prior criminal convictions, which the government has cited as justification for their removal.</p>
