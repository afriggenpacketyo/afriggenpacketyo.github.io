        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four women, identified as Jane Does, have filed a lawsuit against singer Smokey Robinson and his wife, Frances Robinson, accusing Smokey of sexual assault and harassment while they worked as housekeepers at his residence. The lawsuit alleges that the assaults occurred over several years, with one woman claiming the harassment led to her forced resignation. The women are also accusing Frances Robinson of creating a hostile work environment, including using ethnically pejorative language. The plaintiffs are seeking no less than $50 million in damages and a jury trial, citing fear of reprisal and public embarrassment as reasons for their delayed reporting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India, specifically an exemption on National Insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders, against claims that it could disadvantage British workers. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds argues that the deal, which extends the exemption from one to three years, aligns with existing agreements and will not undercut British labor. The deal aims to boost trade between the UK and India by making it easier for UK firms to export goods like whisky and cars, and cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports to the UK. The Scotch Whisky Association anticipates a significant increase in Scotch exports, potentially creating 1,200 jobs across the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German football is experiencing a decline in participation among teenage boys, prompting the German FA (DFB) to initiate reforms aimed at retaining young players. The number of men's U19 and U17 teams in Germany has decreased significantly since 2006, raising concerns about the future of football in the country. The DFB is focusing on making football more enjoyable and less results-oriented for young players, encouraging creativity and participation over strict competition. Similar trends have been observed in England, where a drop in participation among 16-24 year olds has led to the introduction of new strategies to combat the decline.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares experienced a nearly 7% increase after the company announced it anticipates improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of the year, driven by the phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The Danish pharmaceutical giant reported first-quarter net profits that exceeded expectations, although Wegovy sales slightly missed forecasts due to competition from alternative versions in the U.S. market. CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen anticipates that the end of a drug shortage ruling by the FDA will allow sales to rebound and that the company will pursue companies unlawfully distributing copycat drugs.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans, led by Representative Mike Johnson and Senator John Thune, are relying on a spending and tax cut package to revitalize their political standing after President Trump's first 100 days marked by economic self-immolation. The bill, centered on extending the 2017 tax law, aims to calm markets amid economic uncertainty caused by Trump's tariffs. However, the author of the article, Brendan Buck, argues that extending the tax law will not counteract the economic damage caused by the tariffs, as voters may not perceive it as a new benefit. Buck suggests that Republican leaders should pressure Trump to reconsider his trade policy to stabilize the economy and improve their chances in the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Community Plate, an organization founded by Karl Schatz and Margaret Hathaway in Maine, aims to combat loneliness by creating potluck suppers in rural towns, where people can connect and share stories. Inspired by the U.S. Surgeon General's declaration of a loneliness epidemic, Community Plate organizes events where attendees bring a dish to share and a few volunteers tell personal stories. These gatherings provide a sense of community and connection, addressing the growing issue of social isolation and divisiveness in society.</p>

Lake's announcement follows earlier actions to silence VOA's broadcasts, freeze its website, and place most of its staff on indefinite leave, prompting legal challenges from journalists and press advocacy groups.</p>

Trump's recent tariffs on imports from China have raised alarms about potential disruptions to supply chains and increased prices, leading to decreased consumer confidence.

The production will run for eight weeks at London's Bridge Theatre from September 10, and will also star Andrew Lincoln. Vikander says she feels the reason many of the classics are still being performed in the West End is they tackle many of the same subjects society still grapples with today.</p>
