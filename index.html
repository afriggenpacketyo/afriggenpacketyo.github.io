          <h2>Mortgage Demand Experiences Unexpected Surge Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing economic uncertainty and only a slight decrease in mortgage interest rates, weekly mortgage demand has surprisingly surged by 11%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The increase is primarily driven by conventional loans, suggesting that borrowers with larger loan sizes and those looking to upgrade their homes are more willing to take on mortgages. The April housing market had been slow due to potential buyers' concerns about tariffs and stock market volatility, but real estate agents still report strong demand. Applications to refinance a home loan also rose by 11%, driven by Veterans Affairs loans, and the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting could further influence mortgage rates (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, dubbed "Operation Sindoor." The Indian defense ministry claims the strikes targeted terrorist infrastructure used to plan attacks, while Pakistan denies involvement in the original attack and describes the strikes as "unprovoked". Pakistan claims to have shot down Indian aircraft, resulting in casualties, while India also reports casualties from Pakistani shelling. The strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, highlighting the ongoing conflict in the disputed Kashmir region.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and Russia continued their attacks on each other, just before a Russian-proposed cease-fire was set to take effect and Moscow prepared for a parade commemorating the end of World War II.

President Zelensky of Ukraine rejected Russia’s cease-fire offer as insufficient for meaningful negotiations, while Russia accused Ukraine of attacking Moscow with drones.

          <p>A bill to restore over $1 billion in funding for Washington, D.C., that Congress blocked earlier this year is facing resistance in the House, leaving its future uncertain. Some ultraconservative Republicans are opposing the bill, arguing that the Democratically-run city should not be allowed to spend its own money unless it adheres to Republican priorities on voting, abortion, and other issues. The lack of action leaves D.C. facing a significant budget cut, potentially leading to reductions in city services. Speaker Mike Johnson has assured Mayor Muriel Bowser that he would try to pass the bill quickly, but he indicated that it lacks sufficient support in its current form.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated following India's missile strikes into Pakistani-administered Kashmir and Pakistani territory, leading to preparedness exercises and heightened security measures in India. Pakistan has condemned the strikes as an act of war, promising retaliation, while India claims the strikes targeted militant infrastructure linked to a recent massacre of tourists. The U.S. has issued security alerts, advising citizens to avoid the India-Pakistan border, and international concerns are mounting, with calls for restraint from both sides. Despite the tensions, Pakistan has reportedly reopened airports in major cities, offering some hope for de-escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card interest rates remaining high, experts are weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks of credit card debt forgiveness for seniors. Debt forgiveness may be a smart option for seniors with high medical expenses, limited income, or no significant assets, especially if repaying debt would mean sacrificing basic needs. However, it may not be suitable for seniors with substantial assets or those who plan to use credit in the future, as it can damage credit scores and trigger tax consequences. Seniors are advised to explore alternative debt reduction strategies and to be wary of predatory actors in the debt relief industry (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A U.S. fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman has been lost in the Red Sea for the second time in just over a week, according to a defense official. The Super Hornet was attempting to land on the flight deck of the Truman when an arrestment failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard. Both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter, sustaining minor injuries. The incident is under investigation and occurred after a similar mishap on April 28 when another Super Hornet was lost in the Red Sea.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, saving money can be a challenge, but a certificate of deposit (CD) can help by offering higher returns. CDs allow you to lock in high rates for the term and are generally FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000, making them safe investments. Short-term CDs often offer the best rates, and online banks typically provide more competitive rates than traditional brick-and-mortar banks. Strategies like CD laddering can help you take advantage of high rates while saving for the long-term (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing face challenges due to high mortgage rates and limited inventory, but affordable options are still possible with a strong credit score. As of May 7, 2025, average mortgage rates are 6.11% for a 15-year term and 6.89% for a 30-year term, while refinance rates are 6.12% and 6.86%, respectively. Strengthening your credit profile and shopping around for different lenders can improve your chances of qualifying for a better rate. Consider shorter loan terms for better interest rates and factor in fees to calculate the overall cost of the loan (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>For the second time in eight days, a U.S. fighter jet has fallen into the Red Sea after an incident on the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier. A F/A-18F Super Hornet was attempting to land on the flight deck when a maneuver failed, causing it to go overboard; the two pilots ejected and sustained minor injuries. This incident follows another recent event where a Super Hornet was lost after crews lost control of the aircraft, and also the tow tractor, in the Truman hangar bay. The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since deploying to the Middle East in September 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chavín people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals, which may have contributed to the establishment of social and political hierarchies. Researchers found traces of hallucinogenic substances, including DMT, on artifacts at Chavín de Huántar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These substances were likely consumed via "snuff tubes" during private gatherings reserved for elite figures, suggesting that access to altered states of consciousness played a vital role in creating early class structures. This study provides material evidence that hallucinogens were a focal point of formalized and tightly-controlled rituals.</p>

          <p>With today's savings interest rates higher than they have been in years, it is a wise idea to save money in a savings account to prepare for unexpected financial emergencies.

Comparing different accounts and considering factors beyond just the interest rate will help you find the best option to maximize your savings.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that renewable energy in the US has surged, tripling in the past decade and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, this progress is threatened by the Trump administration, which has begun dismantling federal policies and spending aimed at addressing the climate crisis. Almost $8 billion in investments, including 16 large-scale factories, were canceled or downsized in the first three months of 2025 due to market uncertainty and debates over clean energy tax credits. Despite this, electric vehicle sales continue to increase, and states with significant renewable energy growth are predominantly in the south.</p>

          <p>Despite a commitment to climate neutrality by 2045, Germany's new government faces challenges in prioritizing climate action amid economic concerns and international pressures. Domestic and international climate policy will shift back under the environment ministry, potentially leading to conflicts with economic interests. The new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, prioritizes economic stability over winding down coal and gas plants, and the removal of a special international climate envoy poses further hurdles. Experts emphasize the need for innovative partnerships and economic integration to achieve climate targets and maintain Germany's international reputation.</p>

          <p>Rwanda is in "early stage" talks with the Trump administration about a deal to take in migrants deported from the United States. A similar plan in Britain, which cost nearly a billion dollars, proved largely unworkable, and was ultimately scrapped. The British plan faced legal challenges, was expensive, and raised concerns about the safety and human rights of migrants. Rwanda's capacity to take in large numbers of deportees is also questionable, given its size and population density.</p>
