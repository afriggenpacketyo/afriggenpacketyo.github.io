          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field in Fresno County, California, near Naval Air Station Lemoore. The pilot, part of the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" training squadron, was able to eject safely before the impact and was not injured. The crash caused a small grass fire covering nearly a dozen acres, but no other personnel were affected. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation by naval authorities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's August 1 deadline for new global tariffs is approaching, creating economic uncertainty for countries without a trade agreement with the U.S. While deals have been struck with nations like the U.K., Vietnam, and the E.U., many key partners, including India, Canada, and Mexico, face steep new duties. The administration has fallen short of its initial goal of securing numerous deals, with only eight agreements finalized. Countries without a deal are expected to face a higher baseline tariff of 15-20%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean saw a significant surge of over 16%, reaching their highest point since July 2015. This market rally followed the announcement of a new trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea, which sets a 15% tariff on South Korean exports. The company is expected to expand its U.S. operations at the Philly Shipyard, contributing to the revitalization of American shipbuilding efforts. The stock's performance was also boosted by strong second-quarter profits and new order announcements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run civil defence agency in Gaza, Israeli gunfire killed at least 30 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more who were waiting for humanitarian aid. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated they fired "warning shots" at a gathering near aid trucks but were unaware of casualties from their fire. This incident adds to the growing death toll of Palestinians seeking food, with the UN reporting over 1,000 such deaths since late May. The event highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in the region amid warnings of famine.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. imposing a 25% tariff, India has not rushed to secure a trade deal, choosing to protect its key domestic sectors. New Delhi has particularly resisted opening its agricultural market to American products to safeguard its large population of local farmers, a significant voting bloc. Analysts suggest India can withstand the pressure as its U.S. exports are a relatively small part of its economy, and it is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy by negotiating deals with other partners like the U.K. and the E.U.

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell by more than half compared to the previous year, missing market expectations. The decline was primarily driven by a 93.8% plunge in profits from its Device Solutions division, which includes its critical memory chip business. The company cited inventory value adjustments and the impact of China-related export restrictions as key factors. Despite the poor results, Samsung expressed cautious optimism for a gradual recovery in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not seek the governorship of California in the next election. In a statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now, though she remains committed to fighting for the American people. The decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential run. Sources suggest the move keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign.</p>

The victims were identified as a 32-year-old male employee and two young girls under the age of 12, who were waiting for him at the facility.

          <p>A significant diplomatic gap has emerged between the United States and its key allies, including the U.K., France, and Canada, over the future of Gaza. As these allies announce plans to recognize a Palestinian state, the Trump administration has boycotted related conferences, viewing them as anti-Israel and leaving a strategic vacuum. This divergence marks a break from past U.S. leadership on the conflict, as allies push for a two-state solution and address the severe humanitarian crisis. European nations appear driven by worsening conditions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves that prompted alerts across the Pacific. Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast experienced minor flooding and small waves, with initial warnings later downgraded to advisories. The quake caused flooding in Kamchatka and also appeared to trigger an eruption at a major volcano. Several South American countries issued new warnings and ordered evacuations, highlighting the far-reaching effects of the powerful undersea temblor.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Boring Company is facing scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers in Nashville over its plan to build a 10-mile underground transit loop connecting the airport to downtown. The project, supported by Tennessee's Republican Governor, is being fast-tracked with a proposed no-cost lease of public land, raising questions about transparency and public input. Local officials have expressed concerns about the lack of environmental, safety, or traffic assessments for the privately funded "Music City Loop." The plan highlights a partisan divide over partnering with Musk.</p>

          <p>Following an outcry from residents, Los Angeles city leaders have moved to restrict the construction of duplexes in the fire-ravaged Pacific Palisades neighborhood. The decision came after Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order allowing areas in very high fire hazard zones to be exempt from SB 9, a state law promoting housing density. Residents raised concerns that increased density would worsen evacuation dangers in future wildfires, a fear stemming from their chaotic January evacuation. The move is controversial, as critics argue it uses fire safety as a pretext to block housing law.</p>

          <p>The Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, has submitted a competing proposal to the UK government for the expansion of Heathrow Airport. This new plan, named Heathrow West, rivals the one from the airport's current owners and features a shorter third runway. The primary benefit, according to the group, is that a shorter runway would avoid the costly and complex process of rerouting the M25 motorway. The proposal aims to have the new runway operational by 2035, introducing competition into the expansion process.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street expectations with a 45% year-over-year jump in revenue to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it added 2.3 million funded customers, bringing its total to 26.5 million. The growth was driven by strong net deposits and higher asset valuations, with total platform assets nearly doubling to $279 billion. Despite the strong performance, shares slipped after the company projected higher future operating costs related to its recent acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>
