        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record, climbing past $120,000, largely driven by substantial inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This rally is supported by increasing institutional investment, with one recent day seeing over $1.18 billion in ETF inflows. The momentum is also fueled by anticipation of clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including potential legislation around stablecoins. Analysts suggest that while geopolitical trade disputes could cause short-term dips, the long-term outlook is buoyed by institutional confidence and potential government-level digital currency investments.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 02:20:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing economists' forecasts, as a temporary tariff truce with the U.S. slowed the decline in shipments to America. The growth was significantly supported by increased exports to Southeast Asian nations and the European Union. Despite the positive data, economists express caution for the second half of the year, citing uncertainty over future U.S. tariffs and constraints on Chinese manufacturers' ability to expand market share. The data also showed a notable surge in exports of rare earths, steel, and integrated circuits, reflecting complex dynamics within the ongoing trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sought to alleviate U.S. concerns that the company's advanced AI chips could be used by the Chinese military. In a recent interview, Huang argued that China cannot rely on U.S. technology that could be restricted at any moment and already possesses significant computing capacity. He reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to maintaining America's global tech leadership, as they limit access to the large market of AI developers in China. Huang's comments come as he navigates delicate relations between Washington and Beijing ahead of another trip to China.</p>

          <p>China's leadership is signaling a new focus on curbing what it terms "excessive competition," or 'neijuan,' where intense rivalry leads to diminishing returns. This policy shift, announced by a commission chaired by President Xi Jinping, aims to regulate disorderly, low-price competition and guide enterprises toward improving quality. Analysts note this initiative differs from the 2015 supply-side reforms, as the current economic landscape involves weaker growth, a larger role for private firms, and limited fiscal space. The government's goal is to manage overcapacity and promote a healthier, more sustainable market environment for Chinese businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The catastrophic floods in Texas, which have claimed at least 129 lives, are being analyzed as a result of a combination of climate change and political factors. Environmental reporters point to a warming atmosphere holding more moisture, leading to more frequent and intense precipitation events. Concurrently, the Trump administration's cuts to federal agencies like the National Weather Service are being scrutinized for potentially weakening storm tracking and emergency coordination capabilities. Despite the scale of the disaster, which has an estimated economic toll of up to $22 billion, the political discourse has been dominated by conspiracy theories rather than a reckoning over climate policy or public service funding.</p>

While the report highlighted a 2018 FAA advisory suggesting inspections of the switch's locking feature, the FAA stated it does not consider the issue an unsafe condition warranting a mandatory directive, as it continues to share information with international aviation authorities.</p>

However, other economists remain optimistic, pointing to London's strong fundamentals like the rule of law, cultural diversity, and a skilled talent pool. They contend that while the city faces intense competition, its core strengths remain, and targeted interventions in areas like housing and transport could ensure its continued success.

The drugstore beetles, attracted to the starch-based adhesives in the old bindings, have burrowed through numerous volumes. Experts believe climate change may be a contributing factor, as warmer temperatures allow the beetles to have more reproductive cycles annually, posing a growing threat to historical collections.</p>

This practice, known as conditional selling, is forbidden by industry codes. The investigation also revealed that Purplebricks was allegedly overvaluing properties to secure listings and then incentivizing staff to persuade sellers to reduce the price, while also pushing expensive in-house conveyancing services on first-time buyers.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the second quarter of 2025, successfully avoiding a technical recession. This growth reversed a 0.5% contraction from the first quarter and was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. On a year-over-year basis, the economy expanded 4.3%, beating forecasts. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks for the rest of the year, citing a lack of clarity regarding future U.S. tariff policies and their potential impact on global trade.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers used their first two picks in the MLB draft, Nos. 40 and 41, to select a pair of teammates from the University of Arkansas. The team chose left-handed pitcher Zach Root and outfielder Charles Davalan, both of whom were key players for a Razorbacks team that reached the College World Series. Root, a transfer from East Carolina, posted a 3.62 ERA with 126 strikeouts, while Davalan, a draft-eligible sophomore, hit .346 with 14 home runs. The selections provide a significant infusion of talent from a top collegiate program into the Dodgers' farm system.</p>

Her insistence on a public trial shocked the nation and became a catalyst for legal reform, contributing to the passage of a bill that includes lack of consent in the criminal definition of sexual assault.

The announcement marks a significant development in U.S. policy towards the conflict, coming after Trump's previous promises to end the war failed to materialize.

However, over 70% of the federal funding goes to local stations, many of which are in rural, Republican-leaning states and rely heavily on these grants to operate. Senators from states like Alaska have voiced opposition, arguing that for many of their constituents, public broadcasting is an invaluable and sometimes life-saving source of information.</p>
