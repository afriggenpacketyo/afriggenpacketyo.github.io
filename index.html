          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life for murdering her two children in a doomsday plot, has been convicted of conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, with her brother, Alex Cox. Prosecutors argued that Daybell orchestrated the shooting to collect a $1 million life insurance policy and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. Daybell, representing herself, claimed self-defense by her brother, who later died of natural causes. She faces sentencing after another trial for allegedly conspiring with her brother to kill her niece's ex-husband. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing Powell's handling of interest rates. Trump has been publicly lobbying for lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth, while Powell has cited "uncertainty" as the reason for maintaining steady rates. The conflict has raised concerns about the Fed's independence and its ability to make decisions without political influence. Trump's administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of independent federal agencies, setting up a potential court battle.</p>

The plan is contingent on an "understanding" with major food companies that consumers want the artificial dyes removed, and the FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives.

This follows comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who deemed the current tariffs unsustainable.

Despite the tariffs, Trump expressed a desire for a positive relationship with China.

          <p>Tesla's profit declined by 71% in the first quarter, reaching $409 million, due to various challenges, including tariffs and brand issues linked to CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration.

Analysts attribute the decline to Musk's controversial involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), leading to boycotts and vandalism.

          <p>U.S. stocks rebounded sharply, with the Dow rising over 1,000 points, driven by signs of potential de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. The market turnaround followed a slump triggered by President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Investors were also encouraged by Trump's statement that he has "no intention of firing" Powell. Despite the positive day, the IMF cited the escalating trade war and policy uncertainty as factors contributing to a reduced growth forecast for the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs, along with environmental regulations, pose a significant threat to Southern California's $300 billion trade and logistics industry, according to a report. The region relies heavily on trade with China, and increased tariffs could severely impact the industry. The Port of Los Angeles expects cargo volumes to drop, affecting port operators, haulers, and wholesalers. The report also suggests that economic uncertainty could deter foreign investment in the region, leading to job losses.</p>

HHS said it would establish a "national standard and timeline for the industry" to voluntarily make the switch. The FDA Commissioner claimed that food companies are eager to remove artificial dyes, while the industry expressed concerns about the complexity of food production and potential supply disruptions.</p>
