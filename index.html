          <p>Some National Guard members in Washington D.C., fewer than 50, were armed starting Sunday night, following a directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This marks an escalation in President Trump's intervention into the nation's capital's policing, despite previous assurances that troops would not carry weapons. The move comes as nearly 2,000 Guard members are stationed in the city, with local officials disputing the president's claims of rising crime. Troops have primarily been involved in protecting landmarks and crowd control, with no reports of threats requiring weapons until this change.</p>

Goldman Sachs analysts suggest maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining momentum and potentially attracting capital from the US to China.

          <p>The upcoming Premier League clash between Newcastle United and Liverpool is intensified by the ongoing transfer speculation surrounding Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, who reportedly desires a move to Liverpool. This match marks Newcastle's first home game of the season, with fans and coach Eddie Howe aiming to channel the crowd's energy despite the distraction. The transfer saga follows Liverpool's earlier acquisition of Hugo Ekitike, a player Newcastle had pursued for years, adding another layer of rivalry. Newcastle faces a race against time to secure new strikers if Isak departs, further complicating the team's preparations.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate cooled to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest level since January 2021, driven by falling retail, electricity, and gas prices. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, also dipped to 0.5%, below economists' forecasts. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects moderate inflation in the near term, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. The central bank has already eased monetary policy twice this year to address weaker growth and rising trade tensions, forecasting economic moderation in the second half of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized the Senate's 'blue slip' tradition, calling it unconstitutional and claiming it gives Democrats veto power over his judicial and U.S. Attorney nominees. He urged Senator Chuck Grassley to abandon the century-old custom, which Grassley defends as a norm for balance and state input. Trump's frustration stems from a slower confirmation rate for his nominees in his current term, compared to his first. The president's comments follow a ruling against Alina Habba's temporary appointment as U.S. attorney for New Jersey, highlighting ongoing political tension over judicial appointments.</p>

          <p>Global labor markets are experiencing a significant shift from the 'Great Resignation' to a 'Great Stay,' characterized by fewer employees leaving jobs and a 'no-hire, no-fire' freeze by employers. Economists attribute this trend to economic insecurity and uncertainty, with workers prioritizing job stability and companies hesitant to make new hiring decisions. While U.S. jobless claims remain low, nonfarm payroll growth has slowed, suggesting a cooling market. Similar trends are observed in the U.K., where job vacancies have fallen, and businesses are reluctant to expand hiring without clearer economic trajectory.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Donald Trump of "playing games with the lives of Americans" by proposing to send federalized National Guard troops into Chicago without local consent. Jeffries' comments on CNN criticized Trump's unprecedented domestic military deployments, which have already seen troops in Los Angeles and the arming of National Guard in Washington D.C. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned any such plan as a "flagrant violation of our constitution." This highlights a deepening political conflict over federal intervention in local law enforcement matters.</p>

Djokovic, aiming for a record 25th major title, attributed his struggles to a lack of match practice, but ultimately held his nerve in crucial moments.

          <p>India fears a planned Chinese mega-dam on the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet could drastically reduce water flows by up to 85% during the dry season, impacting over 100 million people downstream. This concern has prompted India to fast-track its own Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam project, despite local resistance from communities fearing displacement. The Indian government's analysis, corroborated by sources, estimates China's dam could divert 40 billion cubic meters of water, raising fears of water weaponization by its strategic rival. Beijing maintains its projects will not adversely affect downstream nations, but geopolitical tensions over water resources persist.</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency due to the state's infant mortality rate reaching its highest level in over a decade, with 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births. This rate is nearly double the national average, with Black infants disproportionately affected. The leading causes include congenital malformations, premature birth, and low birthweight. The state's plan involves expanding prenatal services, creating an obstetric care system, and strengthening community health programs. However, federal funding cuts and Mississippi's non-expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act complicate efforts to address these deeply entrenched inequities.</p>

Once China's largest real estate firm, its shares were suspended in January 2024 after a winding-up order and its founder, Hui Ka Yan, was fined for overstating revenue. The crisis, driven by Beijing's new rules on developer borrowing, has severely impacted China's economy, leading to massive layoffs, falling property prices, and reduced consumer spending.
