          <p>The search for Madeleine McCann resumed in Portugal near where she disappeared 18 years ago. German and Portuguese investigators are looking for evidence related to her disappearance. The search is focused on a 21 sq km site between where she went missing and where the prime suspect, Christian Brückner, had been staying. Brückner is serving a prison sentence in Germany for an unrelated sexual assault case and has denied any involvement in McCann's disappearance, but German police suspect him of murder. The investigation continues to treat the case as a missing persons investigation.</p>

          <p>New Zealand legislators voted to suspend three lawmakers who performed a Māori haka in protest of a proposed law. Hana-Rāwhiti Maipi-Clarke received a seven-day ban, while Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi were barred for 21 days, the longest bans in Parliament's history. The lawmakers from Te Pāti Māori performed the haka last November to oppose a bill they said would reverse Indigenous rights. The protest sparked debate about the role and acceptance of Māori culture in Parliament.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in the mushroom trial allege that Erin Patterson, accused of murdering relatives with a beef Wellington, used kitchen scales to measure a lethal dose of toxic mushrooms. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to killing three people and attempting to murder another at her home in Victoria in July 2023. The prosecution presented photos from Patterson's phone showing wild fungi being weighed, suggesting she measured the amount required to kill her guests. Patterson denies intentionally including poisonous fungi in the meal.</p>

Younger people are more likely to disagree with the supreme court ruling that the legal definition of "woman" is based on biological sex. The author argues that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy and fairness is sexist and congruent with consumer capitalism. The life cycle also influences views on biological sex, with experiences like childbirth and menopause shaping perspectives.</p>

          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often-complicated medical needs. These dogs put their lives at risk in the line of duty, and their care can be expensive after retirement. Many adopters face significant costs for chronic health issues and injuries sustained during their service. The lack of support could deter potential adopters, potentially leading to euthanasia for some dogs.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan is actively pitching to WWE legend Triple H to bring WrestleMania to London. If the event were to come to the U.K.'s capital city, it would be the first time the event is hosted outside of North America. Khan held talks with Levesque in July last year, adding to the speculation. He believes it would open a new market for the WWE and create a festival atmosphere.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers lost to the New York Mets due to pitching struggles, falling to .500 over the last month. Their lead in the National League West remains at just one game. The team's ERA in May was poor, and they haven't had a shutout in weeks. Starter Tony Gonsolin lasted just five innings, giving up three runs, and the bullpen didn't fare much better, as the Dodgers continue to struggle with their pitching.</p>

          <h2>Japan Sees Record Number of Stalking Investigations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 01:10:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese police investigated more than 1,300 cases of stalking in 2024, the highest since a law criminalizing the act was enacted in 2000. The figure is 260 cases higher than the previous year, prompting the National Police Agency to instruct forces to liaise more closely with local stations. This follows the discovery of the body of Asahi Okazaki, who had reported abuse from her former partner. A record 2,415 restraining orders were also issued.</p>
