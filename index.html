          <h2>White House Intervention Leads to Firing of LA Federal Prosecutor</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House ordered the firing of Adam Schleifer, a Los Angeles federal prosecutor, following pressure from lawyers representing Andrew Wiederhorn, a fast-food executive charged with tax evasion.  Sources suggest the firing was politically motivated, given Schleifer's past criticism of President Trump and Wiederhorn's political donations to the Republican party.  The incident raises concerns about political influence on the Department of Justice and potential chilling effects on future investigations.</p>

          <p>Prestigious British boarding schools are establishing campuses in Nigeria, driven by high demand from affluent Nigerian families and the rising cost of UK education.  While offering high-quality education, the schools face the challenge of navigating cultural differences, particularly regarding LGBTQ+ issues and religious practices.
