          <p>Opendoor's newly appointed board chair, Keith Rabois, declared the company "bloated" and announced plans to cut 85% of its 1,400-person workforce, aiming for a lean team of around 200. Rabois attributed the company's struggles and cash burn to remote work and a "broken culture," vowing to return to in-person innovation and abandon its "DEI path." This drastic restructuring follows investor pressure that led to the previous CEO's resignation, signaling a significant strategic pivot for the online real-estate platform. The announcement initially boosted shares, but they later slid, reflecting market volatility and uncertainty about the proposed changes.</p>

          <p>Following a week of fiery anti-government protests that led to the resignation of the previous administration, Nepal's President Ram Chandra Poudel has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as interim prime minister. Karki, known for her anti-corruption stance, becomes the first woman to lead the Himalayan nation's government. The protests, initially sparked by a social media ban, escalated into broader discontent over political corruption and youth unemployment, resulting in at least 51 deaths.

The piece emphasizes that investment selection based on fundamental metrics like P/E ratio, management quality, and growth opportunities is paramount, rather than limiting choices to cheaper shares. Technological advancements like fractional share trading further empower investors to access high-quality companies regardless of individual share cost. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts warn against outdoor venues for political events, citing the difficulty of establishing perimeters against long-range threats like the sniper-style shot that killed Kirk. The incident, amid a rise in political violence, underscores the need for enhanced security measures, including drone surveillance and multi-ring protection strategies, especially as "idiosyncratic actors" increasingly target non-politicians.

          <p>This article challenges the immediate alarm over a recent three-day spike in LAPD officer-involved shootings, arguing that such incidents should be examined within a broader context of long-term trends and specific facts. The author highlights a significant 72% reduction in LAPD shootings since 1990, attributing it to decades of reform and new training doctrines emphasizing restraint and "command and control." Data suggests that changes in police shootings largely correlate with violent crime levels, rather than a cultural problem. The article concludes that the LAPD's performance, when judged against the actual threat environment, reflects professionalism and effective reforms.</p>

The PMRC presented provocative content, and despite initial resistance, a deal was struck with the recording industry, resulting in the "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" stickers.

          <p>Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP sponsoring the assisted dying Bill, voiced discomfort with former Prime Minister Theresa May's characterization of it as an "assisted suicide bill." May and other peers vehemently oppose the legislation, citing concerns about insufficient safeguards against pressure to end lives and the message it sends to society. Leadbeater countered that terminally ill supporters are "definitely not suicidal" but are seeking choice in their dying process. The Bill, which passed the Commons, faces intense scrutiny in the House of Lords, with emotional pleas from both sides reflecting deeply personal and ethical considerations.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed by three senior FBI agents accuses FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi of wrongful termination, potentially implicating Donald Trump in another legal issue. The agents claim Patel fired them for resisting illegal orders and attempting to protect subordinates, with one agent alleging Patel admitted the firings were "likely illegal" and originated from the White House. Patel reportedly stated, "the FBI tried to put the President in jail and he hasn’t forgotten it," directly linking the actions to Trump's alleged retribution. This legal challenge suggests a breach of FBI protocols and raises concerns about political interference within the bureau.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's strike on a Hamas meeting in Doha, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened further attacks in Qatar if it continues to harbor Hamas representatives, despite strong condemnation from Qatar. This stance directly contradicts President Trump's assurance to Qatar's prime minister that such strikes "will not happen again." The U.S. has relied on Qatar for mediation with Hamas, and the incident has strained relations with a key ally, with Qatar's prime minister stating it "killed any hope" for hostage returns. The situation highlights deep divisions and escalating tensions in the Middle East, further isolating Israel globally.</p>

          <p>The European Union has accepted Microsoft's commitments to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its popular Office productivity apps, allowing the tech giant to avoid a substantial antitrust fine. This decision resolves accusations that Microsoft's bundling practices stifled competition, particularly from rivals like Salesforce-owned Slack. Under the agreement, Microsoft will offer Office 365 and Microsoft 365 at reduced prices without Teams, ensure interoperability with competing tools, and allow data migration. This marks a significant step in regulating big tech, with Salesforce applauding the Commission's efforts to promote fair competition and customer choice.</p>

Sanders defended the practice, stating it's necessary for efficient campaign travel to reach large audiences for multiple rallies. The article notes that private jets disproportionately contribute to carbon pollution compared to commercial flights, raising questions about consistency between his actions and policy stances. While acknowledging his efforts in reducing pollution through legislation, the article suggests greater consideration of the environmental and financial toll of such travel.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Fox & Friends that he is deploying the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, instead of Chicago for now, despite earlier indications. Trump cited a railroad executive's advice regarding Memphis's high crime rates, claiming the city is deeply troubled. This decision comes amidst Mayor Paul Young's statement seeking financial resources and support for Memphis police, not necessarily federal troops. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who vocally opposed a Chicago deployment, criticized the president for using troops as political props. The move reflects ongoing debates about federal intervention in local crime and immigration enforcement.</p>

His son, Nkosinathi Biko, expressed confidence that a democratic court would find the implicated policemen responsible, emphasizing the need to correct history and achieve accountability for past atrocities.

          <p>With rising living costs straining fixed incomes, many seniors are exploring ways to access their substantial home equity without incurring new monthly payments. Options like reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62+ to borrow against their equity via lump sums or credit lines, with repayment deferred until the home is sold or vacated. Home equity sharing agreements offer funds in exchange for a share of future appreciation, while sale-leaseback arrangements involve selling the home and renting it back. Each method provides financial liquidity, but seniors must carefully weigh the long-term implications, including property taxes, insurance, and inheritable equity. (not investment advice)</p>
