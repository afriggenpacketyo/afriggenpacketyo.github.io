          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that Russia launched its largest drone and missile attack of the war, striking multiple locations including the cabinet building in Kyiv. The Ukrainian air force stated that Russia launched 810 drones and 13 missiles, with many being intercepted but dozens still causing impacts across the country. The attacks resulted in at least eight civilian deaths and 59 injuries, prompting Zelenskyy to call for an immediate international response and increased military aid. The barrage also led NATO to scramble fighter jets in neighboring Poland as a precautionary measure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As gold prices reach new record highs, driven by economic uncertainty and anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts, financial experts are advising on investment strategies. Many suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track physical gold are the most efficient and low-cost method for gaining exposure. While gold is considered a safe-haven asset during periods of instability, financial advisors typically recommend limiting its allocation to a small portion of a diversified portfolio, generally under 3%. This approach helps mitigate risks associated with the commodity's price volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has stated that the government is exploring the use of military sites to accommodate asylum seekers as an alternative to hotels. This move is part of Labour's pledge to end the practice of housing asylum seekers in hotels, where over 32,000 are currently living while their claims are processed. The initiative is being framed as a cross-government effort, with military planners working alongside the Home Office to identify suitable military and non-military locations. Two former military bases are already in use for this purpose, and their capacity may be expanded.</p>

          <p>An advocacy group, Rainbow Railroad, reports a dramatic 760% increase in inquiries from LGBTQ+ Americans considering relocation to Canada since Donald Trump's re-election. This surge is attributed to fears stemming from anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, executive orders, and hundreds of bills targeting the community at state and federal levels. The majority of inquiries come from transgender individuals, who have been a primary focus of recent administrative policies. While legal pathways to Canada remain limited, recent Canadian immigration cases have offered a glimmer of hope for those seeking asylum based on persecution in the U.S.</p>

He argues that Murdaugh, like Bundy, displayed profound indignance at being judged by those he considered his inferiors after his crimes were exposed.

          <p>A look at the recent transfer window shows Spanish La Liga clubs spending significantly less than their Premier League counterparts, reflecting a strategic shift towards financial sustainability. This restrained approach is a result of strict economic controls implemented in 2013 to combat widespread club debt and bankruptcy. These rules, including salary caps, have stabilized the league financially, transforming clubs into more stable enterprises. While this discipline has reduced some of the league's glamour, Spanish clubs continue to achieve significant success in European competitions, often by relying on strong youth academies.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse will be visible across parts of the UK, causing the full moon to take on a deep red color, an event commonly known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. The reddish hue is caused by sunlight refracting through Earth's atmosphere, the same phenomenon that creates red sunsets. Astronomers advise finding a clear view of the horizon around moonrise to witness the event, which does not require special eye protection.</p>

          <p>Multiple undersea fiber optic cables in the Red Sea have been cut, causing disruptions and increased latency for internet users in parts of Asia and the Middle East. Companies like Microsoft have acknowledged the impact, and monitoring groups have identified failures in the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems. While the cause is not yet confirmed, there has been ongoing concern about potential targeting by Yemen's Houthi rebels amidst regional conflict, though they have previously denied such attacks. Repairing this crucial internet backbone can be a lengthy process.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins football team suffered a 30-23 loss to UNLV, dropping to an 0-2 record for the season and showcasing recurring problems. Similar to their season opener, the Bruins had a poor start, falling into a 23-0 deficit, and were plagued by defensive lapses and offensive inconsistency. A late comeback attempt led by quarterback Nico Iamaleava was cut short by a tipped interception in the final minute. The loss raises early-season pressure on head coach DeShaun Foster to address the team's lack of discipline and execution.</p>
