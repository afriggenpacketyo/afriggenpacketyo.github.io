          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. The project involves the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Eneos Corp., and others. Coastal plants like mangroves and kelp absorb more carbon than terrestrial vegetation. The study will assess seaweed behavior at considerable depths and the environmental impact of such projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon initiatives, compared to 34 tons absorbed by coastal plants in fiscal 2023.</p>

The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment to remove parental responsibility from convicted child molesters, but only if they abused their own children. The family, who spent over Â£30,000 in legal fees to protect their daughter, expresses disappointment that the law doesn't automatically remove parental rights in all cases of serious child sexual assault.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut. Investors are betting on the company's ability to capitalize on the booming electric vehicle market. CATL raised $4.6 billion in its IPO, reportedly the largest offering this year globally. The company plans to use 90% of the funds to build its factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company's expansion into Europe comes amid increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed tariffs on EVs made in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway for six men who escaped from the New Orleans city jail, raising concerns about the facility's conditions and oversight. The escape involved a daring run, including crossing Interstate 10, and a taunting message left behind. The jail, under a federal consent decree since 2013, faces issues such as overcrowding and understaffing. Governor Jeff Landry has demanded answers about how the escape occurred and criticized the criminal justice system. The escaped inmates were being held on charges including murder and armed robbery, prompting officials to caution residents to be vigilant.</p>

          <p>Honda Motor Co. has announced it will cut its investment plan for electric vehicle technology through fiscal 2030 by 30%, reducing the amount from 10 trillion yen to around 7 trillion yen. The decision is attributed to lower-than-expected growth in the EV market. This revision follows Honda's earlier announcement that it would delay the operations of an EV plant in Canada by two years, initially scheduled to start in 2028.

          <p>This New York Times guest essay argues that the war in Ukraine is not solely Europe's concern, and its outcome matters significantly for the United States. The author contends that President Trump's view of the war as primarily a European issue overlooks Russia's broader objectives to undermine the post-Cold War order and diminish American influence. Abandoning the peace process in Ukraine would embolden Russia, leaving Europe vulnerable and potentially exacerbating global challenges for the U.S. The author urges the Trump administration to confront the Kremlin now, rather than face greater costs later.</p>
