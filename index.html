          <p>Jewish students, faculty, and alumni are increasingly pushing back against the Trump administration's exploitation of antisemitism charges to justify repressive policies on college campuses. They are organizing protests, writing letters, and lobbying legislators to denounce what they see as the exclusion of Jewish perspectives critical of Israel. These Jewish-led efforts aim to defend pro-Palestinian students detained by the administration and challenge the conflation of criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Many Jewish Americans are invoking their Jewishness in a public way for the first time to stand against what they view as authoritarianism and defend the liberal principles that have enabled Jewish thriving in the United States.</p>

          <p>Brad Smith, an ALS patient, can now communicate using only his thoughts thanks to a Neuralink brain implant and AI technology. The implant, containing 1024 electrodes, captures neuron firings and transmits them wirelessly to a MacBook Pro, which decodes the signals to move a cursor on the screen. Smith uses Grok, an AI chatbot, to generate responses and suggestions, allowing him to participate in conversations and even play games with his children. This technology is still in its early stages, but it offers hope for people with severe speech impairments caused by ALS, stroke, spinal cord injury, and other neurological conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark is raising its retirement age to 70, prompting discussion among experts about whether the U.S. might follow suit. While Denmark's move reflects increasing good health and demand for older workers, retirement experts caution that raising the U.S. retirement age may be problematic due to income inequality and differences in life expectancy. Unlike Denmark, the U.S. has a significant gap in life expectancy between those at the top and bottom income quartiles, making an across-the-board increase in the retirement age potentially harmful to lower-income individuals. Additionally, the long phase-in period required for such a change would not address the immediate funding challenges faced by the Social Security Administration. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that the Republican Party under President Trump has abandoned its core principles of constitutional conservatism, including the rule of law, limited government, and individual liberty. Trump and his supporters exhibit a disdain for laws, procedures, and the Constitution, seeking to empower the federal government to reward allies and punish opponents. The author contends that the Trump administration embodies a philosophy of "might makes right," where laws and the Constitution are malleable and the state has become a blunt-force instrument. Despite this shift, the courts are proving to be a vital bulwark against Trumpism, and resistance to his policies is expected to grow.</p>

          <p>Jessica Slice, a disabled mother, shares her experiences and insights on parenting in her new book, emphasizing the importance of accepting a loss of control and asking for help. Diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), Slice argues that her disability has allowed her to embrace dependence on others and reject cultural ideas of perfectionism related to capitalism. She advocates for mutual aid, accessible infrastructure, and stronger social safety nets in parenting, encouraging parents to release control and find joy in the imperfect. Slice also addresses the stigma surrounding disability in reproductive healthcare and calls for justice and equity for people with disabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite advocating for harsher penalties in the U.S. drug war, President Trump has stirred controversy by pardoning several convicted drug dealers, including Larry Hoover, a leader of the Gangster Disciples. This move has drawn criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with some viewing the pardons as transactional and others as a necessary act of redemption. While Trump's supporters argue that the punishment doesn't always fit the crime, critics point to the mixed messages and potential chaos caused by simultaneously advocating for tough penalties and releasing drug dealers. Some experts suggest Trump's decisions are influenced by powerful individuals and lack a coherent ideological thread. Optimism is tempered by the conflicting signals and potential for continued harm from the broader drug war policies.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that the UN's global population estimates may be significantly undercounted, potentially by hundreds of millions or even billions of people. This discrepancy is attributed to incomplete or unreliable census data in rural areas of the global south. While some express concerns about overpopulation and resource scarcity, the author argues that anxieties about population growth often reflect power struggles and unequal distribution of resources. The focus should be on responsible consumption, sustainable technologies, and addressing inequalities rather than solely on population control.</p>

          <p>Meta plans to automate up to 90% of all privacy and integrity risk assessments, replacing human evaluators with AI systems. This shift aims to streamline decision-making and accelerate product development, but it raises concerns about potential risks to user privacy and safety. Current and former Meta employees fear that AI may not be equipped to make nuanced judgments about the real-world harm that Meta's apps could cause. While Meta claims that human expertise will still be used for complex issues, critics worry that this automation push could lead to less rigorous scrutiny and higher risks for users.</p>

          <p>Veteran lawyers are raising concerns about the legality of President Trump's deals with big law firms, suggesting they may not be valid contracts. These deals involve firms agreeing to provide pro bono services in exchange for curtailing investigations and maintaining access to federal buildings. Critics argue that these agreements are made under coercion and lack a true meeting of the minds, potentially violating federal bribery statutes. Some targeted law firms are challenging Trump's actions in court and winning, while others who settled report losing clients.</p>

          <p>Memory cafes are providing valuable support and social interaction for people with dementia and their caregivers, offering a sense of community and purpose. These gatherings, which are relatively inexpensive to run, provide a safe and welcoming environment where attendees can participate in activities, share experiences, and build relationships. The inclusion of caregivers distinguishes memory cafes from other programs, addressing the social isolation and stress that both patients and caregivers often experience after a dementia diagnosis. As cases of memory loss are expected to rise, memory cafes are becoming an increasingly important part of the continuum of care.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expected to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, according to Defence Secretary John Healey. This commitment is the basis for the government's upcoming strategic defence review, which will outline military and security priorities for the coming years. The review is expected to warn of a new era of threats, including drones and artificial intelligence, and will recommend deploying new digital experts alongside troops. The plan will leave capacity for projects to be sped up and delivered faster if the 3% target is brought forward.</p>
