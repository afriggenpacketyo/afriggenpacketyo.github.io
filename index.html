          <p>Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met with his German counterpart, Johann Wadephul, in Berlin to discuss bilateral relations amid growing international pressure regarding the conflict in Gaza. The diplomats began with a wreath-laying ceremony at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial, a somber reminder of Germany's past. Wadephul reaffirmed Germany's commitment to sending arms to Israel, a decision that has sparked controversy given the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Several human rights groups and NGOs organized a rally in front of the Foreign Ministry to protest Israel's military actions in the Gaza Strip, highlighting the deep divisions over the conflict. The parliamentary session addressing Germany's Israel policy was disrupted when a lawmaker was asked to leave for wearing a pro-Palestine T-shirt.</p>

          <p>Data indicates a significant drop in U.S. user engagement for e-commerce giants Shein and Temu, triggered by President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the "de minimis" trade loophole. Temu's daily active users (DAUs) in the U.S. fell by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's DAUs decreased by 25%. Monthly active users (MAUs) also saw declines for both platforms, reflecting reduced user activity. The decline in user engagement coincides with a reduction in U.S. advertising spending by both companies following the tariff announcements.</p>

          <p>Russia is attempting to re-establish a strategic alliance with China and India to counter the Western-led international order, but faces challenges due to existing tensions between the two Asian powers. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized NATO's attempts to draw India into "anti-China" efforts and expressed hope for the restoration of the Russia-India-China (RIC) framework. The China-India border dispute in 2020 had largely frozen bilateral ties until a disengagement agreement was reached last year. Despite these challenges, some analysts suggest that President Trump's policies could potentially drive the three nations closer together.</p>

Exemptions are in place for athletes participating in major sporting events, holders of immigrant visas for persecuted ethnic and religious minorities, and Afghan nationals with Special Immigrant Visas.

Several European auto supplier plants and production lines have already been shut down as a result of the restrictions, with further outages anticipated as inventories dwindle. China's Ministry of Commerce imposed the export restrictions on rare earth elements and magnets in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increases.

          <p>The Trump administration has deployed military resources, including Stryker combat vehicles, to the US-Mexico border, raising questions about the militarization of border control. The deployment is justified by the administration as a response to an "invasion" at the border, though migrant crossings have slowed significantly. The military's involvement is enabled by designating areas along the border as National Defense Areas, allowing soldiers to detain trespassers until Border Patrol agents arrive. Critics argue that this circumvents the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, alleging a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's mental state. Trump claims that Biden's aides used an autopen to sign executive actions, effectively shielding the public from the true decision-makers. Biden, who is battling advanced prostate cancer, has dismissed Trump's accusations as "ridiculous and false." The investigation aims to determine whether Biden's aides unconstitutionally exercised presidential authority and concealed information about his health.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by promoting decentralized solar power, creating a model for other countries in the Global South. The report argues that cheap Chinese solar panels are undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal-fired plants, leading to potential stranded assets. The report also emphasizes the importance of developing indigenous manufacturing capabilities to mitigate rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals. A Chinese energy scholar, however, questions whether this vision is too expensive to be viable.</p>

The agency plans to promote a new style of travel that emphasizes engagement with local communities and encourages repeat visits. The report also highlights initiatives to remove barriers to travel, such as reluctance to take time off work, and promotes "learcation" programs for working parents.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration signed a proclamation suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries, citing national security interests and inadequate vetting processes. The ban affects nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Partial restrictions were also imposed on citizens of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The policy mirrors a similar travel ban from Trump's first term and has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who argue it is discriminatory.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether individuals working for former President Joe Biden conspired to deceive the public about his mental state. Trump alleges that Biden's aides abused the power of presidential signatures through the use of an autopen. The memo calls for an investigation into activities that purposefully shielded information about Biden's mental and physical health, as well as the use of the autopen for policy documents.

The vote offers a rare chance to make the country's bureaucracy slightly more benevolent, with cultural implications too. Meloni's government opposes the measure, hoping for low voter turnout to undermine the referendum.
