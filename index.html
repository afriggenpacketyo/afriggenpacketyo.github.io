        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed global initiative, has officially declared famine in Gaza Governorate, including Gaza City. This dire situation is projected to spread to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by late September 2025, with over half a million people already enduring catastrophic levels of food insecurity. An additional 1.07 million, representing 54% of the population, are facing emergency conditions. The report emphasizes that these figures are likely underestimated due to classification challenges in North Gaza and the exclusion of Rafah's population, underscoring the severe and worsening humanitarian crisis following the end of the ceasefire and continued aid blockades.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier directive to relocate all stray dogs in Delhi to shelters, following widespread protests from animal welfare groups. The new ruling mandates that non-aggressive strays should be vaccinated and sterilized before being released back to their original sites, while only rabid or aggressive dogs will be kept in shelters. The court also prohibited feeding stray dogs in public areas, ordering the creation of dedicated feeding zones. This decision, welcomed by animal welfare advocates as balanced and compassionate, aims to address the estimated one million stray dogs in Delhi and the country's high rate of rabies-related deaths, while also planning a national policy on the issue.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against The Guardian newspaper, which published a series of articles in 2021 detailing allegations of sexual misconduct. The High Court judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that the Guardian successfully defended its stories on the grounds of truth and public interest, finding the meaning of the articles to be "substantially true." During the six-week trial, more than a dozen women testified about their personal experiences with misconduct by the actor and director. The Guardian's editor-in-chief welcomed the decision, hailing it as a victory for the women involved and for investigative journalism, expressing hope it would encourage others to speak out.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened a complete federal takeover of Washington D.C., accusing Mayor Muriel Bowser of disseminating "false and highly inaccurate crime figures." In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed the city was "SAFE AGAIN" with no murders reported that week, but warned of federal intervention if the mayor did not cease her alleged misrepresentation of crime statistics. This threat follows previous orders from Trump to mobilize the D.C. National Guard and Metropolitan Police for federal purposes to combat the city's crime problem. The Department of Justice is reportedly investigating possible manipulation of D.C. crime data amidst the administration's crackdown on violence.</p>

          <p>Canada is confronting the fundamental question of its self-defense, a historically remote concern, amidst a new tone from the US under the second Trump administration, which has even called for annexation. Traditionally reliant on its southern neighbor and focused on peacekeeping, Canada's military is unprepared for potential aggression from the world's largest military force. Experts suggest Canada would be "a snack" in such a scenario, prompting a reevaluation of its national identity and security. The article proposes Finland's "whole society defense" model, which mobilizes all societal resources to make conquest too costly, as a potential blueprint for Canada to bolster its resilience against external and internal chaos.</p>

          <p>The measles outbreak in Texas has concluded, but health experts are highlighting its lessons as cases rise across the US, exacerbated by anti-vaccine sentiments during the Trump administration. With 1,356 confirmed cases reported this year, significantly higher than the previous year, officials stress the need for targeted vaccination campaigns and community-led education in undervaccinated areas. A key challenge during the Texas outbreak was the CDC being under a gag order, forcing local officials to rely on past literature for guidance. The experience underscores the importance of accessible vaccination clinics, community health workers, and county-level vaccination data to effectively combat future outbreaks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unilaterally terminated union contracts for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, following an appeals court decision that overruled an injunction. This action stems from a March executive order aiming to cancel collective bargaining agreements for most federal employees, citing national security concerns, a move unions like the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) are fighting. AFGE President Everett Kelley warns this is a "test bed" for a wider assault on labor organizations across the US, potentially affecting all workers. The administration defends its actions as lawful, asserting its authority to eliminate agreements in agencies with national security functions, despite concerns from groups like Common Defense about the impact on veterans' care and workers' ability to advocate for patients.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case has become a symbol of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, is expected to be released from federal detention in Tennessee as early as Friday. This follows a federal magistrate judge's order for his release pending a January criminal trial, despite previous delays and a mistaken deportation to El Salvador where he alleges torture. Abrego Garcia faces federal charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens, alongside accusations of MS-13 gang membership, which his lawyers vehemently deny. While a Maryland judge's ruling prevents immediate ICE detention upon his release in Tennessee, his long-term immigration status and the "vindictive and selective prosecution" claims by his defense remain unresolved.</p>

However, Ford plans to deliver a $30,000 four-door pickup by 2027, targeting a mass market and global demand for cheaper vehicles. This move, focusing on affordability and export potential, highlights that while the US EV transition faces hurdles, the worldwide shift towards electric vehicles, driven by cost-effectiveness and environmental regulations elsewhere, continues to accelerate.

The article praises Kuang's intellectual prowess, which enriches the narrative with deep subject knowledge, akin to her previous work "Babel."

Baron's deeply researched and witty narrative focuses on the social currents and major personalities, rather than complex scientific concepts, to explain why people chose to believe. Ultimately, the book acknowledges that while many conclusions about Martian life proved incorrect, this imaginative fascination inspired generations, including Carl Sagan, to consider space exploration a real possibility.</p>

Furthermore, tariffs are deemed inefficient and distortive, particularly impacting capital inputs and making investment more expensive, unlike broad-based consumption taxes. Their unpredictable nature and susceptibility to political carve-outs also undermine their stability and fairness as a tax system. (not investment advice)</p>

Caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the plague primarily affects small animals and is typically transmitted to humans through infected flea bites or contact with infected rodents, often in rural areas. While the disease, which caused massive deaths in the Middle Ages, remains serious, it is treatable with antibiotics if caught in a timely manner. Experts emphasize that, unlike smallpox, the plague cannot be eradicated due to its presence in mammalian populations spread by vectors like fleas, but medical advancements have significantly mitigated its threat.</p>

          <p>Scottish actress Karen Gillan has officially joined the cast of the "Highlander" movie reboot, where she will star opposite Henry Cavill, playing the wife of Connor McLeod. Gillan, known for her roles in "Doctor Who" and "Guardians of the Galaxy," expressed excitement about playing an "actual Highlander," noting her intention to work more in her home country of Scotland, where filming is set to begin in September. The original 1986 cult classic depicted an age-old war between immortal warriors. Gillan also discussed her recent film "Life of Chuck," based on a Stephen King novella, describing it as a life-affirming exploration of how to truly live, a perspective she now views through the lens of new motherhood.</p>

          <p>Chocolate lovers face continued price increases as the delayed impact of soaring cocoa prices hits retailers, though there's a possibility of better news by next Easter. Cocoa futures have reached record highs due to adverse weather, pest outbreaks, and supply tightness in West Africa, which produces most of the global supply. This, combined with broader retail inflation, has already driven chocolate product prices up significantly in the UK and US. While cocoa futures have eased slightly this year, chocolatiers are still processing higher costs from late 2024. However, J.P. Morgan analysts suggest industrial demand is softening and supply is improving, potentially leading to a brighter outlook for prices in the longer term, despite remaining structurally higher.

          <p>Plans to rename Berlin's Mohrenstraße, a street widely considered to have racist connotations, to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Straße, honoring the first African-born scholar to earn a European doctorate, have been halted once more by a legal challenge. Despite a higher administrative court upholding the renaming in July, the Berlin Administrative Court granted an urgent application from a citizens' initiative, delaying the change until their lawsuit is concluded. The "Moor" in Mohrenstraße references the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as "court moors," perpetuating a racist experience of violence. Renaming the street is seen by civil society groups as a crucial act of decolonization and a recognition of Black history and resilience.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted of a royal defamation charge, known as lese majeste, which could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence.

This verdict marks a significant moment for Thaksin, who returned to Thailand in 2023 after years in exile and has maintained a high public profile despite facing other legal challenges. The ruling comes amidst broader concerns about the increasing use of lese majeste laws against government critics and the ongoing political instability in Thailand, including ethical challenges faced by his daughter, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.</p>

The Fed faces a difficult decision: raising rates to counter tariff-induced inflation risks a downturn, while lowering them to stimulate the economy could worsen inflation. Powell's speech, the first since a weak jobs report, will offer insights into whether his primary concern remains inflation or employment, with futures markets anticipating a September rate cut.
