          <p>A cold case detective captured Bryan Patrick Miller, the notorious 'canal killer' responsible for two murders in the early 1990s, through an undercover operation at a Phoenix Chili's restaurant. The detective posed as a security consultant to meet Miller and covertly obtain his DNA from a water glass. This tactic was employed after genetic genealogy linked the crime scene DNA to the Miller surname. Eleven days later, the DNA from the glass was confirmed as a match, leading to the arrest of Miller, who was also a local personality known as the 'Zombie Hunter.' Miller was later convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a novel trade policy, allowing companies like Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China on the condition that they share 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This move reverses a previous block on these exports and has sparked debate among trade experts, who worry it sets a dangerous precedent that national security-based export controls could be for sale. The legality of this 'revenue-sharing' agreement, which critics argue could be an unconstitutional export tax, is still under review by the Department of Commerce. The policy highlights the ongoing technological arms race and complex trade dynamics between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China is hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, emphasizing the artist's 'Russianness' in collaboration with Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery. The exhibit showcases 48 oil paintings and numerous sketches, framing his career within the context of the Russian Empire. This presentation occurs amid a cultural dispute, as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin, known there as Illia Riepin, as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition's design and curation are intended to underscore the artist's connection to St. Petersburg and Russian classicism, reflecting current geopolitical alignments.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new head coach, Ruben Amorim, is implementing significant changes to restore the club's success after what he termed a 'disaster season.' Amorim is known for his open communication style and is focusing on a modern, player-centric approach that encourages responsibility over the rigid discipline of his predecessor. He has established a six-player leadership group to manage the dressing room and has adjusted his tactical formation, bringing in new attacking players for around £200m. Despite a challenging fixture list ahead, Amorim expresses confidence in his revamped squad's ability to compete for European qualification and bring 'the good days' back to Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has become one of the fastest-strengthening storms in Atlantic history, escalating from a Category 1 to a powerful Category 5 hurricane in just over 24 hours. This phenomenon of rapid intensification is becoming more common due to warming ocean temperatures, making Erin a potent example of climate change's impact on weather extremes. While it has since weakened slightly to a Category 4, it is expected to regain Category 5 strength. The storm is forecast to curve north into the open Atlantic, avoiding a direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast but is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the coastline next week.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has broken her social media silence following a divisive American Eagle ad campaign titled 'Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans.' The campaign, which plays on the words 'genes' and 'jeans,' drew criticism from some who alleged it had racial undertones, while others praised it for challenging 'woke' advertising. Sweeney, who had not previously commented, posted photos from a night out with friends, all clad in denim. Reputation management experts suggest the controversy, despite its nature, could ultimately boost Sweeney's career and net worth by generating significant media attention and demonstrating her resilience under public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the death of Angela Craig was triggered when a staff member at her husband's dental practice opened a package he had instructed them not to. The package, delivered while Angela was hospitalized with a mysterious illness, contained a canister labeled 'potassium cyanide.' This discovery was relayed to James Craig's business partner, Ryan Redfearn, who then informed a hospital nurse, prompting a police investigation. Police allege this was a key piece of evidence showing Dr. James Craig's intent to murder his wife. Craig was arrested just hours after Angela died and has since pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

This brings the cumulative tariff rate to 50%, among the highest for any U.S. trading partner.

          <p>A long-standing principle in U.S. traffic engineering, the '85% rule,' is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies amid rising road fatalities. The rule suggests that speed limits should be set at the speed that 85% of drivers naturally travel, assuming drivers instinctively choose the safest pace. However, critics argue this creates a feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, and it fails to account for pedestrians and cyclists in urban areas. The Federal Highway Administration has clarified that this is a guideline, not a strict rule, encouraging communities to also consider road usage, crash data, and pedestrian safety when setting limits.</p>

This process turns the tissue into a glassy solid at low temperatures, maintaining its integrity and enabling long-term storage. The breakthrough offers an unprecedentedly clear view of an organ's inner workings, which could significantly advance biological and medical research.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are exploring a design for a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes a 'scissor wing,' a concept once pursued by NASA. The proposed aircraft features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as it approaches Mach 5, it pivots to become parallel, merging with the aircraft's body to function as a 'waverider.' This innovative design aims to solve the aerodynamic challenges of transitioning from subsonic to hypersonic flight by balancing lift and drag without the compromises of conventional or swing-wing aircraft.</p>

Common triggers include a lifelong pattern of repressing personal desires to be 'good,' the burnout from perfectionism, and having poor boundaries developed from a parentified childhood. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can make an affair feel like a form of escape or retaliation. A recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can also act as a catalyst, prompting a re-evaluation of life and relationships.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched to the White House to protest President Trump's recent executive order placing the Washington D.C. police department under federal control and deploying National Guard troops. Protesters criticized the move as a 'hostile takeover' and a 'serious ethical and legal breach,' arguing that the president is exaggerating crime rates as a pretext for federal overreach. The demonstration followed a successful legal challenge by the D.C. attorney general that blocked the appointment of a federally controlled 'emergency police commissioner.' Organizers have stated that more protests are planned to oppose what they see as a threat to the city's home rule.</p>

          <h2>Chinese E-Commerce Sellers Remain Concerned About Potential U.S. Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Despite a temporary truce in trade tensions, Chinese merchants selling on platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu remain anxious about the potential for future U.S. tariffs. Many sellers continue to prioritize the large U.S. market due to its high traffic and relatively low barriers to entry for new merchants. However, the volatility of bilateral trade relations creates significant uncertainty, as exemplified by one electronics company that had to halt its U.S. business for two months earlier in the year when tensions escalated. This ongoing worry highlights the precarious position of Chinese businesses that rely heavily on American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., as part of President Trump's public safety initiative 'may be armed.' While stating that the troops will not be making arrests at this time, an official clarified their mission includes protecting federal assets and providing a visible presence to deter crime. This represents a shift from earlier guidance, which indicated that weapons would be available but stored in an armory. The deployment and potential arming of troops are part of a broader federal effort to take control of the city's policing, a move that has drawn significant local protest and legal challenges.</p>

          <h2>Reports Indicate Trump Supports Putin's Peace Proposal Requiring Ukraine to Cede Donbas</h2>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has reportedly told European leaders he supports a peace plan that would require Ukraine to cede the entire Donbas region to Russia. According to sources, Putin's proposal involves Ukraine withdrawing from the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk it still controls in exchange for Russia freezing the current front lines elsewhere. This potential deal would represent a major concession from Ukraine, which has fiercely defended the territory for over three years. The revelation adds a new layer of complexity to President Zelenskyy's upcoming visit to Washington, where he will face pressure to negotiate under these terms.</p>
