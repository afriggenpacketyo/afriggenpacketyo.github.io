        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have moved forward with President Trump's tax breaks, but a disagreement persists regarding the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). The House Ways and Means Committee passed the legislation, which proposes raising the SALT cap to $30,000 for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. Some House lawmakers are pushing for a higher limit before a full House vote. The current $10,000 SALT cap was implemented to help fund the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The full House vote is expected soon, but the legislation may face significant changes in the Senate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenyan authorities recently prosecuted four individuals for smuggling ants, bringing attention to the growing problem of biopiracy and the illicit trade in wild animals. The smugglers possessed valuable ant species, including giant African harvester ants, sought after by collectors for their unique behaviors and colony-building abilities. The Kenya Wildlife Service emphasized the ecological importance of even smaller species like ants, which play a crucial role in ecosystems. This incident underscores how the illegal wildlife trade is expanding beyond large mammals to include ecologically critical species, posing risks to biodiversity and potentially facilitating the spread of zoonotic diseases.</p>

          <p>In an effort to alleviate overcrowding in prisons across England and Wales, limits will be implemented on the duration that some offenders can be returned to prison. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that offenders recalled for breaching their licenses will be released after a fixed 28-day period. This measure is expected to free up approximately 1,400 prison spaces, providing ministers with time to overhaul the system. The changes will apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years who have been released but recalled for breaching their license terms, but not those who commit a serious further offense or pose a high risk.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are requesting an investigation into whether the Trump administration is facilitating deals for Elon Musk's Starlink. The senators are concerned about potential conflicts of interest given Musk's role as a special government employee and his company's dealings with foreign governments. They cited Starlink's expansion into Bangladesh and approvals in India and Saudi Arabia as examples warranting scrutiny. The senators allege that these actions raise questions about whether Musk or other administration officials may be violating ethics laws by abusing their official roles for the benefit of Starlink.</p>

          <p>With ever-changing U.S. tariff policies causing confusion for Americans, consumers can take several steps to mitigate the impact on their budgets. A U.S. agreement with China would reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%, while China would cut tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. Consumers should look for sales, check the origin of products, and purchase domestic products to avoid price hikes. Electronics and toys are the most likely to be affected by tariffs, so shoppers should consider purchasing them sooner rather than later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Small business owner David Mauro, who makes talking religious toys, is relieved by the temporary lowering of tariffs between the U.S. and China, as it ensures he will have products to sell for Christmas.

Mauro's plan was to ship his toy stock to Canada, the U.K. and Australia to avoid paying the steep levies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest efforts to lower prescription drug prices have sparked debate about the high costs paid by U.S. patients. The U.S. consistently pays more for many prescription drugs compared to other high-income countries. This is largely due to the complex reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control. Private insurers negotiate prices, often with limited transparency, while drug companies argue higher U.S. costs fund critical research and development. (not investment advice)</p>

The test involved nearly 2,700 participants who sampled 122 plant-based meat products alongside animal meat benchmarks. Twenty of the plant-based products were rated as good or better than their animal-based counterparts, with Impossible Foods receiving six awards. The results suggest that some consumers' preference for animal meat is psychological, as prepared plant-based dishes can be just as enjoyable. The top-performing products include burgers, chicken nuggets, breakfast sausage, and deli slices.</p>
