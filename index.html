          <p>North Korean state media has vehemently denounced South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, branding him a "hypocrite" following his remarks on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula during a visit to the United States. Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) dismissed Lee's mention of denuclearization as a "naive dream," reaffirming North Korea's unyielding position as an "irreversible" nuclear power. This public condemnation underscores the persistent diplomatic challenges and heightened tensions between the two Koreas, despite Lee's recent attempts to initiate dialogue and ease cross-border friction. The North views any discussion of denuclearization as a hostile threat, further complicating regional stability and international efforts to address the nuclear issue.</p>

          <p>Seven individuals were arrested after occupying Microsoft President Brad Smith's office, protesting the company's alleged ties to the Israel Defense Forces and the use of its Azure cloud platform for surveillance of Palestinians. This incident follows earlier arrests and employee firings related to similar demonstrations demanding Microsoft sever its connections with Israel and provide reparations to Palestinians. Microsoft is currently investigating reports that the IDF used Azure to store mass surveillance data, although it previously found no evidence of its AI technologies being used to target or harm people in Gaza. The protests highlight growing ethical concerns regarding tech companies' involvement in international conflicts.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a masterful performance, allowing just one run over five innings to secure his fifth consecutive victory for the Dodgers in a 6-3 win against the Cincinnati Reds. Kershaw, pitching on short rest, retired 14 consecutive batters after an early run, showcasing his refined pitching repertoire and effective use of various pitches. The Dodgers' offense steadily chipped away at the Reds' pitching, with key hits and a decisive four-run sixth inning, including a leadoff home run by Will Smith, solidifying their lead. This victory maintains the Dodgers' first-place standing in a tight National League West race, underscoring their strong push towards the season's end.</p>

          <p>A time capsule buried by Diana, Princess of Wales, at Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1991 has been opened, revealing a fascinating collection of items that capture life in the 1990s. Among the contents were a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a passport, and a pocket TV, all carefully selected by children who won a "Blue Peter" competition. Originally intended to remain sealed for centuries, the lead-encased wooden box was unearthed to facilitate the construction of a new children's cancer center. The article notes some damage to the objects but confirms they are largely intact, offering a unique and poignant glimpse into the past and a tangible connection to the late Princess.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, testified in a civil trial, vehemently denying allegations that she touched, scratched, or spat at a security guard in 2018. While admitting to a verbal altercation and calling the guard a "bitch" because she believed she was being recorded, Cardi B insisted the incident never turned physical. The security guard, Emani Ellis, claims the performer cursed at her, used slurs, body-shamed her, and scratched her left cheek. The article details the contentious courtroom exchange and the starkly differing accounts of the confrontation outside a Beverly Hills obstetrician’s office when Cardi B was four months pregnant, highlighting the ongoing legal dispute.</p>

          <p>A report from SAP Concur indicates a notable shift in US travel trends for the first half of 2025, with leisure travel experiencing a downturn while business travel remains robust. The United States emerged as the top global destination for business travelers, accounting for 15% of all international business air bookings, significantly outpacing other countries. This trend persists despite broader negative travel sentiment in other regions and ongoing global economic tensions, including Trump's tariff policies. The article suggests that corporate interests continue to drive travel to the US, with inbound business travel volume increasing slightly year-on-year, reinforcing its status as a stable hub for professional engagements.

While overall earnings for the first seven months still contracted, the manufacturing sector notably saw faster profit growth. The article highlights that despite this improvement, profit margins remain under pressure due to softened domestic demand and persistent deflation, which continues to impact corporate bottom lines across the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a reduced rate of decline in July, slipping 1.5% from a year earlier, marking the slowest contraction in five months. This recovery is attributed to Beijing's policies aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels and improving corporate margins amidst a campaign against price wars. While state-backed industrial firms still saw profit drops, businesses with foreign investments and the manufacturing and utilities sectors experienced profit increases. The article highlights this as a notable improvement after months of steeper declines, suggesting some effectiveness in government measures to bolster economic performance and indicating a potential easing of competitive strain on producers.
