The breaches exposed sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, for approximately 73 million current and former account holders. Eligible individuals could receive up to $7,500 in compensation for documented losses, though payments are contingent on the court's final approval of the settlement in December 2025.

          <p>Hurricane Erin has rapidly strengthened into a powerful Category 5 storm over the Caribbean, driven by a process known as rapid intensification. The storm's power surged due to a combination of low wind shear and its path over exceptionally warm ocean waters, with sea surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit. While the hurricane is not projected to make landfall on the U.S. mainland, tropical storm watches are in effect for several Caribbean islands, which face threats of significant rainfall, flash flooding, and mudslides. U.S. emergency agencies have preemptively deployed personnel to Puerto Rico as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Washington D.C. on Monday. The meeting concluded without an immediate ceasefire agreement, with Trump stating that the focus has shifted towards negotiating a comprehensive peace agreement to end the war, a move that aligns more with Russia's stated position. European leaders, while welcoming the diplomatic efforts, reiterated that Ukraine must receive robust security guarantees and that its territorial integrity must be respected. Zelenskyy's upcoming visit is seen as the critical next step in the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Nationwide immigration arrests conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) saw a 13% decline in July compared to the previous month. Activist groups believe their efforts, including nightly protests and rapid-response legal networks, may be contributing to the slowdown of the administration's deportation goals. In states like Oregon, which has a "sanctuary" law and lacks ICE detention facilities, activists work to file immediate legal challenges to prevent detainees from being transferred out of state. Despite criticism from federal officials, these local strategies appear to be complicating large-scale enforcement operations.</p>

Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record and securing a clear victory over Lyles, who finished second at 9.90 seconds. The race was a significant rematch after Lyles narrowly won Olympic gold over Thompson by just five-thousandths of a second a year ago.

His statement comes in response to accusations from conservative influencer Laura Loomer, who suggested that a top aide to Kennedy was laying the groundwork for a future campaign. Kennedy dismissed these claims as a "flat-out lie" propagated by the "swamp" to create a divide between him and the president. He emphasized his commitment to Trump's "make America healthy again" agenda and defended his staff from the attacks.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all of its operations after failing to reach a contract agreement with its 10,000 flight attendants, who are now on strike. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) initiated the strike early Saturday after a deadline passed without a deal, marking the first such action by the airline's flight attendants since 1985. The shutdown is expected to affect approximately 130,000 travelers daily, with key disagreements centered on wages and compensation for unpaid work. The airline has advised affected customers not to go to the airport and is offering refunds.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued by a helicopter crew after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search and rescue team located him using a drone. He was then hoisted to safety and treated for only minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent shift in focus from securing an immediate ceasefire to pursuing a direct peace agreement with Russia has generated significant concern in Kyiv and among European allies. This new stance, announced after his meeting with Vladimir Putin, is seen as aligning with Russia's long-held position that a ceasefire can only occur as part of a broader settlement, which Ukraine fears would imply capitulation. While European leaders have been briefed and are preparing for President Zelenskyy's upcoming visit to Washington, the development is viewed as a diplomatic setback that could give Russia more time to press its advantage on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to intensify its efforts in developing space-based solar power technology to compete with the United States. This technology involves building orbital stations that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The proposal highlights the need for a top-down national strategy, as current research is fragmented across universities and lacks the resources for such a large-scale project. The goal is to close the technological gap with the U.S., which has been experimenting with this concept for decades.</p>

          <p>A collection of articles explores the concept of the "Lighthouse Parent," a model that encourages guiding children without controlling their every move, as a healthier alternative to intensive parenting. This approach suggests that while parents are biologically driven to prevent their children's struggles, constantly intervening can be detrimental to a child's development of confidence and independence. The articles argue that being a steady, reliable guide who illuminates the way when needed, rather than hovering constantly, fosters more resilient children. This mindset also helps parents avoid burnout and the isolation that can accompany micromanagement.</p>

Their protest has gained national attention and support, notably from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has proposed a counter-redistricting measure in his state.

Hardin stated that lax security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform to simply walk out of a gate. He survived in the woods on smuggled food and foraged items before his recapture on June 6. The report led to the firing of two prison employees and highlights significant security failures, including misclassifying Hardin's custody level.</p>

Instead of adhering to a rigid schedule of activities, she uses this extra hour flexibly for things she enjoys, such as reading, listening to a podcast, or taking a longer walk with her dog.

          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals a significant decline in the number of young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving traditional life milestones such as moving out, securing a job, marrying, and having children. In 1975, nearly half of young adults had met all four milestones, whereas today that figure has dropped to less than a quarter. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, including the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. Economic stability is now often prioritized over marriage, which is increasingly viewed as a capstone achievement rather than a foundational one.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard design of the iPhone. Samsung's broader range of products at various price points also contributes to its success. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to compete in this growing high-end segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A selfie taken by fugitive Jamie Rothwell on an encrypted EncroChat phone inadvertently led to his capture and a 43-year sentence for running a massive drugs and firearms operation from Spain. When law enforcement agencies hacked the EncroChat network in 2020, they gained access to thousands of messages where Rothwell orchestrated his criminal enterprise, including trafficking AK-47s and ordering a shooting. The photo, showing his reflection and apartment view, allowed police to identify and locate him in Barcelona. The case highlights the critical intelligence gained from the EncroChat breach, which has led to over 2,200 criminal convictions.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell and her former bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, have been federally charged with fraud and corruption. Prosecutors allege the two engaged in an intimate relationship and used public funds to facilitate it, with Vappie claiming to be on duty during personal activities and trips, costing the city over $70,000. The indictment accuses them of using a city-owned apartment as a personal residence and taking personal trips while Vappie was being paid for protection work.

          <h2>Psychologist Outlines Three Steps to Build Emotional Endurance</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy, building emotional endurance—the ability to withstand stress without being overwhelmed—can be achieved through three key steps. First, she suggests using a visual aid to remind yourself that the struggle between not knowing and knowing is a natural part of the learning process. Second, engaging in positive self-talk can reframe difficult feelings and build mental strength. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which trains your body to tolerate discomfort and builds resilience over time.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has endorsed efforts to redraw the state's congressional maps mid-decade, a move that could significantly favor Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. Citing a recent Florida Supreme Court ruling that approved his previous dismantling of a Black-majority district in northern Florida, DeSantis and legislative allies are now targeting districts in the southern part of the state. Democrats have condemned the plan as a partisan power grab that silences voters, while DeSantis argues it is appropriate and necessary, potentially expanding Republican control of the state's congressional delegation.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed support for a potential trilateral meeting between the leaders of the United States, Russia, and Ukraine to negotiate an end to the war. Speaking after the Trump-Putin summit, Merz emphasized that a comprehensive peace agreement would be more valuable than a simple ceasefire, which he noted Russia was not ready for. He also confirmed that the U.S. is prepared to offer Ukraine significant security guarantees, a crucial element for any lasting peace deal. The comments reflect ongoing diplomatic efforts among Western allies to coordinate a unified strategy for resolving the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less, with a majority now believing that even moderate drinking is unhealthy. This trend is complemented by a sharp decline in underage drinking over the past few decades. The shift is largely seen as positive public health news, as reduced alcohol consumption is linked to lower rates of cancer, violent crime, and drunk driving fatalities.</p>

          <p>Health officials are attempting to contact hundreds of people who may have been exposed to rabies after staying in bat-infested cabins at Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park. The issue was discovered in late July at Jackson Lake Lodge, where a colony of bats was found in the attic above eight cabins. Although the few bats tested were negative for rabies, officials are taking precautions because a bat bite or scratch can go unnoticed, especially during sleep. They are recommending prophylactic shots for some former guests, as rabies is nearly always fatal once symptoms appear.</p>

In a letter, Engine criticized Avantor's flawed leadership, poor capital allocation on overpriced acquisitions, and a board that rejected a previous acquisition offer at a significant premium. The firm is pushing for operational improvements, cost reductions, board refreshment, and a focus on share repurchases, suggesting a sale of the company should also be considered to create shareholder value.
