          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a Republican-led bill to fund the government until November 21, aiming to prevent a shutdown before the September 30 deadline. The proposal includes additional funding for lawmaker security but faces strong opposition from Democrats, who have presented a counteroffer with different priorities, such as extending Affordable Care Act tax credits. With a slim GOP majority, the bill's passage in the House is uncertain, and it faces even greater challenges in the Senate, where it requires bipartisan support to overcome the 60-vote threshold. The political maneuvering increases the likelihood of a government shutdown as both parties hold firm on their positions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, after his office declined to press mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources indicate that federal prosecutors found no clear evidence of wrongdoing by James, but Trump administration officials pressured Siebert to bring charges anyway. The move raises significant concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice and the use of federal power to target political adversaries. The administration is reportedly seeking a replacement who would more aggressively pursue the investigation into one of Trump's most prominent critics.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, consumers with high-cost debt may find some relief, but a strategic approach is still necessary for meaningful progress. Financial experts recommend three key strategies for paying down balances on credit cards and loans. These include creating a strict budget to identify extra cash for payments, negotiating lower interest rates with creditors or utilizing balance transfers, and making more than the minimum payments on student loans. The article also emphasizes that understanding the emotional spending habits that contribute to debt is a crucial first step toward achieving financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has defended his decision to recognize a Palestinian state, arguing it is a necessary measure to combat Hamas and advance a peaceful resolution. Responding to criticism from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called the plan "reckless," Macron stated that Hamas's goal is the destruction of Israel, not the creation of a Palestinian state. He asserted that formally recognizing Palestine is a precondition for isolating the militant group and pursuing a viable peace plan. France plans to formalize this recognition at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly, a move that puts it at odds with the current U.S. position.</p>

          <p>A senior official in China's Xinjiang region has publicly admitted for the first time that U.S. sanctions are having a negative impact on local economic development and employment. Chen Weijun, vice-chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, stated that some businesses are facing difficulties with exports, leading to production cuts and fewer job opportunities for residents, including ethnic Uyghurs. Despite these short-term challenges, he expressed confidence in the region's long-term growth prospects.

          <p>Internal documents reveal that U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and NYPD, have alleged that the use of specific emojis like trains, ninjas, and strawberries could signal affiliation with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA). These claims, disseminated in official briefings, have been criticized by gang experts and immigration attorneys as "ludicrous" and "baseless." Critics express concern that such profiling could lead to erroneous labeling and severe consequences, including deportation, for individuals based on common social media usage. The controversy echoes previous instances where authorities have used dubious indicators, like tattoos, to allege gang membership among immigrants.</p>

          <p>A new book by AI doomsayer Eliezer Yudkowsky, titled "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies," argues that a superintelligent AI would inevitably exterminate humanity. However, this article contends that such apocalyptic predictions are based on flawed premises, just like the utopian forecasts from AI accelerationists. Both camps mistakenly treat intelligence as a single, scalable metric and anthropomorphize AI systems, attributing human-like desires for power and resources to them. The author suggests these extreme narratives serve the interests of tech oligarchs by framing AI as a world-altering force, distracting from more immediate, practical concerns about the technology's deployment and societal impact.</p>

The new measures are expected to target Russia's fossil fuel imports, banking sector, and cryptocurrency markets.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for more decisive action from allies after another significant Russian drone attack, while the head of Britain's MI6 stated there is no evidence that Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiating a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace was achieved by relaxing its seller vetting processes, leading to significant problems with counterfeit products and fraud. The report details how shoppers have received fake and potentially dangerous items, and dozens of sellers were found to be using the stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create their accounts. This strategy, aimed at competing with Amazon, has reportedly created a "Wild West" environment on the platform, undermining consumer trust. Walmart has stated it has a zero-tolerance policy for such issues and is investing in new safety tools.</p>

          <p>President Trump responded to a federal appeals court ruling against his across-the-board tariffs with a statement claiming the decision would "literally destroy the United States of America." The court found that Trump had overstepped his authority by using an emergency economic powers act for broad tariff imposition, a power the Constitution grants to Congress. This article argues that Trump's hysterical language is a tactic to intimidate the Supreme Court, where the case is headed, into siding with him. Economists widely agree that the tariffs have harmed the U.S. economy by increasing inflation, making the court's potential block a potential benefit, not a catastrophe.</p>

For these students, who overcame immense challenges like destroyed homes and universities, intermittent internet, and the constant threat of violence to complete their applications, the decision has been devastating.

A recent survey of EU businesses highlighted ongoing market access issues, with very few applications for certain licenses being approved by Chinese authorities.

          <p>Amid a crisis of public trust in higher education and the rise of AI, Dartmouth's president argues that the residential college experience is more crucial than ever. The true purpose of a university, she contends, is not merely knowledge transfer but teaching students how to think critically and cultivate essential human skills like communication, empathy, and collaborative leadership. In an era of information overload and online polarization, face-to-face dialogue and structured debate in a campus community are vital for developing these abilities. While embracing AI as a tool, higher education must double down on its mission to foster what makes us human.</p>

          <p>Britain's foreign intelligence service, MI6, has launched a secure portal on the dark web called "Silent Courier" to recruit new agents from around the world, with a particular focus on Russia. The initiative aims to leverage the anonymity of the dark web to allow individuals with sensitive information to securely contact UK intelligence. In his final public speech, outgoing MI6 chief Sir Richard Moore made a direct appeal to potential spies and strongly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating there is no evidence he desires a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine. The move is part of a broader effort to adapt intelligence gathering to modern technology.</p>

          <h2>Rapid Adoption of AI Contrasts Sharply with Slower Diffusion of Past Technologies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent reports from OpenAI and Anthropic show that artificial intelligence is being adopted at an unprecedented speed, far surpassing the diffusion rates of previous transformative technologies like computers or electricity. While early computer use was dominated by the military, AI tools like ChatGPT have reached hundreds of millions of weekly users in less than two years for a wide range of tasks. This rapid uptake suggests that the economic and societal adjustments that took decades for past innovations may occur much more quickly with AI. However, the article cautions that current usage patterns may not predict long-term impacts on labor or economic growth.</p>

          <p>The renowned magical duo Penn & Teller have been inducted as members of the prestigious Magic Circle, ending a 50-year period during which they were barred from the organization. The pair were famously excluded for their signature practice of revealing the secrets behind their tricks, which violated the society's cardinal rule. The Magic Circle's president acknowledged that while they were once seen as controversial, their originality and artistic performances have earned them legendary status. The induction ceremony took place at the London Palladium, where the duo is currently performing their 50th-anniversary show, marking a significant reconciliation within the magic community.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 06:23:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's borrowing reached £18 billion in August, the highest figure for that month in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics. This larger-than-expected deficit was driven by increased spending on public services, benefits, and debt interest, which outpaced the growth in tax receipts. The figures add pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the November Budget, as she aims to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules of not borrowing for day-to-day spending and getting debt to fall as a share of national income. Analysts suggest that tax increases may be necessary to address the deteriorating public finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio warned that mounting and unsustainable U.S. government debt is creating a major fiscal crisis that puts the current monetary order at risk. Speaking at a forum, the Bridgewater founder argued that as major global currencies face devaluation pressures from excessive government spending, gold and other non-fiat currencies will become more reliable stores of value. He suggested that the U.S. government has a significant supply-demand imbalance for its debt, which will have long-term consequences. Dalio recommended that investors consider diversifying their portfolios by allocating around 10% to gold to hedge against these risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series went on sale worldwide, with the company facing significant pressure from growing competition in key markets like China and questions about its artificial intelligence strategy. In China, where Apple has lost market share to local rivals like Huawei, initial preorder data from e-commerce platforms suggests strong demand for the new models. The global launch is a critical test for Apple to demonstrate that its latest hardware upgrades, including new designs and features, are compelling enough to retain customer loyalty and drive sales. The company's AI features, which were announced but have yet to be fully rolled out, remain a key area of focus for investors.</p>

          <p>Human remains discovered near a mountain creek in Oregon in 1976 have been identified as Marion Vinetta Nagle McWhorter, a 21-year-old woman who vanished in 1974. The cold case, known as "Swamp Mountain Jane Doe," was solved after nearly 50 years through forensic genealogy and a DNA match with her younger sister, Valerie Nagle. Nagle had spent decades searching for her sister and submitted her DNA to an ancestry website in hopes of finding a lead. The identification brings a long-awaited answer to the family, and the Linn County Sheriff's Office is now investigating the circumstances surrounding McWhorter's death.</p>

          <p>The decision by ABC to pull Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show from the air is being condemned as a dangerous moment for free speech in America. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, which drew the ire of the Trump administration and a threat from the FCC chairman. This article argues that the network's move is part of a broader trend of media capitulation to political bullying from the Trump administration, which is increasingly using its power to silence critics. This incident is seen as a significant escalation, marking a new level of censorship that erodes the media's role as a check on power.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C.'s veteran non-voting delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, 88, is facing a primary challenge from city council member Robert White. Announcing his candidacy, White argued that the district needs its "strongest fighters" to counter interference from the Trump administration, implying it is time for new leadership. The challenge comes amid growing concerns about Norton's ability to continue serving effectively, with former aides also suggesting she should not seek a 19th term. The move highlights a generational shift and a desire for more energetic representation as the city navigates a tense relationship with the federal government over issues like crime and local autonomy.</p>

This initiative aims to secure a direct supply chain of cobalt, a key component in electric vehicle batteries and military technology, for the U.S. and its allies.

          <p>A woman has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against a former Riverside County sheriff's deputy, the department, and the sheriff, alleging the deputy used law enforcement databases to stalk her. The lawsuit claims that after a brief meeting, the deputy illegally looked up her personal information, showed up at her home unannounced under false pretenses, and sent her unwanted flirtatious messages. The former deputy pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of illegally accessing the databases and received probation, a result the woman feels was insufficient. The case raises serious questions about the abuse of power and law enforcement resources for personal harassment.</p>
