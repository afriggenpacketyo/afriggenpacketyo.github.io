          <p>A mass shooting in Montgomery, Alabama's downtown nightlife district resulted in two fatalities and twelve injuries when rival gunmen opened fire in a crowded area. The victims who died were identified as a 17-year-old and a 43-year-old, with several other young people among the injured. Police Chief James Graboys stated the incident was a targeted exchange of gunfire between two parties who disregarded the safety of the surrounding crowd. Authorities have recovered multiple weapons and are actively investigating to bring the perpetrators to justice, emphasizing the event was not connected to the city's weekend festivities.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old New Jersey man was arrested outside Saint Matthew’s Cathedral in Washington, D.C., for possessing a Molotov cocktail and other suspicious items. The arrest occurred early Sunday morning before the cathedral was scheduled to host its annual Red Mass, an event for judges, lawyers, and public officials. Metropolitan Police Department officers, who were on detail for the event, identified the man in a tent on the cathedral steps, from which he had been previously barred. The suspect was taken into custody without incident, and an explosive disposal team secured the scene, confirming no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

After an early lead by Wigan, St Helens scored twice to lead at the break.

Cravitz was one of two men killed when an assailant rammed a car into worshippers and stabbed them during services for Yom Kippur. Friends and community members remembered him as a kind, charismatic, and loving man who was a devoted fixture in his community and family. The service took place in Salford, where many gathered in the rain to pay their respects and listen to eulogies celebrating his life.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon. The judge, a Trump appointee, ruled that the president's justification for the deployment was "untethered to the facts," as recent protests in the city were not significantly violent or disruptive. The state of Oregon had filed a lawsuit arguing the president lacked the authority to federalize the Guard for domestic law enforcement in this context.

          <p>Following a disappointing 1-1 draw, angry Rangers fans attempted to block the team bus from leaving Falkirk Stadium, requiring a significant police presence to manage the situation. Head coach Russell Martin, who is under intense pressure due to a string of poor results, was escorted from the grounds in a separate police car for his safety. The protest highlights growing fan frustration, with the team currently eighth in the Premiership and Martin having secured only one win in his first seven league matches. The club's board now faces a decision on the manager's future during the upcoming international break.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he believes hostages held in Gaza could be freed "very soon" as mediators prepare for peace talks in Egypt. His comments come after Hamas partially agreed to a U.S. peace plan, which includes releasing hostages and transferring governance, though key issues like disarmament remain unresolved. Despite Trump's call for Israel to halt bombing, Israeli air strikes have continued in Gaza, with a government spokesperson clarifying that there is no formal ceasefire and forces are acting for defensive purposes.

Speakers at the event, including local faith leaders and community activists, expressed that the erasure of the symbol re-traumatized victims' families and represented a broader effort to erase marginalized communities.

Investors are also focused on an upcoming investor day for Solstice Advanced Materials, which is set to be spun off from Honeywell, providing details on its future growth prospects. Additionally, a light week for corporate earnings will still offer valuable insights into the economy, with reports expected from companies like Constellation Brands, PepsiCo, and Delta Air Lines. This corporate commentary is especially crucial as the flow of official government economic data has been halted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has indicated that mass layoffs of federal employees will commence if President Trump concludes that negotiations to end the government shutdown have reached a complete impasse. Speaking on Sunday, Hassett stated that the administration is preparing for this contingency but remains hopeful that Democrats will negotiate reasonably when Congress reconvenes. The shutdown, now in its fifth day, is centered on a dispute over Democrats' demands to include an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits in any funding legislation, a condition Republicans have so far rejected.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Conservative Party has unveiled a plan to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants within five years as part of a tougher stance on border control. The proposal, announced at the party's annual conference, includes banning anyone who enters the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum and replacing court appeals with an internal Home Office process. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch stated that a rebranded "Removals Force" would be tasked with deporting at least 150,000 people annually to their home countries or other safe nations. The plan also involves leaving the European Convention on Human Rights to expedite the process.</p>

          <p>Police in Tbilisi, Georgia, used water cannons and pepper spray to disperse anti-government protesters who attempted to storm the presidential palace, resulting in five arrests. The clashes occurred amid a long-standing political crisis following last year's disputed election, which the ruling Georgian Dream party won. The opposition, which claims the election was fraudulent, is largely boycotting the current local elections. Tens of thousands marched in the capital, demanding the release of political prisoners and snap elections, reflecting deep divisions over the government's perceived pro-Russian stance and its decision to pause EU accession talks.</p>

          <p>According to psychologist Dr. Mark Travers, the number one cause of fights among couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations about these topics. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, turning simple questions into perceived accusations. Dr. Travers advises individuals to become self-aware and apologize for harsh tones, rephrasing their statements to de-escalate potential arguments. He also suggests that the person on the receiving end should calmly request their partner to try again, thereby interrupting a negative cycle before it begins.</p>

The heavy snowfall, which began Friday, caused tents to collapse and left some individuals suffering from hypothermia.

          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025, highlighting the sport's rapid financial growth, primarily concentrated in England's Women's Super League and the U.S. National Women's Soccer League. While experts see this as a positive sign for the sport's ecosystem, there are growing concerns that the escalating fees could widen the gap between the wealthiest leagues and the rest of the world. For example, Germany's Bundesliga is struggling to compete financially, with its broadcasting and sponsorship deals trailing far behind those in England and the U.S. This financial disparity risks creating a permanent elite tier of clubs that smaller leagues cannot challenge.</p>

          <p>Democrats are strategically embracing the political risks of a government shutdown in what activists describe as their most significant effort to challenge President Trump's use of executive power. By blocking Republican funding measures, Democrats are leveraging the shutdown to force negotiations on key priorities, particularly the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. Progressive groups are supporting the strategy, framing it as a necessary stand against the administration's perceived attacks on the Constitution and congressional authority. While Republicans accuse Democrats of sabotage, early polling suggests voters are more inclined to blame the GOP for the impasse.</p>

          <p>A successful vaccination program against the human papillomavirus (HPV) in the United States has significantly reduced infections, suggesting that herd immunity against the primary cause of cervical cancer is attainable. A new study found that high, gender-neutral vaccination rates led to a substantial decline in cancer-causing HPV strains, even among unvaccinated women, who saw a 75% drop in infections. This indirect protection highlights the community-wide benefit of the vaccine, which is typically administered to adolescents. However, experts caution that maintaining this protection depends on sustaining high vaccination rates amid challenges like global vaccine skepticism and misinformation.</p>

Fidesz has historically outspent all its rivals combined, using paid online content as a cornerstone of its communication. To counter the ban, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has launched an initiative to recruit online activists, or "digital freedom fighters," to spread the party's message organically.
