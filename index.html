          <p>President Trump addressed the nation, calling the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites a "spectacular military success" and warning of further attacks if Iran does not pursue peace.

          <p>Analysts suggest that despite the US's direct involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, its long-term strategic focus on containing China in the Indo-Pacific remains unchanged. While the US has redeployed some military assets to the Middle East, Washington has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to prioritizing strategic resources for China. The redeployment of assets, such as the USS Nimitz, has prompted caution from Taiwan, which relies on the US military presence in the region. The US's decision to strike Iran expands its military engagement in the Middle East, but its strategic emphasis on China persists.</p>

          <p>A new wave of conservative thinkers is challenging the traditional Republican focus on free markets, low taxes, and deregulation, advocating for economic populism centered on the working class. Oren Cass, founder of American Compass, argues that the GOP has been too focused on corporate interests and market fundamentalism. He suggests a reset that embraces American manufacturing and empowers workers, distinguishing this approach from democratic socialism by emphasizing traditional values and national solidarity. While some policies reflect this shift, such as tariffs, skepticism remains about the Republican Party's commitment to these changes.</p>
