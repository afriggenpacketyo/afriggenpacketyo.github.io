          <p>Federal investigators are probing the motive behind a deadly attack at a Michigan church, where a gunman killed four people and injured eight before being killed by police. The suspect drove his truck into the building, opened fire, and then set it ablaze. The FBI is leading the investigation as an act of targeted violence, exploring potential connections to the recent death of the LDS Church's president. Officials have described the chapel as a total loss and believe more victims could be found in the rubble.</p>

          <p>This article provides financial advice for federal employees facing a potential government shutdown and the added threat of mass firings. Experts recommend a focus on cash flow, creating a detailed budget to understand all expenses, and contacting lenders to inquire about hardship assistance or payment deferrals. Given the unprecedented threat of permanent layoffs, workers are also advised to research unemployment benefits and health insurance options in advance to prepare for a potential loss of income.

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced new proposals requiring legal migrants to demonstrate their contribution to society to earn indefinite leave to remain. Under the plan, migrants would need to learn English to a high standard, maintain a clean criminal record, and volunteer in their community. The Labour government is framing the policy as a way to ensure integration and counter arguments from the Reform UK party, which has been gaining in opinion polls. The policy aims to redefine the path to permanent settlement in the country.</p>

          <p>The nation's two largest real estate firms, Compass and Anywhere, have announced a proposed $1.6 billion merger that would create a network of 340,000 agents. While the companies state the deal will create efficiencies and deliver more value to home buyers and sellers, some industry analysts express concern that the consolidation could increase pressure on smaller, independent brokerages. The merger comes at a time of a softening housing market and is pending shareholder and regulatory approval before it can proceed.</p>

          <p>Over 100 years after John D. Rockefeller became America's first billionaire, the U.S. is now home to over 900 billionaires who collectively hold an estimated $6.8 trillion in wealth. Research indicates that the share of national wealth held by the top one percent is approaching levels last seen during the Gilded Age. The fortunes of today's wealthiest individuals are increasingly derived from technology and financial markets rather than the traditional industries that created the fortunes of the past.</p>

          <p>After a period of turbulence and team changes, England's women's cricket team enters the 50-over World Cup in India under significant pressure to perform. While Australia and host-nation India are considered the favorites, a semi-final appearance is seen as the minimum expectation for the English side. The team's ability to handle pressure, improve their batting against spin, and enhance their fielding will be key to their success in the high-stakes tournament, which follows a period of heavy investment in the women's game.</p>

          <p>A dance teacher injured in the 2024 Southport attack stated in evidence to a public inquiry that locked doors would have made the outcome "severely worse." She believed the attacker would have found another way in or simply waited outside, trapping people inside by blocking exits. The inquiry also heard that fire safety legislation required the doors to remain unlocked as they were designated fire exits, and that planning for such a violent attack was not part of standard safety procedures for the workshop.</p>

          <p>This article outlines five key pitfalls to avoid when trying to pay off debt, such as using predatory debt-relief services or tapping into retirement funds, which can incur penalties and sacrifice future growth. It also warns against relying too heavily on balance transfer cards without a clear payoff plan and neglecting to build at least a small emergency fund. The advice emphasizes that a sustainable, balanced approach is more effective than seeking quick fixes that can ultimately backfire financially. (not investment advice)</p>

The non-repayable grants will be targeted at students enrolled in "priority courses" that align with the country's industrial strategy. This new program will be funded by a new tax levied on the fees paid by international students, a funding mechanism that has drawn criticism from some university representatives as potentially harming the sector.</p>
