          <p>President Trump has confirmed he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The summit comes as a Trump-imposed deadline for a ceasefire expires, with the administration weighing heavy sanctions on Russia and its trading partners. While the White House has expressed openness to including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, this initial meeting will be bilateral. Trump has stated he expects that a potential peace deal could involve "some swapping of territories" between Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Co. and actress Gina Carano have settled her wrongful termination lawsuit, filed after she was fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts. This article contextualizes the settlement against other corporate legal battles, including one where an anchor wrongly stated Trump was found liable for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll. The author argues that Carano's firing was an overreaction and that the settlement represents a reasonable conclusion, separate from broader trends of "cancel culture." The piece suggests that Disney's initial decision to fire her, not the settlement itself, was the more problematic action.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only individual to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Appointed by President Jimmy Carter to head the FBI in 1978, he was tasked with restoring the agency's reputation after a period of scandal and domestic spying revelations. He later led the CIA under President Ronald Reagan, stepping in after the Iran-Contra affair. Webster was widely respected as a figure of integrity who championed the rule of law throughout his long career in public service, which also included roles as a federal prosecutor and judge.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have fled Texas to prevent Republicans from passing a new congressional map sought by Donald Trump, which could help secure a GOP House majority in 2026. Their absence has blocked a legislative quorum, prompting Republican leaders to threaten arrest and removal from office, with the state's attorney general suing to vacate their seats. The standoff has escalated into a national political fight, with California's Democratic leaders vowing to retaliate by redrawing their own state's map to neutralize any Republican gains. The Texas Democrats, facing financial penalties and legal pressure, remain defiant in their efforts.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has welcomed Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled their state to block a Republican-led redistricting effort. In response to the Texas plan, Newsom announced that California is preparing its own emergency measures to redraw its congressional maps to favor Democrats, vowing to "nullify" any seats the GOP gains in Texas. This move, supported by prominent Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, would involve a ballot measure asking California voters to approve new maps for the 2026 election. The strategy represents a significant escalation, turning a state-level dispute into a national battle over political power ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

Officials described the shooting as an act where the suspect murdered four people "in cold blood for no reason whatsoever." The suspect, a military veteran who reportedly struggled with mental illness, lived next door to the bar. The victims were identified as Daniel Baillie, Nancy Kelley, David Leach, and Tony Palm, all residents of the small community.</p>

          <p>A grassroots campaign called "Adopt a Corner" has emerged in Southern California, with local residents organizing to monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity. Volunteers gather daily at locations like a Home Depot in Pasadena to provide information to day laborers and act as observers, aiming to protect vulnerable members of their community. This local-level activism reflects a shift from large downtown protests to smaller, community-based actions in suburban areas. The effort is supported by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which provides training for citizens who wish to document ICE raids and assist immigrant families.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are grappling with the loss of star offensive tackle Rashawn Slater, who will miss the entire season after rupturing his patellar tendon. Coach Jim Harbaugh described the injury as a "gut punch," leaving a significant void in the team's offensive line. Slater, a cornerstone of the offense, is set to undergo surgery, and the team is now forced to reshuffle its lineup, with Trey Pipkins III expected to step into the starting role. The injury has cast a somber mood over the team's training camp as they prepare for the upcoming season without one of their key players.</p>

Despite production moving from the UK to Turkey in 2013, the Transit remains the world's best-selling van, with over 13 million built. As the brand moves toward an electric future, it faces a more competitive market where the brand loyalty it once commanded is no longer guaranteed.</p>

          <p>The UK's advertising watchdog has seen a significant increase in complaints about ads featuring models who appear "unhealthily thin," sparking warnings of a return to the "super skinny" aesthetic of the 1990s. High-profile brands like Zara, Next, and Marks & Spencer have recently had advertisements banned for this reason. While the body positivity movement has gained traction in recent years, some activists and models believe the industry is on the cusp of reverting to harmful beauty standards. This trend is occurring alongside the rise of social media hashtags like "skinnytok," which critics say idolize extreme thinness and contribute to unhealthy body images.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving brush fire, named the Canyon fire, has burned nearly 5,400 acres in Southern California, forcing thousands to evacuate in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. The blaze is fueled by record-low moisture levels in the vegetation and triple-digit temperatures, creating precarious firefighting conditions. This fire comes as another major wildfire, the Gifford fire, has become the state's largest of the year, burning over 99,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest. Officials warn that wildfire risk will remain elevated across California as a heatwave intensifies, with the driest conditions making new fires more challenging to control.</p>

This move follows an executive order that designated several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a status that Secretary of State Marco Rubio says shifts the issue from law enforcement to national security. The designation provides greater legal authority to use elements of national power, including intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense, to target these groups.

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has begun issuing licenses to Nvidia, allowing the company to export its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China. This move reverses a previous ban and removes a significant hurdle for the chipmaker's access to a key market, though exports of its more advanced AI chips remain restricted. The H20 chip was specifically designed by Nvidia to comply with U.S. export controls aimed at slowing Beijing's technological and military development. The company had previously warned that the restrictions would significantly impact its sales, with China accounting for 12.5% of its revenue in the first quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC documentary explores the complex impact of hook-up apps like Grindr on the mental health of some gay men. While the apps can offer a way to explore sexuality and find community, some users report that the focus on casual sexual encounters can become addictive and damaging to their self-esteem. One user describes feeling objectified, "like picking clothes on Asos," and caught in a cycle of seeking validation that fuels anxiety and depression. The experience highlights a cultural tension for those seeking more meaningful connections in a digital space that often prioritizes instant gratification and physical encounters over emotional intimacy.</p>

President Xi Youmin argues that global divisions are stifling academic freedom and scientific research, with universities in the West facing political pressure to scale back diversity and inclusion initiatives. He believes that one way to ease the situation and improve understanding of China is for the country to ease visa restrictions and welcome more foreign students and visitors.

          <p>President Trump has removed Billy Long as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) just two months after he was sworn into the position. Long, a former congressman from Missouri, was expected to serve a term running through November 2027 but is now reportedly being nominated for the post of ambassador to Iceland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will temporarily serve as acting commissioner. Long's brief tenure occurred as the Trump administration implemented significant tax cuts and the IRS absorbed job cuts from the president's government efficiency initiative. Long stated on social media that he was honored to serve and excited for his new role.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to approve a plan to occupy Gaza City is being driven by his political reliance on hard-right coalition partners, according to this analysis from The Atlantic. This move is opposed by both the Israeli security establishment and a majority of the Israeli public, who favor ending the war with a hostage deal. The far-right parties in Netanyahu's government advocate for the annexation and resettlement of Gaza, a goal he must appease to maintain his narrow coalition and avoid new elections. President Trump's hands-off approach and rhetoric have further enabled these absolutist outcomes, leaving Netanyahu's actions dictated by political survival.</p>

Lowe shared a picture of their boat and wrote that he had alerted authorities, calling for mass deportations if they were migrants. After HM Coastguard confirmed the crew was rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research, Lowe issued a follow-up post. He apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause, while maintaining he makes no apologies for being vigilant.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with the Trump administration, throwing out a lower court's finding of criminal contempt against officials involved in the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The case began when a district judge blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, but planes carrying migrants still departed for El Salvador. The judge found this demonstrated a "willful disregard" for his order, but the D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled 2-1 to vacate the contempt finding. The majority opinion stated the ruling was necessary to prevent extended conflict between the executive and judicial branches over core executive functions like foreign policy.</p>

The policy is part of a coordinated international effort to increase economic pressure on Moscow and limit a crucial source of revenue funding Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne stated that the measure is intended to ratchet up economic pressure and hold Russia accountable for its illegal invasion. (not investment advice)</p>

During the meeting, Trump assured Cook that Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips due to its increased investment in U.S. manufacturing.
