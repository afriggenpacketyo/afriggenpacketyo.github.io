          <p>Former President Donald Trump surveyed the catastrophic flood damage in central Texas, where the disaster has resulted in 120 fatalities and left over 160 people missing. Meeting with local officials and families in Kerrville, he pledged federal support for the rebuilding efforts and praised the ongoing search operations. The tragedy was particularly acute for Camp Mystic, a local summer camp where 27 young girls were among those killed by the deluge. Questions are being raised about the effectiveness of the warning systems and evacuation procedures prior to the flood.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-supported organization, reports distributing 70 million meals in Gaza since May, but faces significant opposition from established aid groups. The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and over 230 NGOs have criticized GHF's methods, alleging they lead to chaos and casualties, and are urging a return to the UN-led distribution model. GHF contends that these legacy organizations, some allegedly allied with Hamas, are resisting a new system that bypasses their control and corruption. The conflict has turned violent, with GHF staff killed and U.S. veterans injured in attacks.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the 2016 South China Sea arbitration ruling, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has once again stated Beijing's firm rejection of the decision. Speaking at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Wang described the ruling, which favored the Philippines, as a "farce" that was manipulated by external powers to destabilize the region for their own benefit. He emphasized China's commitment to maintaining regional stability and advancing negotiations for a code of conduct with ASEAN nations. This restatement comes amid renewed tensions in the strategic waterway.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. While Swiatek holds the advantage in major final experience, Anisimova's underdog status may allow her to play more freely and aggressively. Both players have adapted their games for the grass court, with Swiatek adjusting her court positioning to better utilize her powerful top-spin forehand. The outcome will likely depend on which athlete better manages the immense pressure of the occasion, as they compete for a historic first-time Wimbledon title.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is navigating the growing tensions between the U.S. and China by championing a doctrine of national self-interest, summarized as "Australia first." Drawing inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasizes that Australia's foreign policy must be based on strategic reality rather than just tradition. While reaffirming the country's commitment to the AUKUS security pact and its alliance with the United States, his government aims to recalibrate relationships with all global powers. This approach signals a determination to shape Australia's own future in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods if the Trump administration follows through on a threat to levy a 50% tariff. The U.S. threat is linked to the criminal trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, an ally of Donald Trump, which the U.S. has labeled a "witch hunt." Lula stated he would invoke Brazil's reciprocity law, escalating the risk of a trade war between the two nations. The move by the U.S. to use trade policy to influence another country's domestic judicial proceedings has drawn criticism and united political factions within Brazil.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to take effect on August 1st. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the administration cited Canada's alleged failure to stop the flow of fentanyl and its own retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the move. This action represents a significant escalation in trade tensions with one of America's largest trading partners. The letter suggests the tariff could be adjusted if Canada cooperates on stemming drug trafficking, a claim that is being scrutinized as very little fentanyl enters the U.S. via the Canadian border.</p>

The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he hit the switch, with the other pilot denying he had done so.

The piece sarcastically suggests that with proposed budget cuts, significant layoffs of senior staff, and the appointment of a former reality TV star as interim head, perhaps the era of ambitious space travel is over. The author humorously argues that space is full of uninteresting things and that the funds could be better used for other administration priorities.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has invalidated a plea agreement for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and two co-defendants that would have allowed them to avoid the death penalty. The court ruled that the former defense secretary acted within his authority when he revoked the deal, which had been negotiated over two years. The agreement would have sentenced the men to life in prison and was seen by some victims' families as a path to closure. This ruling reverses a lower military court's decision and means the defendants will likely face a full military trial.</p>

          <p>A farmworker has died from injuries sustained during a large-scale immigration raid at two Glass House cannabis farm sites in California. The raid, which led to the arrest of 200 workers, devolved into a chaotic scene with authorities in riot gear deploying smoke canisters against protesting family members and advocates. The United Farm Workers advocacy group confirmed the death of Jaime Alanis, who reportedly fell from a building while trying to hide from agents. The incident has intensified fears within immigrant communities and drawn sharp criticism over the aggressive tactics used by federal authorities at the licensed agricultural operation.</p>

It is also facing user backlash for a new 25% fee on crypto staking rewards and public objections from OpenAI regarding its tokenized stock offerings.

          <p>Grok 4, the latest version of Elon Musk's AI chatbot, has been shown to produce racist and sexist outputs despite being billed as the "smartest AI in the world." When prompted with a loaded request to identify a "good scientist" based on race and gender, the AI generated a program favoring white and Asian men, using Nobel Prize demographics as a flawed basis. This occurred even as the chatbot acknowledged the premise was discriminatory. The behavior is attributed to Musk's directive to create a non-"woke" AI, which may have resulted in fewer safeguards against bias compared to competing models.</p>

This "loyal wingman" concept, where uncrewed aircraft are directed by crewed fighters, is a key focus for the U.S. as it competes with China to achieve air dominance.
