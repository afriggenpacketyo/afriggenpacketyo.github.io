          <p>Jack Draper secured his place in the Madrid Open final by defeating Lorenzo Musetti in a tightly contested match, with a final score of 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Draper, the British number one, is set to compete against Casper Ruud of Norway in the final. Draper expressed that the level of play was high from both competitors, and he reflected on the sacrifices he makes on a daily basis to reach key moments like these. This marks Draper's first clay-court final and makes him the first Englishman to reach the Madrid Open final, following Andy Murray as the second Briton to do so.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified antibodies in the blood of Tim Friede, a man who has been bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, that can neutralize the venom of multiple deadly snake species. This discovery, reported in the journal Cell, could lead to the creation of a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives each year. The antibodies, when combined with a drug that blocks neurotoxins, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species from various regions. This research offers a promising path toward a more effective and accessible treatment for snakebites, which affect millions of people globally, particularly in rural areas of Africa.

          <p>Several medical journals have received letters from the Justice Department, raising concerns about potential bias in their research reporting. The letters, sent by U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr., question the journals' handling of misinformation, competing viewpoints, and the influence of funders. Editors of the journals, including The New England Journal of Medicine, express surprise and concern, viewing the letters as an attempt to intimidate and interfere with scientific research. Legal experts suggest the letters raise First Amendment concerns and could represent an unprecedented attempt by the administration to influence the scientific community.</p>

Researchers have now identified antibodies in Friede's blood that neutralize neurotoxins from multiple snake species. This discovery, published in the journal Cell, has led to the development of a new antivenom cocktail that offers mice complete protection against 13 snake species and partial protection against six more. The team plans to test the cocktail in dogs bitten by venomous snakes in Australia and hopes to expand its coverage to include vipers.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has expressed his devastation over the loss of his legal battle for security protection in the United Kingdom, stating that he still hopes for "reconciliation" with his family. Harry noted that his father, the king, is no longer speaking to him because of his legal battle for security protection. In response to Harry’s interview with the BBC, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said that all of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.</p>

The letter, signed by 76 footwear brands, highlights the potential for factory closures and consumer price increases due to the high tariff rates. The group warns that the tariffs will not result in bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., as Trump has promised, because they erase the certainty that businesses require in order to invest in sourcing changes.</p>

          <p>The movie "Rust", on which Halyna Hutchins was accidentally killed, is a moody indie western with a heart and a conscience, exploring violence's aftermath and atonement's hard road. The film tells the story of orphaned farm boy Lucas, who mistakenly kills a local rancher, and his escape with his outlaw grandfather Harland Rust. The movie's themes and the tragic accident on set make its release feel more like a solemn performance at a wake. Despite its strengths, the central relationship between Baldwin's killer and McDermott's innocent never quite gels into meaningful cross-generational intimacy.</p>

NASA also plans to streamline its workforce, IT services, and facility operations, while terminating multiple missions.
