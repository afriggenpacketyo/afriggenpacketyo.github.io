          <p>China's significant investment in African ports, driven by the Belt and Road Initiative and its 'go out' policy, is expanding its influence on the continent's infrastructure.  A new study reveals China's involvement in over one-quarter of Africa's ports, highlighting the strategic importance of the region to China's global trade ambitions.  This raises questions about the potential implications for regional geopolitics and China's long-term strategic goals.</p>

          <p>Negotiations for a lasting Israel-Hamas ceasefire are stalled over the release of hostages held in Gaza and the terms of a permanent end to the conflict.  Mediators are working to bridge the gap between Israel's demands for immediate hostage release and Hamas' conditions for ceasefire talks, including troop withdrawal.  The situation is further complicated by dwindling aid supplies in Gaza and potential shifts in Israeli politics.</p>

          <h2>Wholesale Egg Prices Decline; Grocery Prices May Follow</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-17 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wholesale egg prices have been falling for three weeks, offering potential relief to consumers after months of high costs.  The decline is attributed to a decrease in bird flu outbreaks, allowing egg supplies to recover.  However, the impact on grocery store prices may be delayed due to inventory issues and retailer caution, with the continued absence of bird flu outbreaks being a key factor in determining the speed of price reductions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alabama has seen a remarkable turnaround in 4th-grade math scores, becoming the only state with higher scores than before the pandemic.  DeKalb County, a model for this success, implemented a hands-on, engaging approach to math instruction, using manipulatives and focusing on math fluency.  This improvement is attributed to a combination of factors, including early return to in-person learning and a district-wide focus on teacher training, data-driven instruction, and collaborative learning.</p>
