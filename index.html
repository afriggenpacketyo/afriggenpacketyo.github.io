          <h2>Samsung Gains US Market Share on Apple as Foldable Phones Prove Popular</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market has increased, narrowing the gap with industry leader Apple. This shift is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer new form factors compared to the traditional iPhone design. While tariffs and a wider range of price points also contribute to Samsung's gains, analysts suggest Apple may respond with its own foldable device in the coming years to reclaim momentum and explore higher price points. The renewed competition highlights a significant challenge for Apple in the domestic market for the first time in over a decade. (not investment advice)</p>

While the storm is expected to remain several hundred miles offshore, it poses a significant threat of large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the U.S. East Coast from August 20 to August 27. Tropical storm watches are in effect for several Northern Leeward Islands, which could see up to six inches of rain.

          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three practical steps for developing emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overcome by negative emotions. She advises using a visual aid to understand that learning and growth occur in the often-frustrating space between knowing and not knowing. Kennedy also emphasizes the power of positive self-talk to reframe internal dialogues and build confidence, even if it feels unnatural at first. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone to incrementally build tolerance for discomfort.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has endorsed efforts to redraw the state's congressional maps mid-decade, a move that could significantly favor Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. This follows a recent Florida Supreme Court ruling that approved a previous DeSantis-led redistricting which diminished the influence of Black voters in northern Florida. DeSantis is now eyeing districts in the southern part of the state, potentially targeting seats held by prominent Democrats. Critics and Florida Democrats have condemned the plan as a partisan power grab aimed at rigging elections and silencing voters, while the governor argues it is appropriate.</p>

Merseyside Police are investigating the event, which resulted in a 47-year-old man being ejected from Anfield stadium. Semenyo, who scored two goals in the game, thanked his teammates, Liverpool's players and fans, and Premier League officials for their immediate support. The incident has reignited discussions about the persistence of racism in football, with figures like Virgil van Dijk calling it a "disgrace" and advocating for better anti-racism education.</p>

Trump stated on Truth Social that the goal is to pursue a direct "Peace Agreement" rather than a temporary ceasefire, which he claims often fails. The announcement came after the Alaska summit concluded without a concrete deal, though Trump described it as "very successful." European leaders were briefed on the Putin meeting and expressed support for U.S. involvement in providing security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any potential peace deal.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all operations after failing to reach a contract agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, who walked off the job early Saturday. The strike action during the peak summer travel season is expected to affect approximately 130,000 passengers daily, potentially stranding thousands of travelers globally. The dispute centers on wages and compensation for unpaid work, with the Canadian Union of Public Employees rejecting the airline's proposal for government-directed arbitration. The federal government has urged both sides to negotiate, but the shutdown could take up to a week to fully reverse once a deal is reached.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup survey reveals that only 54% of Americans report drinking alcohol, the lowest percentage since the question was first asked in 1939. This trend is accompanied by a decline in reported drinking frequency and growing public concern over alcohol's health impacts, with a majority now viewing even moderate consumption as unhealthy. The article highlights that this shift is particularly pronounced among underage individuals, where drinking rates have fallen sharply since the 1990s. While reduced alcohol consumption has significant public health benefits, some concern exists that it may be linked to a broader decline in social interaction.</p>

          <p>Health officials are alerting up to 500 recent guests of Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park about potential rabies exposure after bats were found colonizing the attics of eight cabins at Jackson Lake Lodge. Visitors who stayed in the specific cabins between May and late July are being contacted across 38 states and seven countries. Although the few bats tested were negative for rabies, officials are acting with caution because a bat bite or scratch can go unnoticed, especially during sleep. Rabies is nearly always fatal once symptoms appear, so authorities are recommending preventative shots for those who may have had direct contact with a bat.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Engine Capital has taken an approximately 3% stake in life sciences company Avantor and is publicly urging its board to implement significant changes to address chronic underperformance. In a letter, Engine Capital outlined a plan that includes focusing on operational excellence, reducing costs, optimizing the company's portfolio through divestitures, and refreshing the board of directors. The activist firm argues that self-inflicted mistakes, poor capital allocation on overpriced acquisitions, and a lack of leadership accountability have destroyed shareholder value. Engine suggests that if a standalone turnaround is not viable, the board should consider an outright sale of the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Farmers in the U.S. Midwest are grappling with a combination of extreme weather events driven by the climate crisis and economic pressures from the Trump administration's trade policies. After suffering from severe drought last year, many are now dealing with excessive rainfall, which has damaged crops and increased costs. Concurrently, retaliatory tariffs, particularly from China, have caused U.S. soybean exports to plummet to a 20-year low, depressing crop prices. This "one-two punch" of poor harvests and low international demand is creating immense financial and mental strain for agricultural producers, many of whom continue to support the president despite the economic hardship.</p>

During his previous 25-game absence earlier in the season, the Dodgers' run production dropped to last in the majors.

While longer cables present technical challenges, the development represents a key innovation in Ukraine's effort to maintain a technological edge in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its military support to Burkina Faso, filling a strategic vacuum as the nation and its Sahel neighbors distance themselves from traditional Western security partners like the U.S. and France. The shipments, part of a deal with Chinese state-owned arms manufacturer Norinco, include fire support vehicles and rocket launch systems for the Burkinabe military. This move is part of a broader effort by Burkina Faso's junta to modernize its army amid ongoing conflict with jihadist militants. The growing security relationship signals China's expanding influence in the strategically important Sahel region of Africa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Baltimore has achieved a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with its homicide rate falling to the lowest level in five decades. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that moves beyond traditional policing to focus on targeted intervention. The city's approach identifies individuals most at risk of violence and offers them intensive support services, such as housing and job training, coupled with the credible threat of law enforcement action if they refuse help. This "carrot and stick" model, combining social work with focused deterrence, has produced a 95% non-revictimization rate among participants.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people are expected to participate in "Fight the Trump Takeover" protests across 34 states to oppose Republican plans for mid-decade redistricting in states like Texas and Florida. The demonstrations, organized by groups including MoveOn and Indivisible, are a response to what they see as a partisan effort by Donald Trump and his allies to gerrymander districts to "steal Congress." The national day of action comes as Texas Democrats have fled the state to block a vote on a new map and California's governor has proposed a retaliatory redistricting plan.

          <p>According to a recent survey, Americans on average believe that 27 is the ideal age to begin saving for retirement, with a goal of retiring by 58. However, certified financial planners recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest. While starting in one's late 20s is considered doable, it requires more aggressive savings to meet retirement goals. The article notes that many older Americans regret not starting to save sooner, and data shows younger generations like Gen Z and millennials are beginning to save earlier than their predecessors, emphasizing that time is a critical factor.

A well-meaning individual cut the owl's feathers to free it, but this action has severely hampered its rehabilitation, as the bird must now undergo a full molt to regrow its flight feathers, a process that could take over a year. Wildlife caregivers successfully removed the remaining glue and are hoping for a full recovery. The incident serves as a stark warning about the indiscriminate harm caused by glue traps.</p>
