          <p>BTS members Jimin and Jung Kook were discharged from South Korea's military, marking a significant step towards the group's anticipated reunion in 2025, which is expected to greatly impact global music sales and concerts. The pair were greeted by thousands of cheering fans, some of whom traveled from across the globe to see their idols. All seven members of BTS have now either completed or are nearing completion of their mandatory military service, with SUGA set for discharge later this month. Before their hiatus in 2022, BTS generated substantial revenue for South Korea's GDP, and analysts predict their comeback will revitalize the global music scene. The group's 12th anniversary celebrations are already underway in Seoul, signaling their imminent return.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass declared a curfew for downtown L.A. in response to ongoing anti-ICE protests, which have resulted in numerous arrests and instances of looting. The curfew, spanning from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., aims to prevent further vandalism and property damage, particularly after 23 businesses were looted the previous night. Exemptions are in place for residents, workers, credentialed media, and individuals experiencing homelessness. Protests began following immigration raids in the Westlake District, leading to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. President Trump deployed National Guard troops and Marines to protect federal offices, sparking legal challenges from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who accused Trump of exacerbating the situation.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver has been indicted on federal assault charges stemming from a clash outside a Newark ICE detention center. The charges allege that McIver assaulted federal law enforcement officers while protesting conditions at the detention center. The incident occurred during a visit by McIver and other members of Congress, which led to a confrontation between protesters and law enforcement, resulting in the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. McIver denies the charges, calling the indictment a politically motivated attempt to intimidate her. Alina Habba, the interim New Jersey U.S. Attorney, is a close ally of former President Trump.</p>

          <h2>Trump to Restore Original Names of Army Bases with New Namesakes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 22:20:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to restore several Army base names that originally honored Confederate military figures, reversing a renaming process ordered by Congress. However, the bases will be renamed after other service members with similar names, not Confederates. This decision follows earlier changes to Fort Bragg and Fort Benning, which were renamed and then changed back to honor non-Confederate soldiers. Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll will oversee the renaming of the other seven bases, sparking debate over the legacy of Confederate symbols and the role of the military.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second night of serious disorder as petrol bombs, projectiles, and fireworks were thrown at police. Police responded with baton rounds and a water cannon to disperse protesters who set a car on fire and smashed windows of houses. The violence followed an earlier peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault in the town. There have been reports of homes being attacked and signs displayed indicating the nationalities of residents. Politicians have condemned the violence, with some pointing to tensions related to immigration as a contributing factor.</p>
