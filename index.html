        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent US court ruling against Trump's tariffs has sparked questions about its implications for the UK's trade deal with the US; however, the ruling does not affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute the majority of UK exports to the US. While the UK has secured a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, this agreement has yet to be implemented. The ruling blocks Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods like salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, creating uncertainty for British exporters. Businesses face challenges in planning and investing due to the unpredictable nature of international trade standoffs. </p>

          <p>In 1950, the U.S. deported Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist, despite his contributions to American aerospace and weaponry, including work on the Manhattan Project. This decision proved to be a significant misstep as Qian returned to China and spearheaded the development of China's missile and space programs. By the end of the decade, China tested its first missile, and by 1980, it could target California or Moscow. The deportation serves as a cautionary tale amid current concerns about targeting foreign students and researchers, highlighting the potential consequences of xenophobia on global power dynamics.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America," following a court ruling against most of his tariffs. Trump's attack came after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, deemed his tariffs illegal, putting him at odds with some conservative legal figures. Leo, a former Federalist Society leader, advised Trump on Supreme Court picks and played a key role in assembling lists of potential justices. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society due to what he perceived as poor advice on judicial nominations.</p>

          <p>A Chinese economist has cautioned that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in China-US rivalry. Lian Ping, chairman of the China Chief Economists Forum, suggests that the U.S. might gradually expand sanctions against specific Chinese entities to eventually push China out of the US dollar system. While full-blown financial sanctions are deemed unlikely, Lian warns that such measures could undermine the Swift system if China were excluded. Countries with trade and investment ties to China would then shift to using the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), potentially diminishing Swift's importance. (not investment advice)</p>
