          <p>A Russian missile strike on a training exercise in Ukraine's Sumy region resulted in the deaths of six Ukrainian soldiers and injuries to more than ten others. The Russian defense ministry released a video purportedly showing the Iskander missile attack on a training camp, with some reports suggesting up to 70 casualties. The Sumy region has experienced repeated bombardment, prompting Ukraine to launch an offensive into Russia's Kursk region to create a buffer zone. An investigation has been launched following the deadly strike, which targeted a training camp in the far north of the Sumy region, and the commander was suspended.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence rapidly evolves, Hong Kong firms are being encouraged to proactively implement safe AI practices to mitigate security and privacy risks. The use of AI systems often involves collecting and processing personal data, which raises concerns about excessive collection, unauthorized use, and potential data breaches. International declarations and resolutions, including the Bletchley Declaration and the UN's resolution on AI, emphasize the importance of safe, secure, and trustworthy AI systems. China has also stressed the need for both development and security in technological innovation, promoting a people-centered approach to AI governance.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider tax increases prior to the Spring Statement. The memo proposed measures to raise £3-4 billion annually, including increasing corporation tax on banks and extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold. While these proposals were not implemented, they highlight ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions. The Labour party is having discussions about raising funds rather than cutting benefits, as some Labour MPs have expressed unease about cuts to welfare announced at the Spring Statement.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to halt its bonus scheme for senior executives following public criticism and government intervention. The company's "retention scheme," potentially worth up to £1 million per executive, was linked to securing a £3 billion rescue loan. Downing Street deemed it unacceptable for bosses at the troubled firm to reward themselves for failure. The company has faced heavy criticism for sewage discharges and leaks, and is working to reduce its £20 billion debt pile. The board decided to pause the scheme and await guidance from the regulator Ofwat.</p>

          <p>President Trump pressured House Republicans to support a sweeping bill aimed at advancing his domestic agenda, as party leaders negotiated with holdouts to secure their votes. Trump urged Republicans to embrace the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, emphasizing that it was a test of loyalty. Despite initial resistance, Speaker Mike Johnson made progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations, addressing concerns from various factions. The bill encompasses tax cuts, increased military spending, and changes to Medicaid, requiring careful concessions to satisfy different Republican groups. The White House views the bill's passage as crucial for fulfilling Trump's campaign promises.</p>

Last year, all six British singles competitors were eliminated in the first round, marking the third such occurrence this century.

          <p>Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, stated that U.S. export controls on advanced A.I. chips to China have backfired, spurring Chinese companies to accelerate their own development. Regulations intended to limit China's access to cutting-edge chips have instead strengthened domestic companies like Huawei. Huang noted that Nvidia's market share in China has decreased significantly since the implementation of the export controls. He emphasized that Chinese researchers are still conducting A.I. research, and if they lack Nvidia chips, they will use their own. Huang has vowed that Nvidia will continue to sell A.I. chips in China.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, has developed an immunity to multiple types of venom. His experiences have prompted researchers to explore the possibility of creating a universal antivenom. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions of people annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Researchers hope to synthesize a treatment from Friede's blood that could neutralize toxins from various snake bites. Existing antivenoms are typically derived from animals injected with specific venoms to produce antibodies.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, has been met with skepticism from some in the Maga movement, who view him as a continuation of Pope Francis's progressive policies. However, the article argues that the new pope's approach may be more challenging for Catholic Maga figures, particularly those who have used their faith to justify nationalist policies. Pope Leo's choice of name signals a recognition of the challenge posed by right-wing populism, and his focus on issues like inequality, climate change, and migration suggests a critique of the Maga worldview. The article suggests that Pope Leo will challenge the insular nationalism and authoritarian tendencies of the Maga movement.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after making a controversial remark about never having bought rice, Japan's staple grain, amid a national shortage. Eto's comment drew criticism for appearing out of touch with the public's struggles with rising rice prices. The shortage has been attributed to long-standing policies that protect small-time farmers, limiting agricultural land use. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi, a rising star in the Liberal Democratic Party, as the new agriculture minister. The incident has further strained Ishiba's approval ratings ahead of parliamentary elections.</p>

A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years. Such an event could sink coastal land and trigger waves reaching extreme heights, potentially impacting cities like Seattle and Portland.

He said companies would use the "second best" option if they couldn't get chips from the American AI leader. The US curbs on sales of state-of-the-art AI chips to China have forced companies there to buy semiconductors from Chinese designers like Huawei.

They are largely unregulated in the UK and there is currently no law to stop children buying them.
