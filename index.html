          <p>This opinion article, written by a former colleague, strongly endorses Eric Tung's nomination by President Trump to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The author details Tung's distinguished credentials, including clerkships for Justice Neil Gorsuch and the late Justice Antonin Scalia, presenting him as a brilliant constitutionalist. Despite this, his Senate confirmation hearing was reportedly marred by partisan attacks focused on his associations rather than his legal merits. The piece concludes by urging the Senate to confirm Tung, arguing his appointment would be a significant step in reinforcing the rule of law.</p>

          <p>India is undertaking a major upgrade of the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) Road, its primary land access to the contested Galwan Valley region bordering China. The improvements are designed to accommodate heavy military equipment, including tanks and missile carrier trucks. Additionally, a 130km alternative route is nearing completion, intended to reduce reliance on the DSDBO Road and minimize exposure to Chinese surveillance. Analysts state that these infrastructure projects are aimed at facilitating faster troop movement to the border, reflecting ongoing strategic tensions and the need for enhanced military readiness in the region.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Biden Administration Was Complicit in Gaza's Starvation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that while the Trump administration is complicit in the current famine in Gaza, the groundwork for this crisis was laid during Joe Biden's presidency. The author contends that the Biden administration repeatedly ignored stark warnings from the UN and aid groups about Israel's use of starvation as a weapon of war. The article asserts that Biden had the leverage to pressure Israel but instead chose to undermine humanitarian efforts and flout US laws that restrict arms shipments to allies obstructing aid. This failure to act, the author concludes, represents a significant moral stain on Biden's presidential legacy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the potential for the FBI to become involved in the Texas political standoff, where Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting bill. Texas Senator John Cornyn has requested FBI assistance in locating the legislators, raising concerns about the federal agency's neutrality. The author argues that FBI involvement would be legally baseless, as its jurisdiction is limited to federal crimes, and the lawmakers' actions are a civil matter under state law. The piece warns that using the FBI for partisan political ends would be a dangerous transgression of legal norms and a step toward a police state.</p>

          <p>The Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus, once a vibrant hub of Palestinian identity, is now a landscape of ruins after years of Syrian civil war. Volunteer engineers are assessing the catastrophic damage, where about 40% of the camp was destroyed, but rebuilding is slow and basic services remain scarce. Only a fraction of the original population has returned, facing a changed reality where the strong connection to Palestine has been eroded by conflict and displacement. The article explores the residents' resilience and their uneasy relationship with the Syrian government, past and present, as they try to reclaim their homes.</p>

The author agrees with the principle but pivots to Texas, where Republicans have used gerrymandering to solidify their power despite demographic shifts favoring people of color. The piece also highlights how Democrats in Illinois gerrymandered a district, inadvertently removing moderate Republican Adam Kinzinger, who later became a key figure in the Jan. 6 committee. The author concludes that such political maneuvering is a self-defeating danger to democracy, regardless of which party employs it.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is planning to increase its rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base to nearly 100 per year, a significant jump from its current schedule. This proposal faces strong opposition from the California Coastal Commission, which raises concerns about the environmental impact on wildlife and sonic booms affecting residents. The conflict has escalated to a lawsuit filed by SpaceX against the commission, with the company arguing the state agency is overreaching its authority. The commission maintains that most launches are for SpaceX's private Starlink enterprise and should be subject to state regulations, not treated as federal activity.</p>

          <p>Turkey's Gobekli Tepe, a nearly 12,000-year-old archaeological site, has become a focal point for conspiracy theories, amplified by figures like Joe Rogan. These theories suggest a "lost civilization" built the site and that archaeologists are deliberately hiding discoveries. Lead archaeologist Lee Clare refutes these claims, explaining that the slow pace of excavation is necessary to preserve the site for future generations and properly decode its history. Clare emphasizes that rushing the process would destroy invaluable information, stressing that the real story of this ancient ceremonial hub is one of humanity's earliest known efforts at communal storytelling.</p>

          <p>In a significant de-escalation measure, North Korea has started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border with South Korea. This move follows a similar action by Seoul, which recently halted its own broadcasts as part of President Lee Jae Myung's efforts to reopen dialogue with Pyongyang. The loudspeakers have been a recurring feature of inter-Korean tensions, with the South broadcasting K-pop and news, while the North emitted disruptive noises. This reciprocal step is seen as a positive development, reversing the hard-line policies of the previous South Korean administration and fostering a more conciliatory atmosphere.</p>

This potentially fatal condition can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume normal eating too quickly, causing a rapid shift in electrolytes that can lead to heart failure and other critical issues. The article explains that proper treatment requires a slow, managed reintroduction of nutrients, often using specially formulated products like ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs).

Fearing a forced removal, Kangethe has made the difficult decision to leave his wife and three children behind to return to Kenya on his own terms.

In response, the CDC is in discussions with Moderna to increase its supply, though Moderna's shot is only approved for young children with underlying health conditions.

          <p>With the Trump administration's new tariffs now in effect, this article explains the likely economic repercussions for the United States. Economists anticipate that the costs will be shared among overseas exporters, U.S. importers, and ultimately, consumers, leading to higher prices for many goods. While companies have absorbed some costs so far, this is not sustainable, and price hikes are considered inevitable, with one estimate suggesting an average household cost of $2,400 this year. The tariffs are also expected to contribute to rising inflation and a slowdown in the job market, though most forecasters do not predict a full-blown recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents conducted two raids at a Home Depot in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, detaining multiple day laborers. Advocacy groups argue the raids may violate a recent court order that prohibits agents from using racial profiling to target individuals without reasonable suspicion. This action follows a similar controversial raid in Westlake, dubbed "Operation Trojan Horse," where agents used a rental truck to detain workers. Los Angeles city officials have expressed concern and are investigating whether these enforcement actions constitute a violation of the temporary restraining order designed to protect immigrant communities from indiscriminate arrests.</p>

          <p>India's Air Chief Marshal has claimed that the Indian military shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and another military aircraft during border clashes in May. Citing electronic tracking data, he stated that most of the aircraft were downed by India's S-400 surface-to-air missile system, describing one as the "largest ever recorded surface-to-air kill." Pakistan, which has previously denied losing any aircraft in the engagement, has not yet responded to the claim. The statement marks the first official confirmation from India regarding these specific outcomes from the intense military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbors earlier this year.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the unexpected return of Welsh star Louis Rees-Zammit to rugby union after a brief stint pursuing an NFL career with the Jacksonville Jaguars. While injury and coaching changes played a role, experts suggest other factors were at play, including his exceptional but not elite NFL-level athleticism and increasing opportunities back in rugby. Commentators believe his time in the NFL has made him a more mature and skilled player, with a unique mindset that will benefit Welsh rugby. Despite not achieving his American dream, the move is framed not as a failure but as a closed chapter in a promising athletic career.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next Friday to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The announcement came shortly after Trump suggested a peace deal might involve a "swapping of territories," a proposal Ukraine has consistently rejected. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated that his country would not cede land to occupiers and that no meaningful peace decisions can be made without Ukraine's involvement. The high-stakes summit marks a pivotal moment in Trump's efforts to broker an end to the long-running conflict.</p>

For Trump, the meeting is a chance to deliver on his promise of a peace deal, while Putin likely seeks to prevent Ukraine's NATO membership and secure territorial gains. Key negotiating points will include the status of Ukrainian territories currently occupied by Russia and the nature of any potential ceasefire. The biggest point of contention remains Ukraine's sovereignty and future security arrangements, with Kyiv insisting on the restoration of its pre-war borders.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, are preparing for their upcoming World Cup campaign, with a key warm-up match against France. Winger Abby Dow describes the team's journey as climbing "Everest," a metaphor inspired by a talk from a mountaineer who summited the peak. The team is focused on learning from past encounters, particularly their narrow Six Nations win over France and their heartbreaking loss to New Zealand in the last World Cup final. With a 26-match winning streak, the team is focused on peaking at the right time to claim the ultimate prize in women's rugby.</p>
