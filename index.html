          <p>A city councilman in Flint, Michigan, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence and assault, raising questions about a state law that previously cleared his criminal record. Leon El-Alamin, who was elected in November, allegedly choked and beat a woman, with prosecutors noting that bruising and other evidence corroborated her claims. El-Alamin, who previously served time for drug and weapons charges, had his record expunged under Michigan's Clean Slate Act. He has denied the new allegations, stating he is confident the legal process will clear his name.</p>

          <p>A recent report from real estate brokerage Redfin estimates that the wildfires in Los Angeles this past January resulted in $51.7 billion in damages to residential properties within the city limits. The analysis focused on approximately 11,000 homes inspected after the blazes, a majority of which were affected by the 23,000-acre Palisades fire. This fire was particularly destructive in the affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood, where many high-value homes were destroyed. The estimate does not include commercial properties or public infrastructure, suggesting the total economic impact is even higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave is currently impacting more than 200 million people across the eastern half of the U.S., with dangerous temperatures expected to persist through the week. Heat indices, which factor in humidity, are projected to reach between 105 and 115 degrees in the Southeast, and potentially up to 120 degrees in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. Major cities from the Midwest to the Northeast are under extreme heat warnings, creating life-threatening conditions. The sweltering temperatures are compounded by hazy skies in the Northeast due to smoke from ongoing Canadian wildfires.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Her legal team argues that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement made with her late associate, Jeffrey Epstein, should have protected her from being charged. This plea deal, negotiated with federal prosecutors in Florida, stated it would not charge any of Epstein's potential co-conspirators. Maxwell's lawyers contend this agreement should apply to her case in New York, a claim that lower courts and the Justice Department have previously rejected.</p>

The disagreement comes as two Israeli human rights groups, B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, have accused Israel of committing genocide in the region.

          <p>A federal trade court has declined to immediately block the Trump administration's decision to end the 'de minimis' tariff exemption for low-value imports. The ruling came in a case brought by auto parts retailer Detroit Axle, which argued that eliminating the duty-free status for shipments under $800 would be catastrophic for its business model. The court stated that the relief requested is already covered by a broader, ongoing lawsuit challenging Trump's tariffs. The case has been stayed pending the outcome of the larger legal battle, leaving the new tariff rules in place for now. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the county prosecutor, the terrorism charge was filed because the act was intended to instill fear in the entire community.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has alleged that fintech data aggregators like Plaid are overwhelming its systems with an excessive number of data requests, or API calls. According to an internal bank memo, only 13% of the 1.89 billion data requests in June were initiated by customers for actual transactions, with the rest being for other purposes. The bank claims these unnecessary pings are costly to maintain and are linked to higher fraud rates. JPMorgan is now preparing to charge these middlemen for data access, a move that could significantly impact the operating model of many popular financial apps. (not investment advice)</p>

While some governors sought to work with the administration, others maintained a more confrontational or distant stance.

The proposal was developed in coordination with the leaders of France and Germany following the breakdown of U.S.-led talks last week. The plan aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and establish a sustainable path toward a two-state solution. This diplomatic effort comes amid growing domestic pressure on the UK government to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move supported by more than half of Labour's backbench MPs.</p>
