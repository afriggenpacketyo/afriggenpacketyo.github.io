          <p>President Trump is considering a proposal to issue rebate checks to Americans, funded by the substantial revenue generated from his administration's tariffs. He suggested the payments could be targeted toward individuals below a certain income level, though specific details were not provided. This idea is presented as an alternative to using the funds to pay down the national debt, but it would require new legislation from Congress to authorize the Treasury Department to issue such checks.

While the island itself features only briefly in the book, a real-life encounter le Carré had there with a former associate of his con-artist father was a catalyst for the story's central themes. The experience helped the author delve into the complex legacies of betrayal, identity, and the profound influence of a narcissistic parent.</p>
