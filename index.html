          <p>The Federal Reserve stated it would adhere to any court ruling regarding President Trump's attempt to dismiss Board of Governors member Lisa Cook. The Fed emphasized that governors serve fixed terms and can only be removed "for cause," a safeguard ensuring monetary policy independence. Cook's attorney also asserted Trump lacks the authority for such an action, with the dispute likely heading to the Supreme Court. This highlights a significant constitutional clash over the independence of the central bank.</p>

          <p>The Chinese animated fantasy film, 'Ne Zha II', has achieved unprecedented global box office success, earning over $2 billion and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2025 and the highest-grossing non-English language film in history. Despite a less spectacular U.S. English-dubbed release, its original Chinese version performed well, showcasing a unique blend of Chinese aesthetics and universal coming-of-age themes. The article attributes its success to its epic scale, vibrant visuals, and adaptable narrative rooted in 16th-century Chinese mythology, resonating with a broad audience.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency review found that a 13-year-old girl, who stabbed two teachers and a pupil at a Welsh school, had a long-standing fascination with weapons and war, including prior incidents involving knives and a BB gun. The report concluded that earlier "targeted help" could have intervened if information had been fully shared and assessed by agencies. Despite the challenges, no agency could have predicted the "shocking and unexpected events" of the attack. The review recommends improved inter-agency information sharing and resources for children's mental health support.</p>

The company's revenue increased by 24% year-over-year, driven by a 29% rise in its cloud database service, MongoDB Atlas. CEO Dev Ittycheria highlighted the addition of over 5,000 customers this year, many being AI-native companies, as a key factor in their growth. This strategic focus on larger enterprise clients is yielding significant dividends, exceeding market expectations for future earnings and revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>National Democrats are celebrating a significant victory in an Iowa State Senate special election, where Democrat Catelin Drey won in a district previously carried by Donald Trump. This win ends the Republican supermajority in the chamber, impacting their ability to confirm the governor's appointees without Democratic support. While Republicans downplay the results due to low turnout, Democrats view it as a warning sign for the GOP and evidence of increased engagement among their voters heading into next year's elections.</p>

          <h2>UK Energy Price Cap to Increase by £35 Annually for Typical Households in October</h2>

          <p>Millions of UK households will see their annual energy bills rise by £35 starting in October, as energy regulator Ofgem increases the price cap. This 2% increase, slightly higher than anticipated, will bring the typical annual bill to £1,755. The rise is attributed to increased costs for the Warm Home Discount extension and maintaining a stable electricity supply. Campaigners express concern about another winter of high energy bills, urging consumers to explore fixed-price deals and available financial support.</p>

          <p>West Ham United is experiencing a "very bleak" start to the season with three defeats and 11 goals conceded, intensifying pressure on manager Graham Potter. The article highlights systemic issues beyond the manager, including poor defensive performance, a lack of midfield strength, and problematic summer recruitment following Declan Rice's departure. Former players and fans express concerns about the team's direction and ambition, suggesting a season-long relegation battle. The club's struggles are traced back to misaligned strategies and ineffective player acquisitions post-European triumph.</p>

          <p>Experts forecast that gold prices, currently in a holding pattern after an earlier surge, are likely to remain steady or increase in Fall 2025, potentially reaching $4,000 per ounce by year-end under a "bull case" scenario. Key drivers for a price hike include anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which typically boost gold demand, and continued geopolitical uncertainty. Conversely, a strengthening economy, cooling inflation, or a stronger dollar could lead to a price drop. Investors are advised to consider their goals and liquidity when adding gold to portfolios.

          <p>Cracker Barrel reversed its decision to adopt a new logo, returning to its traditional design featuring "Uncle Herschel" after significant public outcry and a direct appeal from President Trump. The rebranding effort, intended to modernize the image, was criticized by customers and branding experts for being "generic" and losing its "brand story." The company's stock initially dipped but rebounded after the reversal, underscoring the strong emotional connection customers have with established brand identities and the risks of alienating a loyal base.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported mixed fiscal second-quarter results, with overall sales climbing 7% thanks to a strong 19% surge from its Hollister brand. However, sales at the namesake Abercrombie brand declined by 5%. The company narrowly beat Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year revenue outlook, but its profit outlook for the current quarter is weaker than anticipated, partly due to increased tariff costs. Abercrombie is pursuing new categories and international expansion to drive future growth, including a new partnership with the NFL. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of D.C. crime data indicates a nearly 50% reduction in violent crime during the three weeks since President Trump deployed federal troops and law enforcement. The deployments were concentrated in higher-crime areas, and other offenses like burglaries and car thefts also decreased. While local police data already showed a downward trend before the deployments, the White House touts over 1,000 arrests and firearm seizures. However, local leaders express concern that the federal presence is scaring residents and businesses, despite some community support for increased safety.</p>

          <p>US mortgage demand saw minimal movement last week, with total application volume falling 0.5%, while interest rates remained largely unchanged. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased slightly to 6.69%. Applications for refinancing decreased, but purchase applications rose by 2%, marking the strongest week for purchase demand in a month. This indicates some buyer activity, potentially due to more inventory and cooling home prices.

          <p>India and Pakistan are in a stalemate over the Indus Waters Treaty, with India having previously threatened to suspend the agreement following an attack in Kashmir.

Experts warn the dispute could escalate, with India potentially developing new water infrastructure to gain leverage. Without political normalization, progress on technical fixes or renegotiating the treaty remains unlikely, raising concerns about regional hydro-politics and stability.</p>
