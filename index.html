          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a key figure in the Jeffrey Epstein sex-trafficking scandal who accused prominent individuals like Prince Andrew of sexual assault, has died by suicide at age 41. Giuffre's family announced her passing, citing her lifelong victimization by sexual abuse and sex trafficking as contributing factors. Giuffre had previously settled a civil lawsuit with Epstein for $500,000 in 2009 and had accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault, which he denied before settling out of court in 2022. Her accusations and legal battles brought significant attention to the Epstein case and the powerful figures involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors stated that Santos defrauded voters and donors by fabricating his background and misusing campaign funds for personal enrichment. Santos, who pleaded guilty to two counts, expressed remorse in court but was criticized by the judge for blaming others. He was expelled from Congress and now faces a lengthy prison term and significant restitution payments for his crimes, which were described as a mockery of the election system.</p>

          <p>In Canada's Alberta, rising separatist sentiments are being fueled by frustration with federal policies and comparisons to the United States, particularly regarding economic and cultural alignment. Some Albertans express a desire for greater autonomy or even joining the US, driven by dissatisfaction with Liberal Party rule and perceived neglect of the region's economic interests. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has publicly warned of a "national unity crisis" if Alberta's demands are not met. While outright separation remains unlikely, the issue poses a significant challenge to Canada's next prime minister.</p>

The Bloc Québécois, led by Yves-François Blanchet, remains a key player in Quebec, and Jagmeet Singh leads the New Democratic Party.

          <p>The Justice Department has rescinded a Biden-era policy that protected journalists in leak investigations, now allowing authorities to use subpoenas and compel testimony from reporters. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that leaking sensitive information undermines the DOJ's ability to uphold the rule of law. The policy allows for subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to obtain information from journalists, subject to DOJ leadership approval and advance notice. This move marks a return to a more aggressive approach to leak investigations.</p>

The accelerated depletion of the current sequence is partly attributed to increased new car registrations, potentially driven by fears of rising car prices due to President Trump’s tariffs. The threat of a trade war sparked by President Trump’s tariffs has played a role in the state’s license plate quandary.</p>
