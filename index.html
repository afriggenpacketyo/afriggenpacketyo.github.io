            <p>U.S. stocks closed sharply lower, wiping away gains from the previous day's rally, as investors reacted to President Trump's tariff decisions. The White House clarified that tariffs on China were higher than initially reported, contributing to the market downturn. Major companies experienced significant share drops, reflecting investor concerns about the impact of trade policies. Despite rallies in Asian and European markets, U.S. stocks faced renewed pressure due to trade tensions.</p>

            <p>China's President Xi Jinping is taking a firm stance on tariffs to demonstrate the country's resilience against economic pressure. This strategy aligns with China's long-term goal of reducing reliance on the United States. Experts believe Xi calculates that China can withstand economic damage and that the U.S. will ultimately concede. China may also leverage its control over critical materials, such as rare earth minerals, as a retaliatory measure.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in Boston has extended a temporary order blocking deportations to third countries, expressing concerns about the safety of migrants sent to countries other than their own. The judge highlighted the lack of opportunity for migrants to raise safety concerns before deportation. The case involves a Guatemalan man deported to Mexico without being able to raise concerns about past abuse. The judge plans to issue a decision on a preliminary injunction next week.</p>

The operation, called Operation Machinize, targeted businesses suspected of money laundering, drug dealing, and illegal immigration. The raids resulted in arrests, seizures of cash and illicit goods, and the identification of potential victims of modern slavery.

A CNBC|SurveyMonkey poll indicates that nearly half of Americans feel more stressed now than a year ago, with inflation, high interest rates, and tariffs contributing to the pressure. Financial hardship is gripping more of the country, with discretionary spending declining as people cut back on non-essential items. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill, which requires documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, may necessitate additional documentation for women whose voter registration name differs from their birth certificate. Opponents argue that the law could also make voting more difficult for military and rural voters by upending both mail-in and online voter registration.</p>

            <p>China plans to reduce the number of Hollywood films playing in the populous country amid escalating trade tensions, reducing access to what was once a vital market for U.S. blockbusters. President Trump on Thursday boosted tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, a day after partially pausing plans to raise tariffs for most other countries. China has invested heavily to grow its own local production industry and has been less enthusiastic about U.S. movies since 2020 and the outbreak of COVID-19, which prompted chilly relations between the two global superpowers.</p>
