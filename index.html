          <p>Five police officers were shot while responding to an incident in North Codorus Township, Pennsylvania, leaving three in grave condition and one critical. The suspected gunman is believed to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Governor Josh Shapiro and other state officials traveled to the area, and a local hospital confirmed it was treating two individuals in serious condition from the event. The incident prompted a temporary shelter-in-place order for a nearby school district as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has become the first U.S. senator to formally state that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza, calling the conclusion "inescapable." Citing casualty figures and statements from Israeli officials as evidence of intent, Sanders argued that the response to the October 7th attack has become a war against the entire Palestinian population. He urged the U.S. to end its complicity by halting military aid to Israel's government and demanding an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <p>California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii have formed the West Coast Health Alliance to release their own joint vaccine guidelines for Covid, flu, and RSV. This move is a direct response to the Trump administration's recent changes at the Department of Health and Human Services, led by vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which have purged scientists and altered federal recommendations. The states' guidance, based on input from medical doctors and major health associations, contrasts with new federal policies that no longer recommend the Covid-19 vaccine for pregnant people and children.</p>

          <p>An upcoming meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is poised to be a major turning point in U.S. vaccine policy under Health Secretary Robert F.

A key point of contention is the potential change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for newborns, a long-standing public health success that some Republican senators, including physician Bill Cassidy, have warned against altering without rigorous scientific justification.</p>

          <p>During President Donald Trump's state visit, the UK government announced a record £150 billion investment package from U.S. companies, aimed at placating critics of the visit and boosting the British economy. The deal, which is expected to create over 7,600 jobs, is led by a £90 billion commitment from private equity firm Blackstone over the next decade. Prime Minister Keir Starmer framed the investment as a testament to Britain's economic strength, though some critics have questioned the substance and long-term benefits of the announced tech deals.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers edge rusher Khalil Mack has avoided a season-ending injury after suffering a dislocated left elbow during a game against the Raiders. While the injury is significant, the four-week recovery timeline is considered a far better outcome than initially feared. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Mack's toughness, and the team will now rely on players like Tuli Tuipulotu and Bud Dupree to step up in his absence during a crucial stretch of divisional games.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has lowered its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 4% to 4.25%, marking the first cut since last December. The decision reflects growing concerns that the nation's labor market is stalling, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that downside employment risks have increased. This move comes amid persistent political pressure from President Trump for more significant rate reductions and signals a policy shift toward prioritizing job growth over inflation fears.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study involving nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is linked to a significant reduction in non-melanoma skin cancers for individuals with a prior history of the disease. The research, published in JAMA Dermatology, found the greatest benefit among those who started taking a 500 mg dose twice daily after their first diagnosis. This provides stronger evidence for a practice already common among dermatologists and suggests the supplement may be a useful tool for secondary prevention.</p>

          <p>A dive team has identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing boat that sank during a storm in January 1929. The vessel went down with 21 crew members aboard, and no survivors were ever found. Using sonar scans and identifying distinctive features like its winch and steam engine, the Atlantic Wreck Salvage team confirmed the ship's identity, hoping the discovery provides a measure of closure for the descendants of those who were lost.</p>
