          <p>Eighty years after World War II, this article examines China's transformation from a key Allied power to a nation increasingly perceived as an adversary. Despite immense sacrifices during the Sino-Japanese War, Beijing now asserts its role as a defender of global norms, challenging Western-led frameworks. The piece highlights how China's historical contributions underpin its current determination to uphold the post-war order, even as its growing influence is framed by some as destabilizing. This analysis delves into the complex interplay of history, diplomacy, and shifting global power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter, with sales growth projected to remain above 50%, indicating sustained demand for AI infrastructure. Despite these overall positive results, the stock experienced a dip in extended trading as data center revenue fell short of estimates for the second consecutive period. The company anticipates between $3 and $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end, with ongoing challenges regarding H20 chip shipments to China impacting potential sales. Nvidia's board also approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's tragic death is being commemorated with a train ride from Chicago to Mississippi, retracing his fateful 1955 journey. Organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center and National Parks Conservation Association, the event includes Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till's brutal lynching at age 14 and his mother's decision for an open-casket funeral in Chicago are widely credited with galvanizing the modern Civil Rights Movement. The commemoration aims to honor his legacy and reflect on the profound impact of his story.</p>

          <p>Amid rising vehicle prices and high interest rates, Edmunds has highlighted five common and costly mistakes car buyers should avoid. The article advises against buying beyond one's financial means, securing loans solely through dealerships, and trading in vehicles with negative equity, which can perpetuate debt. It also recommends leveraging internet sales teams for better deals and considering certified pre-owned options to mitigate rapid depreciation. By avoiding these pitfalls, consumers can make more informed decisions, save thousands, and ensure better long-term financial security in what is often one of their largest purchases after a home.

          <p>Southern California is bracing for potential rainfall, thunderstorms, and dangerous surf as the weakening remnants of Tropical Storm Juliette move north off the coast of Mexico. Forecasters anticipate scattered showers and a slight chance of thunderstorms from Wednesday night into Thursday, particularly from San Diego to the Coachella Valley, with some areas possibly receiving a quarter-inch of rain. While the bulk of the moisture will likely stay south and east of Los Angeles County, increased rip currents are expected Thursday and Friday. Juliette is projected to dissipate by Thursday, but its effects will still be felt across the region.</p>

          <p>U.S. universities are reporting a significant drop in international student enrollment for the fall semester, with institutions like the University at Buffalo seeing a 15% decline. This trend is largely attributed to the Trump Administration's tightened student visa policies, which have caused long delays and increased scrutiny, preventing many accepted students from arriving on time. Experts predict a loss of 150,000 new international students nationwide, potentially costing the U.S. economy $7 billion and over 60,000 jobs. While the administration cites security concerns, universities emphasize the cultural and financial contributions of international students.</p>

          <p>With a September Federal Reserve interest rate cut nearly 90% likely, savers with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts need to act strategically. While lower rates will benefit borrowers, they will reduce future CD earnings. The article advises shopping online for the highest rates, as online banks often offer better returns due to lower overhead costs. Savers should also carefully determine their deposit amount to avoid early withdrawal penalties and consider longer-term CDs to maximize returns and protect principal from economic volatility. Proactive planning is key to optimizing CD investments before rates decline. (not investment advice)</p>

Argent cites media reports detailing omitted names from official lists and a police search warrant indicating probable cause for a decades-long cover-up.
