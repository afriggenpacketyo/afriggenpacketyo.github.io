          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of Rupert Murdoch's career, detailing his journey from inheriting an Australian newspaper to building a global media empire that includes Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and The Sun. Experts analyze his ruthless business tactics, his formula for tabloid success, and his profound influence on the political landscapes of the UK, Australia, and the US. The piece also touches on major controversies like the phone-hacking scandal and examines his symbiotic relationship with political figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Donald Trump, ultimately portraying him as a powerful and transformative figure in modern media.</p>

          <p>According to sources close to the negotiations, Hamas and other Palestinian factions are leaning towards accepting a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Gaza. The 20-point proposal, presented by President Trump, calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid. The plan also outlines a future for Gaza under an interim administration of technocrats, overseen by an international board, with Israel maintaining perimeter security. Several key Muslim-majority nations have already issued a joint statement welcoming the initiative, signaling broad regional support for the peace effort.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities have arrested a seventh suspect in the gruesome murders of two women and a teenage girl, a case that has deeply shocked the nation. The victims' bodies were discovered buried in a yard, and investigators allege the crime, linked to drug gangs, was livestreamed to a private Instagram group with 45 viewers. The suspected mastermind, a 20-year-old Peruvian drug trafficker, is now the subject of an international arrest warrant. This event draws attention to the persistent issue of femicide in Argentina, where data indicates a woman is killed by a man approximately every 36 hours.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is grappling with a surge in hybrid attacks on its critical infrastructure, including cyberattacks, drone incursions, and physical sabotage of its rail system. Officials and security experts express growing concern over these incidents, which are increasingly attributed to state actors like Russia and China, as well as domestic extremist groups. The attacks are seen as a strategy to destabilize society and erode public trust in the government.

          <p>Tensions are rising as several U.S. cities, including Memphis and Portland, prepare for the arrival of National Guard troops, while Chicago braces for a potential deployment. The federal government states the troops are needed to protect ICE agents and facilities, part of a broader effort President Trump says is aimed at addressing violent crime. However, state and local leaders, such as Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, have condemned the move as an overreach of presidential authority and an attack on their communities. These deployments have sparked legal challenges, with critics accusing the administration of unlawfully using military force for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A group of senior Democratic senators is formally requesting that the Department of Justice oppose any efforts by convicted January 6 rioters to have their court-ordered fines and restitution reimbursed by taxpayers. This comes after President Trump pardoned all individuals convicted in the attack, prompting a growing number of them to file for repayments of funds meant to cover the estimated $3 million in damages to the Capitol. While one judge has ordered a reimbursement, citing the legal effect of a pardon, another has denied a similar request. The senators' letter argues that using taxpayer money to compensate the rioters is unthinkable and an attempt to rewrite history.</p>

          <p>A U.S. official has cast doubt on Taiwan's long-held belief in its "silicon shield," the idea that its dominance in the global semiconductor industry guarantees American protection against a potential Chinese invasion. The official, Lutnick, argued that the heavy concentration of chip manufacturing in Taiwan is actually a vulnerability for the United States, not a security guarantee for the island. He emphasized that the current administration's objective is to significantly increase onshore chip manufacturing within the U.S. This perspective signals a potential shift in U.S. policy, suggesting that reliance on Taiwan's chip industry may not be a sufficient deterrent against Beijing's stated ambitions.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece harshly criticizes the proposed Kushner-Blair plan for Gaza, labeling it a "moral atrocity" and a predictable policy catastrophe rooted in neocolonialism. The author, a former State Department official, draws parallels to the failed U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, arguing that imposing an external government on Gaza lacks legitimacy and will be rejected by the Palestinian people. The plan is framed as a real estate development venture disguised as a peace effort, ignoring the fundamental right to self-determination. The article advocates for the alternative Egyptian-led Arab Plan, which centers on a Palestinian-led interim government and reconstruction.</p>

This militarization endangers local fishing communities and undermines regional solidarity through Caricom.

While no major injuries were reported, the incident has sparked questions about crowd control management at the world-famous event.

Organized with the Debt Collective, the campaign draws inspiration from the successful student debt strikes, using collective action to challenge what they describe as predatory practices. At the heart of the campaign is a new online tool that helps tenants document issues and generate formal dispute letters to debt collectors, aiming to make collection efforts more costly and difficult for landlords. The initiative highlights the growing crisis of rental debt, which often traps families in cycles of housing insecurity.</p>

This refusal allegedly led to the woman developing life-threatening sepsis during the second incident.

A key component is the establishment of a transitional governing body for Gaza, led by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, with a vague pathway toward future Palestinian self-determination.

          <p>German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has strongly condemned recent Russian drone incursions over Poland and Estonia as "dangerous" and "reckless" provocations that violate international law. Speaking at the Warsaw Security Forum, he identified Russia as the greatest and most immediate threat to NATO, accusing Moscow of deliberately trying to undermine European security. The comments came as Germany opened a permanent logistics center for its forces in Lithuania, reinforcing its commitment to protecting Baltic allies. Pistorius also reaffirmed Europe's support for Ukraine, announcing the future delivery of two more Patriot air defense systems.</p>

          <p>A frantic rescue operation is underway in East Java, Indonesia, after a school building collapsed while students and workers were inside for prayers. The incident at the Al Khoziny Islamic Boarding School has resulted in three confirmed deaths and 99 hospitalizations, with at least 38 others, mostly teenage boys, still trapped beneath the rubble. Authorities believe the two-story building's foundation was unstable and could not support the ongoing construction of two additional floors. Rescue efforts have been complicated by the unstable structure, which poses a risk of further collapse, forcing specialized teams to proceed with extreme caution.</p>

This strategic shift is driven by the desire for safer returns from options like government bonds or alternative investments such as fine art and real estate.

The drone carries a nearly 200-pound warhead and has a range of over 600 miles. In response, Ukrainian officials state they are also innovating, developing and deploying their own interceptor drones specifically designed to counter these faster, more resilient threats.</p>

The case has heightened concerns across the European Union about China's espionage activities.

          <p>As the U.S. government heads toward a potential shutdown, economists are analyzing the likely impact on an already delicate economy. While a short shutdown typically causes only modest damage, a prolonged one could be more significant this time, mainly by reducing consumer spending due to furloughed federal workers losing pay. Analysts estimate each week of a shutdown could trim about 0.1% from quarterly GDP growth. A key concern is the halt in the release of vital economic data, such as the monthly jobs report, which would make it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to navigate its interest rate policy amid inflation and a cooling labor market.

          <p>Louisiana is pursuing criminal charges against a California-based doctor, issuing a warrant for his arrest for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a woman in the state. This action represents a new front in the legal battles between states with abortion bans and those with shield laws protecting medical providers who offer telehealth services. The case involves a woman who claims her boyfriend ordered the pills without her full consent, highlighting the anti-abortion movement's argument that telehealth access enables coercion. This move escalates the conflict over interstate abortion access, with Louisiana's Attorney General threatening to sue states that protect such doctors from prosecution.</p>

Citing more stringent regulations in countries like Norway and the UK, these experts are calling for a public health approach with universal limits on advertising, spending, and certain types of bets.
