          <p>Donald Trump's recent overhaul of the US National Security Council, involving the dismissal of numerous staff members, particularly from the China team, has sparked worries among diplomatic observers. The observers suggest this move signals an increased reliance on Trump's personal instincts over expert counsel, which could lead to a more unpredictable approach to China. The shake-up also poses potential challenges for Taiwan, which may find it more difficult to communicate with key figures within the White House. The article underscores the potential ramifications of these changes on US foreign policy and international relations. Optimism here is based on the potential for simplified and more decisive foreign policy decision making. The author's tone is cautiously pessimistic, reflecting concern about the stability of international relations.</p>

          <p>A car-ramming incident occurred at the Liverpool F.C. Premier League title celebration parade in England, injuring almost 50 people, including four children, shocking the city and drawing national attention. The police have arrested a 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area, and they are treating the incident as isolated and not terrorism-related, a move seemingly calculated to quell misinformation. Witnesses described a dark-colored vehicle swerving into the crowd, leaving victims trapped beneath the car, leading to scenes of horror and devastation. Officials, including King Charles and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, expressed their shock and support for Liverpool, emphasizing community spirit and offering assistance to those affected.

          <p>A new book reveals friction between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, highlighting distrust between their teams dating back to the 2020 campaign. According to the book, some on Biden's team felt Harris was not putting in enough work and quietly regretted not choosing Gretchen Whitmer as the running mate. Former First Lady Jill Biden also reportedly resented Harris for her criticism of Joe Biden during the 2019 Democratic primary debates. The article suggests that Harris' team believed the Biden White House was setting her up to fail by assigning her politically difficult tasks without adequate support, and the article underscores the challenges and tensions within the Biden-Harris administration.

          <p>Experts suggest three potential scenarios for gold prices in June 2025, including stabilization, a drop, or a rebound, contingent on factors like Federal Reserve policy, geopolitical conditions, and economic data. Gold prices could stabilize if the Fed holds rates steady and no major changes occur in global conditions. Conversely, prices might drop if the Fed raises rates or trade wars are resolved, prompting capital to flow from gold to treasuries. A rebound could occur if economic data weakens, leading the Fed to lower rates and spurring gold demand. (not investment advice) The author's tone is cautiously optimistic, highlighting the potential for both positive and negative influences on gold prices.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on films produced abroad has stirred panic in the globalized US film industry, raising questions about Hollywood's future. While some argue that the tariffs could revitalize domestic film production, others warn of potential negative impacts on international co-productions and the broader content industry. The pandemic, economic downturn, and strikes have already contributed to a slowdown in Hollywood, making co-productions that leverage foreign incentives crucial for many films. The article explores the complex interplay of tariffs, globalization, and industry trends, highlighting differing perspectives on the proposal's potential effects.
