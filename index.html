          <p>Amazon's ad business experienced substantial growth in the first quarter of 2025, increasing by 19% and exceeding analysts' projections. Ad sales reached $13.92 billion, surpassing the expected $13.74 billion. This growth positions Amazon as the third-largest platform in the global digital advertising market, trailing only Alphabet and Meta. While online advertising constitutes a relatively small portion of Amazon's overall sales, its strong performance underscores its increasing significance, although the article notes that economic uncertainty and trade tensions could pose challenges later in the year.</p>

          <p>Airbnb reported first-quarter results that aligned with expectations, but its revenue guidance for the second quarter fell short of analyst predictions, causing shares to decline. The company anticipates revenue between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, while analysts had forecast $3.04 billion. Airbnb attributed the softer outlook to broader economic uncertainties, particularly in the United States, where travel from Canada has seen a decline. Despite strong year-over-year growth in North America, the company noted "softness" in travel patterns, and is also planning platform updates beyond just places to stay.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the nomination of Michael Waltz as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security advisor in addition to his current role.

Rubio's appointment was unexpected, and the State Department spokesperson learned of the change during a press briefing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid President Trump's newly imposed tariffs, retailers are increasingly passing on the added costs to consumers, with some opting to display tariff surcharges on customer receipts. Amazon denied a report that it would list tariff charges on its site, but other retailers, including Shein and Temu, have started reflecting tariff costs in their pricing. Triangl, an online swimwear company, now includes tariff charges at checkout, significantly raising the final price for U.S. customers. This move aims to provide transparency and demonstrate the impact of trade policy on daily spending.</p>

Amazon noted that "tariffs and trade policies" are among the factors that could make its guidance subject to change, a departure from the previous quarter's forward-looking statements.

          <p>A top Trump appointee in the Justice Department ordered an aggressive investigation into student protesters at Columbia University who protested Israel’s conduct in Gaza. This move has sparked concern among career prosecutors and investigators who view it as politically motivated and lacking legal merit. The investigation, conducted by the civil rights division, has faced pushback from a federal magistrate judge who believed some steps might violate the First Amendment. This episode highlights tensions within the department as officials seek to enact President Trump’s agenda, redirecting the civil rights division to crack down on student protesters amid accusations of antisemitism on college campuses.</p>

The sweep follows a Supreme Court ruling upholding a ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors, even without available shelter beds.

          <p>Approximately 1,500 lawyers gathered in Foley Square in Manhattan as part of the National Law Day of Action, protesting President Trump's perceived threats to the American legal system.

          <p>A federal judge in Texas ruled that the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act does not authorize President Trump to deport Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang. This ruling is significant as it is the first sweeping and permanent injunction directly addressing the use of the AEA for deporting alleged gang members. The judge stated that the President's invocation of the AEA exceeded the scope of the statute, as the actions of the gang did not constitute an organized armed attack or a threat by Venezuela.</p>

Experts argue that key vaccines were already tested against placebos and dispute the definition of a new vaccine.
