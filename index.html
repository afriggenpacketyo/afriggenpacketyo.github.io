          <p>Nvidia announced it will soon resume selling its H20 AI chips to China after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that licenses will be granted. This decision reverses a previous halt on sales of the chips, which were specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls. The move is seen as a significant win for the company, which had lobbied against the restrictions, and is expected to serve as a new growth catalyst in the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

The test simulated key mission phases, and the rocket's nine-engine first stage held up under all conditions. This achievement marks a significant step forward for the company as it works to develop a reusable rocket, demonstrating the structural integrity needed for future launches and landings.</p>

It emphasizes that Judaism should be understood as both an ethnicity and a religion to ensure discrimination is handled appropriately.</p>

          <p>According to analysts, the United States is unlikely to obtain public commitments from key allies Japan and Australia regarding their specific actions in a potential conflict with China over Taiwan. Washington's reported efforts to pressure these allies are viewed by some as a way to amplify the "China threat" and encourage increased defense spending and military cooperation. This strategy may also reveal weakening confidence in the U.S.'s ability to manage regional tensions on its own.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico, ending a long-standing trade agreement that had set a minimum sale price. The Commerce Department stated the move is intended to protect American farmers from what it calls unfair trade practices and cheap imports that have undercut the domestic industry. While supporters praise the decision, critics warn it could lead to higher consumer prices for tomatoes and potential retaliation from Mexico. (not investment advice)</p>

The one-week stay provides a brief reprieve for the approximately 11,700 Afghans enrolled in the program while the court considers the case.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to deny an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued her conviction was barred by a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was only intended to apply within its Florida district and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental third-party beneficiary who was not a known subject of the investigation at the time.</p>

          <p>An ongoing purge of federal prosecutors by the Trump administration is now impacting the case against a Florida businessman accused of stealing $100 million from a fund for people with disabilities. The recently fired prosecutor, Michael Gordon, was leading the case against Leo Govoni, raising concerns that his dismissal could jeopardize or delay justice for the victims. Critics allege the firings are political retribution, targeting prosecutors who worked on cases related to the January 6 Capitol riot.</p>

          <p>Following an unusually dry spring and recent heatwaves, more regions in England are expected to be officially declared as in a state of drought. The National Drought Group is meeting to assess the situation, which is caused by prolonged low rainfall depleting reservoirs and drying out soil. A drought declaration triggers water companies' management plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans, as climate change and water usage increase the risk of future shortages.</p>
