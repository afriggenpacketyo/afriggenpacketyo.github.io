          <p>A U.S. airstrike in Yemen's Saada Governorate resulted in the deaths of at least 68 people at a migrant detention center, according to the Yemen Civil Defense. The center housed approximately 100 African migrants, and another 47 people were injured in the strike. The U.S. military's Central Command stated that its campaign since March 15 has struck over 800 targets, degrading the pace and effectiveness of Houthi attacks, which have decreased significantly. The strikes are part of an intensified U.S. campaign against Iran-aligned Houthi forces in response to attacks on commercial and military shipping and strikes on Israel. Optimism score: 5</p>

Dame Rachel de Souza emphasizes the need for a total ban on "nudification" apps, which use AI to make people appear naked, highlighting the apps' disproportionate targeting of girls. The government has announced laws to tackle child sexual abuse images generated by AI, but Dame Rachel argues this doesn't go far enough.

          <p>Investors are concerned that lower oil prices may lead Big Oil companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron to reduce share buybacks and dividends. Global tariff announcements by President Trump have heightened fears of a recession and weaker oil demand, prompting lower oil price outlooks. Analysts suggest that companies may cope with sustained lower prices by cutting spending on projects or tapping into cash stockpiles. Chevron may reduce buybacks if weak oil prices persist, while BP may also be forced to cut buybacks. (not investment advice) Optimism score: 50</p>
