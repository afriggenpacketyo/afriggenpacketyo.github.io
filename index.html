          <p>Epic Games announced that Fortnite is now offline on iOS devices globally after Apple blocked its attempt to reinstate the game on the App Store in the U.S. The move follows a legal battle that began in 2020 when Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission fees by linking to its own website for in-app purchases, violating Apple's policies, which led to Fortnite's removal from the App Store. Epic Games submitted Fortnite to Apple's U.S. App Store last week, a month after a judge ruled the iPhone maker was not allowed to charge a commission on purchases that consumers make outside of an iOS app.</p>

          <p>Two Republican lawmakers are calling for Duke University to end its joint campus program with Wuhan University in China, citing concerns about technology transfers and student manipulation. The congressmen, John Moolenaar and Tim Walberg, argue that the partnership creates a direct pipeline between U.S. innovation and China's military-industrial complex. Duke Kunshan University (DKU), founded in 2013, is a liberal arts-focused joint venture that offers students degrees from both Duke University and DKU, with opportunities to study at Duke's campus in North Carolina. The lawmakers fear that exchange opportunities provide Chinese students access to federally funded U.S. research, which could be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers have gone on strike after failing to reach an agreement on pay raises, leading to a full shutdown of train service and significant inconvenience for over 300,000 daily commuters. The union, representing about 460 engineers, claims that competing agencies offer better compensation and that the cost of living has increased substantially. NJ Transit is advising people to work from home if possible and has implemented a contingency plan involving additional bus service, which can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders.

The luxury group's revenues increased by 7% year-on-year, driven by double-digit growth in the Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. Despite overall growth, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China.

While Biden's inner circle may have obscured the extent of his decline, it was evident to many voters, raising questions about why Democratic insiders failed to recognize the problem.

          <p>Chinese trade envoy Li Chenggang described recent trade talks with the U.S. as "good" following high-level engagement in Switzerland, which led to a temporary easing of trade tensions. However, both sides have maintained a restrained tone, with no confirmation of future meetings between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The tariff reprieve has somewhat improved China's economic outlook, prompting some economists to raise growth forecasts. The negotiations in Geneva were viewed in Beijing as a vindication of China's response to Trump's tariffs.</p>

Silver notes that Trump has lost some voters' confidence in his ability to manage the economy. Anderson describes Trump's governing style as a "nauseating amusement park ride" and questions whether voters will punish him for the "herky-jerky turns."</p>

          <p>President Trump's denunciation of "activist judges" aligns with a historical pattern of U.S. presidents criticizing the judiciary, though his rhetoric may be the most vocal. The term "judicial activism," coined in 1947, describes judges making rulings based on their policy views rather than legal interpretation. Presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan have accused courts of exceeding their constitutional role. While the Constitution enshrines an independent judiciary, presidents have often criticized court decisions they disagree with.</p>
