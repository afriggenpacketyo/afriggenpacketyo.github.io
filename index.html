        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global demand for fresh water increases due to climate change and population growth, desalination technology is becoming more common, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. The primary environmental concern is the disposal of brine, a highly salty byproduct that can harm marine ecosystems. New strategies, such as diluting the brine before release and building plants in locations with strong currents, are being implemented to lessen the impact. Additionally, innovative projects are exploring methods to extract valuable minerals like lithium and magnesium from the brine, turning waste into a resource.</p>

          <p>A game between the San Francisco Giants and Colorado Rockies featured a benches-clearing altercation in the first inning. The incident began after Giants infielder Rafael Devers hit a two-run home run and appeared to admire it, leading to a verbal exchange with Rockies pitcher Kyle Freeland. Players from both dugouts and bullpens entered the field, with some shoving occurring before order was eventually restored by the umpires. The confrontation highlighted the frustration of a difficult season for the last-place Rockies.</p>

          <p>Demonstrators across Israel participated in a "day of disruption" to pressure the government for a ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas. Protesters blocked major roads, set fires near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, and hung banners on the National Library accusing him of abandoning the hostages. The protests reflect growing public anger and opposition to the government's handling of the war, especially as the army mobilizes for a planned offensive in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>Cement production in the United Kingdom has dropped to its lowest level since the 1950s, raising concerns about the government's ability to meet its housing and infrastructure targets. The Mineral Products Association (MPA) warns that high energy costs, regulatory burdens, and competition from cheaper imports are threatening domestic manufacturing. This decline could jeopardize major projects, including the construction of 1.5 million new homes, hospitals, and power plants. The industry is calling for government action to create a level playing field with foreign competitors.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock price increased by 6% in premarket trading after a U.S. District Judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in a major antitrust case. The court found Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search but decided not to force the company to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system. The ruling also permits Google to continue paying companies like Apple to be the default search engine, removing a significant overhang of uncertainty for the tech giant. Analysts view the decision as a major victory for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

Ukrainian air defense forces reported downing or suppressing most of the projectiles, but impacts were recorded in 14 locations, primarily targeting civilian and energy infrastructure in western regions. The barrage prompted NATO to scramble jets in neighboring Poland as a precautionary measure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as a demonstrative act of impunity and called for increased international pressure on Russia's war economy.</p>

          <p>The filler word "um" serves several crucial functions in conversation, despite sometimes being viewed negatively in formal speech. Linguists explain that it acts as a placeholder, signaling to others that a speaker is still thinking and intends to continue, a practice known as "turn holding." It can also be used to soften a speaker's tone or to buy time while formulating the next thought. This type of verbal pause is not unique to English, with similar sounds appearing in languages worldwide, reflecting a universal need to manage the real-time flow of dialogue.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its history, South Korea's men's national football team has selected a foreign-born player who has switched nationalities, signaling a potential cultural shift for the traditionally homogeneous squad. Jens Castrop, a 22-year-old who has lived his entire life in Germany and represented it at youth levels, is now set to make his debut for South Korea. The move has been met with largely positive reactions from fans and media, influenced by the player's and his Korean mother's expressed passion for his heritage. This decision could pave the way for more diaspora talent to represent the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, Google was found to be a monopolist in online search but avoided the government's harshest proposed penalty: a forced breakup of its business. The judge decided not to compel the divestiture of the Chrome browser, viewing it as too disruptive. However, the court did impose remedies intended to foster competition, including requiring Google to share some search data with rivals and prohibiting it from entering into exclusive contracts that make it the sole default search engine on devices and browsers. The outcome is seen as a partial victory for both sides.</p>

          <p>Thailand's government is facing a new wave of political instability as the ruling Pheu Thai party has requested royal approval to dissolve parliament, paving the way for a new election. The move came immediately after the country's largest opposition party threw its support behind a rival candidate for prime minister. This political maneuvering follows last week's dismissal of former Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra by the Constitutional Court. The nation is now bracing for a potential parliamentary vote on a new leader and a likely general election within the next two months.</p>
