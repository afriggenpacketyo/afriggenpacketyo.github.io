          <p>Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse, has died by suicide at the age of 41 in Western Australia. Her family stated that she was a 'fierce warrior' against sexual abuse, but the toll of abuse and sex trafficking became unbearable. Ms. Giuffre had been living in North Perth with her husband and children, although reports suggested the couple had recently split. Police are investigating the death, but early indications suggest it is not suspicious.</p>

Some, like Adam Azim, are backing Benn due to his youth and power, while others highlight Eubank's mental edge. The weight factor, with Benn moving up two weight classes, is a key consideration for many of the predictions. The match is highly anticipated due to the history between the fighters' fathers, who had a famous rivalry in the 1990s.</p>

The author reflects on the contrast between the world’s narratives and the reality of the war, where civilians are targeted. The author's experience underscores the urgent need for a just and lasting peace that respects Ukraine's freedom and will.</p>
