          <p>At least 26 people were killed and 17 wounded in an attack by gunmen targeting tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir, marking the worst civilian assault in years. The attack occurred in Pahalgam, a popular tourist town, and has been attributed to rebels by police, sparking international condemnation. The incident coincided with U.S. Vice President JD Vance's visit to India, prompting condemnation from him and President Trump, who expressed solidarity with India against terrorism. The attack raises concerns about the impact on Kashmir's tourism industry, which has flourished recently due to government promotion efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that the UK government borrowed more than anticipated in the year leading up to March, with borrowing reaching £151.9bn due to increased expenditure on pay and benefits. This figure surpasses the £137.3bn prediction by the UK's official forecaster. The figures come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is scheduled to attend the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank to meet with fellow finance ministers and advocate for a US trade deal. The IMF has downgraded the UK's economic growth forecast from 1.6% to 1.1% for 2025, citing tariff increases and rising borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>Ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine in London have been downgraded, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff no longer participating. The meeting will now involve senior officials from the UK, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the US, while UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy will host a bilateral meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart. The change occurs amid speculation that Russia might be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in return for US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea.

          <p>The Japanese women's judo team is preparing for the world championships in June, seeking to rebound after securing only two medals at the Paris Olympics. The team will feature three world championship debutants and one previous winner, Uta Abe, who is aiming for her fifth world title. The team is under pressure to perform well, as the two medals won in Paris were the fewest by Japanese women since judo was officially added to the Olympic program in 1992, and neither medalist will compete in Budapest. The team will be led by Maki Tsukada, the first female head coach of Japan's women's national team.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing him. Trump added that he would like Powell to be "a little more active" in cutting interest rates. These remarks followed comments from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett about the possibility of dismissing Powell. Trump nominated Powell to lead the central bank in 2017, and the Fed has not cut rates this year after lowering them last year, a stance Trump has criticized. Trump also expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that coral reefs worldwide are experiencing the most intense bleaching event ever recorded, with 84% of them now affected. The current crisis, the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, is more severe than the 2014-17 episode. Coral bleaching occurs when warming waters cause the colorful algae living within corals to produce toxins, leading to their expulsion and increased risk of disease and starvation. Scientists attribute the widespread bleaching to rising ocean temperatures caused by global warming from human activities.</p>

          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has urged European countries to join forces with Beijing to defend the multilateral trading system against what he describes as Washington's weaponization of tariffs. In separate calls with the British and Austrian foreign ministers, Wang accused the United States of violating World Trade Organization rules and harming the interests of other economies. Wang's message echoes President Xi Jinping's call for countries to stand up against protectionism in the face of President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs."

Musk said Tesla is working with Beijing to secure approval to access the critical resources, as China seeks assurances that the magnets will not be used for military purposes. The new restrictions require exporters of medium and heavy rare earths to obtain licenses from China's Ministry of Commerce. The Trump administration is reportedly considering new tariffs on U.S. imports of critical minerals in response.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at over four-year lows in March, with the consumer price index climbing 0.9% year-on-year. Increases in food and private transport costs primarily contributed to the headline inflation. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, slowed to 0.5%. The inflation reading comes as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledged cost-of-living pressures were a concern due to global events and trade wars.</p>

          <p>Gunmen killed at least 26 people and injured a dozen others in a suspected terror attack in the disputed Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, a rare assault on tourists in an area fraught by decades of insurgency and opposition to India’s rule. The devastating massacre targeted sightseers in a popular tourist destination in Pahalgam, in the mountainous Anantnag district, and is the region’s worst assault on civilians in years. A group of tourists were fired on by suspected militants, authorities said. Most of the 26 people killed are understood to be travelers.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of travelers are using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services to finance flights, hotels, and cruises, often with interest-free installments. BNPL companies like Klarna and Affirm report significant growth in travel bookings processed through their platforms. While BNPL can be a valuable tool for responsible vacation financing, it can also lead to debt accumulation and missed payments if not managed carefully.

          <p>Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates a slight increase of 1% in the number of births in the US in 2024, totaling approximately 3.6 million. This modest rise occurs after a prolonged decline that began during the Great Recession around 2008. The report shows record-low birth rates among teenage girls and young women, while birth rates increased for women aged 40-44. The increase appears to be driven by Hispanic and Asian women, whose birth rates rose, while birth rates declined for Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women.</p>
