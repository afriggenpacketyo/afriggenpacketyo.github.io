          <p>Representatives from Iran and the United States are scheduled to resume high-level discussions in Oman to address ongoing disputes concerning Tehran's nuclear program. The US is firm on preventing any uranium enrichment by Iran, insisting on the dismantling of facilities in Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan. Iran, however, maintains that its right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes is non-negotiable, viewing it as a matter of national pride and achievement. These talks occur as President Trump plans to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, underscoring the region's significance in diplomatic efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former workers and public health officials are raising concerns that mass terminations and budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Trump administration are jeopardizing key programs and increasing the risk of missed disease outbreaks. The HHS workforce is being reduced from 82,000 to 62,000, and grant cuts are impacting state public health agencies, exemplified by over 70 layoffs in South Carolina. This reduction in staff and resources compromises disease surveillance, which is crucial for early detection and response to health threats, potentially leading to delayed responses and broader negative impacts on public health.</p>

          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) has released its annual allergy report, identifying the most challenging US cities for seasonal allergy sufferers, with Wichita, Kansas, topping the list for the third consecutive year due to high tree and grass pollen counts. Experts recommend strategies such as starting medications early, washing clothes frequently to remove pollen, and staying indoors during peak pollen times, especially in the mornings and late afternoons. Dr. Purvi Parikh advises seeking medical advice for breathing issues, as they may indicate asthma rather than allergies, and notes that allergy symptoms tend to last longer than those of colds or viruses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall electric vehicle (EV) exports from China to the UK have decreased, there has been a significant surge in plug-in hybrid vehicle exports, increasing by nearly 600% in the first quarter of this year. The UK remains China's second-largest destination for EV exports, benefiting from a standard 10% import tariff, unlike the higher tariffs imposed by the European Union. This trend is driven by cost-conscious consumers seeking affordable alternatives to European marques, as one Londoner highlighted after purchasing an MG electric vehicle.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, attributed to reduced oil prices and production, with net income reaching $26 billion. The company's free cash flow also declined, signaling ongoing financial pressures as global demand slows. Despite these challenges, Aramco's CEO, Amin Nasser, emphasized the company's resilience and disciplined capital planning amidst volatile market conditions. The company also slashed its performance-linked dividend payout for the fourth quarter of 2024 and repeated that $200 million figure for the first-quarter of this year, to be paid in the second quarter.</p>

          <p>This article suggests that mothers should cut themselves some slack and stop striving for perfection, as being flawed is an important part of a mother's job. The author, a psychiatrist, argues that a mother's imperfections help children learn to accept their own flaws and understand that relationships are not one-way. The article also criticizes the tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and encourages mothers to ignore the constant messages that they might not be doing enough.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, is accused of providing his much younger girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming anesthesia drugs, ultimately leading to her death.

Authorities discovered that Ryan had been providing Harris with propofol and ketamine, powerful surgical anesthetics, and texts revealed his control over her drug use.

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remains steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but still below the 7.09% average from a year ago. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as global demand for US Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Recent fluctuations in mortgage rates mirror the volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a benchmark for pricing home loans, and elevated rates combined with rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz's new government in Germany is facing scrutiny due to the appointment of individuals with close ties to the business world to top cabinet positions, raising concerns about potential lobbying influences. Norman Loeckel from Transparency Germany notes that while expertise from the business sector can be beneficial, the lack of effective rules to curtail conflicts of interest is a critical issue. Lobbying regulations in Germany, including the Lobby Register Act, aim to increase transparency, but exceptions and loopholes persist, highlighting the need for stronger safeguards to maintain integrity in political decision-making.</p>

          <p>Amid threats of new sanctions from European leaders, Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to be held in Istanbul, Turkey, without preconditions. This proposal follows a visit by leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland to Ukraine, where they pledged “new and massive” sanctions on Russia’s banking and energy sectors if Putin did not agree to a 30-day ceasefire. While not addressing the ceasefire directly, Putin stated Russia was “prepared for serious negotiations” and suggested a meeting on May 15, but authorities reported an attack by Russian exploding drones in several cities, including Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital shortly after.</p>
