        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that Hong Kong is becoming dangerously reliant on mainland China for healthcare services due to long wait times and high costs in the local system. While convenient, this trend of "unofficial outsourcing" threatens to hollow out Hong Kong's own medical infrastructure, talent development, and innovation. The article calls for strengthening the local system to prevent a long-term decline in its healthcare capacity and market share, ensuring it remains a competitive and self-sufficient medical hub for its residents.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has signed a law making all state residents, regardless of immigration status, eligible for state-funded student financial aid. Supporters, like State Senator Celina Villanueva, championed the bill for promoting equity and removing barriers for undocumented and DACAmented students pursuing higher education. However, the move has drawn sharp criticism from Republican Representative Mary Miller, who called it a "slap in the face" to taxpayers and a misuse of state funds amid existing debt and other priorities for legal residents.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece argues that President Trump's recent diplomatic efforts, including a summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska and subsequent talks in Washington, have primarily bought more time for the Russian leader. The proposed meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is seen as lacking a substantive foundation, as Putin has shown no real intent to cease hostilities. While European leaders successfully steered Trump away from an immediate land-for-peace deal, the outcome is viewed as a delay that allows Russia to continue its military campaign without significant pressure.</p>

          <p>Following a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, President Trump announced he has contacted Russian President Vladimir Putin to arrange a bilateral meeting between the two warring leaders. Trump stated this would be followed by a trilateral meeting including himself, framing it as a significant early step toward peace. While Zelenskyy confirmed readiness for such talks, the Kremlin's official statement was more reserved, mentioning only a discussion to raise the level of representatives in ongoing negotiations between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Following high-stakes meetings in Washington, President Trump announced he is arranging a direct meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to be followed by a trilateral summit. A key point of discussion was security guarantees for Ukraine, with Trump suggesting significant US involvement and Zelenskyy mentioning a potential $90 billion arms deal. European leaders present pushed back against Trump's dismissal of a ceasefire as a prerequisite for talks, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz insisting it is necessary. Zelenskyy also adopted a more conciliatory tone compared to his previous White House visit.</p>

          <p>The opening of Camp East Montana, a new migrant detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, was met with protests from immigration advocates over the weekend. The facility, which can currently hold 1,000 migrants with plans to expand to 5,000, has been criticized for its cost and for limiting detainees' access to legal counsel. Democratic Representative Veronica Escobar questioned the use of funds for mass deportation, while Republican Senator John Cornyn defended the detentions, stating the individuals have no legal right to be in the country. The DHS says the facility will offer full services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to fundamentally realign the league geographically, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues. Speaking at the Little League World Series, Manfred suggested creating Eastern and Western conferences to reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason television slots. This would group teams like the Dodgers and Angels with other West Coast franchises. While the move could face pushback from traditionalists, Manfred believes the benefits of reduced travel and new rivalries are significant.</p>

          <p>An international team of scientists is studying long tubes of mud extracted from the Antarctic seabed to understand centuries of climate history and human impact on the Southern Ocean. By drilling cores from depths up to 500 meters, researchers can analyze layers of sediment that act like a historical record. This "environmental DNA" analysis will help reveal the effects of past events, such as industrial whaling, by measuring changes in marine life and carbon levels over time. The research is part of a global effort to better understand the crucial connection between the ocean and the climate.</p>

          <p>A new court filing indicates that the May arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was carried out at the direction of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. According to a description of body camera footage, a Department of Homeland Security agent told fellow officers, "We are arresting the mayor right now, per the deputy attorney general of the United States." The arrest for trespassing occurred during an attempted oversight visit to an immigration detention center and the charge was later dropped. The revelation adds to concerns that the Justice Department is being used to target political opponents.</p>

          <p>A massive, 113-year-old wooden church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being moved 5 kilometers to a new location to save it from ground subsidence caused by iron ore mining. The entire 672-tonne structure has been hoisted onto giant transporters for the two-day journey to the city's new center. This complex operation is the most symbolic part of a broader project to relocate the city, which is at risk from ground fissures. The local mining company is funding the relocation, which has been a deeply emotional and long-awaited event for the community.</p>

          <p>Meal-kit company HelloFresh has agreed to a $7.5 million settlement in a consumer protection lawsuit led by Santa Clara County, California. The lawsuit alleged that the company misled customers with its automatic renewal subscriptions and made the cancellation process overly difficult. While denying any wrongdoing, HelloFresh will pay $6.38 million in civil penalties, $1 million in restitution to affected California consumers, and $120,000 in investigative costs. The case was brought by California's "Automatic Renewal Task Force," which targets deceptive subscription practices that charge consumers without their clear consent.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to "lead a movement" to eliminate mail-in voting and some voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is being drafted. Trump claimed, without evidence, that mail-in ballots are corrupt and the only way Democrats can win elections. However, legal experts assert that the president lacks the constitutional authority to regulate state-run elections, as Article I, Section 4 grants that power to the states and Congress, not the executive branch. Any such executive order would face immediate and significant legal challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that China's economic problem of "involution," or excessive internal competition leading to stagnation, is rooted in issues of both supply and demand. While authorities have criticized local governments for offering unreasonable incentives that fuel a self-defeating rat race in production, the core issue is a lack of better options. With profit margins near zero, businesses cannot invest in innovation. The article suggests that the phenomenon is a symptom of deeper structural problems, where enterprises and local governments engage in this damaging competition because they have few other paths for growth.

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has enacted an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug often called "designer Xanax." The action makes the substance a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the state, empowering law enforcement to make arrests for its sale or possession. The move came at the request of Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who is also leading a coalition of 21 state attorneys general urging the federal DEA to issue a nationwide emergency ban. The unregulated drug was linked to nearly 50 overdose deaths in Kentucky last year.</p>

The facility has seen a surge in patients and now has a waiting list, reflecting a broader mental health crisis among Afghan women exacerbated by years of conflict and the Taliban's crackdown on their rights.</p>
