        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ukrainian president expressed readiness to meet with Russia's leader in Turkey, emphasizing the need for an immediate truce before negotiations could commence. This comes as President Trump urged Ukraine to accept Russia's proposal for direct talks, diverging from the European leaders' plan for a cease-fire. While France and Germany rebuffed Russia's offer without a cease-fire condition, Zelensky stated he would personally attend negotiations in Turkey, calling for Russia to halt hostilities. The back-and-forth highlights the complex diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict, with differing views on preconditions for meaningful dialogue and ongoing concerns about Russia's commitment to de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Following a four-day military confrontation involving drones, missiles, and intense shelling, India and Pakistan have agreed to a cease-fire, reportedly with the help of U.S. mediation. President Trump praised both sides for their wisdom in halting the aggression and expressed intentions to increase trade and work towards resolving the Kashmir dispute. While Pakistan acknowledged the American role, India avoided mentioning it, emphasizing direct negotiations with Pakistani officials to maintain the perception of independent decision-making. Despite the cease-fire, uncertainty remains regarding its stability, with reports of continued cross-border shelling and cautious civilians urged to remain in relief camps.</p>

          <p>California, despite its status as the world's fourth-largest economy, is confronting a multitude of challenges that threaten its resilience. The state is grappling with potential population decline due to wildfires and immigration policies, a significant budget shortfall in Los Angeles, and a growing homelessness crisis. Compounding these issues is an adversarial relationship with the federal government, limiting potential assistance. While some leaders remain optimistic, pointing to California's history of overcoming adversity, others express concern about the state's future amid budget deficits, climate change impacts, and battles with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-funded charter plane carrying dozens of white South Africans, claiming discrimination and violence in their home country, departed Johannesburg for the United States, where the Trump administration is welcoming them as refugees. This move contrasts with the administration's halt on refugee admissions from other regions, creating an expedited path for Afrikaners. While administration officials plan to celebrate their arrival, aid groups, immigrant rights activists, and the South African government have criticized the initiative, calling it a mockery of the refugee system. The program has deepened tensions between South Africa and the United States, with South African officials viewing it as a politically motivated attempt to discredit the country.</p>

This initiative stands in contrast to the Trump administration's move to ban most other refugees from entering the U.S., and the processing of Afrikaners was unusually fast.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet, described as a "palace in the sky," from Qatar's royal family, prompting accusations of bribery and corruption. While Qatar acknowledged discussions about a "possible transfer" of a plane, it denied a final decision or that it was a gift. The $400 million jet would serve as the new Air Force One until Trump's term ends, then be transferred to his presidential library foundation. The reports have triggered criticism, with Senator Chuck Schumer calling it "premium foreign influence with extra legroom.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed Special Education Simplified Funding Program, part of his 2026 budget, has raised concerns among parents of students with disabilities, who fear reduced federal oversight and potential harm to their children's education. The proposed changes could limit the federal government's role in education and provide states with greater flexibility, which could mean drastically reducing oversight of how states use that money. Parents fear that this could lead to segregated classrooms and limited learning opportunities for students with disabilities, as well as a weakening of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The article highlights the importance of federal oversight in ensuring a fair education for all students with disabilities.</p>
