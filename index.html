          <p>S&P Global Ratings has significantly worsened its 2025 forecast for China's real estate sector, predicting an 8% drop in new home sales instead of the previously anticipated 3% decline. The report attributes the continued slump to fragile homebuyer sentiment, noting that government support measures have been less aggressive than in previous years. This prolonged downturn, now expected to enter its fifth year, could see the market halve in value from its 2021 peak, delaying any hopes for a sustainable recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the UK's decision to lift a ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors, the country's largest investment platform, Hargreaves Lansdowne, has issued a strong warning. The platform stated that it does not consider bitcoin an asset class and believes cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic value, making them unsuitable for helping clients meet financial goals. This cautionary stance contrasts with other financial institutions like Morgan Stanley that are embracing digital assets, highlighting the ongoing division within the financial industry regarding crypto's legitimacy.

          <p>Ferrari's stock suffered its worst trading day in history after the luxury automaker announced updated financial guidance and scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions. The company's new revenue and earnings targets for 2030 fell short of analyst expectations, triggering a more than 15% drop in its share price on both Milan and New York exchanges. Additionally, Ferrari revised its 2030 sales goals to comprise only 20% fully electric vehicles, down from a previous target of 40%, reflecting a broader industry trend of tempering EV sales forecasts.

          <p>The American trucking industry is urging Congress to pass the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act to address a dramatic rise in online cargo theft, which has increased by 1,500% in four years. Industry experts report that sophisticated criminal organizations, often based overseas, are exploiting digital systems to steal identities and redirect valuable freight, costing the industry an estimated $19 million daily. This surge in high-tech heists is straining businesses, causing insurance rates to double and threatening to increase consumer prices as companies grapple with the financial losses and reputational damage.</p>

          <p>Peru's Congress has voted to initiate an impeachment trial against President Dina Boluarte, citing her government's failure to control a severe crime wave gripping the nation. The decision gained momentum after a recent public shooting at a concert in Lima intensified public anger over rising homicides and extortion. This marks the most significant challenge to Boluarte's presidency, which began in December 2022 after her predecessor was also impeached, plunging the country into another period of profound political instability.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has responded to comments from his ex-teammate Steven Gerrard, who described their "golden generation" of players as "egotistical losers." Speaking on his podcast, Rooney disagreed with the characterization, stating that while the team had big personalities, they worked hard and simply "didn't quite manage to get over the line." He suggested that current England squads benefit from a different media environment and closer relationships between players from rival clubs, rather than a superior attitude.</p>

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has threatened to fire air traffic controllers who are calling in sick during the ongoing government shutdown, referring to them as "problem children." With controllers working without pay, an increase in absences has led to significant flight delays and cancellations across the country. Duffy stated that while most controllers are dedicated, the small percentage not reporting for duty are causing massive disruptions and warned that those who do not come to work will not receive backpay and could be terminated.</p>

          <p>Mark Bray, a Rutgers University historian who wrote "Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook," was prevented from boarding a flight to Spain with his family after their reservations were mysteriously cancelled at the gate. Bray had decided to relocate to Europe for a year after receiving numerous death threats, which escalated after he was targeted by right-wing activists and media. While the reason for the cancellation was not immediately clear, Bray suggested the timing was suspicious, occurring shortly after a White House event criticizing anti-fascist activists.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers clinched their spot in the National League Championship Series with a dramatic 2-1 walk-off victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4. The game ended in the bottom of the 11th inning when, with the bases loaded and two outs, Phillies reliever Orion Kerkering fumbled a ground ball and then made a panicked, errant throw to home plate. This shocking error allowed the winning run to score, abruptly ending the Phillies' season and sending the Dodgers to their seventh NLCS in the last ten years.</p>

          <p>Maine's Democratic Governor, Janet Mills, is expected to announce her candidacy for the U.S. Senate next week, according to sources familiar with her plans. She aims to challenge longtime Republican incumbent Susan Collins in what is anticipated to be one of the most closely watched and competitive races of the upcoming midterm elections. Mills, who is term-limited as governor, is considered a top recruit for Democrats, who see the Maine contest as a rare opportunity to flip a Republican-held seat and contest the GOP's Senate majority.</p>

As a staunch conservative and nationalist, her ascent may mark a departure from the centrist pragmatism of her predecessors. Her policy platform suggests a blend of fiscal expansion and protectionism, with increased state investment in defense and technology, potentially reshaping Japan's domestic economy and leading to a more assertive foreign policy focused on national self-interest and security.</p>

          <p>Publisher Electronic Arts is making a significant investment in "Battlefield 6," its latest military shooter, with the goal of challenging the market dominance of its rival, "Call of Duty." Developed by four separate studios, the new game aims to learn from the poorly received "Battlefield 2042" by reintroducing a single-player campaign and incorporating fan feedback from early playtests. Despite the huge financial gamble and recent news of EA's sale to a Saudi-led group, the development team is focused on delivering a high-quality experience to avoid disappointing its community.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills designed to bolster the California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, which faced billions in losses after recent catastrophic wildfires. The new legislation will allow the plan to issue bonds and secure lines of credit to pay for claims, while also increasing legislative oversight by adding lawmakers as nonvoting members to its governing committee. These reforms aim to stabilize the insurance market and enhance transparency as California grapples with the escalating financial risks posed by climate-fueled disasters.</p>
