          <p>President Donald Trump revealed his intention to impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and chips to encourage domestic manufacturing. The policy includes a significant exemption, stating that companies building or committing to build facilities in the United States will not be subject to the tariff. This move represents an escalation of the administration's strategy to reshore critical supply chains and pressure businesses to invest in U.S.-based production.

          <p>Southern Brave secured a dramatic, last-minute victory against Manchester Originals in The Hundred cricket tournament, thanks to a surprising performance from their tail-end batters. Needing 26 runs from the final 11 balls with only two wickets left, Craig Overton and Tymal Mills hit a series of crucial boundaries to turn the game around. Fast bowler Reece Topley, the last man in, hit the winning four with just one ball to spare, capping a remarkable comeback for the 2024 runners-up.</p>

          <p>A power struggle has erupted within America250, the bipartisan commission planning the nation's 250th-anniversary celebration, following attempts by a Trump-appointed director to politicize the events. The director, Ariel Abergel, reportedly asked four Republican-appointed commissioners to resign to make way for new appointees, a move that backfired and led to internal calls for his own removal. This conflict highlights a broader effort by the Trump administration to exert control over the national celebration, which was originally established by Congress as a unifying, non-partisan initiative.</p>

          <p>A study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has uncovered evidence of widespread, organized fraud in scientific publishing, where unethical editors and authors collude to get fake papers into circulation. Researchers identified "paper mills" that mass-produce fabricated articles and found that a small number of editors at some journals handle a disproportionate share of retracted papers. This flood of fraudulent science threatens to pollute the academic record, undermine trust, and make it difficult for legitimate researchers to build upon reliable work.</p>
