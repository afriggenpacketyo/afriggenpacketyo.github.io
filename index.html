          <p>Following the fatal shooting of Jonathan Joss, best known for his voice work on "King of the Hill," San Antonio police are investigating whether his sexual orientation played a role in the crime. Joss's husband reported that the assailant used homophobic slurs before the shooting, prompting police to consider a hate crime angle, though initial assessments found no such evidence. Friends and colleagues, including Chris Pratt and Nick Offerman, have shared tributes to Joss, remembering him as a kind and talented individual. The investigation is ongoing as authorities gather more information regarding the circumstances surrounding Joss's death and the possible motivations of the suspect, Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, who is currently out on bond.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit (BORTAC) from Texas has been deployed to Arkansas to aid in the search for Grant Hardin, who escaped from the North Central Unit state prison.

The BORTAC unit brings specialized tools and experience in high-risk operations, joining helicopters, drones, and K9 units already involved in the search.

          <p>Ketamine, originally synthesized in the 1960s as an anesthetic, is increasingly used for both medical and recreational purposes, raising concerns about potential abuse. Elon Musk's reported ketamine use, detailed in a New York Times report, highlights the drug's therapeutic applications and potential for misuse. Studies indicate a rise in ketamine use among Americans, with some using it recreationally in combination with other drugs. Experts emphasize the importance of medical supervision when using ketamine for depression to mitigate the risks of dependency and adverse health effects, as self-medication can lead to serious physical and mental health consequences.</p>

          <p>The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for the United States to withdraw sanctions imposed on four judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC). These sanctions, announced by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, target judges involved in issuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials and investigating alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan. Türk expressed deep concern over the sanctions, stating that attacks against judges undermine the rule of law. The ICC has also responded, deploring the sanctions as an attempt to undermine its independence and ability to hold individuals accountable for grave international crimes.</p>

Mozenter has reportedly filed a counter-petition in Florida to remove Jane as co-trustee and representative of the estate.

          <p>Jess Walter's novel, “So Far Gone,” tells the story of Rhys Kinnick, a sixty-something man who has spent seven years in self-imposed exile in a remote region of Washington state. Rhys's attempts to improve the home his grandfather once envisioned as a thriving sheep farm have stalled, but he has managed to read more than 900 books during his stay, and to write 2,000-plus pages of a still-unfinished metaphysical volume ambitiously titled “The Atlas of Wisdom. He is forced to confront his past when his grandchildren unexpectedly arrive, prompting him to re-engage with the world and attempt to atone for his absence. The novel explores themes of loss, connection, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Public Health is moving to suspend the licenses of seven Southern California nursing facilities that have been repeatedly cited for contributing to patients' deaths. The facilities received at least two "AA" violations within the last two years, indicating a failure that contributed substantially to the death of a resident. The state investigations found failures and oversights that contributed directly to residents’ deaths. Advocates express concern about the number of patient deaths occurring before state action is taken.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a two-year shutdown, recreational salmon fishing is resuming in California under strict limits to help the population recover. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is limiting ocean fishing under quotas in two windows in the summer and fall. The first is set to open Saturday-Sunday and allow for up to 7,000 salmon to be caught statewide. The fishing industry depends on fall-run Chinook, which migrate upstream to spawn from July through December, and officials hope to see "responsible water management" where state officials prioritize river flows for fish, as well as efforts to restore floodplains and improve hatchery operations.</p>

          <p>Trump's Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, is facing criticism for his desire to remove Harvey Milk's name from a ship, as well as similar actions regarding ships named after other civil rights figures.

The removal of Milk's name, in particular, is seen as a disgrace, given Milk's military service and advocacy for equality.

The article also points out that survivors of long-term sexual violence often develop trauma bonds with their abusers, leading to confusing emotions and behaviors. The author asserts that until women feel safe to speak up, they will continue to be judged for how they survived, not just what they survived.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered a large, well-preserved ancient Native American agricultural site in northern Michigan, revealing extensive farming practices from centuries before European colonization. Using drone-mounted laser technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds, remnants of raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. The scale of the agricultural system is surprising, especially given the region's challenging growing conditions and the presence of wild rice. The discovery highlights the advanced agricultural knowledge and practices of Native American communities and suggests that similar sites may be found in other undisturbed forested areas.</p>
