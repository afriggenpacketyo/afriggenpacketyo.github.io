          <p>An opinion piece challenges the narrative of the 'China shock' causing widespread job losses in the U.S. The article argues that while some manufacturing jobs were indeed affected, cheap Chinese goods made life more affordable for average Americans. It questions the influential research that defends the 'China shock' claim, suggesting the overall impact may have been more beneficial than commonly perceived. This perspective offers a counterargument to the anti-China sentiment prevalent in U.S. politics, particularly among those who feel negatively impacted by trade policies. The article presents an alternative viewpoint on the economic relationship between the two nations, emphasizing potential benefits alongside the acknowledged challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economic growth remained steady at 1.3% in the first quarter of the year, falling short of economists' predictions amidst ongoing global trade tensions. The GDP figure aligns with the previous quarter's growth, signaling a slowdown in economic momentum. This news comes as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) recently reduced interest rates to a two-year low in May, providing some flexibility to ease monetary policy in response to easing inflation. While the RBA anticipates a recovery in consumption and continued public demand to drive GDP growth in 2025, it also acknowledges weaker global demand and domestic uncertainty may result in a more gradual upswing. The central bank will continue to monitor economic conditions and adjust monetary policy as needed to support sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>Despite delivering quarterly beats on key metrics, CrowdStrike experienced a post-earnings sell-off due to mixed guidance, prompting analysts to raise the price target. Revenue increased by 20% year-over-year, with growth observed across all major geographic regions. The company's Falcon Flex subscription model is reportedly accelerating platform adoption, indicating strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. This suggests the post-release decline will likely present a buying opportunity, as cybersecurity remains a critical expense for corporations regardless of economic conditions.

          <h2>Trump Administration Rescinds Guidance Requiring Emergency Abortions</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that used a federal law to require hospitals to perform emergency abortions. The previous guidance stated that under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), doctors must perform abortions in emergency departments, even in states where the procedure is illegal, if it serves as a stabilizing treatment. The HHS and CMS rescinded the guidance, saying it does not reflect the administration's policy. Abortion rights groups have criticized the decision, accusing Trump of breaking a campaign promise.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration eases EPA regulations, Houston could face a price due to increased pollution. The EPA has been slashing and reconsidering rules designed to fight pollution, while also firing staffers who enforce remaining regulations. A study found that pollution from a local power plant contributes to premature deaths. The administration has also granted exemptions from mercury emission regulations to numerous plants, many of which are located near low-income, minority communities, leading to concerns about environmental justice.</p>

          <p>President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which has cleared the House and is now in the Senate, includes measures that could lead to millions losing Medicaid coverage and make it harder to sign up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Critics are calling it Obamacare Repeal Lite, as it includes the most substantial rollback of the ACA since 2017. Republicans claim the bill would merely reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid and other government health programs. The bill would leave nearly 9 million more people without health insurance by 2034, according to the CBO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A controversy has emerged in mountaineering after climbers used xenon gas to rapidly acclimate to high altitudes on Everest, while Nike is preparing a carefully choreographed attempt for a woman to run a sub-four-minute mile, potentially violating pacing rules. These initiatives have sparked debate about fairness and the role of technology in sports. Critics argue that these methods diminish the traditional challenges and create an uneven playing field. The article explores the historical context of such debates, referencing past controversies like the use of oxygen on Everest and pacing in mile runs, and questions the psychological impact of viewing sports as zero-sum games.</p>
