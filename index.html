          <p>The Department of Justice has confirmed it will investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, following a criminal referral from a Trump administration official. The referral alleges misconduct, prompting a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell urging him to fire Cook, although Powell lacks the legal authority to do so. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, only the president can remove board members, a power the Supreme Court has suggested is not arbitrary, adding a layer of legal complexity to the situation.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted in the 1989 murders of their parents, are scheduled for separate parole hearings this week before the California parole board. Sentenced to life in 1996, their sentences were recently reduced, making them eligible for parole. The case, which captivated the nation, continues to be debated, with supporters arguing the brothers have been rehabilitated after claiming self-defense from parental abuse. Prosecutors, however, maintain the murders were financially motivated and oppose their release from prison.</p>

          <p>New Home Office data reveals a complex situation regarding the UK's asylum strategy, showing a record 111,000 applications in the year to June. While the government has increased the speed of processing claims and reduced the overall backlog, the number of asylum seekers in hotels has slightly increased since the current government took power. Despite this, hotel usage remains far below its 2023 peak, and officials express cautious optimism about the long-term effectiveness of their approach to managing the system.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the more than $500 million financial penalty imposed on Donald Trump and other defendants in a civil business fraud case. The court ruled the fine was excessive and violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the ruling upheld the non-monetary sanctions, such as the independent monitor, designed to curb the Trump Organization's business practices. The decision represents a significant legal victory for Trump, who praised the court's "courage" in its ruling.</p>

          <p>The UK's third-largest steelworks, Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), has been placed under government control following a compulsory winding-up order from an insolvency court. The move creates uncertainty for nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield. The company, part of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire, was deemed "hopelessly insolvent" by a judge. The government will cover ongoing costs while seeking a buyer, a process that Liberty Steel, which hopes to repurchase the business, called "irrational."</p>

          <p>Top House Democrats are investigating the $8 billion merger of Paramount and Skydance Media, questioning whether the companies conceded to "illegitimate demands" from President Trump to secure regulatory approval. The probe focuses on a $16 million settlement Paramount paid to end a lawsuit from Trump concerning a "60 Minutes" interview. Lawmakers suggest this payment may constitute an illegal bribe in exchange for the FCC's approval of the merger, and are requesting extensive internal communications from the new company.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has permanently fired 600 employees, finalizing layoffs that were proposed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in April. The American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing the workers, criticized the move, noting its timing shortly after a deadly shooting at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters. The firings are part of a broader plan to lay off 10,000 workers across health agencies to reduce "bureaucratic sprawl" and save an estimated $1.8 billion annually.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Schmid, President of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, has indicated hesitation about cutting interest rates at the upcoming September meeting, pushing back against strong market expectations for a reduction. Speaking from the Jackson Hole symposium, Schmid stated that policymakers need "very definitive data" to justify a move, as he believes there is still work to be done to bring inflation down to the 2% target. His comments add a note of uncertainty to the Federal Reserve's next steps amid political pressure for lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Russell, who has also written for TV shows like "Beef" and "The Bear," explains that he drew on his own experiences as an outsider to craft a story about the universal desire to belong.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have released new details of their trade agreement, confirming that pharmaceuticals and semiconductors will face a 15% tariff, not the much higher rates previously threatened by President Trump. This decision averts potential tariffs of up to 250% on these key sectors. In return for the U.S. lowering tariffs, the EU must first pass legislation to eliminate its own tariffs on U.S. industrial and agricultural goods, after which the U.S. will reduce its 27.5% tariff on European cars to 15%.

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances suggests that public wolf hunting in the Western U.S. is not an effective tool for reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers analyzing data from Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington found that killing wolves had a minimal impact on cattle and sheep depredation. The study concluded that approximately 14 wolves would need to be killed to save a single cow, questioning the core logic behind many states' wolf management plans that promote hunting as a solution to human-wildlife conflict.</p>

          <p>According to sources familiar with Kremlin thinking, Russian President Vladimir Putin has outlined specific terms for a potential peace deal in Ukraine. The proposal reportedly demands that Ukraine cede the entire Donbas region, renounce any ambition to join NATO, and agree to keep Western troops out of the country. This represents a shift from previous demands for four Ukrainian provinces, as Moscow would now halt front lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. These terms were allegedly discussed during Putin's recent meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska.</p>
