          <p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Muscat for the fourth round of indirect talks with the United States regarding Iran's nuclear program, just before President Trump's visit to the Middle East. Araghchi expressed hope for a "decisive" outcome, but emphasized that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and non-negotiable, particularly enrichment achieved through the "blood of our scientists." He also stated that the constant change of American's positions is a problem with the negotiations.

          <p>Wealthy Gulf states have promised President Trump significant investments in the U.S., but falling oil prices pose a challenge to their ability to fulfill these pledges. Lower oil prices, driven by fears of a global recession and increased oil production, impact the national income of these oil-dependent nations. While countries like the UAE and Qatar are better positioned, Saudi Arabia may face pressure on spending, potentially affecting its Vision 2030 plan and regional commitments. Experts suggest these promises should be viewed in the context of past pledges that did not fully materialize.</p>

          <p>Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, numerous attempts to broker a lasting peace in Ukraine have failed, with agreements collapsing within weeks or days. The article outlines a history of broken ceasefires, including the Budapest Memorandum and the Minsk agreements, as well as short-term agreements breached since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. The latest proposal involves negotiations in Istanbul, but skepticism remains due to past failures and ongoing violations.

          <p>Germany is facing increasing polarization, particularly regarding the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). The domestic intelligence service's classification of the AfD as "confirmed right-wing extremist" has sparked debate on how to address the party, with discussions ranging from a potential ban to adapting media coverage. Concerns exist that a ban could further divide society, while others argue that enemies of democracy should not be in a position to destroy it. The article explores the complexities of dealing with the AfD and mitigating social division.</p>

The plan, driven by the Trump administration, would only provide aid to around 60% of Gaza's civilians initially, and key details remain unresolved. Major aid organizations refuse to cooperate, citing contravention of humanitarian principles and concerns that the program is designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as part of a military strategy. The U.S. says it is still in talks with aid professionals to finalize the program.</p>

India's supporters hailed the truce as a victory due to the might of the Indian armed forces, while Pakistanis celebrated what they saw as a successful defense against Indian aggression.
