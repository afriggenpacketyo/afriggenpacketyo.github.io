            <p>President Trump faced pressure from the bond market this week to reconsider his tariff plans, ultimately leading to a policy adjustment. The bond market reacted negatively to the uncertainty caused by the tariffs, with investors demanding higher yields as compensation for the perceived risks. The surge in Treasury yields raised concerns about potential problems for financial markets, prompting Trump to delay additional tariffs. While the stock market initially rallied, questions remain about market stability given the chaotic events and underlying economic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of US Indo-Pacific Command, warned that China and North Korea's support to Russia in the Ukraine war poses a security risk to the Pacific region. China is reportedly providing a significant portion of machine tools and legacy chips to Russia, aiding in the rebuilding of Moscow's war machine. In return, China may be gaining access to technologies that enhance its submarine capabilities. The admiral also addressed concerns about China's advancements in the region, including threats to Taiwan, and emphasized the importance of maintaining the US military presence in South Korea.</p>

The company has been increasing iPhone production in India, which faces lower levies compared to China, where most iPhones for the U.S. market are manufactured. Despite a temporary pause in tariffs on India, a 125% tariff on China remains in effect, potentially leading to significant price increases for consumers. Analysts predict that an iPhone 16 Pro Max assembled in China could see a 67% price hike due to the tariffs.</p>

            <h2>Economists Predict 'Ugly' Inflation Impact from Tariffs by Summer</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Economists predict that President Trump's tariff agenda and the resulting trade war will lead to higher consumer prices by the summer. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, are expected to be passed on to consumers, reducing their purchasing power. While current inflation data doesn't yet reflect the full impact of tariffs, experts anticipate a noticeable rise in prices by May or June, particularly for food and physical goods. Capital Economics expects the consumer price index to peak around 4% in 2025, significantly above the Federal Reserve's target.</p>

            <p>A massive short squeeze, triggered by President Trump's announcement of a tariff pause, propelled the stock market to historic gains on Wednesday. Hedge funds, who had placed record short bets against U.S. stocks, were forced to rapidly buy back borrowed stocks to limit losses as the market surged. This artificial buying pressure contributed to the S&P 500's third-biggest gain since World War II. The session saw a record 30 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, highlighting the intensity of the short covering.</p>

            <p>This article explores the impact of photography on Abraham Lincoln's public image and his decision to grow a beard. It argues that the rise of photography in the 19th century created a new awareness of the self and the face, influencing how people presented themselves. Lincoln's decision to grow a beard was partly driven by the desire to improve his appearance in photographs, which were becoming increasingly important in politics. The article also discusses how photography shaped perceptions of Lincoln during the Civil War.</p>

However, economists warn that tariffs, which are taxes on imports, will add costs for businesses that will ultimately be passed on to consumers. While gasoline prices declined, grocery prices, particularly for eggs, remain a concern due to the impact of avian flu.</p>

Trump suspended many of his new tariffs on Wednesday, but he left in place a 10% tax on nearly everything the U.S. imports from other countries. Goods from China face a much higher tariff of 145%, which could lead to significantly higher prices for clothing, toys and other goods.</p>

Roughly half of Constellation's beer sales come from Hispanic consumers.
