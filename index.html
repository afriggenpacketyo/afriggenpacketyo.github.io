          <p>Kevin Hassett, the Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, has emphasized that the central bank's monetary policy must remain completely independent of political influence, including from the President. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Hassett warned that historical examples show that political control over central banks often leads to high inflation and economic hardship for consumers. His comments come amid ongoing scrutiny of the White House's pressure on the current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, to lower interest rates. Hassett affirmed that maintaining central bank independence is a widely held bipartisan principle essential for long-term economic stewardship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 15:22:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive new study published in eClinicalMedicine has identified a significant link between the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and a higher risk of death from any cause. Researchers analyzed the diets of nearly 187,000 adults in the U.K. over 11 years, finding that certain additives, including artificial flavors, colorings, and sweeteners, were particularly associated with increased mortality. The risk was observed to rise steadily as UPFs constituted a larger percentage of an individual's total food intake. While the research is observational and cannot prove causation, it highlights a strong correlation that underscores growing concerns about the health impacts of modern diets.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka secured her fourth Grand Slam title by defending her US Open championship, a victory that demonstrates significant personal and professional growth. After a difficult loss in the French Open final, Sabalenka reflected on the need to better control her emotions under pressure, a lesson she applied successfully in her win against Amanda Anisimova. This triumph continues an impressive streak of consistency, with Sabalenka reaching at least the semi-final in 11 of her last 12 Grand Slam appearances. At 27, she is in her physical prime, and her newfound mental fortitude suggests more major victories are likely as she continues her career.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump attended the U.S. Open men's final, marking his first appearance at the tournament in a decade and causing a 30-minute delay due to heightened security measures. His arrival at Arthur Ashe Stadium was met with a combination of cheers and boos from the crowd, and broadcasters were reportedly asked by organizers to avoid showing crowd reactions. Trump, who was a guest of Rolex, watched the match alongside family and political associates. The event underscored his polarizing public image, particularly in his native New York, where protesters gathered outside the venue while some inside the stadium booed when his face appeared on the jumbotron.</p>

          <p>The reunited British rock band Oasis performed a sold-out show at the Rose Bowl, delivering a powerful performance that centered on the collective, emotional experience of the audience. The concert, part of the band's first tour in over 15 years, has been noted for the intense, cathartic reactions it elicits from fans, who sing along passionately to classic hits. This article's review highlights that the show's success lies as much with the crowd's participation as with the band's musical prowess, creating a shared ritual of connection. Brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, despite their famously contentious history, presented a united front, culminating in a performance that felt both nostalgic and vital.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest aerial attack of the war, firing over 800 drones and missiles across Ukraine, with one strike damaging the main government cabinet building in Kyiv for the first time. The barrage killed at least four people nationwide, including a baby, and caused widespread damage in several cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the strikes as a deliberate crime intended to prolong the war, urging global partners to provide more air defense systems. The attack on a central government building, previously thought to be heavily defended, marks a significant escalation and symbolic blow, challenging the sense of security in the capital's core.</p>

          <p>In an interview on "Face the Nation," Republican Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas defended the controversial policies of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stating that Kennedy is acting as a necessary "disrupter" to an untrustworthy CDC.

He expressed specific doubts about the necessity of the Hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. Despite criticism from fellow Republican doctors, Marshall maintained that these changes are about restoring transparency and trust in public health institutions.</p>

Following a recent cabinet reshuffle that saw key proponents of the bill moved from their positions, unions like Unison fear a loss of commitment to its full implementation. They argue that any pullback would be a "huge mistake" and have pledged to campaign fiercely to ensure the landmark workers' rights reforms are passed without being weakened.

          <p>The UK's Defence Secretary, John Healey, has stated that the government is considering an expansion of its use of military sites to accommodate asylum seekers. This initiative is part of Labour's broader strategy to move people out of costly hotels, which have become a source of public and political contention. Officials are reportedly working on proposals to be announced soon, which may also include other types of "non-military" locations. The move comes as the government faces the ongoing challenge of small boat crossings in the English Channel, with over 30,000 arrivals recorded so far this year.</p>

          <p>Investors are bracing for a pivotal week, with two key inflation reports—the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI)—set to provide crucial data ahead of the Federal Reserve's next meeting. Following a soft jobs report, markets are increasingly anticipating an interest rate cut, and this week's inflation figures will heavily influence that decision. Additionally, the technology sector will be closely watching Apple's annual hardware event on Tuesday, where the company is expected to unveil its new iPhone 17 lineup. Any announcements regarding pricing or new features could significantly impact the tech giant's stock and the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has sharply criticized Vice President JD Vance for his remarks supporting a recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers on a Venezuelan boat. Vance had called the action the "highest and best use of our military," a sentiment Paul labeled as "despicable and thoughtless." Paul, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, condemned the idea of glorifying extrajudicial killings without a trial, invoking the novel "To Kill a Mockingbird" to emphasize the importance of due process. The public disagreement highlights a rift within the Republican party over the administration's increasingly aggressive military posture against drug cartels.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza, but the race was marked by a significant team orders controversy at McLaren. Lando Norris, who had been running in second place for most of the race, fell behind his teammate Oscar Piastri due to a slow pit stop. The team then controversially instructed Piastri, the current championship leader, to relinquish the position and allow Norris to pass, a decision Piastri complied with despite expressing disagreement. The result cuts Piastri's championship lead over Norris to 31 points and has sparked debate about fairness in intra-team racing.</p>

          <p>The advancement of artificial intelligence is raising concerns that it could dismantle the traditional concept of a career ladder by eliminating many entry-level positions. As AI automates routine tasks, the first rung of professional life for many new graduates is disappearing, making it harder to gain institutional knowledge and advance within a company. Data from venture capital firm SignalFire shows a 50% decline in new role starts for recent graduates at major tech firms since 2019. While some experts believe this will force an evolution toward a flatter organizational structure, others worry about the long-term impact on career development and upward mobility for the next generation.</p>

The material, known as AquaFung, is lightweight and buoyant, similar to styrofoam, but without the harmful environmental footprint.
