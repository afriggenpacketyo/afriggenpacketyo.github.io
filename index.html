          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 07:44:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK rail policy. The initial nationalized service departed from Woking to Surbiton on schedule, though the journey to London Waterloo was via a rail replacement bus due to engineering work. While the government hails this as a "new dawn for rail," they refrained from promising fare reductions, focusing instead on service improvements and infrastructure investment. Concerns have been raised by unions regarding outsourcing of staffing for security and cleaning, while the Conservatives emphasize the need for Labour to fulfill their commitments. </p>

          <p>An attack on a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has brought attention to the fringe movement of anti-natalism and its more extreme offshoot, pro-mortalism. The suspect, Guy Edward Bartkus, who died in the attack, espoused pro-mortalist views, believing that death should happen sooner rather than later. Anti-natalism, the broader philosophy, considers procreation immoral due to the inevitability of suffering. While mainstream philosophers largely dismiss the ideology, it has gained traction online, fueled by anxieties about climate change and artificial intelligence, and the article explores the dark corners of the internet where these ideas take root and sometimes lead to violence. </p>

This announcement puts pressure on Labour, with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticizing both Reform UK and Labour for making promises they cannot deliver.

          <p>An essay explores the perceived decline of young, straight, white male writers in contemporary literary fiction, noting that female writers and writers from diverse backgrounds have increasingly dominated bestseller lists and awards. The article discusses the potential reasons for this shift, including a lack of interest from the literary world in straight male perspectives and a possible decline in interest in fiction among young male writers. It raises questions about what might be lost when the perspectives of these young white men are not represented in literature, particularly regarding the portrayal of toxic masculinity and the challenges faced by young men today. </p>

          <p>The U.S. clean energy boom could go bust if Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' becomes law. The tax bill would basically kill the two tax credits that have done the most to enable the surge of solar power. It terminates the investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities that begin construction 60 days after the legislation is enacted or enter service after 2028. Clean energy projects also cannot claim the tax credits as early as next year if they receive "material assistance" from prohibited foreign entities. </p>

          <p>A proposed tax bill threatens to derail the clean energy boom in the U.S. by terminating key tax credits for solar and wind energy projects. This could lead to significant job losses and increased electricity costs, potentially surrendering the AI race to China. While some Republican senators are pushing back, the bill's current form could severely hinder the growth of renewable energy and undermine efforts to combat climate change. The legislation would also restrict projects that source materials from foreign entities, primarily targeting China. </p>
