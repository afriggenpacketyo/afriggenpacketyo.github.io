            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-15 06:53:51 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Bank of America reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' forecasts, driven by better-than-expected net interest income and trading revenue. The company's earnings per share were 90 cents, exceeding the LSEG estimate of 82 cents, while revenue reached $27.51 billion, also above the expected $26.99 billion. Bank of America's stock had faced recent pressure due to concerns about President Trump's tariff policies potentially causing a recession, but the strong performance in trading and resilience in consumer credit and wealth management contributed to the positive results. This follows similar successes reported by JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs, which also benefited from a surge in equities trading revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Shares of LVMH experienced a significant drop, briefly losing its position as the world's largest luxury firm to Hermès, after reporting an unexpected 3% decline in first-quarter sales, falling short of analyst expectations. The disappointing results impacted the broader luxury sector, with shares of Kering, Burberry, and Richemont also declining. LVMH's wines and spirits division saw the steepest revenue decrease, down 9%, due to weakened demand in the U.S. and China for cognac, while the key fashion and leather goods division slid 5%. Analysts suggest that uncertainty surrounding U.S. and global economic conditions, coupled with trade tensions and tariffs, could continue to pose challenges for LVMH and the luxury sector.

            <p>Global markets experienced a slight rise on Tuesday, mirroring gains in U.S. futures, amidst continued uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies. The previous Friday, the administration announced exemptions for many consumer electronics from reciprocal tariffs, boosting markets on Monday. Trump also indicated a willingness to ease tariffs further, particularly for car companies. European markets also responded positively after the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's 90-day pause on planned tariff countermeasures went into effect, while Asian markets displayed more tempered enthusiasm, with China's markets showing less pronounced gains.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off, with investors moving away from the safe-haven asset amidst market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariffs, which he later suspended. Yields on the 10-year Treasury soared to their highest level since February, raising questions about who was selling and why. Some analysts suggest China may be weaponizing its Treasury holdings by selling them and converting the proceeds into Euros or German bunds, while others point to Japanese life insurers reducing their exposure to U.S. debt. Hedge funds and 'bond vigilantes' are also suspected of contributing to the sell-off. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Amid escalating trade tensions with the US, China has instructed its airlines to cease accepting further deliveries of Boeing jets. This directive, reported by Bloomberg, also includes halting purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from American companies. The order follows China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs of 125% on US goods. Beijing is reportedly considering support measures for airlines leasing Boeing jets that now face higher costs. The restriction poses a significant challenge for Boeing and other manufacturers navigating the trade war between the two economic powers.</p>

            <p>With the April 15 tax deadline looming, taxpayers can file for an extension to gain an additional six months to submit their federal return. Filing an extension allows individuals more time to gather necessary forms, address complex tax situations, and avoid penalties. However, it's crucial to remember that an extension only grants extra time to file, not to pay any owed taxes; payments must still be made by the original deadline to avoid penalties and interest. The IRS provides various methods for requesting an extension, including online payment systems, IRS Free File, and Form 4868.</p>

However, borrowers still face mortgage rates well over 5% on average, while those with larger deposits typically secure lower rates. Securing a mortgage is only part of the challenge, as Zoopla data indicates homes in England and Wales spend an average of 36 days on the market before a sale is agreed, highlighting the need for quick action in a competitive market.</p>

            <p>President Trump's plans to expand infrastructure for artificial intelligence in the US could face years of delays due to proposed legislation in Texas that would impose regulatory hurdles on data centers. The Texas bill, aimed at protecting the state's power grid, introduces new regulatory measures, including a six-month review process and additional fees, which could increase construction costs and discourage tech companies from building data centers in the state. This could directly hamper Trump's AI initiative, as Texas is seen as a key location for these projects.</p>

Moderates, in turn, must recognize the importance of issues like climate change to progressives.
