          <p>AVZ Minerals has temporarily halted its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo following encouragement from the U.S. government, which seeks to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project. The U.S. is supporting KoBold Metals, backed by tech billionaires like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, in an effort to acquire AVZâ€™s stake in Manono, with a pledge of $1 billion for development. This move aims to counter China's Zijin Mining, which gained control over the northern section of the project after Congo revoked AVZâ€™s rights in 2023. Washington's intervention highlights its increasing efforts to secure critical minerals in Congo, directly challenging Chinaâ€™s dominance in the region crucial for the global green energy transition.</p>

          <p>Dana Chandler was found guilty in her third trial for the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness, after decades of maintaining her innocence. The case involved circumstantial evidence, including Chandler's history of stalking Sisco, her changing alibis, and recorded conversations with her daughter, Hailey Seel, where she admitted to having violent thoughts about Sisco. The first trial resulted in a conviction that was later overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct, and the second trial ended in a hung jury. This "48 Hours" episode delves into the complex investigation, the emotional toll on the families, and the legal battles that spanned over two decades, concluding with Chandler's sentencing scheduled for June 3, 2025.</p>

          <p>China's box office is experiencing a subdued Dragon Boat Festival, reflecting broader challenges in stimulating domestic consumption. While the Hollywood film *Mission: Impossible â€“ The Final Reckoning* topped ticket presales, overall revenue for the first day of the holiday was lower than that of the previous public holiday. This comes amid a backdrop of declining box office revenue in China, which fell significantly last year. Despite these challenges, some observers remain optimistic about the long-term resilience of China's film market, citing improvements in domestic productions.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The incident occurred early Friday morning, causing authorities to close the road and advise the public to avoid the area.

          <p>California's film and television industry is facing increasing challenges, with production declining significantly due to factors such as the 2023 strikes and competition from other states and countries offering more generous tax incentives. The number of television shoot days in Los Angeles has decreased sharply since 2021, leading to job losses and economic strain. Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to increase the state's film and TV tax credits to help retain productions, but some industry experts question whether it will be enough to offset the high cost of working in California. Many in Hollywood are now seeking alternative employment as the industry struggles to recover.</p>

While spending increased sharply in 2024, it is unlikely to continue at the same rate, leading to speculation that cuts will be necessary.
