          <p>Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, plans to invest $50 billion in the United States over the next five years, creating over 12,000 jobs. This investment aims to establish new R&D sites, expand manufacturing facilities in multiple states, and build a new manufacturing center for next-generation weight loss medicines. The move comes amid concerns about potential tariffs on pharma goods, with Roche aiming to increase medicine exports from the U.S. once the new facilities are complete. The investment reflects a broader trend of pharmaceutical companies strengthening their U.S. presence in response to possible trade measures.</p>

          <p>A new ceasefire plan has been proposed by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to end the war in Gaza, envisioning a five- to seven-year truce, the release of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a complete Israeli withdrawal. This proposal follows the collapse of a previous ceasefire and comes as Israeli air strikes continue across Gaza, resulting in numerous Palestinian casualties. Hamas has signaled a willingness to hand over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed-upon Palestinian entity, though Netanyahu has rejected any role for the Palestinian Authority. The mediation is considered serious, with Hamas demonstrating "unprecedented flexibility," but the success of the talks remains uncertain amidst ongoing conflict and differing demands from both sides.</p>

          <p>President Trump is simultaneously battling numerous institutions and individuals, including universities, law firms, the media, the Federal Reserve, and even members of his own party. He is also revisiting past grievances with former aides and foreign leaders.

The president's actions have sparked controversy and legal challenges, but he maintains a high level of access to the press, despite often criticizing their coverage.</p>

          <p>The military regime in Burkina Faso announced it thwarted a coup attempt allegedly planned by individuals in Ivory Coast, accusing them of aiming to create chaos. Interim President Ibrahim Traore, who himself took power in a 2022 coup, has accused Ivory Coast of harboring his opponents. The government claims the plot involved an assault on the presidency by soldiers recruited by the nation's enemies, and several officers have been questioned in connection with the alleged plan. Since taking power, the junta has cracked down on dissent, leading to arrests and accusations of undermining republican institutions.</p>

          <p>The United States Commerce Department is set to impose tariffs as high as 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. This action follows an investigation initiated by major solar equipment producers seeking protection for their US operations. The tariffs target companies allegedly benefiting from Chinese subsidies and engaging in unfair dumping practices, with the specific duties varying by company and country of origin. The International Trade Commission is expected to make a final decision on the tariffs in June, impacting the solar energy sector and trade relations with Southeast Asian nations.</p>

Despite team principal Christian Horner's disagreement with the decision, Verstappen's approach did not work this time, potentially leading to a change in his racing style.</p>
