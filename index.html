          <h2>Microsoft Warns of Active Cyberattacks Targeting SharePoint Software</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 20:14:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft has issued warnings about active cyberattacks targeting a vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint collaboration software. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency stated the flaw allows unauthenticated access, enabling attackers to execute code and access all SharePoint content. Security researchers at Palo Alto Networks believe thousands of organizations globally are at risk, with attackers already exfiltrating data and establishing backdoors. Microsoft has released patches for affected versions, but the vulnerability is concerning as it can allow hackers to impersonate users even after a server is patched.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal judge to delay his potential release from criminal custody for 30 days to evaluate legal options against likely deportation efforts. Abrego Garcia, who was previously deported in what was acknowledged as an administrative error and then returned to the U.S., faces human smuggling charges. The legal complexities arise as his release from criminal custody in Tennessee would likely lead to immediate detention by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings. A separate civil case in Maryland is also seeking to prevent his deportation.</p>

          <p>Former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that resulted in her death. The judge criticized a Justice Department recommendation for a much lighter sentence, calling it inappropriate and stating that no prison time was not an option. Hankison was convicted of using excessive force by firing shots into Taylor's apartment through a covered window and door, though none of his bullets struck her. The case was a major catalyst for the 2020 racial justice protests.</p>

          <p>A two-person non-profit in Connecticut is working to restore the health of the Long Island Sound's overfished oyster beds by returning used oyster shells to the water. The organization, Collective Oyster Recycling and Restoration, collects shells from over 50 local restaurants. These old shells provide the ideal surface for new baby oysters to grow, which in turn helps filter water, prevent erosion, and provide a habitat for hundreds of other species. In just two years, the effort has successfully returned over 700,000 pounds of shells to the sound.</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter and raising the possibility of an unprecedented timekeeping adjustment. This acceleration, caused by factors like changes in the planet's liquid core and atmosphere, could eventually require the removal of a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep it aligned with astronomical time. Such a "negative leap second" has never been implemented and raises concerns for critical computer and telecommunication systems that rely on precise time. Interestingly, climate change-induced ice melt has slightly counteracted this trend by slowing the planet's rotation.</p>

The article highlights the administration's frequent use of executive orders, verbal attacks on judges, and recent Supreme Court victories that have curbed lower courts' ability to issue nationwide injunctions. This strategy has raised concerns among some legal experts and former judges about a fundamental shift in the balance of powers.

In response, Ukraine is expanding its anti-drone units, including a recruitment drive by the Azov Brigade, and developing specialized, faster FPV interceptor drones.

          <h2>Analysis Argues President Trump's Governance is Driven by Pettiness and Vengeance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's second term is characterized by a small-minded pettiness that substitutes for coherent policy. The article suggests that many of the administration's actions, from personnel decisions to foreign policy shifts, are animated by anger and a desire for retribution against perceived enemies. Examples cited include harassing former officials, attempting to fire the Fed chairman for personal reasons, and flip-flopping on Ukraine policy based on whether Vladimir Putin made Trump look weak. This governing style is described as a series of emotional reactions rather than a pursuit of substantive national goals.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is set to expand its capacity to detain immigrants by using military bases in New Jersey and Indiana, following approval from the Pentagon. The plan allows for up to 1,000 people to be held at both Camp Atterbury in Indiana and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. Additionally, the capacity for holding migrants at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, will be increased. This move comes as the administration seeks to detain more people amid its nationwide immigration enforcement operations, with detention numbers already exceeding official bed space.</p>

          <p>An NPR report examines the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, suggesting he may represent a new phase in President Trump's effort to reshape the federal courts. During his first term, Trump relied heavily on the Federalist Society to select judges with a conservative, originalist philosophy. The article posits that the nominations machinery is now restarting with controversial figures like Bove at the forefront. This raises questions about the future direction of the judiciary and whether it will shift from traditional conservative legal theory to one more aligned with the president's political movement.</p>

An expert from the University of Hong Kong notes this disconnect, stating that what households and businesses are actually feeling is a "different world" from the rosy official data.

          <p>The same federal judge who presided over President Trump's dropped lawsuit against Michael Cohen has been assigned to his new $10 billion libel case against Rupert Murdoch and News Corp. The lawsuit concerns a Wall Street Journal article about an alleged letter from Trump to Jeffrey Epstein. In the previous case, Trump voluntarily withdrew his suit after Judge Darrin Gayles scheduled a deposition where Trump would have had to testify under oath. This assignment raises the possibility that Trump will again face a choice between giving a sworn deposition or dropping his high-profile lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who was detained by ICE while reporting on a protest in Georgia, says his month-long detention has left him "emotionally destroyed." Guevara, who founded a Spanish-language news outlet, believes his arrest is direct retaliation for his coverage of ICE activities and is meant to intimidate others. DHS claims he was arrested for obstruction after refusing to comply with police orders. Guevara, who has a work permit and a pathway to citizenship, says the experience has made him reconsider his previously conservative-leaning political views and warns other Latinos against supporting the administration.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's latest tax bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent and introduces new deductions, resulting in $4.5 trillion in lost revenue. This deficit is only partially offset by an estimated $1.1 trillion in savings from major cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, which the CBO projects will leave 10 million more Americans without health insurance by 2034.

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration faced off in a Boston court over the decision to cut more than $2 billion in federal research funding to the university. The administration claims the cuts are a necessary response to antisemitism on campus, while Harvard argues the move is an illegal attempt to control the institution and will harm vital public research. The presiding judge expressed skepticism about the government's reasoning, questioning how cutting medical research funding would combat antisemitism and calling the government's claims "mind-boggling." The case is being closely watched and could ultimately reach the Supreme Court.</p>

This policy change comes as Argentina's President Javier Milei seeks to balance relationships with both the U.S. and China, particularly amid delayed trade negotiations with Washington.

The demonstration comes as players and the league are negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement, with a key sticking point being the revenue-sharing model. Players currently receive about 9.3% of league revenue, a figure they argue is unfair given the WNBA's rapid growth in viewership, merchandise sales, and media deals. They are pushing for a model more similar to the NBA's, where revenue is split roughly 50/50 between players and owners.</p>
