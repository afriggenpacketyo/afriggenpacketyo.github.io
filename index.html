          <p>Law enforcement is actively pursuing the individual responsible for the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, the article reports. Despite receiving over 7,000 tips and conducting nearly 200 interviews, the suspect remains at large, and the FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to their arrest. Investigators have released security footage showing the suspect's movements before and after the shooting, and recovered a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon used. The authorities believe the shooting was a targeted attack and do not believe there is a lingering risk to the public. The event has prompted increased security measures and a heightened sense of concern about political violence. </p>

This breakthrough led to a rally in SK Hynix shares and contributed to positive market sentiment in Asia. Other Asian markets also saw gains, mirroring positive trends from Wall Street, driven by easing inflation and expectations of U.S. rate cuts. Investor sentiment has been boosted by the promise of easier money and the actions of central banks. (not investment advice)</p>

The monsoon rains have caused widespread destruction, resulting in over 900 deaths nationwide since late June. Climate change is considered a major factor exacerbating the floods, alongside a lack of government investment in disaster mitigation. The UN and the US have allocated funds and deployed personnel to support Pakistan's flood response, and authorities have declared a climate emergency in the country. </p>

          <p>A report from the National Audit Office (NAO) reveals that the cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has nearly doubled in five years, yet many children are not receiving adequate care, the article summarizes. Councils are spending significant amounts on each child, but the report deems this spending does not represent value for money, highlighting a dysfunctional market where private care providers are making substantial profits. The Department for Education acknowledged the issues and stated it is implementing reforms to improve children's social care. The report emphasizes the need for better oversight and a more balanced approach to the supply and demand of care home places. </p>
