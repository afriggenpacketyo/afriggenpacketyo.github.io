          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of a major tax and spending bill supported by former President Trump, vowing to support primary challenges against any Republican lawmakers who vote for it. The billionaire argues the legislation, which he called an "abomination," would irresponsibly increase the national debt and has renewed his calls for a new political party. This public opposition has reignited a feud with Trump, who retorted by highlighting Tesla's reliance on government subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British Members of Parliament are scheduled to vote on the government's controversial welfare reform bill, facing a significant rebellion from within the ruling Labour Party despite recent concessions. Dozens of Labour MPs remain opposed to the changes, particularly future adjustments to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). The Conservative opposition plans to vote against the bill, arguing the reforms do not go far enough to control the rising costs of the welfare system, which are projected to reach Â£100 billion by 2030.</p>

The author highlights recent independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on Frantz Fanon that are finally addressing these topics but often struggle for mainstream visibility. The piece argues that while audiences are ready to confront this history, French film institutions have been reluctant to make room for these compelling and overdue narratives.</p>

          <p>An employee of a nonprofit tutoring service has been arrested on suspicion of bringing approximately 170 pills, believed to be Xanax, into the Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Los Angeles County. The arrest follows months of concern over drug use in the county's juvenile facilities, including several non-fatal overdoses at the same location earlier this year. County probation officials stated that such behavior is unacceptable and poses a clear threat to the safety of youth and staff in their institutions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed two significant bills aimed at speeding up housing construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The legislation, which exempts most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews, was pushed through the legislature using a "poison pill" provision in the state budget. While developers praise the move as the most consequential housing reform in decades, some progressive lawmakers and labor groups have raised concerns about the process and the sidestepping of worker wage demands.</p>
