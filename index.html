          <p>The United Kingdom is reportedly on track to become the first nation to finalize a trade agreement with the United States following the announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is investigating the stabbing of a baby seal on an Oregon beach. The seal survived the March attack and was moved to a secluded beach in Washington.

Additionally, a majority believe that the U.S. should take the first step to de-escalate tensions. The survey also suggests that the trade war will diminish the U.S.' global standing more than China's.</p>

The poll reveals tepid approval ratings for Newsom, contrasting with other Democratic governors considered potential presidential contenders. Despite Newsom's insistence that he is not focused on running for president, his actions suggest otherwise.
