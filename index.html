          <p>A new US-brokered peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan includes plans for a transit corridor, dubbed the "Trump Route," that connects Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan through Armenian territory. This development has sparked mixed reactions in Iran, which fears growing US influence in the South Caucasus and a potential blow to its own regional energy and trade connections. While some hardline officials have vowed to block the corridor, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has taken a more moderate stance. The situation highlights Iran's increasing geopolitical isolation and the shifting power dynamics in the region.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index increased by 2.7% year-over-year in July, a slightly cooler rate than the 2.8% economists had anticipated. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.2%, driven largely by shelter costs while energy prices fell. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, increased 3.1% annually, indicating persistent underlying price pressures. The report comes as the Federal Reserve weighs future interest rate decisions, with many economists suggesting that the modest impact of tariffs so far might not deter a potential rate cut in September.

          <p>The ongoing excavation of a mass grave in Chemmani, northern Sri Lanka, has unearthed 140 skeletons and renewed calls from the Tamil community for international involvement in the investigation. The site is linked to disappearances at the end of the country's civil war in 2009, and families of the missing are experiencing renewed trauma and fear. Activists and lawyers express deep distrust in domestic accountability mechanisms, citing a history of intimidation and slow progress. Despite a new government, many believe international oversight is crucial for achieving justice and uncovering the truth about the war's victims.</p>

          <p>After his first 100 days as Germany's Chancellor, Friedrich Merz of the CDU is facing scrutiny for a series of surprise decisions and political turnabouts. Key moves include halting certain weapons supplies to Israel, lifting strict debt rules to fund massive investments, and implementing tougher immigration controls. While active on the foreign policy stage, his chancellorship has been marked by domestic controversy, including a failed attempt to lower electricity prices for all consumers and a major coalition crisis over judicial appointments. These challenges arise as the far-right AfD party gains in the polls.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has recently adopted a more lenient trade policy towards China, extending a tariff pause and softening his rhetoric, a stark contrast to his earlier aggressive stance. This shift is attributed to several factors, including a desire to avoid price hikes for US consumers during the holiday season and China's strategic leverage, particularly its dominance over rare earth minerals vital to US industries. With other geopolitical challenges, such as peace talks with Russia, Trump may be seeking to de-escalate one front. Analysts suggest this strategy buys time for broader negotiations on technology and energy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has launched an anti-dumping investigation into pea starch imported from Canada, a move seen as retaliation for Canadian tariffs on Chinese steel. The probe follows complaints from China's domestic industry, which claims it is being harmed by an influx of low-priced Canadian pea starch. Canada is a major supplier of peas to China, second only to Russia. This action is the latest in a series of trade measures, with Beijing also set to collect anti-dumping deposits on Canadian canola oil and a specific type of synthetic rubber.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the prevalent nostalgia for the 1990s, arguing that by many objective measures, the present day is significantly better. It points to data showing that the 1990s had far higher rates of violent crime and murder in the U.S. compared to today. Globally, extreme poverty was rampant, with nearly 40% of the world's population affected, a figure that has since plummeted. Furthermore, the HIV/AIDS pandemic was at its peak with limited treatment, and social tolerance on issues like same-sex marriage and interracial relationships was considerably lower, highlighting substantial progress in health and social attitudes.</p>

          <p>Journalists, activists, and politicians gathered in Tirana to protest the closure of the private 24-hour news channel, News 24. The broadcaster was forced off the air after police raided its premises, which are located in a former state-owned complex, to enforce a court ruling returning the property to the state. The channel's owner called the eviction, conducted without prior written notice, "a blow to freedom of expression." Opposition leaders and journalism associations have condemned the move as a politically motivated attack on free speech and an unacceptable form of pressure on independent media.</p>

          <p>Convicted fraudster Anna Sorokin, also known as Anna Delvey, is again at the center of a New York controversy, this time involving abandoned rabbits. Three rabbits used in a recent photoshoot with Sorokin were found dumped in a Brooklyn park, sparking accusations of animal cruelty online. Sorokin stated she was "horrified" and "embarrassed" by the incident, clarifying that she was not responsible for the animals' welfare. A person involved in the shoot reportedly apologized in a now-deleted post, admitting to panicking and releasing the rabbits, mistakenly believing it was a safe option for them.</p>

          <p>With rising temperatures, animal welfare charities are reminding pet owners of the dangers of heatstroke in dogs. The RSPCA advises against walking dogs during the hottest parts of the day, recommending a "pavement test": if the ground is too hot for a hand for five seconds, it's too hot for paws. Signs of heatstroke include excessive panting, confusion, and collapse, and require immediate action to cool the animal down. Owners are encouraged to provide ample shade and water, use cooling mats, and never leave a pet in a locked vehicle, conservatory, or shed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce by another 90 days, postponing the threat of escalating tariffs until November 10. The move keeps the US levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%, avoiding a potential spike to triple-digit rates. The White House stated the extension allows more time for negotiations on trade imbalances, market access, and national security issues. While the pause averts immediate economic turmoil, some US business owners express frustration over the prolonged uncertainty, which makes future planning difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

The attack on a tent used by journalists has drawn widespread international condemnation, with groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists stating there is no justification for the killing, as journalists are not active combatants.</p>

          <p>Pharmacies across the UK are experiencing a surge in crime, with a new survey reporting that 95% of pharmacy staff have faced verbal or physical abuse from customers. Shoplifting has also become a major issue, with organized gangs and individuals stealing various items, not just high-value goods. Pharmacists attribute the rise to a lack of police response and feel emboldened criminals face few consequences. In response, many pharmacies are investing in their own security measures, such as CCTV and panic buttons, while calling for more police support to ensure the safety of staff and patients.</p>

The 5-2 decision rejected the NFL's attempt to move the case to arbitration, where the league commissioner could have designated the arbitrator. Gruden is suing the NFL, alleging the league maliciously leaked racist, homophobic, and sexist emails he wrote years ago while working as an analyst, leading to his resignation in 2021. His attorneys praised the decision as a vindication that clears the way for him to seek justice.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that lung cancer is a grossly undercounted and rapidly growing "hidden epidemic" in sub-Saharan Africa. While official statistics suggest low mortality rates outside of South Africa, this is likely due to a lack of diagnostic resources, with many cases being misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. Systemic issues like poor record-keeping, a lack of screening infrastructure, and rising smoking rates targeted by tobacco companies are allowing the disease to grow unchecked. Without better data collection, public health campaigns, and scalable screening solutions, Africa's cancer burden is projected to more than double by 2050.</p>
