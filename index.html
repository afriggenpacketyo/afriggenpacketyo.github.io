            <p>Experts warn that President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, despite some exemptions for technology hardware, will cause irreversible damage to many American businesses. Canceled freight orders and abandoned shipments from China are becoming common, particularly impacting lower-margin goods like furniture, apparel, and toys. Businesses are struggling to cope with sudden policy changes and high tariffs, leading to lost sales and potential product shortages. The situation may result in a significant restructuring of liner services to North America, causing congestion and freight rate spikes. (not investment advice)</p>

The FDA will prioritize human-relevant testing strategies for antibody therapies, while the EPA will reinstate a policy to reduce and eventually eliminate animal testing. Animal rights groups like PETA and the White Coat Waste Project applaud these decisions, while others warn that high-tech replacements for animal testing are not yet sufficient.
