          <h2>Cognac Producers in France Navigate Climate Change and Trade Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cognac producers in France are facing a multitude of challenges including climate change, tariffs, and the loss of the Russian market. Global warming is causing grapes to ripen earlier and become sweeter, impacting the quality of cognac, while tariffs imposed by the US and China have significantly reduced exports. Despite these difficulties, family-run businesses like Earl du Bois Noble winery and Tonnellerie Allary are adapting by diversifying their markets and implementing sustainable practices. The Cognac region owes its success to trade, with famous houses like Hennessy and Martell founded by immigrants, and is now exploring new markets like organic cognac and cocktails to attract younger consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on Ukraine, primarily targeting Kyiv, just before President Trump was expected to speak with President Putin about a potential cease-fire. The drone barrage resulted in casualties and injuries, underscoring the ongoing conflict's intensity. This attack occurred amidst diplomatic efforts, including a meeting between President Zelensky and Vice President Vance in Rome, aimed at finding a path to peace. Despite these efforts, Russia's military actions suggest a continued escalation, potentially undermining any progress towards a resolution, as former American ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget A. Brink, has spoken out against the Trump administration's approach to the war, stating that it puts pressure on the victim rather than the aggressor.</p>

Amentha Hunt, the niece of the deceased, noticed the discrepancy and brought it to the attention of mortuary staff, who initially dismissed her concerns. The family endured a three-hour delay while the mortuary rectified the mix-up, causing emotional distress.

Richard Bartkus stated that his son had changed after a period in Twentynine Palms, and that he had no idea his son held anti-natalist beliefs. The FBI is investigating Bartkus' online posts and writings, which appear to indicate his opposition to having children, and are treating the bombing as a potential act of terrorism.

The company claims to have prevented 1 million kilograms of fabric from going to waste in the past three years and has attracted investments from H&M Group, Tony Fadell, and Amazon's AWS Compute for Climate Fellowship. Smartex uses AWS technology to train its machine learning models to identify flaws in fabric, which can vary significantly. The fashion industry has a significant waste problem, with a truckload of clothes thrown away every second, and Smartex is working to address this issue by improving efficiency and reducing pollution.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose numbers have declined by 90% in the past 30 years. The glitter, which is safe for the animals, is added to their food and then tracked in their droppings, allowing conservationists to monitor their movements and habitat use. This innovative approach aims to help protect the species by identifying key territories and informing environmental adjustments, such as removing invasive conifers and fencing off riverbanks. The team is testing the method on captive-bred water voles before applying it in the wild, hoping to improve the species' chances of survival.</p>

Chan suggests that the U.S. needs to invest in research, innovation, and global economic ties to avoid becoming a diminished nation, and that China's strength across these and other overlapping technologies is creating a virtuous cycle in which advances in multiple interlocking sectors reinforce and elevate one another.</p>

          <h2>NATO Corruption Probe Highlights Risks in Defense Spending Boom</h2>

          <p>A corruption investigation involving staff at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has raised concerns about oversight in the defense sector, particularly during a period of increased military spending. The investigation involves alleged irregularities in contracts for arms and ammunition, with detentions made in Belgium and the Netherlands. As NATO countries increase their defense budgets, Transparency International emphasizes the importance of transparency and oversight to prevent corruption and ensure that public money is used effectively. The probe serves as a reminder of the risks associated with large-scale defense contracts and the need for robust accountability measures.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill has advanced in the House after conservatives initially stalled it due to concerns about insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to some modifications, allowing the bill to move forward, though challenges remain in the Rules Committee and the Senate. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts, increase military spending, and cut Medicaid and clean energy subsidies. The bill still faces opposition from both conservatives and moderates, making its path to passage uncertain.</p>

New tents, warehouses, and renovated fighter jet shelters have been observed, although troop levels remain low for now. Finnish defense officials anticipate a significant increase in Russian forces within five years, prompting NATO to monitor the situation closely. The moves reflect Moscow's perception of a threat from NATO expansion and could transform the region into a potential hotspot, particularly in the Arctic Circle.</p>

The new agreement is described as fair and fiscally responsible, and riders are asked to work from home on Monday to facilitate the return to normal service.

          <p>The dragonâ€™s blood trees on the Yemeni island of Socotra, found nowhere else on Earth, are threatened by climate change, invasive goats, and conflict. Increasingly severe cyclones are uprooting the trees, while goats devour young saplings before they can mature. Conservation efforts are hampered by Yemenâ€™s civil war and limited resources, and scientists warn that these trees could disappear within centuries if interventions are not made. The umbrella-like canopies capture fog and rain, which they channel into the soil below, allowing neighboring plants to thrive in the arid climate.</p>
