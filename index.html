          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one fatality and two injuries. Authorities have arrested a 23-year-old suspect, charging him with second-degree murder, though there is no known connection between him and the victims. The incident occurred at the club's restaurant, adjacent to a wedding reception where a witness reported the shooter was subdued after being struck with a chair. The suspect is scheduled for arraignment as the investigation continues.</p>

The position, initially purchased for $230 million, saw its value increase by approximately 3890% during the holding period. While Buffett has praised BYD, the sale aligns with a broader re-evaluation of geopolitical risks associated with Chinese investments, similar to the company's recent divestment from Taiwan Semiconductor.

          <p>Seven northeastern states and New York City have established the Northeast Public Health Collaborative to create unified health guidance, particularly concerning vaccines. This move comes as national health agencies like the CDC face scrutiny, leading to a fractured landscape of public health policy across the country. The alliance aims to ensure consistent, evidence-based recommendations for the region, addressing concerns that access to essential health services could become dependent on state-level politics. A similar alliance has also been formed by West Coast states.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Article Argues True Strength Lies in Emotional Mastery, Not Suppression</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 08:00:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that genuine resilience, or "grit," is not the absence of emotion but the ability to manage and harness feelings effectively. Citing neuroscience research, the author argues that suppressing emotions makes individuals more brittle, whereas acknowledging and naming them enhances self-control. The piece suggests that emotional mastery is a learnable skill, crucial for perseverance and success in all aspects of life. It frames this capability as a core component of American strength and the pursuit of long-term goals.</p>

          <p>The United States recently held a major trilateral military drill, named Freedom Edge, with allies Japan and South Korea, notably without the presence of a US aircraft carrier. This departure from previous exercises has prompted speculation among analysts. Some suggest it may be a strategic move to de-escalate and improve diplomatic engagement with China and North Korea. Others believe it reflects the Trump administration's strategy of requiring Asian allies to take on greater responsibility for regional security.</p>

          <p>Health experts and fertility doctors are arguing that sex education in schools should be expanded to include comprehensive information about human fertility.

          <p>A recent executive order by President Trump to add a $100,000 fee for new H-1B skilled worker visa applicants caused widespread confusion and panic among current visa holders. Fearing they would be locked out, some individuals who were abroad, like one software professional from India, spent thousands of dollars on last-minute flights to return to the U.S. before the order took effect. The White House later clarified that the one-time fee would not apply to current visa holders or renewals, but the initial lack of clarity created significant personal and financial distress.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of RTX, has caused significant disruption at major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin, for a second consecutive day. The attack affected the company's MUSE software, a shared system used by multiple airlines for electronic check-in and baggage drop services. This forced airports to revert to manual processing, leading to long queues, delays, and flight cancellations. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the aviation industry's interconnected digital infrastructure to supply chain cyber threats.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence, particularly large-language models like ChatGPT, threatens to deepen the cognitive damage already caused by the internet. The author cites recent studies from MIT and other institutions suggesting that "cognitive offloading" to AI tools correlates with weaker brain connectivity and diminished critical thinking skills. The article expresses concern that this trend, especially among younger generations, is leading to a widespread decline in the ability to engage in deep, independent thought, creating a dependency that makes us intellectually weaker.</p>

The decision follows a deadline set by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had conditioned the move on Israel's actions in the Gaza conflict, including agreeing to a ceasefire and allowing humanitarian aid. While largely symbolic, the recognition is intended to increase pressure for a two-state solution and keep the prospect of a lasting peace alive ahead of the UN General Assembly.</p>

This call for accountability follows Musk's public criticism of the act as a threat to free speech and his appearance at a far-right rally.

Drawing on the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the article calls for empathy to become a public practice to counter the weaponization of grievance.
