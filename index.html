          <h2>Dodgers' Pitching Falters in 8-7 Loss to Brewers, Marking Ninth Defeat in Eleven Games</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 00:15:15 EDT</div>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense showed signs of life by scoring seven runs, but it was not enough to overcome a weak pitching performance in an 8-7 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite a three-RBI day from Shohei Ohtani and back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning, the team's inability to secure key hits with runners in scoring position proved costly. Starter Emmet Sheehan had a poor outing, and the bullpen allowed crucial late-game runs, leading to the Dodgers' ninth loss in their last eleven games. The defeat highlights ongoing struggles with timely hitting and consistent play, even as some individual players showed offensive improvement.</p>

          <p>Violent sectarian clashes between Druze and Bedouin communities in southern Syria have persisted despite a ceasefire declared by the country's interim president. Over 900 people have reportedly been killed in the past week, with fighting continuing in Suweida province even after government forces were deployed to quell the violence. The conflict has drawn international attention, with the US demanding an end to the "rape and slaughter" and Israel intervening with strikes against government forces to protect the Druze community. The violence, which erupted after a Druze merchant was abducted, highlights the deep-seated tensions and the fragility of peace efforts in the region.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of individuals missing after the severe floods on July 4, reducing the count from nearly 100 to just three. This update follows extensive verification efforts by state and local agencies, which confirmed that many people initially reported missing were actually safe. The devastating floods resulted in 134 deaths across Texas, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County alone. While this news brings relief to many families, search efforts continue for the few who remain unaccounted for in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent congressional cuts of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are posing an existential threat to small, rural radio stations that rely heavily on this support. Stations like Allegheny Mountain Radio, which serves remote communities in West Virginia and Virginia, depend on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for up to 65% of their budget. These stations provide essential local news, emergency information, and community programming in areas with limited internet and phone access. Station managers fear they may have to cut staff or shut down, severing a vital communication link for residents who depend on radio for daily information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the persistent failure to achieve peace in conflicts like those in Gaza, Ukraine, and Sudan stems from a global crisis of morality. The author posits that a lack of universally accepted ethical standards allows atrocities and the targeting of civilians to become routine, as different groups justify actions that others find indefensible. This moral relativism, exemplified by political figures and public denial, cripples mediation efforts and perpetuates violence. The piece concludes that ending major conflicts requires a collective recommitment to universal ethical principles defined by international law and shared human responsibility, rather than subjective or state-driven morality.</p>

She claimed she then accidentally shot him twice in the head while attempting a "cowboy style" fan-firing maneuver.

          <p>In a Wisconsin murder case, advanced technology played a crucial role in both clearing an initial suspect and convicting the actual perpetrator for the 2016 killing of Nicole Vander Heyden. Her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was first arrested but later exonerated when his Fitbit data showed minimal activity during the time of the murder, corroborating his alibi. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify another man, George Burch, whose location data from his phone's Google Dashboard placed him at the crime scene, where the body was found, and near where her belongings were discarded. Burch was subsequently convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

This fee, part of the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is in addition to existing visa application costs and will be collected when a visa is issued. While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with their visa terms, such as not overstaying, the process remains unclear. Travel and immigration experts have raised concerns about the lack of implementation details and advise treating the fee as nonrefundable due to the expected difficulty in obtaining a refund from the government.</p>

This marks the city's 12th police shooting of the year, six of which have been fatal.</p>

          <p>According to Gaza hospital officials and witnesses, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians near food distribution centers in southern Gaza, killing at least 32 people. The incidents occurred near hubs operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an organization backed by the U.S. and Israel. Witnesses alleged that troops fired indiscriminately on people massed near the sites, while the Israeli army stated it fired warning shots after suspects approached its forces. The GHF sites are located in military-controlled zones, and local officials report that hundreds have been killed trying to access aid since their inception.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old man experiencing homelessness, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta after he was killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during an encampment sweep. The lawsuit alleges that city workers failed to check if anyone was inside the tents before clearing the area on January 16, leading to Taylor's tragic and preventable death. His death sparked outrage among advocates, who criticized the city's approach to homelessness amid an affordable housing crisis. The family is seeking unspecified damages and a call for more humane treatment of the city's unhoused population.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $20 billion libel lawsuit against the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges defamation over a report claiming Trump signed a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which included a drawing of a nude woman. Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling the letter a fake and accusing the newspaper of journalistic failures. The lawsuit faces a high legal standard, as public figures must prove "actual malice" to win defamation cases.</p>

          <p>Health experts and officials are raising alarms over the increasing use of nicotine pouches, also known as snus, among young people in the UK, with use among 16 to 24-year-olds nearly quadrupling since 2022. These pouches, which are currently legal for all ages, can contain extremely high levels of nicotine and are linked to severe gum damage. Teen users report using them for a stronger 'hit' than vaping, even using them in school. Trading Standards is calling for new legislation to make it illegal to sell these products to minors, citing the addictive nature and health risks associated with them.</p>

          <p>The initial phase of the UK's Great British Energy (GBE) initiative, which installed solar panels on 11 schools, used panels manufactured by two Chinese firms, Aiko and Longi. This has drawn criticism from some MPs due to concerns over alleged forced labor in China's solar supply chains, particularly in the Xinjiang region. While GBE stated all contracts complied with UK modern slavery rules, critics argue that taxpayer money should support British or other ethical manufacturers. The incident highlights the global dominance of Chinese solar panel production and the challenge of ensuring ethical supply chains in the green energy transition.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of drivers are avoiding steep airport drop-off fees by waiting in lay-bys and other unofficial spots near terminals to pick up passengers. Research from the RAC shows that over half of the UK's busiest airports have raised their "kiss-and-fly" charges, with some, like Edinburgh Airport, charging £6 for a 10-minute stay. This practice forces drivers to find creative, and sometimes risky, ways to circumvent the fees, leading to congestion on approach roads. In contrast, most major European airports do not charge for drop-offs, fueling criticism that UK airports are being greedy.</p>

This effort involves a revised school curriculum, patriotic events, and the involvement of state-sponsored youth military groups like Yunarmia. Russian teachers are being offered financial incentives to relocate to these regions, while Ukrainian children are forced to participate in pro-Russia parades and listen to the Russian national anthem.

          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over the possibility of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday to address issues like learning loss and the high cost of childcare for working parents. Proponents argue that a shorter break, with holidays spread more evenly throughout the year, could help mitigate the widening learning gap between children from different economic backgrounds. However, the proposal is divisive, with many teachers opposing the idea, valuing the long break for rest and preparation. The discussion also considers the impact on holiday pricing and the challenges of increasingly hot summers due to climate change.</p>

Residents report drying wetlands, shrinking lagoons, and a decline in wildlife like flamingos, which threatens their traditional way of life.

This has sparked debate, with experts noting a gender gap in investing and warning that a forced approach could backfire.
