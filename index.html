          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is experiencing a significant drop in visitors, particularly from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, due to strained relations between Taiwan and Beijing. Visitor numbers plummeted from a record high of 6.14 million in 2016 to just 2.87 million in 2024, with visitors from the specified regions dropping to 50,000 last year. The museum aims to attract 3.5 million visitors in 2025, its centenary year, despite ongoing cross-strait tensions and travel restrictions. The largest overseas visitor group in 2024 came from South Korea, followed by Japan, as the museum navigates political factors and changes in tourism policies.</p>

          <p>Rolando Romero defeated Ryan Garcia by unanimous decision in a boxing match, disrupting plans for a Garcia-Devin Haney rematch. Garcia, returning after a year-long suspension, struggled with his timing and output, landing only 54 punches in the entire fight. Romero's victory earned him the WBA's secondary welterweight title, while Garcia acknowledged the impact of his year-long absence on his performance. In the co-main event, Devin Haney secured a comfortable win against JosÃ© RamÃ­rez, further solidifying his position in the boxing world, although the loss by Garcia has made a rematch between Haney and Garcia much less likely.</p>

          <p>Representative Mikie Sherrill, campaigning for New Jersey governor, suggested the possibility of a third impeachment for President Donald Trump to prevent Republican actions after the 2026 midterms. Speaking at a campaign event, Sherrill, who voted for both of Trump's previous impeachments, responded to audience encouragement with a playful "Maybe weâ€™ll go for the trifecta." This statement comes as Representative Shri Thanedar filed new impeachment articles against Trump, alleging abuses of power. Sherrill emphasized the importance of state-level actions to counter Trump's agenda, highlighting the role of federalism in challenging the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst concerns about inflation, housing affordability, and navigating relations with the United States and China, with voters indicating that economic issues are their primary concern. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton are competing to address the cost-of-living crisis, but neither party has proposed ambitious solutions, as the country grapples with global economic and political turmoil originating from Washington. The election also highlights a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates and minor parties, and opposition leader Dutton has mirrored some policies of President Trump, including denouncing "wokeness."</p>

The Times covers Reform UK's gains and Prince Harry's reflections on security issues and his children's connection to Britain. The Financial Times stands out by focusing solely on Reform UK's impact, describing it as a "populist insurgency" and discusses concerns over British soldiers' drone training for potential warfare with Russia.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is implementing administrative reforms to reduce government spending, streamline bureaucracy, and consolidate political power under the Communist Party leadership. These reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media outlets, and eliminating approximately 100,000 public sector jobs. The changes are intended to address economic stagnation and dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign. Additionally, Vietnam is responding to external pressures, including potential US tariffs, by strengthening political governance and economic resilience. The reforms also coincide with preparations for the Communist Party's 14th National Congress in 2026, potentially benefiting current party chief To Lam.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit claims that these policies obstruct federal efforts to deport undocumented immigrants and interfere with federal immigration law enforcement. The DOJ argues that Colorado's laws, which limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities, violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Local officials have responded, defending their policies and vowing to uphold their values, while the governor's office maintains that Colorado is not a sanctuary state.</p>

          <p>A 25% import tax on key car parts has been implemented in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry amid ongoing policy changes. The tariff aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing, but analysts predict higher costs for businesses and consumers. While some companies have reported increased sales due to concerns about price hikes, General Motors anticipates billions in new costs. The tariffs do not apply to parts from Canada and Mexico that comply with the North American trade agreement, and measures have been introduced to mitigate the impact on carmakers.</p>

Temu has stopped shipping directly from China to the US, and Shein has not yet commented on the changes. Meta CFO Susan Li noted that some Asian retailers had already reduced their U.S. advertising spending in anticipation of the tariff changes, which could impact Meta's revenue, as advertisers from China had been one of the company's fastest-growing segments.</p>

The project is now a target of the new government's anti-corruption initiative, and construction has halted, leaving behind a large, water-filled hole in Accra.

          <p>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor Organization (ITER), based in France, is participating in the World Exposition in Osaka, showcasing clean energy technology. ITER's exhibits explain the fusion energy process and the experimental reactor being built in southern France. Japan, the host of the event, is emphasizing its contribution to the project, which involves China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the United States, and the European Union. Fusion energy, often dubbed "the Sun on Earth," is seen as a byproduct-free energy source, although scientists believe it is still decades away from becoming a reality.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that 58% of Japanese citizens believe social media platforms should be regulated by law to combat the spread of unverified information during elections. This concern follows criticism that partisan online posts influenced a Hyogo gubernatorial reelection. While 29% suggest social media operators should self-regulate, the survey highlights growing unease over online misinformation impacting democratic processes, especially with the upcoming upper house election. The survey also covered constitutional matters, including Article 9, same-sex marriage, and separate surnames for married couples, reflecting diverse opinions on key social and political issues in Japan.</p>

The attack came hours after a Russian strike in Zaporizhzhia wounded more than 20 people. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks and criticized the slow delivery of air defense systems from allies, while Russia announced a three-day ceasefire coinciding with commemorations in Moscow for the end of World War Two, which Kyiv denounced as manipulation.</p>

          <p>South Africa's coastlines face threats from rising sea levels, but new research indicates that parts of the country are slowly lifting out of the ocean due to drought and groundwater loss. Scientists estimate that some areas are rising by two millimeters each year, counteracting the effects of rising seas. While this uplift may seem beneficial, geoscientists caution against optimism, noting that it comes at the expense of less water availability on the land surface. The study's insights could improve drought and flood monitoring, guide groundwater management, and inform climate adaptation efforts.</p>
