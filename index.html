          <p>A man has been sentenced to life with a minimum of 38 years for murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin with a samurai sword in Hainault, east London. During a 20-minute rampage, Marcus Monzo also injured five other people, including police officers. The judge noted that Monzo's self-induced psychosis from cannabis use was a dominant factor but did not diminish his responsibility for the horrific attack. The victim's family expressed that while no sentence could bring back their son, they felt justice had been served.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ordered additional arguments regarding Louisiana's new congressional map, which includes a second majority-Black district. This decision temporarily leaves the new map, created to comply with the Voting Rights Act, in place for the upcoming elections. The case stems from a challenge by non-African-American voters who argued the map constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The outcome of this long-running legal battle will likely influence the balance of power in the House of Representatives in future elections.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has upheld a Texas law mandating that pornography websites verify the age of their visitors. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, found that the law is a constitutionally permissible exercise of the state's authority to protect children from sexually explicit content. The ruling rejected arguments from a coalition of website operators who claimed the law unconstitutionally burdens adults' First Amendment rights to access protected speech. This decision could have broad implications as numerous other states have enacted similar age-verification laws.</p>

Guests including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kim Kardashian were seen attending a pre-wedding reception at the Madonna dell'Orto church. The lavish events, expected to host around 200 guests, have sparked protests from some Venice locals concerned about the impact of "over-tourism" and the city being used as a playground for the super-rich.

Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito emphasized the right of parents to guide their children's religious development.

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his public attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "terrible" and "a very stupid person" during a NATO summit. This renewed criticism has fueled speculation on Wall Street that Trump may soon name a "shadow chair" to influence monetary policy ahead of Powell's term expiring in 2026. The political pressure comes as the Fed navigates complex decisions on interest rates, with traders now increasing bets on rate cuts this year.

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, many retirees are exploring annuities for guaranteed income, with current high interest rates making them more attractive. A $300,000 immediate fixed annuity purchased at age 65 could yield different monthly payouts depending on various factors. For example, a 65-year-old man might receive around $1,942 per month, while a woman of the same age might get about $1,861, due to longer life expectancy. A joint-life annuity for a couple would typically pay less, around $1,684, as it covers two lives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit, filed in Delaware, alleges the network and its anchor Jesse Watters knowingly lied by claiming Newsom was dishonest about a phone call with President Donald Trump. The damages sought mirror the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit. Newsom's legal team stated the suit would be dropped if Fox News retracts the claim and issues a formal on-air apology, framing the legal action as a fight against the network's "propaganda machine."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision in the Trump birthright citizenship case was a narrow procedural victory for the administration, focusing on the use of nationwide injunctions rather than the legality of the policy itself. The ruling restricts the ability of single judges to block a policy nationwide but leaves the door open for such injunctions if they are necessary to provide "complete relief" to plaintiffs. This analysis suggests the decision is not a death blow to birthright citizenship, as challenges can continue through other legal means, and it may also benefit future administrations by curbing judicial overreach.</p>

Data shows warehouse inventory levels are down and ports are seeing a buildup of empty containers, suggesting a milder-than-usual peak shopping season.

The ruling allows the administration to partially enforce the executive order while legal challenges continue, though it cannot be applied to the specific plaintiffs who sued.

          <p>European leaders, particularly NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, have been criticized for using effusive praise and flattery in their attempts to manage President Donald Trump during a recent summit. Rutte's public compliments and a bizarre reference to Trump as "daddy" were seen by some as an "orchestrated grovel" designed to secure U.S. commitments. While some analysts view this as a pragmatic strategy for dealing with Trump's personality, critics argue it demeans the leaders and signals fealty rather than an alliance of equals. The approach highlights the ongoing challenge for U.S. allies in navigating relations with the current administration.</p>

However, the agreement has faced criticism for not directly addressing the systemic use of sexual assault as a weapon of war or providing measures for justice for victims.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated his government's welfare reforms have struck "the right balance" after making significant concessions to his own Labour MPs. The initial plan to tighten eligibility criteria for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) faced a large backbench rebellion, forcing the government to apply the stricter rules only to new claimants. While the compromise satisfied many rebels, some MPs on the left of the party still plan to vote against the bill. The U-turn is estimated to cost Â£3 billion, raising questions about how the government will fund the changes.</p>

          <p>With auto insurance rates rising significantly, many drivers are wondering when to switch providers. Industry experts suggest shopping for new insurance not just for a better price, but also when seeking different coverage options like roadside assistance or new car replacement. Another key reason to switch is a desire for better customer service or if you are working with a "captive" agent who can only offer policies from one company. Experts recommend getting at least three quotes to compare value, which includes coverage, price, and the insurer's service and claims reputation.</p>
