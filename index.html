          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 09:20:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tees Valley Mayor Lord Houchen suggested the Conservative Party might need to form a coalition with Reform UK to prevent a Labour government, sparking debate within Tory ranks. While Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has dismissed a national-level coalition with Nigel Farage's party, Houchen emphasized the 'practicalities' of keeping Labour out of power. This proposal comes as the Tories face challenges from Reform UK, which is attracting right-leaning voters, and as local elections loom, potentially reshaping the political landscape. The comments highlight internal divisions within the Conservative Party regarding strategies for maintaining power. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that while President Trump maintains strong support from his base, concerns are growing among other Americans regarding his focus on tariffs and their impact on prices. The poll reveals diverging views on the economy, with MAGA Republicans expressing optimism while others, including some who voted for Trump, show declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation. Immigration policies continue to receive majority approval, though concerns exist about potential detentions of legal residents. The poll also highlights frustration among Democrats regarding their party's response to the Trump administration. Optimism score: 50</p>
