          <p>Eight major OPEC+ oil producers unexpectedly increased their combined crude oil output by 411,000 barrels per day, exceeding anticipated production hikes. This move caused a significant drop in oil prices, with Brent crude falling by 6%.  The decision was made during a virtual meeting, and OPEC cited evolving market conditions as a factor influencing the potential for future adjustments to production levels. The increased output comes amidst broader market uncertainty triggered by new tariffs imposed by the U.S. administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to eliminate the "de minimis" exemption for Chinese goods will significantly affect American consumers and Chinese cross-border e-commerce businesses. The removal of the duty-free threshold for packages under US$800 will increase costs for Chinese online retailers like Temu and Shein.  Analysts suggest that while these companies will face challenges, their low-cost advantages might allow them to remain competitive despite the added tariffs. The move is a part of a broader trade policy shift by the Trump administration.</p>

The formula involves dividing the trade deficit by total imports and then halving the result.  However, the tariffs are not strictly reciprocal, as they don't fully account for existing tariffs and non-tariff barriers imposed by other countries.
