          <h2>Number of Missing Individuals in Texas Floods Drastically Reduces</h2>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of individuals missing after severe flooding, lowering the count from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies, which successfully verified the safety of many people initially unaccounted for. Despite this positive development in Kerr County, several people remain missing in other counties. The overall death toll from the floods across Texas stands at 134, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the hard-hit Kerr County area.</p>

          <p>Modern technology, including data from a Fitbit and Google Dashboard, played a pivotal role in solving the 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Initially, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was the prime suspect, but his Fitbit data provided an alibi by showing minimal activity during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify a new suspect, George Burch. Burch’s location data from his Android phone's Google Dashboard tracked his movements to the crime scene, where the body was found, and where her belongings were discarded, leading to his conviction.</p>

          <p>Animal rescue volunteers discovered more than 400 guinea pigs living in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions at a home in South Los Angeles. The Southern California Guinea Pig Rescue described a distressing scene with some deceased animals and others suffering from medical issues like ringworm and open wounds. The tenant, facing eviction, had reportedly been feeding them only corn husks. Rescue groups are now urgently seeking public assistance for adoptions, foster care, and donations to cover medical expenses and supplies for the rescued animals, which include pregnant and newborn guinea pigs.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Love Hewitt has commented on long-standing rumors of a feud with her "I Know What You Did Last Summer" co-star, Sarah Michelle Gellar, revealing they have not spoken since the film's release when she was 18. Hewitt dismissed the speculation as a narrative people create, stating there is no bad blood on her side. The rumors gained traction after Gellar gave a terse response about Hewitt's potential return to the franchise and later omitted her from a social media post. Gellar has since clarified her actions, citing non-disclosure agreements and noting she simply didn't encounter Hewitt at a recent premiere.</p>

          <p>A popular social media claim that 55,000 used Wimbledon tennis balls are annually donated to become homes for threatened harvest mice has been found to be outdated. While Wimbledon did donate balls for this purpose in the past, including a notable instance in 2001, it is not a current, ongoing annual practice. A spokesperson for The Wildlife Trusts confirmed they have not worked with Wimbledon in this capacity for some time. Currently, used tennis balls from the tournament are sold on-site, with the proceeds benefiting the Wimbledon Foundation, the tournament's official charity organization.</p>

          <p>Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, is facing an unprecedented water crisis and could become the first modern capital city to run completely dry, according to a report by Mercy Corps. A combination of rapid population growth, climate change, and decades of over-extraction has severely depleted the city's groundwater, its primary water source. With nearly half of the city's boreholes already dry and up to 80% of the remaining groundwater contaminated, residents face severe health risks and economic hardship. The crisis is exacerbated by political turmoil and a freeze in international aid, leaving millions in a desperate situation.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law to target individuals who plan mass killings but are not motivated by a specific ideology, closing a gap in current anti-terrorism legislation. The move comes in response to the Southport attack, where the perpetrator was not driven by a recognized terrorist cause. Under existing law, suspects can be jailed for life for preparing terrorist acts, but this requires an ideological motive. The new offense would allow police to intervene and charge individuals for preparatory actions, like researching targets, regardless of their motivation.</p>

A recent survey found that over half of the UK's busiest airports have increased these fees, with Edinburgh charging £6 for a 10-minute stay. To circumvent the cost, drivers wait for passengers to call and then arrange a quick pickup near airport hotels or the free, but more distant, drop-off area.

However, many teachers oppose the idea, citing the need for the long break to recharge and plan. Some school districts have already moved to a five-week summer break with a longer two-week autumn half-term, but the proposal remains divisive among parents, educators, and even students.</p>

          <h2>Soaring Demand for Lithium for Green Technology Fuels Environmental Concerns in Chile</h2>

          <p>The global transition to green technology, particularly electric vehicles, is driving a massive demand for lithium, but its extraction is causing significant environmental damage in Chile's Atacama Desert. The process involves pumping vast amounts of brine from beneath salt flats, which depletes scarce water resources, harms local ecosystems, and threatens the livelihood of indigenous communities. While mining companies are piloting new, less impactful extraction technologies, locals remain skeptical and fear irreversible damage to their environment. This situation highlights a critical dilemma where the solution to one environmental crisis is contributing to another.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:04:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has stated that savers are missing potential financial rewards due to an overemphasis on the risks of investing. The government is planning initiatives to promote investment, including sending information about opportunities to individuals with funds in low-interest accounts. While a proposal to reduce the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to push people toward stocks and shares has faced opposition, it has not been ruled out. Experts suggest a key challenge is overcoming risk aversion, particularly among women, who currently invest less than men. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new generation of modern, private members-only clubs is emerging in India, catering to the country's growing class of young, self-made entrepreneurs and creatives. These clubs, such as Soho House, offer a more relaxed and contemporary alternative to the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas, which have long waiting lists and cater to old-money elites. Unlike their predecessors, these new spaces focus on personal accomplishment rather than family legacy, providing a hub for networking, collaboration, and leisure. While still exclusive and expensive, they reflect a significant shift in India's social and economic landscape.</p>

While authentic photographs of Trump and Epstein together do exist from past events, this specific, compromising image is a fabrication.

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in Westbury, New York, after being pulled into a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine. The man was reportedly wearing a large metallic chain when he entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the chain, drawing the man into the device and causing a fatal "medical episode." Police are investigating the death, which highlights the critical safety protocols required around MRI machines. The FDA warns that the strong magnetic fields can turn metallic objects into dangerous projectiles, necessitating careful screening of all people and items entering the environment.</p>

          <p>After years of growth, the popularity of learning Mandarin is declining in several Western countries, including the United States, the UK, and New Zealand. In the U.S., university enrollments in Mandarin have dropped by 25% from their 2013 peak, while the UK has seen a 35% decrease in university students studying Chinese since 2016. This trend marks a significant shift from a decade ago when Mandarin was widely promoted as the language of the future, driven by China's economic rise.
