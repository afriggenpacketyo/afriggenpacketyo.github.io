          <p>The dating app Tinder is piloting a new mandatory security feature in California called Face Check to combat fraud and enhance user safety.

This initiative aims to address the growing problem of romance scams and ensure that users are interacting with real people, not bots or fraudulent profiles.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has initiated a series of votes on President Trump's extensive budget and tax bill, with Republicans aiming to pass the legislation by a July 4 deadline. The bill has been met with staunch opposition from Democrats, who are using procedural tactics to delay its progress, including a 16-hour reading of the 940-page document. Key Republican senators have also voiced objections over aspects like debt increases and cuts to Medicaid, making the final vote uncertain. The legislation includes significant tax cuts and would authorize trillions in new borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

Key factors contributing to this stability include inflation holding steady around 2.4% and the Federal Reserve's likely decision to continue its pause on interest rate cuts until at least September. While geopolitical tensions can be an unpredictable driver of gold prices, the current muddled global landscape is not expected to cause major shifts, though any sudden changes could quickly alter the forecast for the precious metal.

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies following significant pressure from President Donald Trump. The tax would have imposed a 3% charge on Canadian revenues for giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta. After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and called off trade negotiations in response, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney informed the White House that the tax would be scrapped. The White House hailed the decision as a major victory for American tech companies and a result of the president's firm negotiating stance.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced it is examining reports of civilians being harmed while trying to access aid at distribution centers in Gaza. Since a new U.S.- and Israeli-backed aid system began, the UN reports that over 400 Palestinians have been killed near these sites, sparking international condemnation. The IDF stated that it has issued new instructions after learning lessons, but did not specify what they were, and will reorganize access to the sites. This development follows a report in which unnamed Israeli soldiers claimed they were ordered to fire on unarmed civilians.</p>
