          <p>Canadian companies, particularly small businesses, are struggling with instability caused by fluctuating U.S. tariffs on goods like metals and automobiles. Business owners express frustration over the inability to plan for the future, describing the punitive and unpredictable nature of the levies as a significant hindrance to operations and investment. The ongoing trade dispute has slowed Canada's economy, with many firms delaying expenditures and seeking alternative markets while hoping for a stable trade agreement to be reached. This article highlights the ground-level economic anxiety and the broader impact on Canada's trade-reliant economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that limited nationwide injunctions, President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship can proceed in its planning stages, though its constitutionality remains undecided. The ruling creates a complex situation where the policy could take effect in 28 states that did not challenge it, while litigation continues in others. Significant practical questions, such as how citizenship status will be verified at birth, are unanswered by the White House. Legal challenges are expected to continue, potentially through class-action lawsuits and challenges to the administration's future regulations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted against a resolution that would have required President Trump to seek congressional approval before taking further military action in Iran. The measure failed despite recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which have fueled a debate over presidential war powers. Democrats and some Republicans expressed concern over the lack of transparency from the administration regarding the intelligence that prompted the strikes and their actual effectiveness. The vote highlights the deep divisions in Congress over foreign policy and the constitutional authority to declare war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' post-Katrina flood protection system are sinking at a rate of nearly two inches per year, faster than the rise of sea levels. This subsidence, particularly in areas like the Michoud neighborhood and near industrial sites, threatens to degrade the effectiveness of the $15 billion levee system. Researchers warn that if the trend continues, it could significantly increase flood risk and transform nearby wetlands into open water, removing a critical storm surge buffer. The findings underscore the urgent need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the city's defenses.</p>

          <p>United Nations Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has strongly criticized a new aid distribution system in Gaza, operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and backed by Israel and the U.S. Guterres stated the system is "inherently unsafe" and has resulted in the deaths of over 400 Palestinians trying to get food, effectively making the search for aid a "death sentence." The GHF was established to bypass the UN and prevent aid from allegedly being seized by Hamas, a claim the UN disputes.

          <p>A recent meeting of the CDCâ€™s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) showcased a significant shift in direction under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. After the dismissal of all previous voting members, the newly appointed committee, which includes noted vaccine skeptics, raised numerous concerns about vaccine safety, particularly regarding COVID-19 and flu shots. The proceedings were marked by challenges to established CDC data and methods, with new members floating alternative hypotheses about vaccine harms. This overhaul suggests a fundamental change in U.S. vaccination policy, moving away from established scientific consensus toward more open, and controversial, debate.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled to limit the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The 6-3 decision came in a case related to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, argued that such broad orders exceed the authority granted to federal courts. The ruling is a significant victory for the executive branch, potentially making it harder for single-judge rulings to halt the implementation of presidential policies.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican-led budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause up to 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, a change Newsom described as "devastating" and "cruel." He argued the legislation would disproportionately harm vulnerable populations, potentially force the closure of rural hospitals, and threaten the state's progress in reducing its uninsured rate. The governor's office estimates that millions would struggle with the new verification process, leading to significant coverage losses across the state. (not investment advice)</p>

The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids may contribute to improved mental well-being by affecting neurotransmitters.

          <p>Japanese farmers and chefs are exploring the culinary potential of the prickly pear cactus, incorporating it into dishes like tempura, quiche, and pizza. Known for its mild taste and rich nutritional profile, the cactus is being hailed as a "superfood" with research from Chubu University suggesting it may enhance immune function. Farmers in Kasugai, a city known for ornamental cactus cultivation, are now growing edible varieties for sale in supermarkets and restaurants.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that the network, particularly anchor Jesse Watters, knowingly lied by claiming Newsom had been untruthful about a phone call with President Donald Trump. The complaint, filed in Delaware, argues that Fox News distorted the facts to curry favor with the President and attack Newsom for his progressive values. Newsom has offered to drop the lawsuit in exchange for a full retraction and an on-air apology, while Fox News has dismissed the suit as a "frivolous publicity stunt."</p>

Svendsen estimates he has paid over $162,000 in tariffs, which he cannot absorb due to slim profit margins, leading to the difficult decision to close and lay off his 10 employees.

This ruling is the latest in a series of defeats for the administration's campaign to use executive power against law firms for representing clients or causes the president opposes.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has performed a major U-turn on planned cuts to disability benefits following a significant rebellion from its own MPs. The proposed changes, intended to generate short-term savings to meet fiscal rules, were criticized for not being part of a broader, long-term reform to help people with health issues return to work. The reversal, which spares many current and future claimants from cuts, has created a potential Â£3 billion hole in the budget.

          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his policies, calling it a "monumental victory." In a rare appearance in the White House briefing room, Trump praised the ruling for striking down what he called an "excessive use" of judicial power that interfered with the executive branch. The case stemmed from his order to end birthright citizenship, and while the court did not rule on the policy's legality, the decision is a significant win for the president's agenda. The ruling frees the administration to proceed with policies that had been blocked.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California for several days. The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley. The flights are part of NASA's Student Airborne Research Program (SARP), designed to study atmospheric data by sampling gasses and measuring land and water surfaces. Officials advise the public not to be alarmed by the aircraft performing peculiar maneuvers like vertical spirals.</p>
