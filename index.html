          <p>A new animated "Smurfs" film starring Rihanna as Smurfette brings renewed attention to the "Smurfette principle," a term for a lone female character in an all-male cast. The article examines the history of this trope in pop culture, from "Star Wars" to "The Muppets," and discusses how previous "Smurfs" movies have attempted to address or subvert it. It also touches on other controversies surrounding the franchise, including its alleged co-opting by far-right groups in Germany.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is showing signs of cooling, with the unemployment rate rising to a four-year high of 4.7% and annual pay growth slowing to 5%. These figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, have increased speculation that the Bank of England may cut interest rates next month to stimulate the economy. The number of job vacancies has also fallen for three consecutive years, reaching its lowest point in a decade, excluding the pandemic period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely, is altering its U.S. strategy in response to significant trade tariffs. The company reported a sharp drop in second-quarter operating profit and plans to begin producing its popular XC60 SUV at its South Carolina plant starting in late 2026. This move aims to better utilize the U.S. factory and mitigate the impact of tariffs, which include a 27.5% tax on European-made cars and 100% on EVs from China.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that a key federal grant program for fentanyl overdose prevention, which is currently underfunded, will receive its money "in increments" rather than as a single annual payment. The statement followed an NPR report on concerns from CDC staffers about a $140 million shortfall and potential delays for the Overdose Data To Action (OD2A) program. This new, piecemeal funding approach has created uncertainty for state and local health departments that rely on these funds for their operations.</p>

          <p>While federal officials are pushing for a multi-billion dollar plan to modernize equipment in air traffic control facilities, many controllers feel this focus ignores more pressing problems. They cite nationwide staffing shortages, mandatory six-day workweeks, stagnating pay, and difficult working conditions as the root causes of low morale and system stress. Controllers interviewed by NPR expressed frustration that the current conversation fails to address these critical quality-of-life issues, which they believe are essential for ensuring air travel safety and efficiency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the cancellation of $4 billion in federal funds previously allocated for California's high-speed rail project. President Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy labeled the project an incompetent "boondoggle" and a waste of taxpayer money. California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have condemned the move as illegal and politically motivated, stating they will explore all options to fight the decision. The project has faced numerous delays and cost overruns since its launch in 2008.</p>
