          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are experiencing the peak of a four-day heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach 34Â°C in central and eastern England, potentially marking one of the hottest June days on record. An amber heat-health alert is active in five regions, indicating likely impacts on the health service and travel delays. The London Fire Brigade has warned of a "severe" risk of wildfires due to the high temperatures and low rainfall. However, other areas like Northern Ireland and western Scotland are seeing cooler, rainy weather.</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were shot and killed in what authorities have described as a premeditated ambush near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The firefighters were responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain that was allegedly set to lure first responders into the area. Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris stated that the responders came under sniper fire from high-powered rifles. Following a standoff, a SWAT team located a deceased male suspect with a firearm nearby, and a shelter-in-place order for the area was lifted.</p>

          <p>An analysis details the circumstances that have positioned British oil giant BP as a potential acquisition target, culminating in recent market speculation about a takeover by rival Shell. Key factors include BP's 2020 strategic pivot towards renewable energy, the abrupt resignation of CEO Bernard Looney in 2023, and a persistent underperformance of its stock compared to peers. Despite a recent strategic reset to increase investment in oil and gas, investor confidence has remained low, fueling the takeover rumors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC is under fire for its broadcast of a performance by the punk group Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury Festival, which included chants of "death to the IDF." The incident has sparked significant political backlash, with the Prime Minister and other officials questioning why the broadcaster did not intervene. There are now calls for BBC executives to be held accountable and for the singer who led the chants to be prosecuted for inciting violence.</p>

Farmers are concerned about concessions made, such as increased quotas for American beef and the removal of tariffs on U.S. ethanol, which they believe will harm domestic producers.
