          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million. Posing as a friend while preparing the victim's taxes, Cohen-Roth offered fraudulent "investment opportunities" promising high returns with no risk. She operated a Ponzi scheme, using new investors' money to pay off earlier ones and funding her lavish lifestyle. The scheme collapsed when the victim requested her money back, leaving her financially destitute after Cohen-Roth had depleted her investments and reverse mortgaged her home.</p>

While President Trump announced the agreement, both Indian and Pakistani leaders confirmed the ceasefire without explicitly acknowledging U.S. involvement in their initial statements.

          <p>Ukraine and its allies, including the EU, UK, France, and Germany, have proposed a "full unconditional ceasefire" with Russia for at least 30 days, beginning on Monday.

          <p>Climate change is significantly altering bird migration patterns, impacting their ability to feed and breed effectively. Rising sea levels are affecting coastal stopover points, reducing crucial food sources for migratory birds. Extreme weather events and warmer temperatures are also causing birds to shorten routes or abandon traditional habitats, leading to conflicts with resident animals. The extinction of the slender-billed curlew highlights the severe consequences of habitat loss and the inability of some species to adapt. Efforts to aid migratory birds include expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly environments to mitigate the risks posed by human activity.</p>

          <p>The Channel Islands, located off the coast of Southern California, are a vast underwater paradise teeming with marine life and often referred to as "California's Galapagos." These islands are home to thousands of species thriving in protected waters, drawing researchers and recreational enthusiasts alike. The area's 13 marine protected areas (MPAs) preserve approximately 21% of their waters, providing refuge for diverse species. As California officials conduct a required review of these MPAs, scientists and conservationists hope the thriving ecosystem will demonstrate the value of preservation, despite challenges from commercial fishing and climate change.</p>

          <p>Financial planning icon Ric Edelman discusses the potential of new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly buffer ETFs and yield ETFs, as bitcoin surpasses $100,000.

He cautions against leveraged and inverse bitcoin ETFs, deeming them unsuitable for retail investors due to their complexity. Edelman emphasizes that crypto should be viewed as a long-term investment for portfolio diversification, similar to the stock market.</p>

          <p>Smokey Robinson performed to an adoring crowd at the Beau Rivage Theater, making no mention of the sexual assault allegations recently levied against him. The 85-year-old Motown star proceeded with his concert as part of a tour celebrating his music, despite a lawsuit filed by four former housekeepers alleging repeated sexual assault. While Robinson's lawyer has called the claims "vile" and "false," audience members expressed support for the singer, stating that the allegations did not affect their enjoyment of the show. Robinson performed many of his classic hits and new songs, engaging with the audience and receiving enthusiastic applause.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has directed military leaders to review and remove books related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and "gender ideology" from their libraries. This directive follows a similar order given to military academies, including the U.S. Naval Academy, which removed nearly 400 books. The Department said a temporary "academic libraries committee" will convene to help remove similar books from collections, using search terms like "affirmative action" and "critical race theory". The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has vowed to purge DEI from the Pentagon, reflecting the Trump administration's broader effort to eliminate DEI within the federal government.</p>

The House Ways and Means Committee has released a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill, but the final version could undergo significant changes. With Republican control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the tax package can be passed without Democratic support, but competing priorities and the need for a fiscally responsible package could complicate the process.</p>
