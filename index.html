          <p>President Trump emphasized the importance of passing the GOP tax megabill before the Fourth of July holiday, urging Republican friends in the Senate and House to expedite its progress. Trump also addressed concerns about potential cuts to Medicaid and other entitlement programs, dismissing arguments from Democrats as misinformation. He asserted that there would be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, claiming they would be safeguarded from Democratic incompetence. The administration aims to finalize the legislation swiftly despite ongoing debates about its impact on various social programs. Optimism surrounds the potential economic benefits highlighted by the administration.</p>

          <p>FEMA staff were reportedly confused after acting head David Richardson stated during a briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, which officially began on June 1 and lasts through November. It remains unclear whether the remark was a joke or a genuine expression of ignorance, but the comment has reportedly contributed to low morale within the agency amid leadership changes and staff cuts. NOAA has predicted an above-average hurricane season, forecasting 13 to 19 named storms. The Department of Homeland Security spokesperson stated the comment was a joke and that FEMA was prepared for hurricane season.</p>

          <p>The White House released a new official portrait of President Trump, featuring deeper shadowing and a black backdrop, differing from the earlier portrait released in January, which had brighter illumination and an American flag backdrop.

A White House official stated that the updated portrait will replace existing official photographs in federal buildings and offices, and has already been updated on the White House website. The reason for the update was not explicitly stated, but the new portrait captures a different visual representation of the President.</p>

          <p>NPR is gathering information about songs parents sing to their babies, inspired by a Yale University study that found singing to infants improves their moods and overall well-being. The study, which surveyed 110 parents and their babies, indicated that infants who are sung to more often are generally happier throughout the day. Samuel Mehr, an associate professor at the Yale University Child Study Center, emphasized that any song, not just lullabies, can be beneficial.

The research, which examined county-level data in 33 states, indicates significant diversity in vaccination levels, which could inform targeted vaccination strategies. The decline comes amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with 1,088 cases reported.

This shift indicates a cautious stance on stocks, potentially reflecting a "reset year" pattern in the bull market cycle.

          <p>President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act is encountering resistance from Senate Republicans, particularly fiscal hawks like Rand Paul and Ron Johnson, who are concerned about the bill's impact on the national debt. Despite reducing outlays by over $1.5 trillion, the bill is projected to add about $3.1 trillion to the debt. These senators are pushing for deeper cuts than those in the House-passed version, potentially complicating the bill's passage. The White House defends the bill, citing a $1.6 trillion savings over 10 years, while fiscal conservatives call for steeper cuts, possibly including entitlement programs, setting up a contentious debate.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine and Russia escalate attacks and hold a second round of negotiations, the Trump administration signals a shift in its approach to mediating the conflict. President Trump has remained notably quiet despite Ukraine's drone strikes inside Russia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, reiterating Trump's call for direct talks but with lower expectations. The second round of negotiations concluded without major breakthroughs, with the U.S. expressing disappointment but not surprise at Russia's demands for a truce.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating approximately a dozen advertising groups and watchdogs for potential antitrust violations related to coordinated boycotts among advertisers. The investigation focuses on whether these groups colluded to pressure advertisers to withdraw support from certain platforms or content providers. The FTC's inquiry raises questions about the boundaries of advocacy and the potential for coordinated actions to stifle free speech or competition. The outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for the advertising industry and the regulation of online content.</p>

          <p>Mexico's recent judicial election experienced a low voter turnout, with nearly 90% of voters abstaining, marking one of the lowest turnouts in any federal election since the country's transition to democracy. The election aimed to fill judicial positions, but the lack of public engagement has raised concerns about the legitimacy and representativeness of the results. Experts suggest that the low turnout may reflect voter apathy, confusion about the candidates, or skepticism about the impact of the election on the judiciary. The outcome could potentially affect the balance of power and the independence of the judicial system.</p>

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D.

Scholten, a former congressional candidate and current pitcher for the Sioux City Explorers, plans to focus on issues such as President Trump's trade policy and its impact on Iowa farmers.

          <p>Following recent solar storms, the northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S., including Alaska, Washington, Montana, and other northern states. The sun's current active phase in its 11-year cycle makes these light displays more common and widespread. Experts recommend finding a quiet, dark area away from city lights to view the auroras, and checking weather forecasts for cloud cover. Auroras, also known as the northern and southern lights, occur when charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere.</p>

The official emphasized that Harvard was a top-performing team in the program, which helps the Defense Department stay informed about emergency biological threats. Harvard's lawyers claim that the White House directed the abrupt freezing of over $2 billion in federal funds to the university's research programs, violating federal law. Harvard is challenging the termination, arguing it disrupts critical research projects and sensitive equipment would degrade.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. The men, who avoided prison time but faced restitution and felony convictions, spotted the line off Jupiter Inlet in August 2020 and believed it was illegal. Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, arguing the line belonged to a licensed fisherman. The pardons erase the convictions, allowing the men to vote, own firearms, and travel freely outside the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for using law enforcement to target Congress, as seen in recent incidents involving a Nadler aide and a DHS facility inspection. Critics argue that these actions represent an attack on Congress's independence and powers, compounded by the White House's efforts to seize control over regulatory agencies. Congress has been largely feckless in pushing back, raising concerns about the balance of power between the branches. The situation is exacerbated by partisan polarization, with Republicans prioritizing loyalty to Trump over defending congressional authority.</p>
