          <h2>Los Angeles Grapples with Protests Following Immigration Raids and National Guard Deployment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 23:58:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests after immigration raids led to clashes between protesters and law enforcement, prompting President Trump to deploy the National Guard. The demonstrations began in response to ICE raids targeting Latino communities, resulting in property damage, freeway blockades, and reports of looting. Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard, circumventing the governor's approval, has sparked political controversy and legal challenges. The National Guard's role is to protect federal agents and property, while local police continue to manage regular policing duties, and the situation has raised concerns about states' rights and federal overreach, with the city remaining on edge as tensions continue to rise. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing unrest and political divisions.</p>

          <p>A Texas man, Justin Anthony Banta, faces murder charges for allegedly slipping an abortion drug into his pregnant girlfriend's drink without her knowledge. The woman, approximately six weeks pregnant, experienced heavy bleeding after meeting Banta at a coffee shop, leading to the loss of her baby days later. Banta is also charged with tampering with physical evidence after deleting crucial information from his mobile phone. The case is unfolding against the backdrop of Texas's restrictive abortion laws, which ban all abortions except in dire medical circumstances and carry civil and criminal penalties for those who perform abortions, intensifying the legal and ethical complexities surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is deploying school police to create safe zones around campuses and graduation events in response to recent immigration raids. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho announced the measure to protect students, employees, and families from federal immigration agents. This decision follows widespread immigration raids and clashes between police and protesters, including an incident at a Home Depot near Huntington Park High School. Carvalho emphasized the district's commitment to providing a safe and accessible education for all students, regardless of immigration status, and the district is prepared for potential standoffs with federal officers lacking judicial warrants, while also respecting students' right to protest safely.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized President Trump's deployment of additional troops to Los Angeles as a 'deranged fantasy,' as protests against immigration raids continue. The deployment includes 700 US Marines and doubles the National Guard presence to 4,000, prompting Newsom to sue the administration for acting without the governor's permission. Protests have spread to other US cities, with clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement in Los Angeles resulting in arrests and the use of less-than-lethal rounds. Trump defended his actions, claiming they prevented the city from 'burning down,' while Newsom denounced the troop deployment as a step toward authoritarianism, highlighting the escalating tensions between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>The Marines and National Guard personnel deployed to Los Angeles amidst protests will operate under specific rules of force, primarily tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel. Troops will not engage crowds unless necessary, and their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition, though they will carry ammunition for self-defense. These rules emphasize de-escalation, and officials noted that the rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done. The Los Angeles Police Department has expressed concerns about coordination and communication with federal forces, highlighting the complexities of managing large-scale demonstrations.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, aiming to curb elevated rice prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the move, which will leave the country with a 100,000-ton rice reserve. The released rice will be directed to smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers, and the government expects the cheaper rice to lower overall prices. The decision follows previous releases and aims to address rice prices that have doubled compared to last year, impacting consumers and the agricultural sector.</p>

However, critics like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C argue that ministers have not been transparent about the project's full cost, and the investment is a major step in the UK's energy transition.</p>
