        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate a sharp fall in UK retail sales for May, primarily driven by a "dismal" performance in supermarkets. Sales volumes experienced a 2.7% decrease, marking the most significant monthly drop since December 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS also noted indications of reduced alcohol and tobacco sales as consumers opted for spending cutbacks. Separate data from the ONS revealed an increase in government borrowing, reaching the second-highest level for May since records began in 1993, reflecting the impact of inflation-linked benefit uplifts and increased spending exceeding revenue gains.

          <p>The UK is currently experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to exceed 30C for a second consecutive day. Hot and dry conditions are predicted to persist across the country, with central England potentially reaching highs of 32C. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, effective until Monday, warning of potential impacts on health and social care services, including increased mortality among vulnerable populations. While temperatures are record-breaking for 2025, they remain below the June peak of 35.6C recorded in 1976.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom expressed disappointment with the Ninth Circuit Court's decision to allow President Trump to retain control of the California National Guard, deployed to Los Angeles to quell riots during demonstrations against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Despite this, Newsom highlighted a portion of the ruling that rejected Trump's claim of unchecked authority over the National Guard, asserting that the President is not above the law. Newsom's office stated that he and Attorney General Rob Bonta remain committed to holding the president accountable for using the military as domestic law enforcement, which they argue violates federal law. The court acknowledged Trump's failure to notify the governor before deploying the National Guard as required by law, but cited that Newsom had no power to veto the presidentâ€™s order.</p>

China asserts that the Philippine actions violate its sovereignty and international law, while Manila has not yet commented on the incident.

          <p>A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump can continue to control National Guard troops in Los Angeles, despite objections from California's governor. The unanimous ruling stated that Trump's failure to issue the federalization order directly through the Governor of California does not limit his authority to call up the National Guard. The court found that the Trump administration presented a defensible rationale for deploying the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property. Governor Newsom criticized Trump's decision to send troops to LA to quell anti-immigration protests, calling it an authoritarian move.</p>

These "oversimplified" measures have complicated understanding of the regulations, derailing their original intention and bringing "unnecessary shocks to the catering industry".</p>

          <p>A family's dream holiday in Cancun, Mexico, was disrupted by a shoot-out at their hotel, the Riu Palace Costa Mujeres, leaving them traumatized. Colin Nulty and his wife were by the pool when they heard gunshots and had to dive for cover, while their daughter was in their room, terrified. The shooting resulted in one death, and the hotel went into lockdown, with armed officers searching for the gunmen. The family was later transferred to another hotel, but they encountered news of another shooting there, causing them to return to the Riu Palace.</p>

          <p>Brazilian women face significant barriers to accessing legal abortions, even in cases of sexual assault, despite the law permitting it. A 27-year-old woman who became pregnant after being sexually assaulted was denied access to a legal abortion at a hospital due to the requirement of a police report, which is not legally mandated. Instead, she resorted to a home abortion with medication, experiencing severe pain and fear. Advocates cite factors such as a lack of facilities, disparities in clinic protocols, and resistance from medical personnel due to religious or moral convictions as obstacles to accessing legal abortions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump did not commemorate Juneteenth this year, despite honoring the holiday in his first four years as president, even before it became a federal holiday. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that she was not tracking Trump's signature on a proclamation for the day. This silence contrasts with Trump's previous acknowledgements of Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. In the evening, Trump complained about "too many non-working holidays" and said it is "costing our Country $BILLIONS OF DOLLARS to keep all of these businesses closed."</p>

Defense and space companies are vying for a share of the project, particularly after Elon Musk's recent public feud with Trump.

The low-cost coating was tested on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, effectively delaying rot by almost a week or more at a cost of just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. This new strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to a major factor in global food waste.</p>
