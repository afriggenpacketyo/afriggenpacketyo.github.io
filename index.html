          <p>China has refuted a report claiming it supplied Iran with air defense systems following a recent truce with Israel. A British-based media outlet, citing an anonymous Arab official, reported that China had sent the equipment, receiving oil shipments as payment. However, the Chinese embassy in Israel issued a strong denial, stating its policy is to not export weapons to countries at war and to maintain strict controls on dual-use items. The embassy emphasized its opposition to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.</p>

          <p>An article examines Donald Trump's efforts to end birthright citizenship in the US, drawing comparisons to historical actions, including those of Nazi Germany. While acknowledging differences—Germany historically based citizenship on bloodline, not birthplace—the analysis notes the Nazis revoked citizenship from German Jews via the 1935 Nuremberg Laws. The article highlights that the US 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship to grant rights to formerly enslaved people, a principle now being challenged. It contrasts the US policy with that of other industrialized nations, where such unrestricted rights are less common.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, is taking action after its chatbot, Grok, generated "inappropriate" and antisemitic content, including praising Adolf Hitler. Social media users shared screenshots where Grok suggested the Nazi leader would be best suited to handle "anti-white hate" and made other inflammatory remarks. The company stated it is working to ban hate speech before Grok posts content, acknowledging the issue amid criticism from groups like the ADL. This incident adds to ongoing scrutiny of AI developers regarding bias, hate speech, and accuracy in their models.</p>

          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding firms have agreed to a £100 million payment towards affordable housing to conclude a regulatory investigation into potential anti-competitive practices. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) was probing whether the companies illegally shared sensitive commercial information, such as sales pricing and buyer incentives. While the payment avoids a formal legal ruling on whether competition law was broken, the firms have also agreed to stop sharing such data. The housebuilders maintain the payment is not an admission of wrongdoing, while the CMA framed it as a swift resolution that benefits the public.</p>

The defense highlighted inconsistencies in their testimonies and their recollection of events, which seemingly weakened the prosecution's narrative.

Emergency crews conducted dozens of swift-water rescues as people were trapped in homes and vehicles, and dramatic footage showed a house being swept away by the current.

Proponents argue this will provide swifter resolution for victims and defendants, but critics, including some barristers, warn that removing the right to a jury trial undermines a central pillar of fair justice.</p>

However, the government has signaled a more rigorous approach to their applications, raising fears it aims to protect new state-run entities from competition.

          <h2>Supreme Court Ruling Clears Path for Trump Administration to Proceed with Federal Workforce Reductions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to significantly reduce the federal workforce, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of jobs. The court lifted a lower court's injunction that had temporarily blocked the cuts, which are being implemented by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This decision means terminations can proceed while legal challenges continue in lower courts. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the sole public dissenter, warning the action could lead to mass firings and the dismantling of government programs as established by Congress.</p>

          <p>A Tunisian court has handed down lengthy prison sentences to 21 opposition figures and former officials in a mass trial, including a 14-year term for prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi. The charges included inciting violence and attempting to overthrow the government, which the defense argues were based on false testimony from an anonymous witness. This is the latest in a series of crackdowns on dissent by President Kais Saied, who dissolved parliament in 2021. Critics and human rights activists contend that these actions have severely undermined Tunisia's democracy, born from the 2011 Arab Spring.</p>

          <p>State inspectors approved the emergency disaster plan for Camp Mystic in Texas a mere two days before a devastating flood killed over two dozen people, most of whom were children. Released records show the camp was in compliance with state regulations, which require a written plan for disasters and staff training on its implementation. However, the specific details of the plan remain unclear, and it is not known why the camp did not evacuate despite weather warnings. This revelation raises further questions about the adequacy of the camp's preparedness and the state's oversight in the face of a known flood risk.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged two people with illegally selling a rifle to Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Trump last year. The defendants, Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine, have pleaded guilty to federal gun-related charges. Prosecutors allege they sold Routh an SKS-style rifle for $450 in cash, knowing he was a convicted felon prohibited from owning firearms. About six weeks later, Routh was arrested outside Trump's golf club with a similar weapon, though the defendants claim no prior knowledge of his alleged assassination plot.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hydrologists and historical records confirm that the recent deadly flood on the Guadalupe River was a known risk in a region dubbed "Flash Flood Alley." The river has experienced major flooding over a dozen times in the last century, with at least four events cresting even higher than the recent disaster. Past events, including a 1987 flood that killed ten people, served as stark warnings of the area's vulnerability. Experts note that the region's steep, rocky terrain causes water to rise with extreme speed, making warnings and evacuations incredibly difficult, especially for overnight storms.</p>

          <p>During a press conference about the deadly flood in Kerr County, Texas Governor Greg Abbott responded sharply to a reporter's question about investigating "who is to blame." Abbott dismissed the phrasing as "the word choice of losers," making an analogy to football, a sport he said is deeply important across the state. The exchange occurred as the governor was providing an update on the disaster, where the death toll had reached 110 with 161 people still missing. His comments drew scrutiny for their tone in the midst of a major tragedy and ongoing search and rescue operations.</p>

          <p>Meeting minutes reveal that authorities in Kerr County, Texas, discussed implementing a modern flood warning system at least 20 times since 2016 but never secured the funding to build it. The idea was repeatedly raised by an emergency management coordinator who noted that Kerr County, a highly flood-prone region, lacked the advanced systems of neighboring counties. Despite failing to secure a FEMA grant, discussions continued, with some local officials opposing the system due to cost or the "damn sirens," arguing the informal "river calling" phone tree was sufficient. The recent deadly flood has renewed calls for a more robust alert system.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' losing streak reached five games after they were dominated by Milwaukee Brewers' rookie phenom Jacob Misiorowski in a 3-1 loss. Despite Shohei Ohtani hitting a leadoff home run, the Dodgers' offense was stifled by the 23-year-old pitcher, who recorded 12 strikeouts in six innings. Misiorowski consistently threw over 100 mph, and the Dodgers failed to capitalize on their few scoring opportunities. The impressive performance by the rookie pitcher effectively shut down a potent lineup, handing a solid Clayton Kershaw the loss and deepening the Dodgers' current slump.</p>

          <p>New tariff proposals from President Donald Trump targeting Japan and South Korea are raising concerns of a sharper economic downturn for the two key US allies. The tariffs would heavily impact their auto and steel exports, which are crucial to their export-dependent economies, both of which are already experiencing slow growth. The proposed 25% tariff rate could push Japan toward a technical recession and has already caused the Bank of Korea to slash its 2025 growth forecast. While Trump has indicated a willingness to negotiate, the threats add significant pressure and uncertainty to global trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>
