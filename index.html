          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting Japan's rice policy, as prices have roughly doubled from the previous year. Ishiba has signaled a willingness to overhaul Japan's decades-old production adjustment system, aiming to counter opposition parties that are pitching a populist policy of cutting the consumption tax. He is pursuing a more consumer-focused approach by releasing reserve rice under direct contracts with retailers in a bid to lower prices. Japan introduced the acreage reduction policy in the early 1970s to address rice overproduction caused by postwar mechanization. (not investment advice)</p>
