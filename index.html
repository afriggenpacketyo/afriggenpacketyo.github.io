          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility resulted in the deaths of three deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail. The incident, which occurred at the Biscailuz Center Training Academy, is the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. Early reports suggest the deputies were working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered from a separate location the previous day. Federal agencies, including the ATF and FBI, are assisting in the ongoing investigation to determine the exact cause of the tragic blast.</p>

          <p>Beijing is using the failed "Yaohan Longevity City" tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of wasteful grass-roots government mismanagement. Initially planned as a major health tourism hub with a 1.65 billion yuan investment, the project was abandoned after only 540 million yuan was spent, leaving multiple buildings derelict. China's disciplinary authorities condemned the project for being out of touch with reality and resulting in a severe waste of resources. The official who primarily backed the initiative has been expelled from the Communist Party for misappropriating funds.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Army Scientists Propose More Powerful 'X-Railgun' Design</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing electromagnetic weapon. The current naval railgun, first mounted on a ship in 2018, is limited by the weight of projectiles it can fire, making it less effective for sinking ships. The new design involves cross-stacking two railguns, which would increase bore pressure and allow it to fire heavier, 30kg shells at Mach 7. This development aims to overcome the power limitations that have hampered the military application of the technology.</p>

          <p>According to the Environment Agency, the number of serious water pollution incidents in England increased by 60% in 2024, reaching a record high. Water companies were responsible for 75 incidents that posed "serious or persistent" harm, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the main culprits. A cross-party committee of MPs described the situation as "woeful" and criticized regulators for being "missing in action." The report comes ahead of a landmark review that may recommend overhauling the water industry's regulatory body, Ofwat, to address systemic failures and underinvestment.</p>

          <p>A senior Russian lawmaker stated that the messaging app WhatsApp, owned by Meta, should prepare to leave the Russian market, citing national security concerns. Anton Gorelkin, a key figure on parliament's IT committee, suggested the app would likely be added to a list of restricted software, which could clear the way for a state-backed alternative called MAX. This move is part of Russia's broader effort to establish "digital sovereignty" and reduce reliance on platforms from "unfriendly countries." Facebook and Instagram are already banned in Russia, where Meta is designated an extremist organization.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's diagnosis with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild leg swelling, medical experts have explained the common condition. CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool and lead to swelling, aching, or heaviness. The condition affects about one in three U.S. adults and is often managed with lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise. The White House physician described the president's case as "benign and common" and stated he remains in "excellent health" with no signs of more serious cardiovascular issues.</p>

          <p>A Nashville judge has ordered Tennessee prison officials to deactivate a death-row inmate's implanted heart-regulating device just before his scheduled lethal injection. The ruling addresses concerns from attorneys for Byron Black, who argued the device could repeatedly and painfully shock him as the execution drug stops his heart. The order requires a certified medical professional to be on hand to disable the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator moments before the execution. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters, and his execution is scheduled for August 5th.</p>

          <p>At the direction of President Trump, the Department of Justice has filed a motion to unseal grand jury transcripts from the sex trafficking cases against Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. This move aims to quell a political firestorm among Trump's supporters, who were angered by the administration's previous announcement that no more files would be released. The request follows a controversial Wall Street Journal story about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein. A judge must approve the release, which would involve a lengthy process of redacting sensitive victim and witness information.</p>

The proposed hub would focus on attracting companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other frontier technologies, with the goal of "bringing R&D and manufacturing back together." While proponents tout the creation of tens of thousands of jobs, the project has faced skepticism from local residents and community groups.</p>

          <p>Following a warm and dry spring, the United Kingdom is experiencing a significant increase in its wasp population this summer, according to pest control experts and entomologists. While scientific data is still pending, anecdotal evidence points to a "good year for wasps," which thrive in such weather patterns. Experts note that while social wasps can be a nuisance, they are also vital apex predators that provide natural pest control. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them from picnics by leaving a small amount of a sugary substance nearby.</p>

The administration's recent handling of the files has angered some supporters who feel promises of transparency were broken.

          <p>A new theatrical comedy, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," has opened in Liverpool, reimagining the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a "Lord of the Rings"-style fantasy epic. Written by a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the show is a tongue-in-cheek homage that avoids targeting the couple, instead celebrating them as local heroes. The plot is loosely based on a 2004 tabloid myth about Coleen throwing away her engagement ring, merging the urban legend with a classic fantasy quest. The play is characteristic of the Royal Court theatre's focus on homegrown comedies relevant to its Liverpool audience.</p>

          <p>A new study has discovered a specific interaction between gut bacteria and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The research found that in individuals with a faulty version of a gene called OTUD3, a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria can over-activate an immune protein named STING, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and why treatments work inconsistently. The discovery opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies that could target this specific pathway rather than broadly suppressing the immune system.</p>
