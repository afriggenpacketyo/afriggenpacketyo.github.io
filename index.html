          <h2>Tech IPO Market Shows Signs of Recovery, Fueled by Strong Debuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 16:15:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a prolonged drought in the tech sector, the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market is displaying signs of a potential revival. This optimism is largely driven by the successful market debut of crypto company Circle, which saw its stock surge significantly, and the strong performance of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave. Venture capital firms, which have faced pressure to deliver returns to their investors, are cautiously optimistic about this trend. While major companies like SpaceX and Stripe remain private, the recent increase in IPO activity suggests a potential end to the liquidity challenges that have plagued the industry for over three years.

          <p>According to intelligence services from the Netherlands and Germany, Russia has intensified its use of prohibited chemical weapons against Ukrainian forces. The reports indicate that the use of substances like the WWI-era poison gas chloropicrin has become a standard tactic to force soldiers from their trenches. This practice violates the Chemical Weapons Convention, to which Russia is a signatory. Dutch officials have condemned these actions, calling for increased sanctions and highlighting the danger this normalization of chemical warfare poses to global security.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire, which started in the Los Padres National Forest, has rapidly expanded to become California's largest wildfire of the year, scorching over 70,800 acres. The blaze has prompted evacuation orders in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties and currently has minimal containment. Officials have deployed extensive air and ground resources to combat the fire, which is threatening at least 50 structures. The fire serves as a critical reminder of the state's ongoing wildfire danger, particularly as the holiday weekend approaches.</p>

          <p>Despite claims that new legislation eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security, the bill does not repeal the tax itself. Instead, it introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65 who fall within certain income thresholds, which can be applied to their total income. Policy experts clarify that while this provides relief for some, particularly higher-income seniors, it does not benefit low-income recipients who already pay no federal tax. The change is part of a larger budget package and is set to expire at the end of 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite facing bans on Pride events and a rise in hostile rhetoric from government officials, the LGBTQ+ community in Turkey continues to advocate for its existence and rights. The theme for this year's Pride Month, "Insisting on life," reflects this resilience. Activists and journalists report systematic attempts to erase their community, including the blocking of a major LGBTQ+ news portal and demonizing language from politicians. While arrests and repression are common, advocates point to a growing public acceptance and continue to push for legal protections against discrimination and hate crimes.</p>

          <p>On the Fourth of July holiday, many essential businesses and retailers will remain open, though some will operate on modified schedules. Major chains like Walmart will maintain regular hours, while stores such as Trader Joe's, Home Depot, and IKEA will close earlier than usual. Costco is one of the few major retailers that will be closed for the entire day. As expected for a federal holiday, all U.S. post offices and major banks will not be in operation, and the U.S. stock market will also be closed for trading.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has publicly denied claims made by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was mistakenly deported from the U.S. and incarcerated in the country's notorious CECOT supermax prison. Abrego Garcia alleged in a U.S. court filing that he was subjected to severe beatings and psychological torture during his detention. President Bukele responded on social media with photos and videos, claiming Abrego Garcia appeared well and was not mistreated. The case is part of a larger legal battle following his wrongful deportation under the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building has collapsed in Lyari, a densely populated neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan, resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries. Rescue operations are underway, but efforts are being hampered by narrow streets that prevent heavy machinery from accessing the site. Authorities confirmed at least seven deaths, with fears that more people remain trapped in the rubble of the building, which housed as many as 100 residents. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, where lax construction regulations and poor oversight often lead to structural failures.</p>

          <p>Sales of cars manufactured in China reached a new high in the United Kingdom, accounting for one in every ten new cars sold in June. This surge, which includes brands like MG, BYD, and Omoda, marks a significant increase from 6% a year ago. The growth is particularly notable as other Western countries have recently imposed steep tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports, a measure the UK has not yet adopted. The trend reflects the growing competitiveness and innovation of Chinese automakers, particularly in the electric vehicle sector, posing a challenge to the established industry.

Polling suggests such a party could capture up to 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and younger voters.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While competitive eating has grown as a sport, health experts warn of potential short-term and long-term risks associated with consuming massive quantities of food in a short time. Gastroenterologists note that the stomach can become permanently stretched, potentially impairing its ability to contract and empty properly. The massive intake of calories, sodium, and fat, such as from dozens of hot dogs, can cause immediate gastrointestinal distress and spike blood pressure. Though long-term effects are not well-studied, immediate dangers include choking, aspiration, and even tearing the esophagus.</p>
