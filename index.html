          <p>A terror attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, England, has left two members of the Jewish community dead and four others seriously injured. The incident occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, when a suspect drove a vehicle at people and then attacked them with a knife. The attacker, who was wearing what appeared to be an explosive vest, was shot and killed by police at the scene. Authorities have declared it a terrorist incident and are investigating, with two additional arrests having been made in connection to the attack.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction Finns themselves often find puzzling. According to the World Happiness Report, the ranking is based on life satisfaction rather than daily expressions of joy. Experts suggest Finnish contentment stems from a strong social fabric, high levels of trust, and robust public services like free libraries that provide universal opportunities. This societal structure, supported by high taxes that citizens willingly pay, combined with a deep connection to nature and traditions like saunas, fosters a sense of security and well-being.</p>

          <p>Actress Michelle Pfeiffer, 67, has revealed that becoming a grandmother last year has reignited her love for acting and changed her approach to her work. Speaking on a podcast, she explained that having a grandchild has made her want to be more present, freeing her from the deep, prolonged immersion she previously dedicated to her roles. Pfeiffer feels this more relaxed process has paradoxically made her a better actor. Currently juggling multiple projects, including a "Yellowstone" spinoff, she says she enjoys her craft more now than ever before and is grateful for the busy schedule.</p>

          <p>Baroness Anne Longfield, the former children's commissioner for England, has urged the UK government to issue a formal apology to children for "avoidable mistakes" made during the COVID-19 pandemic. Testifying at the UK Covid Inquiry, she argued that children were consistently overlooked, with establishments like pubs and shops reopening before schools. Longfield described a "chaotic" lack of planning for children's welfare and education, which contributed to significant damage to their mental health and development. The inquiry also heard that mental health conditions among young people increased from one in nine in 2017 to one in six in 2020.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a post-tropical storm after lashing Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane with powerful winds and heavy rain. The worst of the storm has passed the archipelago, and forecasters expect the system to continue weakening as it moves further into the Atlantic Ocean. While a hurricane warning was dropped, a tropical storm warning remained in effect for the islands early Thursday. The National Hurricane Center noted that swells generated by Imelda and the remnants of Hurricane Humberto are still likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>For the nearly one million foreign residents in Taiwan, including many Filipino migrant workers, the increasing threat of an attack from mainland China presents a daunting challenge. Despite earning better wages than they could at home, these workers live with the constant fear of being caught in a geopolitical conflict. Many feel they have no choice but to remain in Taiwan even if a conflict erupts, as they question their ability to survive financially back in their home countries. Their situation is compounded by the fact that they often face precarious legal protections and potential abuse, leaving them vulnerable in a crisis.</p>

          <p>Disney's public image has fallen to a multi-year low among both Democrats and Republicans following the controversy surrounding late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. The company's decision to briefly pull Kimmel's show off the air after his comments about a conservative activist, and then reinstate him, managed to alienate both sides of the political spectrum. According to investment bank Jefferies, sentiment for both the parent company and its Disney+ streaming service soured significantly, with Democrats showing an even stronger decline in approval than Republicans. Despite the public relations damage, analysts believe the impact on streaming subscriber numbers may be limited.</p>

While some economic activity may recover after the government reopens, past shutdowns have resulted in permanent losses, such as the $11 billion cost from the 2018-2019 shutdown.

The coroner stated that conventional treatment would have offered an 80% chance of a cure and that the influence exerted on Paloma was "incomprehensible."

While the issue was not on the formal agenda of a recent FIFA council meeting, Infantino emphasized football's role in promoting peace and unity. The U.S. administration has vowed to oppose any efforts to block Israel's participation in the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's recent order to declassify records, the enduring mystery of Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance is rooted more in public appetite for conspiracy than in evidence. The article argues that the most credible explanation remains that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific. It details how myths of her being a spy captured by the Japanese were fueled by wartime propaganda and financially motivated efforts, including from her own husband. The piece contends that focusing on these hoaxes obscures her true legacy as a pioneering aviator who championed women's roles in fields dominated by men.</p>

          <p>With gold prices reaching multiple record highs in 2025, investors are questioning whether it remains a smart investment. The surge is attributed to global uncertainty and strong central bank purchasing, with some analysts predicting prices could climb even higher. Persistent inflation, which erodes the value of cash, strengthens the case for gold as a traditional hedge. Furthermore, in a volatile economic landscape marked by geopolitical tensions and the current government shutdown, physical gold can serve as a key diversification tool and a safe-haven asset in a portfolio.

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, in a cash deal valued at $9.7 billion. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and utilizes some of the nearly $344 billion in cash the conglomerate currently holds. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO says will allow the company to restart its stock buyback program. Berkshire Hathaway already owns a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum, and the deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the common misconception known as "low-price bias," where investors mistakenly believe a low-priced stock has greater upside than a high-priced one. It argues that a company's underlying value, growth prospects, and fundamentals are far more critical than its nominal share price. Using the example of choosing between International Paper and a much higher-priced Nvidia in late 2023, the article demonstrates how focusing on valuation over share price would have yielded significantly higher returns. The piece emphasizes that investors must recognize and correct for such cognitive biases to make sound decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the S&P 500 approaches all-time highs, some financial experts are advising investors to reconsider the passive "set-it-and-forget-it" investment strategy. They argue that the index's market-cap-weighted nature has led to heavy concentration in a few large technology stocks, reducing its diversification benefits and increasing volatility risk. Instead of relying solely on S&P 500 funds, advisors suggest alternatives like total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weight S&P 500 funds. The goal is to build a more balanced portfolio that can better withstand periods of underperformance in large-cap equities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>PepsiCo is accelerating its transition to natural colorants for its food and beverage products in response to growing consumer rejection of artificial dyes. The company, which makes Gatorade, Cheetos, and Mountain Dew, aims to replace synthetic colors in about 40% of its U.S. product line. The process is complex, requiring years of research to find stable, flavor-neutral natural alternatives like paprika, turmeric, and purple sweet potatoes. Tostitos and Lay's will be among the first brands to complete the shift, as PepsiCo balances the demand for natural ingredients with consumers' expectations for the familiar appearance of its iconic products.</p>

          <p>German Unity Day, celebrated on October 3rd, commemorates the formal reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. This date was chosen over November 9th, the day the Berlin Wall fell, to avoid conflicting with the solemn anniversary of the 1938 Nazi pogroms. The holiday marks the end of four decades of division that began after World War II. While official celebrations are held, the day is generally observed quietly by most Germans, and recent polls suggest that a sense of division still persists, particularly regarding economic disparities between the former East and West.</p>

The firm, which launched a dollar-pegged stablecoin called USD1, has drawn scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers due to its ties to the president's family and a revenue-sharing agreement.
