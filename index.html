          <p>A former people smuggler, identified as Nick, revealed to the BBC how he transported Vietnamese migrants into the UK via yachts, exploiting the lack of security in private marinas. Nick, a former British soldier convicted in 2019, described the routes as "easy" and "low risk," claiming similar methods are still used. He transported migrants by yacht into private marinas in seaside towns across south-east England. He also described smuggling Albanians in cars onto ferries, where they would then jump into lorries mid-journey in the English Channel. Nick stated he spoke out because he was angry that he was jailed for a crime that was still very possible to commit.</p>

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan's representative office, relocating it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, signaling deepening ties with Beijing. The office had been maintained since Nelson Mandela's administration cut formal ties with Taipei in 1998. Meanwhile, Somalia has banned Taiwanese passport holders, seen as retaliation for Taiwan's growing relations with Somaliland. Experts note that Taiwan's decreasing presence in Africa underscores a growing alignment between African nations and China, driven by strong economic ties. Taiwan's only official diplomatic ally in Africa is eSwatini, and only a limited number of countries host commercial or trade offices for the island.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to combat soaring prices. The reserve rice is expected to reach store shelves as early as June, addressing criticism of the government's failure to curb price spikes. Koizumi intends to bypass auctions to control prices, with potential online sales being explored. The move aims to alleviate the burden on households facing inflation outpacing wage growth, though analysts remain uncertain about its overall impact on rice prices.</p>

          <p>An article in The Guardian discusses Germany's selective approach to acknowledging its Nazi past, embracing it when it flatters the country's self-image but ignoring it when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. The Herbert Quandt Media Prize, named after an early SS supporter, highlights this contradiction, as journalists continue to accept the award despite Quandt's role in the Nazi war economy. The article points to a broader German refusal to confront the depths of societal entanglement with state violence and genocide, with wealthy families building empires on Nazi collaboration and forced labor.</p>

Businesses in Qatar are interested in using the yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), via tools available in Hong Kong, including settlement, payment, hedging, and swaps. This trend reflects a broader effort by countries and businesses to diversify from the US dollar due to trade wars, aligning with China's strategy to mitigate risks and assert financial independence.

          <p>Supermarket operators in Japan are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with alternatives amid rising domestic rice prices. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a lower price compared to Japanese-grown rice. Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The move reflects consumer interest in more affordable options, as the average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached record levels due to a poor harvest and increased demand.</p>

          <p>With the UK set to ban disposable vapes from June 1, many vapers are stockpiling in anticipation of the change. Concerns range from the inconvenience of rechargeable devices to worries about taste differences and potential returns to smoking. Retailers have seen sales surge, with some customers buying large quantities of their preferred flavors. While the ban aims to reduce environmental impact and youth vaping, some argue it may negatively affect ex-smokers who rely on disposable vapes. One retailer is worried about the future of his business, as 90% of his sales are disposable vapes.</p>

Priorities for Reform UK include reversing net zero initiatives and challenging diversity and inclusion policies, though some services are statutory, meaning a council has to provide them by law, and they make up a significant proportion of the council's budget.</p>

          <p>Karan Kandhari's "Sister Midnight" is a gritty, rock-infused comedy about a young housewife's urban malaise in Mumbai. The film follows Uma, an arranged-marriage transplant, as she navigates a joyless existence and discovers a hidden strength through solo walks and odd encounters. Kandhari captures a liminal space in Uma's alternative existence, using stylish visuals and a punk energy. The movie eventually embraces some gnarlier elements and it is a mischievously off-the-wall exercise with a certain steam to keep up its deadpan wildness.</p>

          <p>Investigators are examining whether foggy conditions and technical glitches at a San Diego airport may have played a role in a fatal plane crash. A Cessna 550 crashed early Thursday into a residential neighborhood, burning cars and destroying at least one home. The airport, a small regional airport with three runways, was experiencing two separate issues at the time of the crash, Mr Baker said. The Automated Surface Observing Station, which provides weather data to pilots, was "inoperative at the time of the accident due to an unrelated power surge" and one of the runways had experienced an issue with the lighting system that guides landing planes.</p>

          <h2>DOGE Cuts to Weather Balloon Sites Leave U.S. Without Crucial Data, Some Meteorologists Say</h2>

          <p>Cuts to National Weather Service balloon sites are leaving meteorologists without crucial data, potentially impacting forecast accuracy. At least 13 of nearly 100 balloon sites were cut or reduced when the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, took aim at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration earlier this year. The cuts have left gaps in data collection, which some meteorologists say impacted forecasting of the March ice storm in Michigan. Meteorologists say there is no substitute to weather balloons. An open letter published earlier this month, five living former NWS leaders issued a warning about the impact of staffing and program cuts to the NOAA.</p>
