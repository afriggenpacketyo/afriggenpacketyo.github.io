            <p>Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, alleged to be a top MS-13 leader, is requesting a delay in the dismissal of his federal firearm possession case. Despite the Justice Department's motion to dismiss in favor of deportation, Villatoro Santos fears immediate deportation to El Salvador's CECOT prison without due process. His attorney argues that the government's actions and public pronouncements create a substantial risk of unlawful deportation and detention in harsh conditions. Villatoro Santos was arrested in Virginia following a publicized raid, with Attorney General Pam Bondi asserting his leadership role in MS-13 and imminent removal from the country.</p>

            <p>Amidst an escalating tariff war between Beijing and Washington, observers suggest that diplomatic backchannels could play a crucial role in de-escalating tensions. President Trump's announcement of increased tariffs on Chinese imports contrasts with his signaling that he doesn't anticipate further increases. Trump expressed that China desires a deal but is unsure how to proceed, highlighting the potential for backchannel diplomacy to bridge the gap. This situation underscores the complex dynamics of the trade relationship and the need for nuanced diplomatic approaches to resolve the conflict.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices have declined for the second consecutive month, while producer price deflation has deepened, signaling rising deflationary pressures amidst an escalating trade war with the U.S. Chinese exporters are bracing for increased strain as the U.S. raises tariffs on Chinese imports. Despite these challenges, core inflation has shown signs of recovery, and Chinese policymakers are implementing stimulus measures to boost domestic consumption. Economists anticipate a divergence between consumer and producer prices, with the latter expected to deteriorate further due to trade disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

Superintendent Alberto Carvalho emphasized that schools are places of protection and knowledge, and that fear and threat will be met with courage and determination.

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries, but significantly increased tariffs on China to 125%. This decision follows days of market turmoil and warnings of recession, marking a shift in Trump's trade strategy. The move signals a renewed focus on the US-China trade relationship and the unfinished business of Trump's first term, aiming to reshape the global trade system centered on China. Trump justified the pause by stating that other countries were getting "yippy," while the increase on China was due to their "lack of respect" in retaliating with tariffs.</p>

            <p>A UK parliamentary committee is calling for a 5% levy on streaming services' UK subscriber revenue to fund British high-end TV production. The committee's report emphasizes the importance of supporting independent British producers and safeguarding distinctly British content. The move aims to address concerns that inward investment from streamers like Netflix and Amazon is crowding out domestic production. Industry groups express concerns that a levy could damage streamers' investment in the UK and raise costs for consumers.</p>

            <p>Retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, former national security advisor, received an unexpected phone call from President Trump, who intended to call South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. Trump, unaware he was speaking to his former aide, launched into a scathing critique. The incident highlights the strained relationship between Trump and McMaster, who has been critical of Trump's views on Putin. A White House official criticized McMaster, while McMaster declined to comment. The call occurred shortly before another incident involving sensitive information being shared in a group chat.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices have fallen as US President Donald Trump increases tariffs on Chinese goods. The national consumer price index (CPI) dropped 0.1 per cent year on year last month, reflecting continued deflationary pressure on the Chinese economy. The trade war is likely to intensify the downward pressure on prices, with a decline in American demand leaving Chinese producers with unsold inventory. The Chinese government is expected to launch a stimulus to boost domestic demand amid the escalating trade war.</p>

High tides may carry fire debris into the ocean, posing a potential hazard, particularly near burned properties along the Pacific Coast Highway.</p>

The judge found that Newsmax aired segments with inaccurate information that would likely cause viewers to think less favorably of Dominion. The ruling is another win for Dominion, following a $787.5 million settlement with Fox News over similar claims. Newsmax maintains it covered the issue fairly and will defend itself vigorously at trial. The company faces a $1.6 billion lawsuit from Dominion and a June deadline for a settlement with Smartmatic USA.</p>
