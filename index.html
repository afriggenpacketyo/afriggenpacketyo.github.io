            <p>The U.S. military detected and tracked Russian military aircraft entering the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) off Alaska on Monday. The ADIZ extends 150 miles from U.S. territory, requiring aircraft to identify themselves. NORAD stated that this type of Russian activity in the Alaskan ADIZ is routine and not considered a threat, emphasizing that the aircraft did not enter U.S. or Canadian airspace. There was no NORAD intercept, but the aircraft were tracked as they flew through the ADIZ.</p>

            <p>The BBC smuggled phones into el-Fasher, a city under siege in Darfur, Sudan, to reveal the hunger and fear experienced by residents. The city has been largely cut off from the outside world for a year due to the ongoing civil war. Residents describe relentless shelling, lack of clean water, and the constant threat of violence. The UN has warned of famine in the city, and many fear ethnic violence if the city falls to the RSF.</p>

            <p>Nissan will reduce production of its Rogue SUV at its Kyushu plant in Japan from May to July in response to new U.S. import tariffs. The planned cut is equivalent to more than a fifth of the Rogues sold in the U.S. in the first three months of the year. Workers at the plant will work fewer hours, and production will be halted on some days. The automaker will reassess the production situation depending on the outlook for tariffs.

            <p>A team of Chinese scientists has uncovered a mechanism by which breast cancer cells use the amino acid arginine to evade the immune system and multiply. Their findings could lead to new precision therapies that target tumors by depriving them of this essential building block for protein. The researchers revealed that the metabolic interplay between cancer cells and macrophages plays a dominant role in arginine-driven breast cancer progression. Macrophages are white blood cells that help clear out dead cells and stimulate other cells involved in immune function.</p>
