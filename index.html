          <h2>FBI Agents Fired for Kneeling at George Floyd Protest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 21:38:08 EDT</div>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired approximately 20 agents who were photographed kneeling at a civil rights protest in Washington, D.C., in June 2020, following the death of George Floyd. Many of these individuals were stationed at the FBI's Washington Field Office at the time, and their participation sparked internal review. Sources familiar with the situation indicate that while some agents faced earlier reassignments, their ultimate dismissal underscores the FBI's strict policies regarding employee involvement in public demonstrations. This development highlights the complex balance between individual civil liberties and the conduct expectations for federal law enforcement personnel, particularly in politically charged environments. The FBI has officially declined to provide a comment on these personnel decisions.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted three women—Cynthia Raygoza, Ashleigh Brown, and Sandra Carmona Samane—for allegedly pursuing a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent from his Los Angeles workplace to his residence. The indictment states they livestreamed the chase on Instagram, directed viewers to share the feed, and then posted the agent's home address online, shouting slogans to neighbors. This action, which prosecutors condemn as deeply offensive to law enforcement, resulted in charges of conspiracy and publicly disclosing a federal agent's personal information. The incident highlights the escalating confrontational tactics employed by some activists against immigration authorities, drawing parallels to a recent fatal attack on an ICE facility in Dallas. If convicted, each woman could face up to five years in federal prison per count.</p>

          <p>The latest Turner Prize exhibition, held at Cartwright Hall in Bradford, showcases diverse installations from its four nominated artists: Nnena Kalu, Mohammed Sami, Zadie Xa, and Rene Matić. Rene Matić, one of the youngest nominees, delves into contemporary British identity through a collection of photos, banners, and dolls, exploring themes of belonging and hypocrisy. Canadian-Korean artist Zadie Xa invites visitors into an ethereal fantasy kingdom with reflective floors, patchwork paintings, and shell arrangements, creating a sensually alluring experience. Nnena Kalu, a learning-disabled artist, contributes vibrant, layered sculptures and swirling paper patterns, embodying intense energy. Finally, Baghdad-born Mohammed Sami presents powerful, large-scale paintings depicting haunting war zones, evoking destruction's aftermath without explicit human presence, drawing significant critical praise.</p>

          <p>Rafie Ollah Shouhed, a 79-year-old U.S. citizen and car wash owner, has filed a $50 million claim against the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The claim alleges that federal agents used excessive force and disregarded his medical condition during a September raid at his Van Nuys business, violating his civil and constitutional rights. Surveillance footage shows Shouhed being body-slammed after attempting to communicate with agents who were pursuing his workers. His attorney contends Shouhed was trying to inform agents about his employees' legal work status, not impede them, and that agents ignored requests for medical attention for his client, who had recently undergone heart surgery. This case highlights ongoing debates about ICE's operational tactics and accountability for alleged misconduct.</p>

          <p>Following the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, Donald Trump publicly declared his expectation for more of his perceived political enemies to face criminal charges, labeling them "corrupt radical left Democrats." Trump's blunt statements amplify concerns that his administration is weaponizing the Justice Department to pursue cases against his adversaries, even when evidence is considered weak, as reportedly seen in the Comey case. He has recently fixated on potential investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, both of whom have challenged him. This situation highlights a perilous moment for the independence of the justice system, with critics fearing an emboldened pursuit of politically motivated prosecutions.</p>

          <p>A transcript reveals U.S. Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala expressed confusion and surprise regarding the handling of James Comey's indictment, particularly when presented with two inconsistent versions of the document. The newly appointed interim U.S. Attorney, Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump personal lawyer, initially claimed she hadn't seen one version, despite it bearing her signature. The grand jury had declined one of three proposed counts, barely reaching the threshold for the other two. This unusual process, coupled with Halligan's recent appointment after the previous U.S. Attorney's resignation amid political pressure, raises significant questions about the integrity and political influence surrounding the high-profile case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative three-day operation across Greater Boston, involving the U.S. Secret Service and local and state law enforcement, successfully recovered 16 illegal skimming devices. Investigators inspected 700 businesses, including ATMs, gas pumps, and point-of-sale terminals, between September 23-25. This proactive effort is estimated to have prevented approximately $16.7 million in potential financial losses from card fraud. Skimming devices are used by thieves to steal sensitive card information, enabling them to create fraudulent clone cards. Authorities have urged consumers to remain vigilant by inspecting card readers for irregularities, utilizing tap-to-pay or chip technology, and shielding PINs, particularly in vulnerable locations like tourist areas. This ongoing initiative underscores the importance of public awareness in combating sophisticated financial crime.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Health has issued a health alert following the detection of harmful blue-green algae cyanotoxins in the St. Johns River near Mandarin Point. A water sample collected on September 23 confirmed the presence of these toxins, which are produced by a type of bacteria prevalent in Florida's freshwater systems. Exposure can lead to skin rashes, while ingesting large amounts may cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, or, in severe cases, acute liver failure. Consequently, the DOH strongly advises against any recreational water activities, such as swimming, drinking, or boating, near visible algae blooms. Furthermore, pets and livestock should be kept away from the water, though consumption of thoroughly cooked healthy fish from the area is deemed safe, unlike shellfish.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut, "Eleanor the Great," features June Squibb as Eleanor, a 95-year-old who invents a past as a Holocaust survivor after moving to New York and joining a support group. This initial deception, born from loneliness after her best friend's death, escalates when a journalism student, Nina, decides to profile her, forging a friendship based on the fabricated story. Despite a largely predictable narrative and somewhat tentative direction, Squibb's "warm, humorous, and slightly spiky" performance is lauded for elevating the material. The film explores themes of grief and the desperate human need for connection, even if built on untruths, ultimately relying on Squibb's endearing presence to navigate its morally complex premise.</p>

García-Hernandez, an undocumented house painter and father of four, sustained multiple serious gunshot wounds, prompting his family to launch a GoFundMe campaign for support.

Gemma Botting, whose husband Matt was diagnosed with the fatal neurodegenerative condition, expressed immense relief, stating it felt "like winning the lottery 10 times over." Until now, there has been no effective treatment for Huntington's, which manifests with symptoms akin to dementia, Parkinson's, and motor neurone disease. While the therapy, developed by uniQure, still needs to navigate regulatory approvals in the US and UK, and its cost will be substantial, its potential impact is considered revolutionary.

School officials expressed dismay, highlighting Roberts' integral role in the community, while ICE officials questioned his hiring given his immigration status and prior weapons charge.

However, the advanced state of decomposition prevented a conclusive autopsy to determine how he died. Decker, a 32-year-old former Army soldier with extensive survival skills, was accused of the May murders of Paityn, Evelyn, and Olivia, aged 9, 8, and 5, whose bodies were discovered bound and suffocated.

TV architect George Clarke highlights a shift in public and professional opinion, noting the King's early critiques of "monstrous carbuncles" are now widely accepted.

The pharmaceutical tariff includes an exemption for companies that establish manufacturing plants within the U.S., which analysts believe may mitigate some of the impact on drug prices. Trump asserts these tariffs are necessary to protect American industries and for national security, arguing against unfair foreign competition. However, critics and recent economic data suggest that such duties could lead to higher consumer prices and have not consistently generated the promised domestic job growth.

The National Weather Service reported at least 2,000 strikes across the region, from the Channel Islands to the Central Coast, attributed to a low-pressure system retaining moisture. The Bay Area recorded an even higher count, with over 13,000 total lightning strikes. Forecasters anticipate a weak low-pressure system will continue to move through Southern California this weekend, bringing further thunderstorms, strong winds, and isolated showers, particularly to interior valleys and mountains.

          <p>Los Angeles Comic Con is launching the "Stan Lee Experience," featuring an AI-powered holographic avatar of the late comic book icon, designed to interact with attendees. Developed by Proto Inc. and Hyperreal, the avatar processes fan questions and generates responses by drawing from a vast dataset of Lee's footage, conversations, and writings, including his "Stan's Soapbox" columns. Developers describe it as a "large language model with guardrails," ensuring its responses remain within the "Stan Lee Universe" and avoid unrelated topics like sports or politics. This innovative project seeks to preserve and expand Lee's enduring legacy, offering a unique, interactive gateway into the world of characters and stories he co-created, with potential future applications in education and healthcare.</p>

          <h2>Former FBI Director James Comey Indicted on Two Charges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted on two federal charges: making false statements to Congress and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from his September 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he allegedly lied about authorizing an anonymous leak to the media concerning an FBI investigation related to Hillary Clinton. President Donald Trump, who has consistently called for Comey's prosecution, publicly welcomed the indictment, fueling concerns about political influence within the Justice Department. Comey, who has declared his innocence, is set for arraignment on October 9 in Alexandria, Virginia, and could face up to five years in prison if convicted. This case marks a significant and politically charged prosecution during Trump's second term.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump publicly demanded that Microsoft terminate Lisa Monaco, the company's president of global affairs, who previously served as Deputy Attorney General in the Biden administration. Trump's post on Truth Social accused Monaco of being a "menace to U.S. National Security," asserting that her security clearances were revoked and access to national security intelligence was banned. This demand, made just after the indictment of James Comey, raises further concerns about political pressure on private sector figures. Microsoft, which holds major contracts with the U.S. government, declined to comment on the president's call. The situation highlights the intersection of politics, corporate affairs, and national security, especially given Microsoft's recent decision to cut cloud services to an Israeli military unit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has, by a 6-3 ideological vote, granted the Trump administration the authority to continue withholding over $4 billion in foreign aid that had been approved by Congress. This ruling overturns a lower federal court's order for the funds to be released, with the conservative majority emphasizing the President's foreign policy prerogatives and suggesting that the suing international aid groups lacked standing. Justice Elena Kagan, in a dissenting opinion, strongly criticized the Court's use of the emergency docket, highlighting the lack of thorough deliberation. President Trump employed a rare "pocket rescission" authority, a mechanism not utilized since the 1970s, to bypass the usual 45-day congressional review period for rescinding appropriated funds, raising constitutional questions about executive power.

Cramer conveyed apprehension regarding the economy's disparate performance, noting an overheating data center sector alongside struggling auto, housing, and retail markets, which challenges the Federal Reserve's balancing act. He will closely watch quarterly reports from Carnival, as an indicator for the resilient cruise industry, and Jefferies, to gauge investment banking performance. Cramer identified Nike's earnings as the week's most significant, expecting a potential breakout quarter under its new CEO, Elliot Hill.

          <p>Team Europe secured a dominant 5½-2½ lead against the USA on the opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, marking their most formidable start on American soil in over two decades. Captain Luke Donald's decision to begin with the foursomes format, where Europe historically excels, proved highly effective, yielding a 3-1 morning session victory, followed by a 2½-1½ win in the afternoon fourballs. Standout performances included Jon Rahm, who earned two crucial points, and the pairing of Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood, who delivered a decisive 5&4 victory. Despite US Captain Keegan Bradley's defiant stance and attempts by home fans to disrupt play, Europe's strong position places them as clear favorites to achieve their first away win since 2012.</p>

          <p>Prominent money manager Howard Rubin, 70, and his former personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, 45, have been arrested on charges of sexual assault and transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts over a ten-year period. Prosecutors detailed a litany of alleged abusive acts, including converting a Manhattan penthouse into a "sex dungeon" equipped with bondage gear and devices to "shock or electrocute women," often causing significant injuries. A federal magistrate judge ordered Rubin detained without bail, citing his substantial overseas wealth, flight risk, and alleged discussions about hiring a "hit man" to target women who had filed civil suits against him. Rubin pleaded not guilty, while Powers also faces bank fraud charges. If convicted, both face severe penalties, including a mandatory minimum of 15 years to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Legal experts contend that President Trump's persistent public attacks on James Comey, combined with unusual leadership shifts within the prosecuting U.S. Attorney's Office, could critically jeopardize the federal case against the former FBI director. Career prosecutors reportedly opposed seeking an indictment, but the case moved forward after Trump installed his former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, as the new interim U.S. Attorney. Experts, including former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi, argue that Trump's long-standing "animus" towards Comey provides substantial grounds for a defense of selective or vindictive prosecution. The grand jury's rare rejection of one of the proposed counts further highlights potential procedural irregularities and concerns that political motivations may have compromised the integrity of the legal process.</p>

This legal action stemmed from a 2023 investigation that uncovered claims of inexperienced and undertrained staff, along with understaffed facilities, resulting in pets being neglected or returned to owners in unsanitary conditions. A notable incident involved a dog attacking four employees at one facility. While Wag Hotels stated it admitted no wrongdoing for what it termed "isolated incidents," the settlement aims to resolve the matter and allow the company to focus on its services.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent Black liberation activist and former member of the Black Panther Party, has died in Havana, Cuba, at the age of 78. Born Joanne Deborah Chesimard, Shakur was granted political asylum in Cuba after her 1979 escape from a U.S. prison, where she was serving a life sentence for the 1973 killing of a New Jersey State Trooper. For decades, American authorities, including President Trump, had demanded her extradition from Cuba, listing her on the "most wanted terrorists" list. Her case has long been emblematic of the strained U.S.-Cuba relations and served as a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, despite criticism regarding the Marxist and communist influences in her writings.</p>

A 400-page legal petition details alleged abuses such as murder, torture, expulsion, and collective punishment, which petitioners argue repressed the Arab Palestinian population. While acknowledging the significance of state recognition, they contend it does not fully address Britain's historical conduct and its enduring legacy.
