          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador and detained in a notorious prison. The court directed a lower court to clarify its order, emphasizing deference to the Executive Branch in foreign affairs. Abrego Garcia's lawyer hailed the decision as a victory for the rule of law and called for his client's immediate return, noting his family's needs. The ruling is a rebuke to the administration's increased focus on deporting alleged gang members. Optimism score: 70</p>

            <p>Lawyers for Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil challenged the government's lack of evidence that his presence in the U.S. poses an adverse foreign policy consequence, the stated reason for his potential deportation. The government presented a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserting his authority to deport Khalil due to his alleged role in "antisemitic protests," which Rubio argues fosters a hostile environment for Jewish students. Khalil's attorneys criticized the memo, arguing it infringes on First Amendment rights and plans to request to depose Rubio to understand his reasoning. The immigration judge is expected to make a finding on Khalil's removability. Optimism score: 35</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.4% annually in March, indicating a slight easing of inflation, partly due to lower fuel prices and decreased travel costs. Experts note that recent tariffs orchestrated by President Trump could still lead to inflation increases later in the year, as import duties impact consumer prices. The CPI data also revealed that egg prices continued to rise despite wholesale price drops and the absence of bird flu outbreaks. Economists anticipate the Federal Reserve will likely maintain current interest rates at its next meeting due to these mixed signals. (not investment advice) Optimism score: 55</p>

            <p>A pioneering project at the University of Bristol is tracking brain development in babies and toddlers to understand how key skills like focus and learning are established. Researchers use specially designed games and brain-scanning technology to measure skills like inhibitory control and working memory. The study is unique because it also includes data from the mothers of the children, who have been tracked since the 1990s. The goal is to identify when different skills develop and how individual children develop over time, with the potential to support children who may struggle academically or socially.

            <p>A British man, Pete Belton, discovered his forearm tattoo was used in a US government document to identify members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA). Belton, who has no connection to the gang, expressed concern about potential issues when traveling to the US. The tattoo, a clock face with his daughter's birthdate, appeared in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to help identify alleged TdA members. The DHS said it was confident in its law enforcement's intelligence and that its "assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos and social media." Optimism score: 50</p>
