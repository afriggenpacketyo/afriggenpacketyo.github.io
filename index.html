        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump over 11% in their Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting the ongoing boom in the electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly the largest global listing in 2025, with funds primarily allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition in China's EV market, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year, driven by strong EV sales in China bolstered by subsidies and incentives. Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at KraneShares, considers CATL a 'must own company' for investors in the EV space.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that former President Biden delayed sharing his prostate cancer diagnosis, implying a cover-up and questioning Biden's fitness for office. Trump, while initially gracious, pivoted to questioning the timing of the announcement, conflating the Gleason score with the stage of Biden's cancer and raising concerns about cognitive ability. Trump's comments come amid ongoing concerns about Biden's health and age, previously highlighted in a special counsel report and during a presidential debate, with Trump emphasizing his own cognitive test results. This shift in tone underscores the politicization of health disclosures and the ongoing scrutiny surrounding Biden's leadership capabilities.</p>

          <p>Associates of President Trump and crypto entrepreneurs are reigniting the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) market, focusing on cryptocurrency and blockchain ventures. Key executives from Trump Media & Technology Group and advisors to Saudi Arabia are backing these deals, capitalizing on the stock market's upswing and investor demand for crypto-related opportunities. SPACs offer a quicker route to public markets compared to traditional IPOs, attracting investors willing to take risks on speculative ventures. However, many past SPAC deals have failed, leading to SEC investigations and investor losses, highlighting the inherent risks in this investment vehicle. (not investment advice)</p>

Babbitt's death has been a rallying point for Trump loyalists, who allege unnecessary force by police, though footage showed Babbitt attempting to climb through a smashed window during the riot.

          <p>Coral reefs off the coast of Honolulu are suffering from severe bleaching due to warming ocean temperatures, threatening marine life and coastal protection. According to NOAA, 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress, causing the algae that give corals their color to be expelled, leaving them white. Marine scientist Greg Asner notes that the decline is even worse in other regions, like the Great Barrier Reef and Florida, with rising ocean temperatures accelerating coral deaths. While efforts are underway to educate tourists and implement underwater nurseries, controlling fossil fuels is essential for the long-term recovery of coral reefs.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% in an effort to stimulate economic growth. This move follows earlier deposit rate reductions by state-backed commercial lenders, aiming to protect their net interest margin and paving the way for lower lending rates. The rate cuts are part of a broader package of stimulus measures, including reductions to lending rates and reserve requirements for banks, amidst concerns about deflationary pressure and trade tensions. Nomura has raised its forecast for China's GDP growth, but cautions about potential risks from the housing slump and possible tariff increases.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill cleared a hurdle in the House after conservative opposition initially stalled its progress due to concerns about insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to minor modifications, with four conservative holdouts voting present instead of against the legislation, allowing it to advance to the Rules Committee. The bill, which includes extending tax cuts and increasing military spending, faces further challenges in the Rules Committee and potential obstacles in the Senate. Conservatives are pushing for earlier implementation of work requirements for Medicaid recipients and an end to clean energy subsidies, while moderate Republicans are wary of slashing social programs.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Russia and Ukraine would "immediately" begin ceasefire negotiations after a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but details remain unclear. While Trump expressed optimism, there was no confirmation of when negotiations would occur or whether Russia would meet demands for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed his desire for a "full and unconditional ceasefire" and warned of stronger sanctions if Moscow is not ready. Zelensky emphasized the need for American and European representatives in the negotiation process.</p>
