          <p>President Donald Trump has officially confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, citing the flow of drugs and the release of prisoners into the U.S. as primary justifications. The acknowledgment follows a series of deadly U.S. military strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and has drawn sharp condemnation from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who decried the actions as attempted coups. The move has also sparked significant concern within the U.S. Congress, with lawmakers from both parties worried about a slide into an unauthorized conflict without proper oversight or transparency.</p>

          <p>Lakers guard Gabe Vincent delivered an impressive offensive performance during a preseason game against the Dallas Mavericks, scoring 22 points and making six of his eleven three-point attempts. He started the game by hitting five consecutive three-pointers, igniting the pro-Lakers crowd in Las Vegas and accumulating 18 points in the first quarter alone. Despite his strong individual effort, the Lakers ultimately lost the game 121-94 after being heavily outscored in the final quarter. The team is expected to play its regular starters in the final preseason game as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The UK government is under pressure after a high-profile spying case against two men accused of working for China was unexpectedly dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The collapse was attributed to the government's failure to provide evidence formally designating China as a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses, a new legal precedent. This has ignited a political dispute, with the Conservative opposition accusing the Labour government of a cover-up to protect relations with Beijing. In response, the government published the witness statements at the center of the controversy.</p>

          <p>The European Union's ambition to become a global AI hub is facing environmental challenges, as the rapid expansion of water-intensive data centers raises alarms in some of the continent's driest regions. Experts warn that building these facilities in water-stressed areas like Spain and Greece reflects a lack of integrated policy thinking, potentially exacerbating local water shortages. While major tech companies are investing billions, critics question the sustainability of such projects. The industry responds by highlighting its importance to the economy and ongoing innovations in water-efficient cooling technologies.</p>

          <p>The People’s Bank of China has set the yuan's daily reference rate against the U.S. dollar at its strongest point in a year, signaling confidence amid global economic uncertainty. This move is largely influenced by growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will implement further interest rate cuts to counter risks from ongoing trade tensions. The stronger fixing reflects Beijing's efforts to manage its currency's value while navigating a complex international financial landscape. The market anticipates additional Fed rate cuts, which could continue to influence the yuan's position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has announced the permanent closure of its crucial emergency care center in Turgeau, Port-au-Prince, due to the relentless and escalating gang violence that has engulfed Haiti's capital. The decision comes after armed attacks made operations too dangerous for staff and patients, further crippling a healthcare system where over 60% of facilities are now non-functional. This closure removes a vital lifeline for a city where gangs control 90% of the territory, exacerbating a severe humanitarian crisis marked by thousands of deaths and over 1.4 million displaced people this year alone.</p>

Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly questioned the legality of the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to police American cities, stating she believes it is not legal for them to enforce local laws on U.S. soil. She highlighted that, unlike in states, the D.C. National Guard reports directly to the president, limiting her authority.

The move follows the Trump administration's imposition of 50% tariffs on Indian goods, which were partly intended as leverage against Delhi for its trade with Moscow. For months, India had resisted the pressure, arguing for its neutrality and citing its economic need for discounted Russian crude oil.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI chip designer Cambricon Technologies and AI software leader SenseTime have formed a strategic partnership to bolster China's push for technological self-reliance. The collaboration aims to create a "new indigenous AI development paradigm" by integrating SenseTime's foundational AI models with Cambricon's advanced processors. This move aligns with Beijing's national priority to build a complete domestic AI stack, from silicon to software. The two companies plan to jointly develop comprehensive AI computing solutions and enterprise services to strengthen the regional AI ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Following their breakout success and winning the BBC's Sound of 2024, The Last Dinner Party are releasing their second album, "From The Pyre," which they describe as darker and more gothically grandiose than their debut. In an interview, the band explains that their newfound confidence allowed them to experiment with more complex arrangements and themes, including love, death, and grief. Despite a whirlwind year of touring, the album was written and recorded in a concentrated period, with some songs drawing on ideas that predate the band's formation, reflecting their growth as musicians and storytellers.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, recently deported to El Salvador, has spoken out about his ordeal, describing his 100-day detention in the U.S. as a "horrible" experience where he felt treated like a criminal. Guevara was arrested by ICE while livestreaming a protest in Atlanta and believes he was targeted for his work, claiming an officer told him journalists "give us a hard time." Now separated from his family, who remain in the U.S., he is adjusting to life back in his home country while grappling with the pain of the separation and the consequences of his reporting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News investigation has found that roughly one in four Californians summoned for jury duty failed to appear last year, with enforcement of this civic duty varying wildly across the state. While some counties threaten or impose fines and court orders, the data reveals that about 21% of counties do not sanction jury dodgers at all. This inconsistency raises concerns about the fairness of the justice system and its ability to seat a true jury of peers, as the financial burden of service often falls disproportionately on those who can least afford it.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an emergency directive requiring all federal agencies to immediately patch their F5 networking devices.

Officials warn that the vulnerabilities could be exploited to steal credentials, move across networks, and potentially gain full control of targeted systems.

A labor economist attributes the worsening trend to economic uncertainty stemming from the White House, exacerbated by the recent government shutdown and ongoing trade tariffs.

The plan suggests the government could provide funds to purchase homes, which would be added to the nation's social housing stock for both local residents and asylum seekers, drastically cutting yearly costs per person from £54,000 to £4,000. This innovative approach seeks to create a more sustainable, cost-effective, and integrated system while addressing community tensions and the national housing shortage.</p>
