          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran's parliament has reportedly approved a measure to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil supplies. The decision now rests with the country's national security council. Experts caution that such a move risks alienating Iran's neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. Closing the strait could also provoke hostilities and put a target on Iran's own oil production infrastructure, especially given the current resolve of the U.S. and Israel.

          <p>The Japanese government has signaled support for the recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, framing it as a demonstration of Washington's commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the importance of de-escalating the situation while acknowledging U.S. efforts to pursue dialogue. Japan, heavily reliant on Middle Eastern oil passing through the Strait of Hormuz, is closely monitoring the impact of the conflict on its energy supply, with concerns rising after reports of Iran potentially closing the strait in retaliation for the U.S. strikes.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran during a routine immigration appointment in New Orleans, sparking outrage. Paola Clouatre, a Mexican national who entered the U.S. seeking asylum as a child, is now facing deportation despite being married to an American veteran and breastfeeding their infant daughter. Immigration law experts say that the Trump administration's strict enforcement policies have reduced deference previously given to military families, with the agency now referring them for deportation.

          <p>Heightened uncertainty in the Middle East, triggered by U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and Iran's threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, has created fears in the global economy.

          <p>Despite facing extensive sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has shown surprising resilience, even outgrowing all G7 nations in 2024 according to official figures. This growth has been fueled by record military spending and relatively stable oil exports redirected to China and India. However, high inflation, rising interest rates, and labor shortages are creating concerns, with the economy minister warning of potential recession. While some analysts predict a mild downturn, others suggest the economy could face collapse, though this remains unlikely.</p>

          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a prominent Belarusian dissident, was unexpectedly released after five years in prison and reunited with his family in Lithuania. Tsikhanouski, who endured harsh conditions including solitary confinement and denial of medical care, credits U.S. President Donald Trump with aiding his release. Despite his deteriorated health, he remains committed to fighting for change in Belarus and supports Ukraine against Russian aggression. He also blames Russian President Vladimir Putin for supporting the Lukashenko regime.</p>

          <p>Detectives have renewed their appeal for information ten years after the murder of John "Goldfinger" Palmer, who was shot six times in his garden in 2015. Palmer, known for his alleged involvement in the Brink's-Mat robbery and timeshare fraud, was 65 years old at the time of his death. Essex Police believe the killing was a planned execution and are hoping that changing loyalties within the criminal underworld may encourage individuals to come forward with information.

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is exploring the possibility of establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. Advocates believe ketamine can make patients more receptive to psychotherapy, while clinicians emphasize the need for controlled administration and careful patient selection.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely shrugged off the escalation, with investors viewing the conflict as contained. The MSCI World index has seen only a slight decline, and safe havens are trading mixed. Experts suggest that the market views the attack on Iran as a relief, reducing the immediate nuclear threat in the region. While the gravity of the situation is acknowledged, it is not seen as a systemic risk to global markets.</p>

          <p>Maureen Welch, an 83-year-old woman, sustained life-altering injuries after being struck by a cyclist on a Lime e-bike who ran a red light.

The family emphasizes the lack of rules governing e-bike usage, citing instances of speeding, jumping red lights, and pavement riding. The government is considering updating cycling legislation, while personal injury solicitors and trauma surgeons are noting a rise in e-bike-related injuries.</p>

She argues that their calls for diplomacy ring hollow as they fail to address the root causes of the conflict or challenge Israel's actions. The author contends that this inaction stems from a biased worldview that prioritizes Western interests and views Iran as inherently untrustworthy, while granting Israel impunity.</p>

The summit will also address the need for additional troops in Europe and the potential withdrawal of US forces, raising questions about how Germany will meet these requirements.</p>
