          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 11:23:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50%, citing India's continued importation of Russian oil as a key reason. The executive order imposes an additional 25% levy on top of a previously announced 25% tariff, making it one of the highest rates for a major U.S. trading partner. India condemned the move as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," arguing its energy purchases are vital for national security and pointing out that other nations, including in Europe, also trade with Russia. The order also directs a review of other countries importing Russian oil for potential similar actions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following new U.S. tariffs, analysts are examining the significant consequences if India and China were to cease buying Russian oil. Such a move could trigger a major spike in global oil prices, as removing Russia's five million barrels per day from the market would be difficult to replace quickly, potentially stoking worldwide inflation. India has saved billions by purchasing discounted Russian crude since 2022, a decision driven by energy security needs. Experts suggest China may be spared from similar U.S. sanctions due to its greater economic leverage, while India faces more direct pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

The aircraft, which had departed from the capital, Accra, was en route to the town of Obuasi for a national event when it went "off the radar." The Ghana Armed Forces confirmed the helicopter was carrying three crew members and five passengers at the time of the incident.

          <p>Lending experts predict that U.S. housing affordability this fall will largely hinge on mortgage rate stability and housing inventory levels. While significant rate drops are not anticipated, stability is seen as beneficial for market confidence, allowing both buyers and sellers to plan more effectively. National inventory is rising, which could ease prices, but conditions vary significantly by local market, with some areas seeing bidding wars while others have ample supply. Overall, home prices are expected to see modest growth or slight declines, making it a complex environment for potential homebuyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Super Micro Computer fell by 20% after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter results and a future outlook that did not meet Wall Street's expectations. The server maker's performance was partly impacted by U.S. tariffs, with executives noting the situation remains dynamic. The company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share and revenue, attributing the shortfall to a lack of working capital and specification changes from a major customer. Super Micro's guidance for the upcoming quarter and full year also fell short of previous, more optimistic projections, reflecting a slowdown from its earlier AI-driven growth.

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to revoke Washington D.C.'s "home rule" and place the city under direct federal control, citing what he calls uncontrolled crime. The statement followed an assault on a federal employee, which was highlighted by Elon Musk, who also supported the idea of federalization. Trump specifically called for prosecuting minors as young as 14 as adults to address the issue. This move would be unprecedented since home rule was established in 1973 and would likely face significant legal and political challenges from Congress and local officials.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in the medical journal JAMA estimates that the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year may have caused 440 more deaths than the official count of 31. Researchers attribute this excess mortality to factors like poor air quality exacerbating pre-existing health conditions and disruptions in access to healthcare during the crisis. The study highlights the need for better methods to quantify the full mortality burden of climate-related emergencies.

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has canceled $500 million in funding for 22 research projects focused on mRNA vaccines for infections like COVID-19 and flu. Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, stated that the data shows these vaccines are not effective against upper respiratory infections and that funding should shift to "safer, broader vaccine platforms." The decision has drawn sharp criticism from scientists, who argue that while mRNA technology is not perfect, it proved remarkably effective at saving lives during the pandemic. Experts warn that abandoning this research could be a "catastrophic error," especially given its rapid-response potential for future pandemics like bird flu.</p>

          <h2>Experts Weigh Pros and Cons of Reverse Mortgages Versus Selling a Home for Retirees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 10:18:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising retirees on the difficult choice between selling their home or obtaining a reverse mortgage to supplement a fixed income in today's high-cost economy. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to access their equity without a monthly payment, which can help cover rising living expenses, but it reduces the inheritance left to heirs. Selling the home provides a lump sum of cash and the opportunity to downsize but involves transaction costs and potential capital gains taxes. The best choice depends on individual circumstances, such as the desire to stay in the home versus relocating. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's forward-looking guidance did not account for potential revenue from these China-specific chips, creating uncertainty about the timing of a restart in shipments. While overall revenue grew, investors also raised concerns about the growth rate of its datacenter business and the company's ability to scale its GPU operations. (not investment advice)</p>

Milliken called the cuts a "death knell" for critical research in medicine, energy, and science and announced the university would enter negotiations to have the funding restored. The suspensions affect over 800 grants and represent more than half of the federal funding UCLA receives annually.</p>
