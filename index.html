Additionally, the platform provides yield-bearing accounts, including a 4% APY on cash deposits, positioning it as a competitor to services like Robinhood and eToro.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has appointed Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano to also serve as the CEO of the IRS, a newly established position. Bisignano, a former CEO of Fiserv, will oversee daily operations at the tax agency while continuing his leadership at the SSA. The Treasury stated the agencies share similar technological and customer service objectives, making him a natural fit. However, advocacy groups have raised concerns about potential leadership vacuums and his capacity to effectively manage two major government agencies simultaneously, especially given recent job cuts at the SSA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's political instability has deepened as Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu resigned after his government collapsed within 14 hours of being formed. The immediate cause was the conservative Republicans (LR) party withdrawing support over the appointment of Bruno Le Maire as defense minister, a figure they hold responsible for the country's rising debt. This marks the third prime ministerial failure in a short period for President Emmanuel Macron, highlighting his waning influence. As the 2027 presidential election approaches, political allies are distancing themselves from the unpopular president, making it increasingly difficult to form a stable government.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that British-made microcomputers were among over 100,000 foreign parts discovered in Russian missiles and drones used in recent attacks. He called for more effective sanctions to close loopholes that allow components from the UK, Germany, Japan, and the US to reach Russia's military. The UK's Department for Business and Trade responded that it takes these reports seriously, having already banned thousands of goods and sanctioned over £20 billion of trade with Russia. Despite being the world's most-sanctioned nation, Russia has adapted its economy to sustain its war effort, though signs of economic strain are reportedly growing.</p>

          <p>An appeals court in Nimes, France, has started hearing the case of a man convicted in the landmark Gisèle Pelicot trial, who is challenging his nine-year prison sentence. Pelicot, who became a global icon for advocating for public proceedings, was present and received applause from supporters. The original trial saw her ex-husband and 50 other men convicted for sexually assaulting her over a decade while she was drugged.

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order designating city-owned properties as "ICE-free zones," prohibiting federal immigration agents from using them for enforcement activities. This action is part of a broader initiative to counter the Trump administration's immigration policies and planned deployment of National Guard troops to the city. Concurrently, Mayor Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have filed a lawsuit to block the troop deployment, which they describe as an un-American and militaristic escalation. The move has drawn sharp criticism from the White House, escalating the conflict between local and federal authorities over immigration and public safety.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has warned that the Essential Air Service program, which subsidizes commercial flights to rural airports, could see its funding expire as soon as Sunday due to the ongoing government shutdown. The U.S. Transportation Department has been using advance funds from the FAA to maintain the service but is now notifying carriers and communities of a potential shortfall. The program, which provides approximately $350 million in annual funding, supports air service to over 170 communities, primarily in Republican-leaning areas.

          <p>An editorial in The Guardian argues that while an end to the conflict in Gaza is urgently needed, Donald Trump's proposed peace plan fundamentally undermines Palestinian rights. The article acknowledges that both Israel and Hamas have indicated reluctant acceptance under U.S. pressure but points out their rejection of key components. It criticizes the plan for sidelining Palestinians, proposing a "colonial administration"-style oversight board, and treating statehood as a vague "aspiration" rather than a right. While seeing any chance to end the violence as necessary, the editorial warns that a lasting peace cannot be built on a foundation that ignores basic Palestinian self-determination.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has stopped the release of crucial economic reports, including monthly jobs and inflation data, creating a "data vacuum" for policymakers and investors. Economists warn this lack of information heightens uncertainty at a time when there are concerns about a potential recession and stagflation. The absence of reliable government statistics could make businesses and consumers more cautious, potentially hindering economic activity. This situation also complicates the Federal Reserve's ability to make informed decisions on interest rates, as officials may be ill-equipped to gauge the true state of the economy.

          <p>Despite a widespread push from major corporations for employees to return to the office, work-from-home rates have remained stable since spring 2023. Stanford professor Nick Bloom attributes this to a "growing compliance gap," where employees and even middle managers engage in passive resistance against mandates they find unnecessary. Workers are also adopting new behaviors like "coffee badging"—appearing at the office for just a few hours—and "micro-shifting" to maintain flexibility. This trend persists even as employers gain leverage in a cooling labor market, with some companies reportedly using strict RTO policies as a way to reduce headcount without formal layoffs.</p>

          <p>Lithuania is positioning itself as a key player in the European startup scene with the development of TechZity, a €100 million project in Vilnius set to become the continent's largest startup hub. The hub aims to host 5,000 workers and foster a creative ecosystem, with the ambitious goal of having the startup sector contribute 25% of the country's GDP by 2030. This initiative follows Lithuania's success in the fintech sector, where it became an EU leader by creating a favorable regulatory environment. However, challenges remain, including access to capital and the need for more skilled personnel to support continued growth.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has commenced its new term, with a docket featuring significant cases on gun rights, redistricting, and bans on "conversion therapy" for minors. A central theme of the term will be legal challenges to President Trump's executive actions, including his use of sweeping tariffs and his authority to fire officials at independent federal agencies. The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has already handled numerous emergency appeals from the Trump administration. The upcoming rulings will provide a clearer indication of the court's stance on the extent of presidential power and shape policy on contentious social issues.</p>

          <p>A Polish woman, Julia Wandelt, is on trial in the UK for allegedly stalking Kate and Gerry McCann, the parents of the missing child Madeleine McCann. Prosecutors stated that Wandelt engaged in a "campaign of harassment" over two and a half years, persistently claiming she was their abducted daughter. The court heard that she sent numerous emails, made phone calls, and even appeared at the McCanns' address, causing the family serious alarm and distress. The prosecutor made it clear to the jury that Wandelt is not Madeleine McCann, whose 2007 disappearance remains one of the world's most high-profile unsolved missing person cases.</p>

In the U.S., the album sold 2.7 million copies on its first day alone, marking the second-largest sales week for any album since 1991. The release also broke the record for most vinyl albums sold in a single week, with 1.2 million copies purchased by fans. These figures are especially notable in an era of declining album sales, cementing Swift's status as a dominant force in the music industry.</p>

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have sued the Trump administration to prevent the deployment of National Guard troops, arguing the move constitutes a threat of military occupation. The lawsuit seeks to block the federalization of the Illinois National Guard and the dispatch of troops from other states, such as Texas. This legal action follows weeks of tension, with President Trump vowing to send federal forces to Chicago to address crime. Local leaders contend the deployment is an abuse of power and unnecessary, escalating a conflict over federal authority and states' rights.</p>

          <p>Nike CEO Elliott Hill acknowledged in an interview that the company's return to profitable growth will "take a while" as it implements a new turnaround strategy. Hill is reversing the previous focus on direct-to-consumer digital sales, moving back toward strengthening relationships with wholesale partners to regain shelf space. The corporate structure is also being reorganized to focus on individual sports rather than broad gender categories to reignite product innovation. While expressing confidence in the plan, Hill noted that the company's stock has fallen about 12% over the last year amid declining sales and macroeconomic pressures like tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has officially updated its immunization schedules, formalizing recommendations that shift away from broad mandates for COVID-19 and chickenpox vaccines. The new guidance emphasizes "individual-based decision-making" for COVID-19 shots in consultation with healthcare providers, dropping specific recommendations even for high-risk groups. For toddlers, the agency now advises a standalone chickenpox vaccine instead of the combined MMRV shot to reduce a slight risk of febrile seizures. These changes, originating from a new advisory panel, have been criticized by some top medical organizations for creating conflicting public health messages.</p>

          <p>The recent political crisis in France, marked by a prime minister's swift resignation, highlights a broader global issue where governments are struggling with overstretched public finances and political polarization. Government bond yields have been rising in many major economies as investors grow concerned about spending pressures and high debt levels accumulated during the financial crisis and pandemic. Countries like Japan, the UK, and the US are all facing difficult fiscal choices with little public appetite for budget cuts. This global borrowing glut has left many governments vulnerable to market shifts, making it difficult to maintain investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has entered into a major agreement to purchase AI chips from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a move that intensifies competition with current market leader Nvidia. The deal, which could result in tens of billions in revenue for AMD, involves OpenAI purchasing 6 gigawatts of AMD's AI processors and securing warrants for a potential 10% ownership stake in the chipmaker. While AMD's stock surged on the news, analysts suggest Nvidia's dominance is not under immediate threat, as the massive demand for AI computing power creates room for multiple suppliers. The agreement underscores OpenAI's urgent need for more computing resources to power its expanding AI services. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average credit card interest rates at 22.25%, making only the minimum payment on a significant balance, such as $10,000, is a financially precarious strategy. An analysis reveals that minimum payment formulas, typically a small percentage of the balance plus interest, are designed to keep consumers in debt for years, potentially costing them more in interest than the original amount borrowed. For a $10,000 balance, a common minimum payment might start around $283, with only $100 going toward the principal. This practice also keeps credit utilization high, which can negatively impact credit scores and access to future credit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newly qualified resident doctors in England have voted overwhelmingly in favor of strike action due to a severe shortage of specialty training positions available after their second year. The British Medical Association (BMA) reports that this year, there were only 10,000 training jobs for 30,000 candidates, leaving many skilled doctors without a clear career path despite high patient demand. The union argues that poor workforce planning has led to an expansion of medical school placements without a corresponding increase in NHS training posts. This mandate for industrial action adds another point of contention to ongoing negotiations with the government over pay and working conditions.</p>
