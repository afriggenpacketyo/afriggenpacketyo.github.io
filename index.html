          <p>The Chinese central government is requiring local authorities to justify any year-on-year increases exceeding 20% in fines imposed on private companies. This initiative aims to curb arbitrary inspections and profit-seeking behaviors targeting private enterprises, which are part of broader economic recovery efforts that began in March. The order addresses issues like inconsistent enforcement standards and abuse of power, with the Justice Ministry employing real-time statistical analysis to detect unusual spikes in punitive fees. Hu Weilie, China’s vice-minister of justice, emphasized that the success of this campaign hinges on correcting these widespread and harmful problems.</p>

          <p>The body of hiker Hannah Moody was found off a trail in central Arizona, approximately 16 hours after she was reported missing. Scottsdale police initiated a search after friends raised concerns when they had not heard from her, discovering her vehicle at the Gateway Trailhead of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve in Scottsdale. The search, which involved officers on foot and bicycles, drones, and assistance from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, was suspended overnight and resumed the following morning. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Air Unit located Moody's body about 600 yards off-trail, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of death, though there are no immediate signs of foul play.</p>

          <p>Internal documents indicate that the Department of Veterans Affairs is facing a crisis marked by canceled contracts, hiring freezes, resignations, and layoffs, impacting patient care across its network of hospitals and clinics. Issues include the closure of an acute care unit in Danville, Illinois, due to nurse resignations, a backlog of unread radiology exams in Orlando, Florida, and a shortage of police officers in Battle Creek, Michigan. Senator Richard Blumenthal criticized the agency for being rash and reckless, while Representative Mark Takano expressed concerns about the impact of the Trump administration’s policies on veterans. The agency has dismissed 2,500 workers and canceled over 500 contracts as part of efforts to cut bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court case, Kennedy v Braidwood, initiated by Republican donor Steven Hotze, challenges the Affordable Care Act's requirement for employers to cover pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), an HIV prevention medication. Hotze argues that providing coverage for PrEP violates his religious beliefs by supporting “sexual promiscuity,” and also objects to STI screenings, alcohol counseling, and childhood obesity interventions. A ruling in favor of Braidwood could lead to widespread loss of access to free preventative healthcare, impacting millions who rely on these services. Critics argue that this case is an attempt to use the law to legitimize bigotry and cut off care based on personal disapproval of lifestyles.</p>

          <p>New York City's subway system is implementing artificial intelligence to improve security and reduce crime by analyzing real-time camera feeds to detect suspicious behavior. The AI system focuses on identifying patterns indicative of potential threats rather than individual recognition, alerting transit police to respond quickly. While about 40% of subway cameras are currently monitored by staff, the AI aims to expand coverage without additional personnel, with the MTA emphasizing that facial recognition will not be used to protect rider privacy. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance subway safety, which includes the deployment of 1,000 National Guard members, in response to fluctuating crime rates, including an increase in assaults.</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed credit for a recent surge in military recruitment, stating that enlistments are the highest in 30 years, but this claim is misleading. While enlistments have increased, they began rebounding before his election and remain below recent peaks. Experts attribute the improvements to recruitment reforms and compensation changes implemented during the previous administration. Data shows that military recruitment began to recover after COVID-era declines in fiscal year 2023 and continued to grow in 2024.</p>

During the game, Noah accidentally poaches a shot, causing them to lose, and fails to apologize, further diminishing her interest.

          <p>The Yosemite post office celebrated its 100th anniversary, marking a century of serving the remote Yosemite Valley community. The article details the history of mail service to the park, starting in 1869, and highlights the importance of the post office as a lifeline for residents, hikers, and climbers, especially with limited internet and cell service. The piece recounts anecdotes, including the "great frankfurter debacle" of 1926 and stories of romances that bloomed at the post office. Current and former postmasters emphasize the post office's role in connecting people and providing essential services in the isolated Yosemite Valley.</p>

          <p>A contributor to the Los Angeles Times argues that President Biden's cognitive decline was apparent for years, becoming undeniable after his debate with Donald Trump in June 2024. The author suggests that the real scandal is the collective inertia and lack of concern from elites, rather than a conspiracy to hide the truth. While acknowledging policy fumbles during Biden's presidency, the author credits his administration with stability and effectiveness, despite Biden's communication challenges. The piece posits that loyalty, fear of Trump, and the media's focus on drama over Biden's perceived boringness contributed to the underreporting of his decline.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' tax bill includes a national school voucher program that would use the federal tax code to offer vouchers for students to attend private schools. The plan rewards charitable donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs) with a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, capped at $5 billion annually. While proponents argue it provides families with educational choice, critics call it a tax shelter for the wealthy, noting it disproportionately benefits those already in private schools and can lead to private schools raising prices. The voucher program does not guarantee the same rights and protections for students with disabilities as public schools.</p>
