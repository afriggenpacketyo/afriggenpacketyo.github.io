          <p>The White House has launched a website to track corporate investments in U.S. manufacturing and other projects, highlighting what it claims is a positive outcome of increased import duties. The investment tracker lists 47 projects involving 50 companies, emphasizing technology and AI initiatives, including substantial pledges from Softbank, OpenAI, Apple, and Nvidia. This announcement arrives amid growing worries about the economic consequences of steep U.S. tariffs, especially after recent data revealed a 0.3% contraction in the U.S. economy during the first quarter. The article notes that President Trump has been advocating for tariffs as a means to stimulate the U.S. manufacturing sector and secure more equitable trade agreements.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-30 18:02:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed inclined to allow the creation of the nation's first religious charter school directly funded by taxpayer dollars during oral arguments on Wednesday. The case stems from Oklahoma, where the state Supreme Court blocked the Catholic Church from receiving a charter school contract, citing constitutional prohibitions against government-sponsored sectarian education. The justices debated the application of the First Amendment's religion clauses, with liberal members arguing that charter schools are public institutions that cannot advance a specific ideology with taxpayer funds, while conservatives viewed them as private contractors providing a public service. A ruling in favor of the school could have broad implications for charter schools nationwide.</p>

The article notes that while wholesale egg prices have dropped, it remains unclear when this will translate into consumer relief.

          <p>Stocks made a comeback after experiencing early losses, as investors largely dismissed new government data revealing that the U.S. economy contracted in the first three months of the year. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed in positive territory, while the Nasdaq Composite experienced a slight decline. The article notes that the initial drop in stocks followed the Commerce Department's report of a 0.3% economic contraction, which some economists attributed to a surge in imports ahead of tariffs.
