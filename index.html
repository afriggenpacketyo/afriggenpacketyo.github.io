          <p>A leaked group chat from Young Republican leaders, containing antisemitic and Nazi-related remarks, has sparked a significant debate within the American right about the normalization of bigotry. The incident has highlighted a growing trend of extremist rhetoric among young conservatives, fueled by certain online influencers and a culture of "joking" about offensive topics like sexual assault and white supremacy. This has created a schism, with some conservative figures calling for accountability and the establishment of clear boundaries, while others argue for unity against the left, regardless of the views held by their allies. The controversy underscores a broader identity crisis about who is welcome in the modern conservative movement.</p>

The 66-year-old star, who was partnered with professional dancer Dianne Buswell, expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to participate in the popular dance competition. This marks his second absence from the show, having previously missed a performance due to a bout of vertigo.

The 26-year-old secured a perfect 5-0 record at the sold-out Royal Albert Hall, which hosted sumo's first overseas tournament in 34 years. The event, which required 10 tons of clay for the ring and nearly a ton of rice for the athletes, successfully showcased the 1,500-year-old Japanese tradition to a global audience. Hoshoryu's victory and openness to competing in the U.S. signal a potential expansion of the sport's international reach and appeal.</p>

The brand, known for its 100% U.S. cotton shirts and signature faded look, saw around 40% year-over-year growth in 2024, boosting its parent company's stock performance. Its success is attributed to its alignment with youth values like comfort, vintage aesthetics, and sustainability, as well as its prevalence in college bookstores, souvenir shops, and on merchandise for various events and brands. Gildan plans to expand the Comfort Colors line into new categories like hats and bags by 2026.</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old man from upstate New York was arrested in Brooklyn after allegedly threatening to use firebombs against federal ICE agents at a "No Kings" protest in Manhattan. The man, David Cox, reportedly made the threats to a bystander at a gas station, who then alerted authorities. Although no weapons or explosives were found in his vehicle upon his arrest, he has been charged with making a terroristic threat. The arrest occurred on a day when tens of thousands of people participated in nationwide demonstrations against the Trump administration, with the New York City rally remaining peaceful with no other protest-related arrests.</p>

          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leading cloud infrastructure provider, caused widespread disruptions for numerous major websites, apps, and services globally on Monday. The issue, which originated in AWS's main US-East-1 region, was attributed to DNS problems with its DynamoDB database service. Companies including Disney+, Reddit, and United Airlines, as well as Amazon's own internal warehouse and delivery systems, were impacted. While AWS reported signs of recovery within hours, it later acknowledged that customers were still experiencing increased error rates, and the company was working on multiple fronts to achieve a full restoration of service.</p>

Under the agreement, the U.S. will invest in rare earths processing facilities in Australia, including a new gallium refinery. This strategic partnership comes amid escalating trade tensions, with Trump threatening 100% tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing does not reverse its export restrictions.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has warned that air travel could face escalating disruptions as the government shutdown extends into its 20th day. Approximately 13,000 air traffic controllers, deemed essential workers, are required to continue working without pay and are reportedly taking on side jobs to make ends meet. Duffy expressed concern that as these employees are set to miss their next full paycheck, there could be a spike in sick calls, leading to staff shortages and more significant flight delays at airports nationwide. The prolonged shutdown also raises the risk of experienced federal employees leaving for private-sector jobs, which could have long-term consequences.</p>

The first congressional hearing will be held in Los Angeles to address what officials describe as unconstitutional actions that have instilled fear in communities.

          <p>For those nearing retirement, the current high-interest-rate environment generally presents a favorable opportunity to purchase fixed annuities, as it allows insurance companies to offer more generous payouts. Insurers invest premiums in conservative, interest-bearing assets like bonds, so higher prevailing rates translate to larger, guaranteed income streams for retirees. While the Federal Reserve has begun cutting rates, they remain relatively high, making it a potentially strategic time to lock in an annuity. However, attempting to perfectly time the market is difficult, and personal timing, such as age, also plays a crucial role in determining the final payout amount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates at its upcoming October 29 meeting, financial experts suggest that now may be an opportune time to invest in gold. Historically, gold prices tend to rise when interest rates fall, as lower yields on interest-earning assets make the precious metal a more attractive alternative. Gold prices have already seen a remarkable surge, surpassing $4,300 per ounce, and could continue to climb due to inflation, geopolitical uncertainty, and domestic economic concerns. Investing now could provide portfolio protection and allow investors to capitalize on potential price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs surged 17% after CEO Lourenco Goncalves announced the company is investigating the potential for rare earths mining at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This move aligns with the U.S. government's strategy to reduce dependence on China, which dominates the global supply chain for these critical minerals used in defense, electric vehicles, and technology. The announcement comes as the Trump administration signals a push for domestic production, having already struck a deal with MP Materials, the only current U.S. rare earths mine. Cleveland-Cliffs aims to be part of the solution for American mineral independence. (not investment advice)</p>

Risk factors include high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol, high blood sugar, excess weight, and reduced kidney function.

While younger Gen Z and millennial business owners are more concerned about a future recession, Gen X owners are most anxious about current conditions, with only 35% rating them as good. This group, many of whom are in their peak career years, consistently shows the least confidence in their own business stability, the broader U.S. economy, and the Federal Reserve's ability to control inflation.

The gang used a vehicle-mounted lift to access a first-floor window of the Galerie d'Apollon, smashed display cases, and escaped on scooters in a heist that lasted only a few minutes. Among the stolen items are tiaras, necklaces, and brooches from the 19th century, once belonging to French royalty. While Empress Eugénie's crown was dropped and recovered, the other jewels are considered to have immeasurable heritage value, prompting a massive police investigation and political outcry in France.</p>

Nandy called the initial decision "wrong," stating that while the government does not assess risk, it will work with local authorities to fund the required policing.
