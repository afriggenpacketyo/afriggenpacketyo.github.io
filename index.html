            <p>As the United States commemorates the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the question of who fired the first shot remains a subject of debate.

            <p>Former Los Angeles Councilmember Kevin de León is facing an $18,750 ethics fine for voting on city council decisions in which he had a financial interest and for failing to disclose income. The ethics report alleges that De León voted on issues benefiting the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and USC shortly after receiving income from each, and failed to disclose over $100,000 in income from the foundation. De León's spokesperson stated that the matter centers on disclosure, not personal gain, and that the items in question provided housing and health services to vulnerable people. The ethics commission noted a pattern of conduct in the violations. Optimism score: 40</p>

While authorities have since regained control of the prison, the gang's influence has spread to other countries, prompting international concern and prompting the U.S. government to offer rewards for the capture of its leaders.

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting until midnight Sunday, citing humanitarian grounds. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the announcement, pointing to ongoing Russian drone strikes and questioning Putin's sincerity. Previous attempts at ceasefires have failed, and the announcement follows frustration from the Trump administration regarding the pace of peace talks. Simultaneously, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner exchange mediated by the United Arab Emirates, marking the largest exchange since the start of the conflict. Optimism score: 30</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, pending further review. This action followed an emergency appeal from the ACLU, arguing that the detainees were not given a fair chance to contest their removal. The White House defended the use of the act, claiming the men were "foreign terrorists," a claim disputed by the ACLU. The case highlights ongoing legal battles over immigration policies and the use of wartime laws to address immigration concerns. Optimism score: 45</p>
