          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 07:07:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh government is proposing changes to controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, which currently require properties to be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for non-domestic rates. The new proposals suggest an average of 182 days let over several years and allowing charity donations to count towards the target. This move, intended to support tourism businesses, has drawn criticism from industry groups and Welsh language society Cymdeithas yr Iaith, who argue it's a "token gesture" that fails to address the housing crisis or the significant challenges facing the sector. A consultation on these adjustments is open until November 20, with changes potentially effective from April 1, 2026.</p>

          <p>A devastating shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in south Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and injuries to 17 others, including 14 children. The 23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, who was also killed by a self-inflicted gunshot, fired through church windows during a morning Mass. Authorities, including the FBI, are investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, though a specific motive is yet unknown. The community is grappling with the tragedy, with officials establishing a family resource center and leaders calling for action against gun violence.</p>

          <p>New York Mets pitcher Nolan McLean made franchise history with a dominant performance against the Philadelphia Phillies, securing his third consecutive MLB win in his first three starts. McLean pitched eight scoreless innings, striking out six, contributing to the Mets' 6-0 victory and bringing them within four games of the National League East lead. His impressive 0.89 ERA over these initial starts is the lowest for a Mets rookie, surpassing Tom Seaver's long-standing record from 1967. Teammates and manager Carlos Mendoza praised McLean's electric stuff, pitchability, and confident demeanor on the mound, highlighting his significant impact on the team's recent resurgence.</p>

          <p>YouTube TV has secured a "short-term extension" in its contract dispute with Fox, preventing an immediate blackout of Fox channels for subscribers. The agreement allows negotiations to continue, averting disruptions to programming like college football and Fox News. While YouTube TV stated Fox was demanding excessive payments, Fox accused Google of exploiting its influence. The Federal Communications Commission chairman urged a resolution, highlighting the importance of access to news and sports. This temporary deal follows a similar dispute in 2021 when YouTube TV briefly lost Disney content, underscoring the ongoing challenges in carriage agreement renewals within the streaming industry.</p>

          <h2>Dick's Sporting Goods Raises Full-Year Guidance Following Strong Second-Quarter Performance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 07:01:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods surpassed second-quarter earnings expectations and subsequently raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance. The company reported a 5% increase in comparable sales and revenue, driven by growth in average ticket and transactions. CEO Lauren Hobart attributed the strong performance to effective long-term strategies and consistent execution. While the full-year revenue outlook was slightly below estimates, the raised profit guidance includes the impact of current tariffs.

          <p>Residents in Ukraine's Donbas region are being evacuated by special police units and volunteers as Russian forces advance within kilometers of their homes, subjecting villages to constant bombardment. Many elderly residents are reluctant to leave their lifelong homes, despite the escalating danger and widespread destruction. The evacuation process is perilous, with aid workers using armored vehicles to navigate war-torn areas and facing challenges in finding adequate accommodation for the displaced. The situation has drastically worsened, with daily evacuation requests and reports of destroyed buildings and civilian casualties, forcing people to abandon their possessions and seek safety further west.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship achieved its first near-flawless test flight, with both stages splashing down intact, rekindling US aspirations in the moon race against China. This milestone is crucial for NASA's Artemis III mission, which plans to return American astronauts to the moon by 2027 using Starship's lunar lander variant. NASA officials expressed confidence in beating China, emphasizing the importance of this breakthrough. However, analysts caution that despite this success, China's consistent momentum in space exploration could still enable Beijing to establish the first lunar base, highlighting the intense competition and the need for sustained progress in the US space program.</p>

          <p>A legal battle over an injunction blocking the use of the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, to house asylum seekers has reached the Court of Appeal, with lawyers arguing the case could set a national precedent. The Home Office and the hotel's owners are challenging an order that would require 138 asylum seekers to vacate the premises by September 12, an injunction secured by Epping Forest District Council on planning grounds following local protests. The court was informed that the outcome holds national importance due to its potential impact on the wider asylum accommodation program, as other councils might seek similar injunctions. The hotel owners emphasized that there was no deliberate breach of planning laws and questioned where the asylum seekers would be relocated if the injunction stands.</p>

The ban, effective immediately and only lifted for emergencies, reportedly stems from a disagreement over a story on local government reorganization. Senior editor Natalie Fahy condemned the "unprecedented" move as a direct attack on press freedom and the ability to hold elected officials accountable, raising concerns about transparency in local government spending.

Zambada, a Sinaloa cartel co-founder, pleaded guilty to murder and drug trafficking, agreeing to the forfeiture to avoid the death penalty. Despite speculation about the cartel's decline following Zambada's and "El Chapo" Guzman's arrests, Mexico's Security Secretary insists the organization remains formidable. The cartel, declared a terrorist group by Washington, operates extensively across the U.S.-Mexican border.

This initiative aims to encourage the transition from petrol and diesel cars, with 26 other models receiving a £1,500 discount. The grants, part of a £650 million scheme, will be automatically applied at the point of sale for eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000, with more models expected to follow. This policy addresses upfront cost as a major barrier for drivers, striving to make EVs more affordable and aligning with the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

A 10-year-old survivor, Weston Halsne, described how his friend, Victor, shielded him from bullets, getting shot in the back himself. The FBI is treating the attack by 23-year-old Robin Westman as an anti-Catholic hate crime. Locals recounted confusion and horror as children, some covered in blood, fled the church. The incident underscores the pervasive fear of gun violence in schools, despite regular drills, and has prompted widespread grief and calls for action from state and national leaders.</p>

Critics argue this "transgressive posture" is a key characteristic of the broader "soy right" phenomenon, where a narrative of liberal oppression fuels the creation of new platforms. The article suggests this trend reflects a vexed relationship with femininity, prioritizing a performative purity culture that, despite its claims, often reinforces traditional gender roles while seeking validation.</p>

While Number 10 disputes these claims, the move has drawn criticism from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who suggested it highlights a lack of clear plan or direction for the prime minister. The principal private secretary role is highly influential, controlling information flow and shaping the prime minister's agenda.

          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's relentless focus on aesthetics, from redecorating the White House to influencing cultural institutions, is a deliberate attempt to rebrand America in his own image. Driven by a lifelong pursuit of omnipresence rather than mere fame, Trump aims to intertwine himself with the nation's identity, projecting an aesthetic of wealth, strength, and individualism. His actions, like promoting neoclassical architecture and censoring historical displays, reflect a desire to replace an idealistic vision of America with one of grandeur and authoritarian self-personification. The piece suggests this rebrand reinforces traditional gender norms, hypermasculinity, and a "survival of the fittest" mentality, reflecting a deep-seated, self-serving philosophy.</p>

          <p>New data indicate that electric vehicle (EV) ownership comes with a significant hidden cost: insurance premiums averaging 49% higher than gas-powered cars. Insurify's report attributes this to EVs' higher replacement costs, more expensive and specialized repairs, and increased likelihood of claims. This adds to existing financial hurdles for EV adoption, such as tariffs and expiring incentives. While states with higher EV adoption, like California, see slightly lower premium disparities, the issue highlights the need for more mechanics and infrastructure to reduce costs. Despite higher insurance, EVs generally have lower maintenance and fuel costs, which could offset some of these ongoing fees in the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch reunite in "The Roses," a black comedy reimagining of "The War of the Roses," exploring the unraveling of a contemporary marriage. Scripted by Tony McNamara, the film delves into what happens when ambition clashes with marital stability, as one partner's career flourishes while the other's disintegrates. Despite their long-standing friendship, the actors embraced the cathartic experience of portraying a couple's escalating conflict, including slapstick fights.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom asserts that the fundamental challenge facing the Democratic Party is "weakness," driving his combative political strategy. His approach includes mocking President Trump on social media, engaging with right-wing influencers, and pushing for a redistricting measure in California to gain more House seats. Newsom aims to break the cycle of Democrats passively reacting to conservative grievances, instead setting their own assertive agenda. Drawing parallels to former President Clinton's analysis of voters preferring "strong and wrong to weak and right," Newsom emphasizes the need for the party to assert itself and prove its strength to the American people, especially as he considers a 2028 presidential bid.</p>

Unlike traditional Chuck E. Cheese venues, it lacks pizza and alcohol, focusing solely on gaming and prize machines, particularly Funko figurines.

County estimated to be operating illegally, the city faces a significant challenge in enforcing its 2018 ordinance, which limits short-term rentals to primary homes. The lack of data hinders efforts to address party houses, protect rent-controlled apartments, and recover crucial "bed tax" revenue needed for vital programs like housing and infrastructure.

The piece suggests Trump's actions and rhetoric are normalizing dictatorial aspirations and eroding democratic norms, transforming America into a country where loyalty to him supersedes constitutional principles.

The policy change comes amidst rising COVID activity and follows earlier CDC guidance requiring parental consultation for children's vaccines.

Like Norma Desmond, Trump exhibits a belief in his own enduring popularity and a drive for a "comeback," interpreting the film's tragic delusion as a rousing success story. Similarly, his admiration for Charles Foster Kane, a populist who becomes the very corruption he fights, mirrors Trump's own trajectory of wealth and power. The piece suggests these cinematic preferences highlight a deep-seated narcissism, an immunity to external correction, and a tendency to create a self-serving reality, resonating with an electorate susceptible to confirmation bias.</p>

President Zelenskyy condemned the "horrific and deliberate killing of civilians," asserting Russia's disinterest in peace and calling for new, strong sanctions. This major assault, one of the largest since the 2022 invasion, hit residential buildings, offices, and the EU Delegation to Ukraine's building. Western leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Council President Antonio Costa, swiftly condemned the attacks.
