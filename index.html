          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in 2022, following a retrial that concluded nearly a year after her first prosecution ended in a mistrial; she was acquitted of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death. The jury, however, found her guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, resulting in a one-year probation sentence. Read thanked her supporters and stated that no one fought harder for justice for John O'Keefe than she and her team. Following the verdict, witnesses who testified against Read expressed their disappointment, calling the result a devastating miscarriage of justice. The optimism score is self-contained and represents a condensed view of sentiment analysis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst escalating tensions triggered by Israeli attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities, the possibility of a U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear program is being considered, although destroying Iran's nuclear program presents significant challenges. Iran's Fordo plant, built inside a mountain and reinforced with concrete, can only be penetrated by the U.S.'s GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) delivered by a B2 Spirit stealth bomber. Military experts suggest that multiple bombing rounds and potential ground personnel deployment would be necessary to ensure the facility's complete destruction. An attack by the U.S. could trigger retaliatory actions by Iran, potentially escalating the regional conflict and drawing the U.S. further into it.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Gilead's lenacapavir injection, marketed as Yeztugo, for HIV prevention, a twice-yearly antiviral injection. Clinical trials demonstrated the injection's ability to virtually eliminate new HIV infections when taken every six months, proving to be more effective than daily pills. The annual list price for Yeztugo is $28,218 in the U.S. before insurance, with programs available to reduce out-of-pocket costs for eligible patients. Gilead has also granted licenses to generic manufacturers to produce lower-cost versions for low- and lower-middle-income countries, committing to supply doses for up to 2 million people at no profit before generic versions become available, with the hope of bending the arc of the epidemic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's contemplation of military action against Iran has exposed a bitter split within his circle, pitting isolationist and hawkish wings of the Republican party against one another. While Trump has often criticized "stupid endless wars," he has also maintained that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, leading to uncertainty about potential U.S. involvement. Some Republicans, like Tulsi Gabbard, have expressed doubt about Iran's nuclear plans, while others, such as Senators Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy, support the use of force if diplomatic efforts fail. This internal conflict reflects a broader debate about the U.S.'s role in the Middle East and whether to prioritize an "America First" approach.</p>

Both Republicans and Democrats expressed interest in Congress having a role in determining U.S. involvement, though Republicans were less forceful in their demands.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalate between Israel and Iran, the U.S. is considering direct military involvement, potentially using "bunker buster" bombs. These bombs, designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding, date back to World War II but were significantly developed during the first Gulf War. The GBU-57 MOP (Massive Ordnance Penetrator), among the heaviest non-nuclear bombs in the U.S. arsenal, is specifically designed for facilities like Iran's Fordo, but its effectiveness in completely halting Iran's nuclear program is debated. Due to its size, the GBU-57 can only be deployed by the U.S.'s B-2 stealth bomber, making U.S. involvement crucial for such a strike.</p>

          <p>Experts in radiation hazards have assessed the potential consequences of a U.S. strike using a "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant. They believe the risk of widespread contamination is low, as the uranium hexafluoride gas processed at the site is heavy and unlikely to travel far. Any contamination would likely remain localized, posing minimal risk to those outside the immediate area. While hydrofluoric acid could form if the gas reacts with water, the underground location and collapsing mountain would inhibit its release.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested he would not obey a federal court ruling against deploying national guard troops and U.S. marines to Los Angeles. Hegseth's comments, made before the Senate Armed Services Committee, reflect the Trump administration's willingness to disregard judicial orders it opposes. Democrats criticized Hegseth for the decision to reinstate Confederate base names, turmoil among his top aides, and the appointment of Kingsley Wilson, who has shared antisemitic conspiracy theories, as the Pentagonâ€™s press secretary.</p>

Basic services for finding information or connecting with friends are becoming less dependable, and the AI-driven fixes are not consistently reliable. Silicon Valley's bet on AI is based on technology that can unexpectedly go off the rails, melt down at the simplest tasks, and be misused with alarmingly little friction.</p>
