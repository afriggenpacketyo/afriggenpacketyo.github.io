          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has named eight new advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, replacing the previous 17 members.

Among the appointees are individuals known for criticizing vaccine recommendations and questioning their safety, such as Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about mRNA vaccines, and Dr. Martin Kulldorff, who criticized COVID-19 restrictions.

          <p>The Department of Defense is expected to reject the majority of the 20,000 troops requested by the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement, according to an official. This decision comes amid concerns that deploying troops for domestic law enforcement purposes could violate federal law. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, defending the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles. This follows a speech by President Trump at Fort Bragg, where he vowed to use military force to suppress what he called "anarchy" and "liberate" Los Angeles. </p>

He criticized the White House's actions as petty and immature, accusing them of running a "paid influencer campaign" against him on social media.

Exhibits like "Fragile Home" use mixed reality to recreate a bombarded home in Ukraine, while "AI & Me" allows viewers to be analyzed by AI. Other exhibits offer immersive representations of culture, including "Uncharted," which combines dance with spoken word and visualizations of symbols, and "In the Current of Being," which uses haptic VR to recount the experience of electroshock conversion therapy. </p>

Trump's initial comments suggested a strong response to any protesters, following his decision to send the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration policies. The White House emphasized that security measures for the parade are proactive and not a reaction to the protests in Los Angeles. </p>

          <p>Crude oil futures rose by more than 4% due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, with President Trump expressing doubt about reaching a nuclear deal. The U.S. is preparing to evacuate non-essential personnel from its embassy in Baghdad. Trump stated he is losing confidence in striking a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, while Iran's defense minister warned that U.S. bases in the region are within reach of the Islamic Republic's military. These developments have contributed to market uncertainty and a rise in oil prices. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom accused President Trump of a "brazen abuse of power" in a televised address, citing the administration's immigration enforcement efforts. Newsom's speech is the latest in a series of clashes between the two leaders, presenting both a challenge and an opportunity for the governor, who has his own presidential ambitions. Trump has accused Newsom of being "grossly incompetent" and suggested arresting him, while the White House is considering cutting off federal aid to California. Newsom's actions have positioned him as a prominent Democratic voice against Trump's policies. </p>

          <p>Egg prices for consumers fell to a 5-month low in May, dropping to $4.55 per dozen, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price decrease is attributed to the receding effects of a years-long avian flu outbreak and a seasonal easing in demand.

Experts suggest that containing the avian flu has been a primary factor in the recent price drop. (not investment advice)</p>
