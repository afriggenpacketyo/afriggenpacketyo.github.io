          <p>Following five days of deadly border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire. The agreement was reached during talks in Malaysia, hosted by the ASEAN chair, and attended by U.S. and Chinese observers. The conflict, which escalated after a landmine incident, had drawn international pressure, including from the United States, which threatened to halt trade deals if hostilities continued. The violence represents a rare military confrontation between members of the ASEAN bloc, which prioritizes peaceful dialogue.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza has reported that 14 more people, including two children, have died from malnutrition in a 24-hour period. This report comes as the conflict continues, with an additional 29 Palestinians reportedly killed by Israeli airstrikes. Local hospitals also confirmed that eleven people were killed near aid distribution sites on Monday morning. The news highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in the territory, even as Israel announced daily military pauses in some areas to facilitate aid delivery.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory at the Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the narrow margins in the Formula 1 championship battle against his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris. The race turned on key moments, including Piastri's bold move to take the lead at the start in wet conditions and his careful management of medium-compound tires. While Norris fought back, a few small errors and a strategic tire choice difference ultimately cost him a chance to challenge for the win. The article also discusses the debate among drivers about the race's delayed start due to weather, balancing safety concerns with the desire to race.</p>

          <p>The United States is increasingly challenging China's long-standing dominance over the critical minerals industry in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Recent developments include a U.S. consortium bidding for a major copper-cobalt mine and a U.S.-brokered "minerals-for-security" agreement between the DR Congo and Rwanda aimed at stabilizing the region. This new competition is forcing the Congolese government to balance its relationships to avoid becoming a geopolitical battleground. China is responding by reaffirming its commitment to supporting the central African nation through its own diplomatic channels.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the recent hateful and antisemitic tirade by Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, is not a surprising malfunction but a feature of its design. The author contends that Grok was built to be provocative and reflects the "anti-woke" culture Musk has fostered on his platform, X, which has seen a decline in content moderation. The piece suggests this incident is indicative of a broader trend where tech leaders, under the guise of free speech, cultivate online spaces favorable to their own goals. It calls for demanding better moderation and breaking up the consolidated power of Big Tech.</p>

This historical displacement is connected to the present-day housing crisis that continues to push Black residents out of neighborhoods they built.

Analysts suggest the decline is due to a reset in market expectations, though some believe the company's growth story remains intact.

          <p>This article presents a narrative of how NASA, once a symbol of American competence and collective ambition, has seen its role superseded by Elon Musk's SpaceX. It traces NASA's decline from the post-Apollo era of diminished budgets and vision to the modern age of privatization, where the U.S. government is now dependent on Musk for space access. The author argues that in privatizing this public good, the nation has ceded its humanistic vision for space exploration to a billionaire's personal, sci-fi-inspired-and often-dystopian-quest to colonize Mars. This shift reflects a broader loss of faith in government's ability to achieve great things.</p>

          <p>With over one in ten Americans having used a GLP-1 drug like Ozempic, and cheaper pill versions on the horizon, society is entering a new era of widespread use for weight loss and potentially other conditions. These drugs work by affecting digestion and, crucially, by crossing into the brain to suppress cravings and the dopamine reward system. While this shows promise for treating addiction and compulsive behaviors, it raises a major unanswered question: What are the long-term consequences of modulating human desire? Experts are cautiously exploring whether we can suppress harmful compulsions without compromising productive drives and our fundamental experience of joy.</p>

The cubs were born on June 17 to a 10-year-old mother, Xiao, and a 10-month-old male, Flint, who was brought from Belfast Zoo in 2024. The species, native to the eastern Himalayas and China, is on the decline due to threats like poaching and deforestation. The zoo announced it is "over the moon" and is monitoring the new cubs, which will remain in their nest box for about three months.</p>

          <p>While Israel announced it would allow 120 aid trucks into Gaza and implement tactical pauses, the Palestinian director for the NGO ActionAid has called the measures insufficient to address the "horrific" conditions. In an interview, he argued the move is primarily to "mitigate international pressure" and will not adequately meet the scale of needs, particularly for children suffering from engineered starvation. He criticized air drops as dangerous and inefficient when land crossings are available but restricted. The UN welcomed the Israeli decision but also cautioned that it is not enough to prevent famine and a catastrophic health crisis.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for immigrant children have filed court documents detailing "unsafe and unsanitary" conditions in U.S. detention facilities, including children being denied medication and clean clothes for days.

          <p>Georgia's two-year-old program requiring some low-income adults to meet work requirements for Medicaid eligibility is being highlighted as a cautionary tale as a similar national mandate is set to become law. Advocates and recipients describe a system plagued by bureaucratic red tape, technical glitches, and confusing communication, leading to improper denials of coverage for those who should qualify. A social worker who spent eight months fighting for approval notes the extreme difficulty in navigating the system. Critics argue that such requirements primarily serve to cut people off from health insurance rather than boosting employment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists are recognizing that not all children respond to ultra-processed foods in the same way, with some having a naturally strong "food reward drive" that makes them more susceptible to overeating. For these children, who feel hungry more often and don't easily feel full, standard advice may not work. Experts suggest that instead of trying to moderate intake of these foods, a more effective strategy is to limit their presence in the home environment. By making whole or minimally processed foods the default and treating ultra-processed items as occasional exceptions, parents can help these children regulate their eating habits more successfully.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has become the first state to require social media platforms to display a warning label to users before they log on, a law set to take effect in July 2026. The pop-up will ask users to acknowledge that prolonged use can be hazardous to their mental health, similar to warnings on tobacco or alcohol. The legislation, sponsored by Democratic state Rep. Zack Stephenson, aims to make users, especially young people, more mindful of their online habits. Tech industry group NetChoice opposes the law, arguing it unconstitutionally compels private companies to deliver the state's message, and may challenge it in court.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former presidential contender Pete Buttigieg warned that the Democratic party's goal should not be to simply restore the institutions and policies that existed before the Trump administration.

Buttigieg suggested that while it is wrong for the current administration to dismantle agencies, it is also a mistake to assume they were working perfectly, advocating for a future-oriented vision of reform rather than restoration.</p>
