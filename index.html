        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected a request from Learning Resources and hand2mind, two toy companies, to fast-track their challenge to President Trump's tariffs implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The companies argued that Trump lacked the authority to impose these tariffs without congressional approval, citing the tariffs' significant impact on businesses and consumers. Rick Woldenberg, the chairman and CEO of Learning Resources and hand2mind, expressed disappointment but affirmed the ultimate showdown would be at the Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of International Trade previously blocked Trump's tariffs, but a federal appeals court allowed them to remain in effect pending further arguments. The author's overall reflection is that the legal battle over Trump's tariffs continues to face setbacks, but the challenge will continue.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention, determining he is not a flight risk or a threat to the community. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained in March, and his attorneys argued his detention was "highly unusual." The judge criticized the Department of Homeland Security for detaining Khalil based on allegations he omitted details from his green card application and suggested the immigration charge was being used to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. The government is likely to appeal the decision, but the judge did not order electronic monitoring of Khalil.</p>

          <p>States are forfeiting hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue to attract data centers, benefiting tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. These tax breaks, often in the form of sales tax exemptions on equipment and energy, are intended to spur economic growth. However, watchdog groups argue that data centers don't create many jobs while consuming immense amounts of electricity. The growing number of tax breaks has sparked debate about whether these massive corporations should receive such generous incentives. (not investment advice)</p>
