          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Tianjin, pledging to resolve their long-standing border disputes. The meeting, Modi's first visit to China since deadly border clashes in 2020, took place ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Xi emphasized that the border issue should not define the entire relationship, urging a focus on mutual economic development and partnership. Both leaders expressed a desire for a stable and healthy bilateral relationship, with discussions on resuming direct flights and border talks having occurred in preceding weeks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese military researchers suggests that the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea could be transformed into a "submarine kill zone." The plan involves using intelligent sea mines hidden in "acoustic shadow zones" created by the rugged underwater mountains. These sonar dead zones would allow the mines to evade detection and selectively target enemy vessels, potentially challenging U.S. naval dominance in the region. The research highlights the strategic importance of undersea topography for enhancing the concealment and effectiveness of underwater weaponry for maritime security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide surge in popularity for matcha has led to significant supply shortages and price increases, even in its native Japan. Driven by its reputation as a superfood on social media and a post-pandemic tourism boom, demand has outstripped the capacity of Japan's aging farming communities. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used for matcha, has skyrocketed, forcing retailers to ration supplies and producers to struggle with production bottlenecks. Companies like Ito En are creating dedicated matcha divisions to manage the intense competition for sourcing and milling the green tea powder.</p>

          <p>As investors return from summer holidays, they face September, which has historically been the worst-performing month for major U.S. stock indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones. This follows a strong August where markets reached new record highs, creating a sense of caution. While some analysts believe the equity bull market will continue, supported by a potential economic soft landing, others are more wary, pointing to underlying pressures on the U.S. economy. Key economic data, including inflation and non-farm payrolls, will be closely watched to gauge market direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made female billionaire, attributes her entrepreneurial drive to a frugal upbringing that motivated her from a young age. Before founding the successful AI data-labeling company Scale AI, Guo engaged in various money-making schemes, from trading Pokémon cards on the playground to selling virtual items online. She dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, a decision that initially disappointed her immigrant parents but ultimately led to her immense success.

          <h2>UK Government Data Highlights Critical Importance of First-Week School Attendance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New figures from the UK's Department for Education reveal a strong link between school attendance in the first week of the academic year and long-term truancy. According to the data, 57% of pupils who were absent during the first week in September 2024 later became "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged parents and schools to prioritize attendance at the start of the new term to combat this trend, which has worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic. While attendance has improved from its post-pandemic peak, it remains a significant concern for educators.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Reform party in the UK is importing Donald Trump's confrontational tactics towards the press, citing a recent ban on the Nottingham Post by the Reform-led Nottinghamshire county council. The author draws parallels between this action and the Trump administration's history of restricting access for journalists from outlets that publish critical coverage. The piece suggests that hard-right politicians increasingly feel they can bypass traditional media and even benefit from making the press a foil in a broader anti-establishment narrative. However, it also notes that such tactics may not be as effective in the UK's political culture.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a Trump appointee who served as the political head of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), has stepped down after four months, stating his "mission accomplished." His role was to reposition the U.S. foreign aid agency as a strategic investment tool focused on countering Chinese influence and generating returns for the United States. Created in 2004, the MCC provides infrastructure and energy compacts to developing nations, and under the Trump administration, its focus has shifted from traditional aid to strategic investments in areas like critical minerals.

Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a difficult debut, and the running game was largely ineffective, with the team unable to consistently execute its new scheme.

This creative, non-lethal method is part of an effort to find ways for ranchers and the recovering wolf population to coexist, as conflicts have increased with the species' return from near-extinction.

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has canceled his planned trip to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in China due to ongoing "domestic dynamics." A presidential spokesman stated that Prabowo needed to remain in the country to monitor the situation and find solutions to the unspecified internal issues. In response to the unrest in Indonesia, the Chinese embassy in Jakarta has issued a security warning, advising its citizens to improve precautions and avoid protest areas. Prabowo was scheduled to attend the summit in Tianjin before joining a Victory Day military parade in Beijing later in the week.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly opposed plans for a new Home Depot in Eagle Rock, accusing the retailer of being complicit in federal immigration raids. The statement follows a recent operation where federal agents targeted day laborers and vendors near a Home Depot in Westlake, one of several such raids since June. Jurado argued that by remaining silent as its parking lots become sites for these enforcement actions, the company has chosen "power and profit over the working people." Home Depot responded that it is not notified of planned ICE operations and is required to follow all federal and local regulations.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order seeks to bar city departments, including the police, from participating in federal actions and urges federal agents to wear clear identification and not use masks. This move is a response to concerns that the Trump administration might send militarized federal forces to the city, similar to actions seen in other cities. The mayor stated the city will use all available legal tools to counter federal efforts that could violate residents' constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the case of Dino Guglielmelli, a millionaire vitamin supplement entrepreneur who was convicted of attempting to hire a hit man to murder his wife, model Monica Olsen. Amid a contentious divorce, Guglielmelli offered his associate, Rick Fuhrmann, $80,000 to kill Olsen. However, Fuhrmann instead went to the police and agreed to wear a wire, capturing Guglielmelli confirming his intentions on tape. The recording became the key piece of evidence, leading Guglielmelli to plead guilty to second-degree attempted murder, for which he served over six years in prison before being released on parole.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans opened their football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, marking their highest point total in a game since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was sharp, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime, while the offense never had to punt. The defense also showed significant improvement from last season, recording five sacks and a pick-six by safety Bishop Fitzgerald. While the performance was dominant, it came against a much weaker Football Championship Subdivision opponent, making it a smooth start but an imperfect measure of the team's true capabilities.</p>
