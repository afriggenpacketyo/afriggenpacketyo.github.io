          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 Pacifica and Voyager minivans from model years 2022-2025 due to a potential airbag defect. The side curtain airbags may have improperly sealed seams, which could prevent them from holding enough pressure during deployment in certain crashes, increasing injury risk. The company has stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this issue and is urging owners to follow recall instructions. Dealers will inspect and replace the airbags for free if necessary.</p>

          <p>Despite a police ban and threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, tens of thousands participated in the Budapest Pride march, with organizers estimating a record turnout. The event has become a symbol of resistance against the government's restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights and broader civil liberties in Hungary. Budapest's mayor declared the parade a municipal event to circumvent the ban, and the march received significant support from over 30 embassies and numerous European officials. The defiance comes amid a growing political challenge to Orban's nationalist government.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators gathered in Bangkok, calling for Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra to resign over her handling of a border dispute with Cambodia. The protests, organized by a nationalist group, stem from a recent border skirmish and a leaked phone call in which the prime minister's comments were seen as deferential to a Cambodian official. The long-standing dispute centers on the historic Preah Vihear temple, which an international court ruled belongs to Cambodia. The incident has fueled domestic political pressure on Shinawatra's government.</p>

          <p>The victory of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's mayoral primary has exposed a significant rift within the Democratic party. Moderate Democrats and business leaders are reportedly strategizing to prevent his election in November, with some considering backing an independent challenger. In contrast, progressive figures and former Mayor Bill de Blasio have voiced support, arguing Mamdani's platform represents the majority's will. Mamdani is now engaging with concerned business executives while prominent national Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have shown openness to his leadership.</p>

England's response was faltering, as they were bowled out for 113, marking their heaviest T20 defeat in terms of runs.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their tour of Australia with a decisive victory over the Western Force, scoring over 50 points.

Head coach Andy Farrell expressed concern over the injury, which could necessitate calling up a replacement. The match also highlighted areas for improvement, particularly a high penalty count in the first half, which Farrell attributed to players' overeagerness to make an impression on the tour's opening game.</p>

The 940-page bill aims to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts and introduce new ones, but divisions remain within the party over proposed cuts to welfare programs. To win over holdouts, leadership has included increased funding for rural hospitals and modified the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions.

          <p>A 70-year-old Egyptian man has pleaded guilty to harming a law enforcement animal after kicking a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) beagle at Washington Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred when the 5-year-old beagle, Freddie, alerted his handler to the man's suitcase during a baggage inspection. The man was found to be smuggling over 100 pounds of undeclared agricultural products, including beef and various seeds. He was ordered to pay the dog's veterinary bills for its bruised ribs and was subsequently ordered to be removed back to Egypt.</p>

          <p>A recent Ukrainian drone strike, dubbed "Operation Spider Web," successfully destroyed or damaged numerous strategic bombers deep inside Russian territory, highlighting a major shift in modern warfare. The operation used small, remote-controlled drones smuggled into Russia, which were then launched by operators near the targets. This low-cost strategy effectively neutralizes high-value assets far from the front lines, challenging the traditional military concept of safe rear areas. The article suggests this playbook could be replicated, forcing major air forces to rethink base security and accept that their runways are now a new front line.</p>

The piece suggests that to move forward, Democrats must escape the "circular nightmares of the recent past" and quickly begin the process of identifying new national leadership for the 2028 election cycle.</p>
