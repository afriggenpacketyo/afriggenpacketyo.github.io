          <p>Leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, along with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, are pressing Russian President Putin to agree to a 30-day cease-fire, coordinated with the White House, or face increased sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors. The European leaders said they would discuss ways to strengthen the Ukrainian military to ensure that any future peace deal proves enduring through what they have been calling a ‚Äúcoalition of the willing.‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov dismissed the threat of new sanctions, stating Russia is accustomed to such pressure.
