        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a four-day conflict involving drones, missiles, and intense shelling, India and Pakistan have agreed to a cease-fire, with President Trump claiming U.S. mediation played a role, though India downplayed this. While Pakistan praised the American role, India avoided acknowledging outside pressure, framing the truce as a result of direct negotiations. Both countries are presenting the outcome as a victory, with supporters of Prime Minister Modi highlighting India's tougher stance on terrorism after a deadly attack in Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan, while Pakistani analysts claim their air force demonstrated operational superiority, although uncertainty remains about the long-term stability of the cease-fire. The article highlights the differing narratives and lingering tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made 'substantial progress' in de-escalating the trade war after high-level talks in Geneva, Switzerland. These discussions, the first since President Trump levied steep tariffs in January, have sparked optimism for a potential trade truce that could lift financial markets and ease global economic concerns. While details remain undisclosed until Monday, both sides have hinted at a willingness to lower tariffs, which currently stand at 145% on Chinese imports and 125% on some US goods, disrupting global supply chains. The article notes that Washington would not lower tariffs unilaterally, and China would need to make its own concessions.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's President Zelensky responded cautiously to Russia's offer of direct talks, stressing the need for an immediate cease-fire first, while Russia's President Putin proposed talks in Istanbul. European leaders have set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions, a move backed by President Trump, who questioned whether either side genuinely wants a deal. President Macron stated that Putin is stalling and wants to buy time. Despite the diplomatic efforts, Russia resumed long-range drone attacks on Ukraine, launching 108 Iranian-designed Shahed drones, underscoring the fragile nature of the situation and the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's recent BBC interview expressing a desire to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has reignited attention on the ongoing rift within the royal family. This has overshadowed King Charles's public engagements, including marking the 80th anniversary of V-E Day and preparing for a trip to Canada. The palace has pushed back against Harry's claims regarding his security arrangements in Britain, and the article suggests that resolving this family division could be crucial for King Charles's reign and the monarchy's image. Prince William is taking on a more prominent public role amid his father's illness and the estrangement of Prince Harry.</p>

          <p>A bomb exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers in Peshawar, Pakistan, resulting in the deaths of two officers and injuries to three others. The attack occurred near a roadside open market, and while no group has claimed responsibility, suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP, allied with the Afghan Taliban, often targets security forces and civilians, and many of its leaders and fighters have found sanctuary in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, emboldening the group.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are defending their actions at an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, arguing that the Trump administration is 'weaponizing law enforcement.' Representatives McIver, Watson Coleman, and Menendez claim they were justified in their actions, alleging that officials instructed ICE to detain Newark's mayor. McIver denied accusations of assaulting law enforcement officers, and Menendez argued that ICE officers could have de-escalated the situation. While admitting that the inmates were well-treated, the lawmakers objected to ICE detentions, and DHS officials have not confirmed any pending charges against those accused of storming the center.</p>

While the Taliban's sports directorate claims chess is 'considered a means of gambling' in Islamic sharia law, a Kabul cafe owner expressed concern that the ban will negatively affect his business, as young people have few recreational activities available.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8, valued at approximately $400 million, as a gift from Qatar's royal family, leading to accusations of bribery and corruption. The Trump administration has reportedly determined that accepting the gift is legally permissible, as it is purportedly not conditioned on any official act. The jumbo jet would be used as Air Force One until shortly before the conclusion of his second Oval Office stint, at which point it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation. Critics argue that the gift violates the Constitution and constitutes bribery, especially given the Trump Organization's recent golf course deal in Qatar.</p>

          <p>A recent Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Walton Goggins as a waiter excessively flirting with middle-aged mothers has sparked debate about the show's portrayal of motherhood and sexuality. While the sketch aimed to challenge the stereotype that mothers are undesirable, some critics argue that it reinforced the idea that older women are the butt of the joke. Another sketch during Weekend Update further solidified the view that motherhood is antithetical to sexuality, undermining the idea that women's sex lives continue after giving birth. The article suggests that SNL missed an opportunity to offer a more expansive and refreshing view of motherhood.</p>

The team's inconsistent away form and Nicolas Jackson's reckless red card, which will see him miss the pivotal final games, have added to the challenge. Chelsea's head coach, Enzo Maresca, faces scrutiny, and success this season will be judged on whether they qualify for the Champions League. Winning the Europa Conference League may not be enough to satisfy the club's ambitions given their vast financial outlay.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called on Ukraine to immediately agree to direct talks with Russia in an effort to end the ongoing conflict. This comes after President Zelensky indicated a willingness to meet with Russian representatives, contingent upon an unconditional cease-fire. Trump expressed doubt about Ukraine's willingness to make a deal with Putin and urged them to accept the meeting invitation. Turkish President Erdogan has also offered to host the talks, but analysts caution that the calls for talks may be a delaying tactic from Putin.</p>

          <p>The recent cease-fire between India and Pakistan follows a chaotic four-day clash marked by new military technology, including weaponized drones and missile strikes. The conflict, fueled by entrenched religious nationalism on both sides, raises concerns about future escalations. External intervention played a crucial role in halting the conflict, but the political realities in both countries remain unchanged. India's assertive stance and the dominance of the military establishment in Pakistan contribute to the potential for renewed tensions and the need for continued international diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that the UK will end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader crackdown on visas for lower-skilled workers. The government aims to cut net migration by requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The changes are expected to reduce up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year. Alongside visa changes, there will be new requirements for training commitments to get people who are not working back into the labor market in the UK.</p>
