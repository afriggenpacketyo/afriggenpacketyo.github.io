          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 10:49:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a new federal court filing, the IRS has stated that churches can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This move challenges the long-standing Johnson Amendment, which has historically barred non-profits, including houses of worship, from engaging in political campaign activities. The filing is part of a motion to resolve a lawsuit brought by the National Religious Broadcasters and two churches who argued the amendment violated their First Amendment rights. A judge has not yet ruled on the proposed consent judgment, which could significantly alter the relationship between religion and politics.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to the deaths of at least 105 people, with dozens still missing after the Guadalupe River rose to unprecedented levels. The disaster has been particularly tragic for Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, where a significant number of fatalities occurred. In response, President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, enabling federal resources to aid in the massive, round-the-clock search and rescue operations. Officials are grappling with the scale of the destruction, which they state was caused by an unforeseeable amount of rainfall.</p>

          <p>According to a Harvard-trained psychologist, couples who have strong emotional security and trust often use specific phrases in their daily interactions. These expressions, such as "I trust you" and "We'll get through this," are indicative of a healthy connection where both partners feel safe and accepted. The article explains that this security is built on believing your partner is committed, compassionate, and has your best interests at heart. Fostering this environment allows for vulnerability, independence, and effective communication, which are foundational to a lasting relationship.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that six Republican representatives from Arizona sold out their constituents by voting for Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The author contends that the congressmen supported the legislation, which provides immediate tax breaks for the wealthy, knowing that its most painful provisions, like $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, will not take effect until after the 2026 midterm elections. The piece asserts that this vote prioritizes political loyalty to Trump over the well-being of millions of Arizonans who rely on the state's health care system.</p>

          <p>A new Harvard study suggests that adopting a plant-based diet, even in middle age, can significantly increase the likelihood of healthy aging. The research, which followed over 100,000 people for 30 years, found a strong association between diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes and being free of chronic disease after age 70. The study identified the Alternative Healthy Eating Index as the dietary pattern most associated with positive health outcomes. These findings suggest that plant-forward eating can enhance overall wellness and longevity.</p>

Officials attribute this trend to heightened security concerns following the war in Ukraine, which has motivated more young people to serve. This comes as the German military aims to recruit up to 60,000 additional soldiers in the coming years to meet NATO demands. To achieve this goal, the defense minister is considering measures to make service more attractive and has not ruled out reactivating compulsory service.</p>
