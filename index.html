          <p>A SkyWest pilot informed passengers he performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft while approaching Minot, North Dakota. The incident, which surprised the pilot due to a lack of radar information from the tower, is under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration. Passengers described the sudden jolt, highlighting concerns about air traffic control communication. The Air Force confirmed the B-52 was performing a pre-approved flyover, but the tower did not advise the B-52 crew of the inbound commercial aircraft.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's "megabill" exposed deep internal divisions within the House Republican conference, requiring extensive negotiations and a "charm offensive" from Trump to secure votes. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer detailed the arduous, sleepless efforts to unite hard-line conservatives and deficit hawks, who often preferred direct deals with the White House over party leadership. The legislative saga, marked by backroom concessions and record-long votes, highlights unpredictable dynamics that could complicate future high-profile fights, including the upcoming government funding deadline.</p>

          <p>The European Union is reportedly considering deploying its "Anti-Coercion Instrument" (ACI), dubbed a "trade bazooka," as a potential last resort against the Trump administration's looming 30% tariffs on EU imports. The ACI, created in 2023 but never used, allows the EU to restrict US suppliers' access to its market, including public tenders, and impose export/import limits on goods and services. This measure signals the EU's readiness to escalate trade disputes beyond counter-tariffs if a deal is not reached by the August 1 deadline, aiming to deter perceived economic coercion.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has reportedly surpassed tech giants like Elon Musk and Tim Cook in political influence within the Trump administration, particularly concerning US-China trade policy.

This shift highlights the growing importance of AI chips in the global tech landscape and Huang's strategic navigation of political complexities.

          <p>New research from the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests that 11% of Trump voters, primarily working-class individuals, could be swayed back to the Democratic Party. The study indicates these voters are "economic egalitarians" who support populist economic policies like raising the minimum wage and protecting jobs, but hold more socially moderate views than the Democratic Party's current base. The article proposes a "social populism" strategy, combining a worker-focused economic agenda with an embrace of working-class social attitudes, as the key to building a durable Democratic majority.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace health plans could experience significant premium increases in 2026 if pandemic-era enhanced subsidies expire as scheduled. This "subsidy cliff" would eliminate premium tax credits for those whose incomes exceed certain thresholds, potentially raising costs by hundreds of dollars monthly. While President Trump's recent "big beautiful bill" made 2017 tax cuts permanent, it did not extend these ACA enhancements. Financial experts advise enrollees to project their 2025 and 2026 incomes and explore strategies to reduce taxable income to mitigate the impact. (not investment advice)</p>
