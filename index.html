The staff cuts, which affected over 1,300 employees, led to the closure of several civil rights offices and the elimination of the team overseeing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.

          <p>Annuities convert a lump sum into guaranteed monthly payments, providing predictable income in retirement, however, payouts vary based on factors like age, gender, and investment amount. Payments generally increase with age, and men often receive higher payouts than women due to differing life expectancies. Annuities are beneficial for those needing guaranteed income and peace of mind, but they require careful consideration as the lump sum is typically inaccessible afterward. Shopping around is advised to find the best features and payout amounts. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite its success, changing media habits mean the song hasn't reached the ubiquitous level of past long-running hits.
