          <h2>Minister Acknowledges Winter Fuel Payment Cuts Impacted Election Results</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 05:58:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted that restricting winter fuel payments negatively impacted Labour's support in recent local elections, acknowledging voter dissatisfaction. Despite the backlash, Streeting maintained that the decision was necessary to invest in public services amid inherited crises. He noted the government is reflecting on voter feedback but has not formally reviewed the policy, which saves Â£1.4 billion by limiting payments to pensioners receiving pension credit. The move, affecting around 9 million pensioners, has faced criticism for not being included in Labour's election manifesto, contributing to the party's loss of council seats.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is contemplating restricting visa applications from countries such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, aiming to reduce asylum claims made by individuals who initially enter the UK on work or study visas. Ministers believe some individuals abuse the system by switching to asylum claims shortly after arriving, seeking permanent residency. While the Home Office has not released recent exit check statistics, they plan to release a comprehensive immigration white paper outlining strategies to restore order to the immigration system. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer has also pledged to reduce both legal and illegal migration, focusing on criminalizing actions that endanger lives at sea and developing training programs to decrease reliance on migrant workers.</p>

          <p>Former Runcorn MP Mike Amesbury attributed Labour's recent election losses, including his former seat falling to Reform UK, to "big political mistakes" regarding benefit cuts. Amesbury specifically pointed to the decisions to reduce winter fuel payments for pensioners and tighten eligibility for personal independence payments (PIPs) as key factors. While acknowledging his own role in triggering the by-election due to his resignation, he emphasized that the significant swing to Reform UK reflected broader dissatisfaction with government policies. Amesbury urged Prime Minister Starmer and Chancellor Reeves to listen, learn, and respond to the concerns raised by voters.</p>

          <p>Hugo Boss shares experienced a surge after the fashion retailer reported a smaller-than-anticipated decline in first-quarter sales, reaffirming its full-year projections despite macroeconomic and tariff concerns. The company's revenues decreased by 2% on a currency-adjusted basis, totaling 999 million euros ($1.13 billion), surpassing analysts' forecasts. Weaker sales were primarily attributed to decreased demand in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in China, due to an uncertain consumer outlook. Despite these challenges, CEO Daniel Grieder confirmed the company's 2025 outlook, projecting full-year sales between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros.</p>

          <p>In an unexpected turn, Germany's conservative leader, Friedrich Merz, failed to secure a majority in the parliamentary vote for chancellor, receiving only 310 of the required 316 votes in the 630-seat Bundestag. This setback occurred despite his coalition with the centre-left holding enough seats, suggesting dissent among 18 MPs expected to support him. The failed vote is unprecedented in modern German history, with the Bundestag now having 14 days to elect Merz or another candidate. Political commentators view this as a humiliation for Merz, potentially inflicted by members of the Social Democrat SPD, which recently formed a coalition deal with his conservatives.</p>

It highlights Trump's history of pushing outlandish ideas into mainstream discourse and his demonstrated disdain for constitutional checks on presidential power, such as ignoring judges' rulings and questioning birthright citizenship.

Peek argues that the Democratic Party's lack of visible leadership and a clear message beyond opposition to Donald Trump could explain the renewed interest in Harris, despite her low approval ratings and perceived alignment with the far-left wing of the party.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deep funding cuts are undermining efforts to combat the HIV epidemic in the Southern United States, reversing progress made during his first term. Community-based groups and health departments are scaling back HIV testing and outreach due to slashed federal funds, impacting historically underserved communities. The Trump administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs has led to millions of dollars in federal grants being cut to organizations that do HIV work. Experts warn that these cuts will lead to a rise in new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths, with the South being particularly vulnerable due to high poverty levels and limited access to health care.</p>

          <p>Aya Al-Hattab, a resident of Gaza, describes the severe food shortages and hunger she and others are experiencing due to the Israeli blockade. She recounts going days without food and witnessing empty markets and scarce vegetables, which is a stark contrast to their previous life of enjoying delicious meals without worry. Al-Hattab emphasizes that this is not poverty but famine, caused by the Israeli occupation, and that children are beginning to die of hunger. She laments the collective punishment and the loss of basic human rights, as well as the fear of death from various causes, including starvation and lack of medical care.</p>

          <p>South Korea's government investigation into human rights violations in past international adoptions has stalled, with adoptees and advocates blaming politicization and a lack of understanding within the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The commission, which previously acknowledged government responsibility in facilitating falsified adoption documents, has put 311 cases on hold due to internal disagreements. Adoptees, who petitioned for the investigation, had hoped it would help them trace their roots and validate their struggles with adoption agencies and the government. The suspension raises concerns that the issue of adoptees' human rights has become entangled in domestic political disputes.</p>

          <p>After 20 years, the REAL ID deadline has arrived, requiring states to issue IDs that are harder to counterfeit and verify the information they contain. The law, intended to avoid a national ID card, faced resistance from states citing cost, privacy, and documentation burdens. As a result, there are various "flavors" of REAL ID, with most states using a star symbol to indicate compliance. Millions have yet to apply for REAL ID versions, and the system is now under attack from the Trump Administration, which is pressuring states that issue licenses to residents without checking immigration status.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney amidst heightened tensions caused by Trump's tariffs and suggestions of making Canada the "51st state." Carney, who won the recent Canadian election, has warned against Trump's rhetoric, stating that America seeks to exploit Canada's resources and land. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of annexing Canada, citing trade deficits as justification. Experts suggest that Trump's remarks helped the Liberal Party in Canada recover from a deficit in popular opinion, underscoring the significant shift in attitudes toward the U.S. in response to the Trump administration's initiatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump's expansion of military involvement in immigration enforcement is testing the limits of the Posse Comitatus Act, a law designed to restrict the use of federal troops in civilian law enforcement. By designating a 170-mile stretch of federal land along the southern border as a military installation, Trump is allowing military personnel to temporarily detain and search individuals, effectively bypassing the Act. Experts raise concerns about the lack of clarity on the authorized use of force and the potential for undermining military readiness by blurring the lines between military and law enforcement roles. The situation is further complicated by Trump's framing of the border situation as an "invasion."</p>

With a focus on cutting Medicaid and SNAP benefits, the group aims to save tax dollars and encourage self-sufficiency. Critics argue that FGA's proposals are a backdoor way to cut off aid to those who need it, advocating instead for making healthy food and health care more affordable.

          <p>Critics argue that despite Attorney General Pam Bondi's vows to end the purported weaponization of the Justice Department, it is being politicized under her leadership to serve President Trump's interests. Former pardon attorney Liz Oyer claims the DOJ is being transformed into Trump's personal law firm, pursuing enemies and doing favors for friends, while career professionals are marginalized. Examples include the firing of prosecutors who worked on Capitol riot cases, the dropping of cases against Trump's allies, and the reversal of a decision to restore gun rights to Mel Gibson, a Trump supporter.

UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that these expanded operations would lead to more civilian deaths and destruction.

While the offer price of 180p per share represents a 44% increase on Deliveroo's share price from when takeover talks became public, it is significantly below the 390p share price at its initial public offering in 2021.

However, the complexity of the globalized film industry and the ambiguity of how the tariff would be implemented have raised questions about its feasibility and potential impact. The article suggests that the primary goal of the proposal is to provoke the media and create uncertainty, potentially damaging the industry even if the tariffs are not enacted.</p>

Despite a rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic, the recovery is losing momentum due to stalled life expectancy and income growth, as well as an increasing number of ongoing conflicts. The UNDP chief warned that this slowdown could reverse decades of progress and make the world more vulnerable to economic and ecological shocks.
