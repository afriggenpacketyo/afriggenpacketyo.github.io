          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), urging the bloc to promote an “equal and orderly multipolar world.” He criticized hegemonism and power politics, stating that certain countries prioritize selfish interests over the international community.

          <p>Germany is facing significant delays in upgrading its national power grid to support its rapid expansion of renewable energy sources. The high-voltage lines needed to transport wind power from the north to industrial centers in the south are progressing too slowly due to bureaucratic hurdles, lengthy approval processes, and debates over costs. Experts and grid operators warn that these infrastructural challenges are a major impediment to achieving the country's climate-neutral energy goals.</p>

          <p>Iranian authorities have intercepted and seized a foreign tanker in the Gulf of Oman, accusing its crew of smuggling two million liters of fuel. The chief justice of Hormozgan province stated that the vessel's cargo documents were incomplete and that 17 crew members have been taken into custody. This action is part of Iran's ongoing crackdown on fuel smuggling, a persistent issue driven by the country's heavily subsidized domestic fuel prices.</p>

          <p>Nearly one million customers of Southern Water are now under a hosepipe ban affecting Hampshire and the Isle of Wight due to prolonged dry weather. The company cited "critically low levels" in the rivers that supply the region's water. The move has drawn criticism, as the company loses millions of liters of water daily through leaks, a problem for which it was previously fined. This measure follows similar restrictions imposed by several other UK water companies.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has called on the Justice Department to release all "credible" information related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, a move that comes amid significant pressure from his own political base. Many of his supporters have been demanding transparency and fueling conspiracy theories about a suppressed list of Epstein's clients. The issue has caused friction within the Republican party, with some prominent figures, including his daughter-in-law, echoing calls for full disclosure.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's recent shift to supply Ukraine with anti-missile systems and threaten Russia is driven by financial persuasion rather than strategic solidarity. The author suggests that NATO members' commitment to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP and to fund the aid for Kyiv framed the support as a good deal for the U.S. This analysis posits that while Trump remains an unreliable ally, these financial commitments have successfully influenced his administration's policy.</p>
