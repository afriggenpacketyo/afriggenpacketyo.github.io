          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth unmanned test flight of the Starship spacecraft from its Starbase facility in Texas, aiming to achieve key objectives such as deploying Starlink satellite simulators and performing a Raptor engine relight in space. Previous test flights experienced hardware failures, leading to the destruction of the spacecraft and debris falling across South Florida and the Atlantic. This flight incorporates significant modifications based on lessons learned, including testing different thermal tile options and materials during reentry. The company aims for Starship to be fully reusable, capable of launching, landing, and flying again with minimal maintenance, marking a crucial step toward Elon Musk's goal of sending humans to Mars. The Super Heavy booster will follow a modified flight path, splashing down in the Gulf after testing new configurations.</p>

          <p>The US State Department, under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has ordered foreign missions to temporarily halt scheduling new appointments for student and exchange visitor visas. This decision aligns with the department's plans to broaden social media vetting of foreign students. This pause will remain in effect until further guidance is provided, impacting potential international students seeking to study in the United States.

          <p>Kelly Wakefield, a professional gardener, stumbled upon a hidden metal box containing coins, antiques, and a map while cleaning a public park in St. Albans, Vermont. The treasure chest was intentionally hidden by Michael Cloherty O’Connell, the author of two history books that lead readers on scavenger hunts around the Northeast. O'Connell, a retired history buff, used his retirement funds to create these treasure hunts, hoping to engage readers with American history. The hidden chests collectively contain antiques worth upward of $100,000, and Wakefield intends to participate in more treasure hunts this summer, inspired by her discovery.</p>

          <p>The White House has condemned Representative Glenn Ivey, D-Md., for his Memorial Day trip to El Salvador, where he attempted to visit Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a deported illegal immigrant suspected of MS-13 involvement. The White House called the trip "shameful" and an insult to the American people, accusing Democrats of prioritizing criminal illegals over American citizens. Abrego Garcia's deportation has been controversial, with the Trump administration citing his alleged gang ties and history of abuse, while Democrats claim he was denied due process. This incident follows similar trips by other Democrats, sparking debate over advocating for a suspected gang member unlawfully present in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Internal data from the U.S. Marshals Service reveals a significant increase in threats against federal judges, particularly since President Trump took office. Between March 1 and April 14, 162 judges received threats, a sharp rise from the 80 judges threatened in the preceding five months. The spike coincided with harsh rhetoric from Mr. Trump criticizing judges who ruled against his administration, leading many to worry about potential violence. The Marshals Service defines a threat as any action or communication indicating intent to assault or interfere with a protected person, with the rise in threats prompting calls for political leaders to tone down their rhetoric.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his intention to take mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal conservatorship. This move has garnered support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believe it could benefit taxpayers and the housing market. However, critics such as Senator Elizabeth Warren warn that privatization could raise mortgage rates and reward Wall Street at the expense of homebuyers. The Trump administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency to advance homeownership, but any actions will be carefully evaluated to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Curtis Jackson III, also known as 50 Cent, has been granted permission to seize the Connecticut home of Mitchell Green, a former executive who confessed to embezzling from Jackson's Sire Spirits company. The legal battle, spanning over four years, concluded with a federal judge lifting an automatic stay that had prevented the property transfer. Green's embezzlement, involving kickbacks from wholesalers, led to a $7 million debt, which the home seizure will partially offset. Amidst this legal victory, Jackson has also been publicly mocking Sean “Diddy” Combs, who is currently facing a federal sex trafficking trial.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that the Colorado River basin has lost 27.8 million acre-feet of groundwater in the last 20 years, nearly equivalent to the full capacity of Lake Mead. The research, based on NASA satellite imagery, underscores the severity of the water crisis in the southwestern United States, with groundwater disappearing at 2.4 times the rate of surface water. Overpumping, particularly for agriculture, is the primary cause of groundwater losses, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The Colorado River basin provides water to approximately 40 million people across seven US states, as well as to millions of acres of farmland.</p>

          <p>A Florida man, Timothy Schulz, was killed by sheriff’s deputies after being bitten by an alligator, entering a gated community, and charging at them with garden shears. The incident began early on Memorial Day when Schulz was reported acting strangely at a gas station before swimming across a lake known for alligators. Deputies responded to reports of a man with shears attempting to break into a vehicle, and after attempting to subdue him with a Taser, they fatally shot him when he tried to take a weapon from their cruiser. The Polk County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop in April, plummeting 49% year-on-year, attributed to brand damage and increasing competition. This decline occurred despite an overall rise in battery electric car sales in Europe. Tesla's brand value and reputation have suffered due to CEO Elon Musk's controversial rhetoric and political activities, including endorsements of far-right parties. Simultaneously, Tesla faces growing competition from traditional automakers and aggressive Chinese players, while European consumers show a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted the deportation of Eyidi Ambila, a Maine resident from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who claims he was illegally detained by ICE for eight months. The ACLU filed a habeas corpus petition arguing that ICE had held Ambila illegally without providing information about their plans for him. Judge Woodcock issued an emergency ruling preventing Ambila's deportation, citing the lack of evidence that the DRC would accept him and the federal government's failure to secure travel papers since 2007. The ruling allows Ambila to maintain contact with his lawyers and challenges his circumstances in court.</p>
