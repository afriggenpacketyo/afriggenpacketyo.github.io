            <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, has been found guilty in her federal bribery trial, mirroring her husband's conviction on similar charges. Prosecutors successfully argued that the couple acted as "partners in crime," accepting cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for political favors. The defense contended that there was no concrete evidence linking Nadine to her husband's illicit activities. Nadine Menendez faces sentencing in June, coinciding with her husband's scheduled prison reporting date to serve his 11-year sentence.</p>

            <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance has agreed to a $300 million settlement concerning allegations that it unlawfully filled millions of invalid prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances. The Justice Department claimed that Walgreens pharmacists knowingly filled prescriptions despite clear signs of illegitimacy, and that the company pressured its workers to fill prescriptions quickly without regard for proper legal protocols. Walgreens denies liability, stating that its pharmacists are dedicated healthcare professionals committed to patient safety and combating opioid misuse.

            <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations, with immigrants' rights groups arguing that the 24-hour notice given to those facing deportation is insufficient. The ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network argue that many of those detained lack access to legal counsel and may not understand English. The Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportations, and the legal battle centers on the due process rights of migrants facing removal from the U.S.</p>

            <p>With credit card debt at record highs and interest rates hovering near 22%, consolidating debt into a lower-rate loan can be an effective strategy for those struggling with high-rate credit card debt. The effectiveness of debt consolidation largely depends on your credit profile. If you have good to excellent credit, you may qualify for the lowest consolidation loan rates. It's crucial to address any underlying spending issues. Without changes in behavior, you risk accumulating new debt on top of the consolidation loan. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. dollar continued its slide on Monday, falling to its lowest level since 2022, as global investors retreat from U.S. assets in the face of tension between President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve. Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week, along with White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett saying the president and his team are exploring whether they can remove the central bank chief, appear to have put even more pressure on the greenback. Investors are showing a clear signal that they do not like the idea of the president trying to remove the Fed chair. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on US central bank boss calling him "a major loser" for not lowering interest rates. Trump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. The S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's cost-cutting measures have led to the layoffs of federal mediators, raising concerns about the resolution of labor disputes. Terminations at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service have fueled concern among unions and employers alike about who will step in to help ease labor conflicts in Southern California and beyond. The agency plays a vital role in helping to settle disputes so as to avoid labor unrest that can disrupt the free flow of commerce. A lawsuit has been filed against the Trump administration to reverse the closure.</p>

            <p>DHL will stop shipping packages over $800 in value to U.S. consumers in response to new, more stringent U.S. customs rules. The carrier cited the 10% tariffs implemented by the Trump administration in early April, which it says had the effect of subjecting parcels worth over $800 to increased scrutiny by U.S. customs inspectors. That has led to shipping backlogs, DHL said. The new policy applies to packages sent from any foreign country to U.S. consumers.</p>

            <p>The University of Louisville canceled its Lavender Graduation ceremony for LGBTQ+ students due to new federal and state policies restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices. Kentucky House Bill 4, which bans DEI initiatives at public universities, prompted the cancellation. The Trump administration has also urged schools to ban DEI programs or risk losing federal funding. The University of Kentucky also canceled its Lavender Graduation, as well as the Harambe Unity Celebration Graduation honoring Black graduates and the First-Generation Student Pinning Ceremony.</p>
