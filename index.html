          <p>Representative Sara Jacobs argues that military families deserve comprehensive in vitro fertilization (IVF) coverage, citing the higher rates of infertility among service members due to the physical and emotional demands of their service. She highlights the financial burden of IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and introduces the "IVF for Military Families Act" to require TRICARE to cover infertility diagnosis and treatment. Jacobs criticizes the lack of Republican support for the bill and urges President Trump to support military families by expanding IVF coverage, emphasizing that military families have earned and deserve this access to reproductive care. </p>

          <p>Mounting trade tensions are causing consumers to reduce their spending on non-essential items. A study indicates that a significant majority of consumers will cut back on non-essential purchases if their financial situation worsens. Many adults are planning to spend less on travel, dining, and live entertainment this year compared to the previous year. Analysts suggest that consumers may no longer be able to absorb higher prices resulting from trade tensions, leading to a decrease in discretionary spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is currently grappling with a severe lead poisoning crisis, forcing multiple schools to temporarily close due to contamination. The crisis emerged after a child tested positive for high lead levels, leading to the discovery of lead paint and dust throughout school buildings. The Trump administration has denied Milwaukee's request for federal support, leaving the city to manage the crisis independently after laying off the CDC's lead exposure team. Local officials are concerned about the lack of federal expertise and guidance as they navigate this public health emergency. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pulling back Medicaid funding for social services like housing and nutrition, reversing a previous expansion that allowed states to use Medicaid money for non-traditional healthcare needs. This decision has created chaos in states that expanded their Medicaid programs, as both liberal and conservative leaders worry about the impact on vulnerable populations. The administration argues that Medicaid should focus on healthcare outcomes and not duplicate existing federal programs, while health experts warn that this disinvestment will lead to increased suffering and higher healthcare costs. Some states are exploring making social services permanent despite the federal pullback. </p>

          <p>America's struggle with affordable child care has intensified a long-standing debate over what defines "quality" care. Perspectives vary, with some prioritizing credentialed teachers and academic standards, while others emphasize nurturing care and parental preference.

States use Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) to assess child care quality, but evidence is mixed on whether these ratings predict better outcomes for children.
