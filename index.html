          <p>A bomb explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulted in one fatality and damage to several buildings. The Palm Springs Police Chief has called the incident an intentional act of violence, and the FBI is investigating. The explosion occurred in or near a vehicle parked by the clinic, American Reproductive Centers, causing damage to the clinic's office but leaving the IVF lab and stored embryos secure. The clinic expressed heartbreak over the event and affirmed its commitment to serving the community, with plans to reopen on Monday. </p>

          <p>Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, have consistently ruled that the Trump administration must provide due process to immigrants facing deportation. This stance challenges the administration's efforts to expedite deportations by circumventing constitutional protections. The Supreme Court recently criticized the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants before deportation. The courts' actions underscore the importance of due process rights for all individuals, regardless of citizenship status, before being deprived of liberty or property.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's new social studies curriculum, driven by State School Superintendent Ryan Walters, will require high school students to "identify discrepancies" in the 2020 election results, promoting conspiracy theories.

Despite concerns from fellow Republicans and a lawsuit from parents and educators, the revised standards, which also incorporate references to the Bible and national pride, are set to be implemented, reflecting a broader trend of ideological influence in education. </p>

The creature, about the length of an index finger, had a circular mouth lined with teeth and claws extending from its head. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period and reveals that the creature was more complex than previously understood.</p>
