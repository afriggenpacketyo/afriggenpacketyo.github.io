        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-sharing giant systematically violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The suit claims Uber has unlawfully denied service to passengers with service animals or mobility devices, and has improperly charged fees to disabled riders. This legal action follows a 2022 settlement where Uber compensated over 65,000 users for charging wait-time fees to passengers who needed more time to board due to their disabilities. The new lawsuit seeks to compel Uber to comply with the ADA, train its drivers, and provide monetary damages to affected individuals, highlighting a persistent pattern of discrimination that leaves disabled passengers stranded and facing significant challenges.</p>

          <p>An ex-convict, Jamel McGriff, has been charged with murder, kidnapping, and arson in the brutal killing of an elderly couple, Frank and Maureen Olton, in their Queens home. According to the District Attorney's office, the suspect gained entry to the home by asking to charge his phone before allegedly torturing the couple for hours, stabbing the husband, and setting fires on both floors of the house. The victims' son, an FDNY EMT, was alerted to the fire by a security system. McGriff was later identified using surveillance footage and was apprehended after allegedly using the victims' credit cards and selling their phones, bringing a tragic and violent crime to a close.</p>

          <p>Central London saw thousands of demonstrators participate in a 'Unite the Kingdom' march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, which was met by a 'March Against Fascism' counter-protest. The Metropolitan Police deployed approximately 1,000 officers to manage the events, creating a sterile zone to prevent clashes between the two groups. Robinson's rally featured a mix of nationalist slogans and flags, with some attendees carrying signs memorializing the recently assassinated U.S. activist Charlie Kirk. The counter-protest, organized by Stand up to Racism, gathered hundreds to oppose the far-right presence, holding signs that welcomed refugees and condemned fascism, highlighting the deep political divisions present in the UK.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships have commenced in Tokyo, marking a significant return of spectators to a major sporting event in the city four years after the fan-less 2020 Olympics. However, the event is shadowed by controversy surrounding the re-imposition of mandatory gene testing for female athletes. World Athletics requires athletes competing in the female category to undergo an SRY gene test to detect a Y chromosome, a policy critics argue is unreliable and discriminatory. This requirement has sparked debate, with some nations like France banning such non-medical screening, forcing their athletes to be tested abroad, and raising questions about fairness and inclusion in elite sports.</p>

Investigators have recovered the high-powered rifle believed to have been used in the attack, which was found in a wooded area near the campus. The case has drawn national attention and condemnation, with authorities continuing to investigate the motive behind the political assassination.</p>

          <p>China's State Council, led by Premier Li Qiang, has announced new measures aimed at strengthening support for private investment to stabilize the economy and employment. The government plans to create a more fair and competitive market environment where private enterprises can invest with confidence. Key initiatives include expanding market access, resolving existing bottlenecks, and increasing financial support through central budget allocations. The plan also involves reserving a portion of government procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises, signaling a concerted effort by Beijing to boost the private sector's role in driving economic growth and innovation amid ongoing economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Economists are expressing growing concern that the U.S. economy is showing signs of stagflation, a combination of stagnant growth and rising inflation not seen since the 1970s. Recent data indicates a slowdown in job growth alongside an increase in the inflation rate, a shift from earlier, more optimistic forecasts. The article highlights that many analysts attribute this trend to former President Trump's policies, specifically his administration's crackdown on immigration and the imposition of tariffs, which have constrained labor supply and increased consumer prices. This economic situation presents a challenge for the Federal Reserve, as its traditional tools are less effective when both unemployment and inflation rise simultaneously. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the recent resurgence of skinny jeans, using it as a lens to critique the relentless and often arbitrary cycles of the fashion industry. The author expresses a personal disdain for jeans altogether, arguing they were designed for manual labor and are ill-suited for modern life. The article laments how fashion media encourages consumers to continuously buy new versions of clothing they were told to discard just years earlier, driven by a need to maintain profits for large conglomerates. Ultimately, the writer advocates for developing a personal style independent of fleeting trends, suggesting that true confidence comes from wearing what feels comfortable rather than what is currently deemed fashionable.</p>

          <p>A group of scientists is urging U.S. health authorities to recognize Chagas disease, caused by a parasite from "kissing bugs," as an endemic illness within the country, not just an imported one. The disease, which can cause serious long-term heart and digestive problems, is already present in at least eight states due to local transmission. Despite this, awareness among the public and even some medical professionals remains low, leading to under-diagnosis and underreporting. By officially classifying Chagas as endemic, the researchers hope to improve public awareness, enhance screening infrastructure, and ensure that at-risk individuals receive timely diagnosis and treatment to prevent chronic complications.</p>

Data shows that flying midweek—on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday—is typically 13% cheaper than traveling on weekends, with Sunday being the most expensive day to fly. Shifting travel plans by even a day or two can result in significant savings. Experts also debunk the myth that the day of the week you book your ticket matters, stating that the day you fly is far more important. Other cost-saving tips include traveling during a destination's off-season, booking flights with layovers, and purchasing tickets well in advance of the departure date.</p>

The victims were healthy adults between 18 and 40, and alcohol was also a factor in each case. The compound, a psychoactive component of the kratom plant, is sold in concentrated forms like tablets and shots at gas stations and smoke shops. While kratom has opioid-like effects, synthetic 7-OH can be significantly more potent, and high doses, especially when mixed with other substances, can lead to severe respiratory depression and death.

While health officials argue that most younger, healthy individuals have sufficient immunity, many doctors still recommend the booster to prevent serious illness. For those who don't meet the primary criteria but have underlying risk factors, such as asthma or diabetes, self-attesting at a pharmacy may be an option.

However, after German reunification, they became symbols of economic decline and social problems, including rising far-right extremism.

          <p>For an individual receiving a significant inheritance, financial experts advise a structured approach to maximize the windfall. The first steps should be to eliminate all existing debt and establish a robust emergency fund to ensure financial stability. Following this, the remaining capital should be invested in a diversified, low-cost portfolio to generate long-term growth. A common recommendation is to allocate a large portion, such as 90%, to a broad market index fund like the S&P 500, with the remainder in safer assets like short-term government bonds. Such a strategy could potentially provide enough annual income to consider early retirement, though consulting a financial advisor is crucial for personalized planning. (not investment advice)</p>

Scholars point to similarities in widespread disillusionment with the Supreme Court, spasms of political violence, and the rise of paramilitary-style political movements. While cautioning that the country is not as fractured as it was before the Civil War, they highlight how the reaction to violence and the perception of unstoppable conflict fueled the nation's spiral into war. The deployment of troops in cities and conflicts over states' rights versus federal power are also seen as modern echoes of the antebellum period's escalating tensions.</p>

The piece references Harris's upcoming book, "107 Days," which highlights the extremely short timeframe she had to launch a presidential campaign after Biden withdrew. The author posits that Biden initially positioned himself as a "bridge" to future leaders but ultimately became a roadblock, draining energy from the party and preventing a normal primary process. This delay, not Harris's campaign itself, is presented as a key factor in the Democratic Party's subsequent challenges in the 2024 election cycle.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica is facing a severe financial crisis, driven largely by the massive cost of settling sexual abuse claims against a former police dispatcher. The city has already paid out $229 million and still faces 180 more claims, prompting the City Council to declare a state of fiscal distress. This financial strain is compounded by post-pandemic economic struggles, including a downturn in tourism and retail revenue. While city officials have tried to reassure municipal employees that layoffs are not imminent, the declaration signals the gravity of the situation as Santa Monica grapples with declining revenues and the staggering financial fallout from a decades-long abuse scandal.</p>

          <p>A disturbing series of attacks on wild donkeys in Riverside County, California, has left local animal rescue organizations and residents deeply concerned. At least six burros, including young foals, have been found shot with hunting-style arrows in the Moreno Valley area recently. The latest victim, a two-year-old donkey nicknamed Cupid, was found with an arrow that had punctured her lung. Animal services and volunteers are working to rescue and treat the injured animals, but the wild nature of the herds makes capture difficult. The community, which largely cherishes the local burro population, is on high alert as authorities search for the unknown individual or individuals responsible for the cruel attacks.</p>

Residents expressed disbelief that such a violent political act could occur in their town, a place where Kirk's views were largely supported.

          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, second only to English, as a growing number of young people view it as a pathway to better opportunities abroad. Driven by Turkey's challenging economic situation, low purchasing power, and stressful work environments, many students are learning German with the goal of studying or working in Germany. Elite Turkish high schools report that a significant percentage of their graduates now pursue higher education in Germany.

This price hike threatens to decimate demand for Kashmiri luxury handicrafts in the U.S., which has long been a primary market.

Fortunately, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries resulting from the powerful tremor. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a threat advisory but later canceled it, while Japan's meteorological agency noted that only slight sea level changes were expected, minimizing the likelihood of any widespread damage along coastal areas.</p>

The ballot title, "AUTHORIZES TEMPORARY CHANGES TO CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT MAPS IN RESPONSE TO TEXAS' PARTISAN REDISTRICTING," is seen by experts as an extremely rare and overtly partisan framing. This move bypasses the state's independent redistricting commission and signals a direct political counter-maneuver in the ongoing national battle for control of the U.S. House.</p>

The ruling affirms that social media posts are constitutionally protected and requires Meta to review its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions.
