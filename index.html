          <p>Jeremy Crawshaw, a 23-year-old punter from Australia, has been drafted by the Denver Broncos, making him the first punter selected in the sixth round of the NFL draft. Having played for the University of Florida, Crawshaw averaged 45.8 yards per punt in 2024 and set a single-season record of 48.9 yards in 2023. He will compete with veteran P Matt Haack for the starting position, bringing his unique rugby background and directional punting skills to the Broncos' special teams. Crawshaw is expected to become an immediate NFL starter and a valuable asset for the team. Optimism for Crawshaw's success in the NFL is high given his proven track record in high-pressure environments.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has refuted claims from the Venezuelan government that the Trump administration "kidnapped" a child, clarifying that the agency intervened because both parents are associated with the violent Tren de Aragua gang. The child's father, Maiker Espinoza-Escalona, is allegedly a lieutenant in the gang involved in homicides, drug sales, and sexual assault, while the mother recruits young women for drug smuggling and prostitution. DHS emphasized that the child was removed from the deportation flight for her safety and is now in foster care, highlighting the administration's commitment to protecting children from abuse and exploitation. DHS has criticized the previous administration for placing unaccompanied children with sponsors who were smugglers and sex traffickers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has called for American commercial and military ships to have free transit through the Panama and Suez Canals, instructing his Secretary of State to address the issue promptly. Trump asserted that these routes would not exist without the U.S. and that American ships should not be charged fees. The Panamanian president responded by stating that toll fees are regulated by the Panama Canal Authority, while the U.S. has been seeking an agreement to allow its warships to pass through the Panama Canal freely. This demand comes amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions affecting global maritime trade, particularly in the Red Sea.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 22:05:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's political landscape has dramatically shifted as the Liberal party, led by Mark Carney, has surged in popularity ahead of the upcoming election, reversing earlier Conservative dominance. This shift is largely attributed to the return of Donald Trump to the White House and his subsequent trade threats against Canada, rallying support for Carney as a steady hand to navigate the crisis. Voters express concerns over housing affordability and economic stagnation, but Trump's protectionist policies have become a central issue, allowing Carney to present himself as the leader best equipped to defend Canada's interests. The election outcome hinges on which party can convince voters they have the best plan to deal with the U.S. president.</p>
