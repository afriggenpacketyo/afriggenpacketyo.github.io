        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority is contemplating a compensation scheme for drivers affected by the mis-selling of car loans, with potential costs estimated between £9 billion and £18 billion. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions unlawful, deemed exceptionally large commissions as unfair. The FCA suggests most individuals could receive less than £950, with payouts potentially starting next year if the plan is approved. The regulator advises affected consumers to contact their loan providers directly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former "Bachelor" stars Sean and Catherine Lowe have voiced their concerns over the widespread use of Ozempic for weight loss, calling the trend "triggering" and "hard to watch." In an interview, the couple promoted what they describe as a healthier approach to wellness, emphasizing consistency, exercise, and healthy recipes through their partnership with Atkins. They argue that sustainable habits, while slower, lead to a healthier long-term lifestyle compared to what they see as a restrictive and potentially risky "easy route." The couple also discussed maintaining their relationship after 11 years of marriage.</p>

          <p>Soccer star Lionel Messi left an Inter Miami Leagues Cup match against Necaxa on Saturday after an apparent hamstring injury in the game's opening minutes. Coach Javier Mascherano stated that Messi "felt a pull" and will undergo tests to determine the injury's severity, putting his availability for the next match in doubt. The incident occurred when Messi fell during a challenge, and he was substituted in the 11th minute. This adds to concerns about managing the 38-year-old's workload, as he has a history of leg injuries.</p>

This was part of a wider wave of overnight attacks, with Russia claiming it intercepted 93 drones while Ukraine reported downing 61 of 83 Russian drones and missiles. Meanwhile, Russian strikes continued in Ukraine, hitting a key bridge in Kherson and killing one man. The escalating attacks have prompted renewed calls for international sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones downplayed a public trade request from star defensive end Micah Parsons, labeling it as typical "negotiation talk." The comments came after Parsons, who is seeking a contract extension, posted his desire to leave the team on social media. Jones insisted the situation is a normal part of the negotiation process for a major contract, comparing it to past standoffs with other star players. Parsons is entering the final season of his rookie contract and is looking for a deal that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in NFL history.</p>

          <p>Public records reveal that actor Sydney Sweeney registered as a Republican voter in Florida in June 2024, a detail that has gained attention online. This information surfaced amid a separate controversy surrounding her new ad campaign for American Eagle, which uses the pun "great genes/jeans." Some critics on social media found the campaign's language tone-deaf in the current political climate, while conservatives defended it against what they termed "cancel culture." The actor previously faced scrutiny in 2022 over guests at a family party wearing hats resembling MAGA merchandise.</p>

          <p>An expert in conscious parenting, drawing from studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests specific phrases to help de-escalate children's tantrums. The article advises replacing punitive or dismissive reactions with validating and reassuring language, such as saying "I'm right here with you" instead of "Stop crying." The core principle is to view a tantrum as a sign of nervous system distress, not misbehavior, and to connect with the child rather than trying to control them. This approach aims to make the child feel safe and understood, which can reduce the intensity of meltdowns and build long-term emotional resilience.</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese province of Guangdong is implementing "decisive and forceful measures" to control a growing outbreak of chikungunya fever, with 2,892 new cases reported last week. The majority of cases of the mosquito-borne viral disease, which causes fever and severe joint pain, were recorded in the city of Foshan. The provincial governor has called for a swift response to contain the outbreak, and the head of China's national CDC visited Foshan to urge efforts to "stamp out the outbreak in the shortest time." Officials have reported no severe or fatal infections so far.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old woman was arrested in New Zealand after a 2-year-old girl was discovered alive inside a suitcase in the luggage compartment of a bus. The bus driver became concerned about a moving bag during a stop and opened it to find the child, who was reportedly very hot but otherwise physically unharmed. The girl was taken to a hospital for a full medical assessment. Police have charged the woman with ill-treatment and neglect of a child, with further charges possible, and commended the bus driver for his immediate action.</p>

          <p>British Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant has publicly stated that he was sexually abused as a teenager in 1978 by Michael Croft, the late former head of the National Youth Theatre. In an interview ahead of his book release, Bryant described how Croft, who died in 1986, pressured him into a sexual encounter. The National Youth Theatre issued a statement expressing sorrow and solidarity with Bryant and other victims. Bryant also revealed he had been sexually assaulted by five male MPs during his career but did not report them due to a lack of a proper system at the time.</p>

          <p>The travel industry is increasingly using artificial intelligence for what experts call "algorithmic auditing," where AI systems detect and bill customers for damages or rule violations. Car rental company Hertz is already using AI to scan for vehicle damage, while some hotels are using sensors to detect and fine guests for smoking in rooms. This trend creates a tension between operational efficiency and customer satisfaction, as businesses can now monetize microscopic imperfections. While proponents cite consistency and objectivity, critics warn of a potential customer backlash if guests feel they are being unfairly scrutinized by machines.</p>

          <p>An American woman has been sentenced to over eight years in prison for her role in a scheme that helped thousands of North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at U.S. companies by posing as American citizens. Christina Chapman operated "laptop farms," managed stolen identities, and laundered payments, enabling the scheme to generate millions of dollars for the North Korean government's weapons programs. The case highlights a sophisticated operation where foreign actors exploit the remote work economy to circumvent international sanctions and infiltrate U.S. corporate networks, raising significant cybersecurity and national security concerns.</p>

A public records lawsuit filed by Radar Online is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's claim that releasing files would interfere with law enforcement proceedings. Separately, a federal judge has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a civil case against Ghislaine Maxwell could be unsealed. These legal pressures offer a potential path to transparency, independent of the political debate surrounding the Epstein files.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has revealed the decade-long process behind creating CHSN01, a high-strength cryogenic steel essential for nuclear fusion reactors. The material was developed to withstand the extreme conditions inside a fusion device, including temperatures near absolute zero and immense magnetic forces. This breakthrough was critical for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project after previous materials failed. The development and successful deployment of this "super steel" in the world's first fusion power generation reactor this year places China in a leading position in advanced materials science.</p>

He equated the president's authority to impose tariffs for political reasons, such as in response to Brazil's prosecution of an ally, to the long-standing use of economic sanctions. Greer also indicated that talks with China to avoid a snapback of high tariff rates are progressing positively. (not investment advice)</p>
