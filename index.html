          <p>This article recounts the story of Karla Flores, an 18-year-old diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, who was later found to have a second tumor on her spine during an MRI. Dr. Mohammed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center devised a novel surgical approach, reaching the spinal tumor through Flores' eye socket, a procedure he called the "third nostril" approach. The surgery involved removing part of her cheekbone and eye socket to access the tumor, which was then successfully removed, followed by reconstructive surgery and radiation treatment. Flores is now cancer-free and hopes to become a manicurist, highlighting the success of the innovative procedure and her resilience.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is fast-tracking the reopening of the Velvet-Wood uranium mine in southeastern Utah, citing a "national energy emergency" to expedite regulatory approvals. This move aims to revive the dormant uranium mining industry amid rising global prices and a ban on uranium imports from Russia. While the industry shows signs of life with new projects, a true revival hinges on sustained price increases to justify the significant capital investment required. The article also highlights the mixed legacy of uranium mining in Moab and the ongoing debate over its environmental impact, concluding that market forces will ultimately determine the industry's future.

Hegseth characterized China as a hegemonic power seeking to dominate Asia, referencing a 2027 deadline allegedly given by President Xi Jinping for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. He emphasized the U.S. commitment to deterring war and supporting its allies, advocating for a strong shield of deterrence forged with allies and encouraged Asian countries to become partners rather than dependents on the U.S. Hegseth also cautioned against economic ties with China, suggesting Beijing would use them for leverage.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece by Doug Schoen, a Harvard alumnus, discusses the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Harvard University, particularly regarding antisemitism and free speech issues. Schoen acknowledges the legitimacy of some of Trump's demands for reform at Harvard, particularly regarding its handling of antisemitism and its DEI policies. However, he cautions against blanket bans and across-the-board cuts, arguing for a more targeted approach that can force necessary changes without harming the university's scientific prowess. Schoen concludes that Trump's actions have spurred Harvard to take steps towards change, highlighting the need for universities to adhere to their own codes of conduct.</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities are collecting DNA information from migrants, including children, and uploading it to a national criminal database, according to government documents. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) is creating detailed DNA profiles on migrants that will be permanently searchable by law enforcement, regardless of whether they have been accused of any felonies. Experts have criticized the practice as a "massive expansion of genetic surveillance and an unjustified invasion of privacy," reinforcing harmful narratives about immigrants. The agency has added over 1.5 million DNA profiles to the database since 2020, with more than 133,000 belonging to migrant teens and children.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, is set to stand trial in August, but the case faces several challenges. The prosecution has not yet ascribed a motive for the killings, and recent leaks of information to the media, including details about Kohberger's phone activity and internet searches, have led the defense to request a trial delay. The upcoming publication of a book about the case may further complicate matters, and while several court rulings have gone against Kohberger, the defense is attempting to introduce alternate perpetrators. The absence of a clear motive and the intense media scrutiny continue to shape the narrative surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>This article explores the evolution of the Mission: Impossible franchise, contrasting its early, director-driven stand-alone stories with the more recent emphasis on continuity and interconnectedness. The first four films, directed by Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird, were marked by their distinct authorial styles and a lack of overarching narrative. However, later installments, including Mission: Impossibleâ€”The Final Reckoning, have adopted a stricter canon, linking characters and plot devices from previous films. The author argues that the franchise's initial inconsistency and willingness to prioritize creative sensibilities over commercial brand-building were key to its appeal.</p>

          <p>Mirra Andreeva, an 18-year-old Russian tennis player, thanked a fan for gifting her a "lucky charm" before her French Open third-round victory against Yulia Putintseva. The charm, a small colorful fabric patch with floral patterns, was placed on her bench during the match. Andreeva, who lost to Jasmine Paolini in the semi-finals last year, is one of the in-form players in Paris, claiming titles at Indian Wells and the Dubai Tennis Championships earlier this season.

          <p>Consumers are taking a more frugal approach to summer vacations this year due to economic concerns, according to a report by Deloitte. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, travel budgets have been scaled back amid recession fears and trade tensions. Travel costs have declined, with lower hotel room rates, rental car costs, and airfares, but people are spending more due to inflation. As a result, travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, staying with family and friends, and driving instead of flying to save money.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tough stance on the U.S. drug war, including calls for harsher penalties for drug dealers, is contrasted by his pardons for convicted drug offenders. Recent clemency decisions, including for Larry Hoover, have sparked controversy and raised questions about the administration's drug policy. Critics point to the mixed messages and the influence of powerful individuals in these pardon decisions. While some view Trump's actions as a potential step towards drug policy reform, others see them as transactional and inconsistent with his broader tough-on-crime rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Jessica Slice, a disabled mother, shares her experiences and challenges in her book, "Unfit Parent: A Disabled Mother Challenges An Inaccessible World." Slice discusses how becoming disabled helped her accept a loss of control in parenting and challenges the cultural pressure to be a perfect and independent parent. She argues that all parents need help and advocates for a disability justice perspective that promotes mutual aid and stronger social safety nets. Slice also addresses the stigma surrounding disability in reproductive health care and the importance of inclusive sexual education and accessible clinics for disabled individuals.</p>
