          <p>Ishiba has pledged to prioritize the removal of elevated U.S. tariffs, rather than focusing on tariff cuts. This commitment signals a strategic approach to trade negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the elimination of existing barriers.

          <p>The German economy saw a surprising 0.4% growth in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis). This growth is attributed to a surge in exports ahead of potential tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The German government is also considering extending the Bundeswehr's involvement in several foreign missions, signaling a continued commitment to international security efforts. This economic growth provides a positive outlook for Europe's leading economy amidst global trade uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger's defense team has introduced the possibility of "alternate perpetrators" in the Idaho student murders case.

The success of this approach depends on the ability to present credible evidence that raises doubt about Kohberger's involvement, and will be up to the jury to decide.</p>

This change means a typical household will see an annual bill reduction of Â£129, affecting 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. Despite the welcome reduction, charities emphasize that many people still struggle with energy costs, with significant customer debt to suppliers.

          <p>Kermit the Frog addressed the University of Maryland's class of 2025, offering advice about navigating life after graduation. He encouraged graduates to "leap together" and support one another rather than competing against each other. Kermit's appearance is particularly meaningful as Muppets creator Jim Henson was an alumnus of the university. The speech aimed to inspire optimism and kindness during a time of economic uncertainty and political turmoil, emphasizing the importance of community and collaboration.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is preparing to halt penny production following President Donald Trump's directive, who deems the coin "so wasteful." The Treasury Department expects annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. Despite being one of the first coins made by the US Mint, the penny is underutilized and costly to produce, almost four cents per penny. Advocates for ending penny production cite its high cost and limited utility, while others argue for its usefulness in charity drives.</p>
