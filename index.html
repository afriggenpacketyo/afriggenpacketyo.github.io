          <p>Anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protesters in Los Angeles burned and spat on American flags while chanting anti-Trump slogans. The demonstration led to clashes with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, resulting in the dispersal of crowds with flash bangs. President Trump deployed the National Guard to address the situation, citing inadequate action by California's Governor and Los Angeles's Mayor to stop attacks on ICE agents during raids. Newsom criticized Trump's involvement, calling it an unlawful breach of state sovereignty that inflamed tensions and diverted resources. </p>

          <p>Las Vegas is increasing its tree canopy to combat rising temperatures and address the "shade disparity" affecting lower-income neighborhoods. The city, county, and nonprofits are collaborating to plant thousands of trees annually, focusing on drought-tolerant species that provide shade. Research indicates that trees can significantly lower temperatures, offering relief from the extreme heat that contributed to over 500 deaths last summer. The initiative includes educating students about environmental conservation through school garden clubs, teaching them the importance of trees in mitigating heat and conserving water.</p>

          <p>A prominent Sikh temple in the US is urging the Department of Justice to investigate the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), alleging it operates as a foreign agent on behalf of the Indian government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Fremont Gurdwara Sahib claims the HAF has facilitated meetings between Indian officials and US lawmakers and advocated for the interests of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The HAF denies these claims, asserting its independence and non-partisan status and accusing the Khalistan separatist movement of orchestrating a coordinated campaign against them. The allegations come amid heightened tensions between Sikhs advocating for an independent state and the Indian government, with accusations of transnational repression.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill could significantly impact student loan programs by altering eligibility requirements for Pell Grants and capping borrowing amounts. The changes would require students to take more credit hours to qualify for maximum Pell Grant amounts, potentially disadvantaging part-time students with other responsibilities. The legislation also aims to eliminate subsidized loans, which do not accrue interest while students are in school, and impose lifetime borrowing caps based on program costs. Critics argue these changes could make college less accessible for low- and middle-income families and exacerbate the doctor shortage by making professional programs harder to finance.</p>

          <p>Mayors of San Diego and Sacramento are warning that California's homelessness crisis will escalate if the state's Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention Grant Program (HHAP) is not funded. They highlighted the significant reductions in homelessness achieved in their cities through HHAP, enabling innovative solutions and providing shelter and housing for vulnerable residents. The mayors emphasized the importance of accountability and responsible spending of public funds, noting that leaving people on the streets is more costly than providing housing. They urged the Legislature to fully fund HHAP at $1 billion to continue progress in addressing homelessness.</p>

The Astral later encountered another group of 109 people, including children, also departing from Libya, and provided life jackets before they were rescued by another charity ship.
