        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump attended a NATO summit in the Netherlands, focusing on securing commitments from allies to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP. Prior to the summit, NATO had already agreed to boost defense spending, with Secretary General Mark Rutte praising Trump's actions in Iran and securing the 5% commitment. Russia's war in Ukraine also remains a key concern, with discussions ongoing about explicitly naming Russia as the main threat to NATO in the summit's communique. The United States carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, leading to retaliatory missile fire on a U.S. base in Qatar, before a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel was announced by Trump.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Sean "Diddy" Combs, accusing him of running a criminal enterprise disguised as a business empire, using his wealth to coerce women into unwanted sexual acts. The prosecution presented evidence alleging Combs engaged in violence, coercion, and threats to silence his alleged victims. Combs has pleaded not guilty, claiming any sexual acts were consensual and private, while his defense acknowledges his complexity and past violence but denies any sex trafficking or racketeering. The case includes testimony from former girlfriends and assistants, along with evidence of raids uncovering unregistered firearms and illegal drugs.</p>

          <p>President Trump avoided directly answering whether he remains committed to Article 5 of NATO, the principle of collective defense, stating his commitment depends on the definition of Article 5. While en route to the NATO summit, Trump emphasized his commitment to being friends with NATO leaders and saving lives, but deferred providing an exact definition of his commitment to Article 5. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte affirmed his belief in the U.S.'s commitment to the mutual defense clause, despite Trump's ambiguous statements.

          <p>The U.S. Navy is utilizing munitions at an "alarming rate" to defend Israel from recent Iranian strikes, according to a military official. This has raised concerns among lawmakers about the Navy's ability to replenish and maintain its stockpiles amidst global threats. Admiral James Kilby testified that while the Navy currently has enough SM-3 missiles, their usage rate is a significant concern. Officials are exploring various avenues to increase munitions production, recognizing it as a top priority.</p>

At Lynn Pinker Hurst & Schwegmann, AI is used to channel Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts or Sherlock Holmes for legal problem-solving. However, data indicates that only a minority of small businesses are currently using AI, suggesting a significant opportunity for wider implementation.

The briefing was rescheduled to include Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth, but Schumer stressed the need for facts and real information, not just political talking points.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has argued that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, asserting that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear targets was within his powers under Article II of the U.S. Constitution. Johnson stated that many constitutional scholars believe the Nixon-era law, which limits the president's power to unilaterally wage war, violates Article II. A pending resolution to bar U.S. military action in Iran under the War Powers Act is unlikely to pass the House, according to Johnson. Representative Massie indicated he may not advance his resolution if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds.</p>
