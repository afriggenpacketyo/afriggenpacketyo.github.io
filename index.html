        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to royal experts, Prince William is reportedly unwilling to reconcile with Prince Harry due to Harry's public criticisms of the royal family. Hilary Fordwich and Ian Pelham Turner suggest the gulf between the brothers has widened, particularly after Harry's BBC interview where he expressed a desire for reconciliation but also criticized the royal household's handling of his security. Harry admitted King Charles won't speak to him because of the security concerns. Experts suggest the rift is likely unbridgeable, with William prioritizing the protection of the monarchy, and that Harry needs to show genuine remorse for his behavior. </p>

          <h2>Analysts Doubt Ukraine Can Replace China as Critical Minerals Supplier</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that despite a recent agreement with Washington, Ukraine is unlikely to rival China as a key source of critical minerals for the US hi-tech, green energy, and aerospace sectors. Most of Ukraine's mineral deposits are located in Russian-occupied territories, and extraction will take years due to a lack of processing capabilities. China controls about 60% of the world's rare earth reserves and 90% of refining, producing 270,000 tonnes last year, making Ukraine's potential output insignificant in comparison. The article highlights the challenges the US faces in diversifying its critical mineral supply amid ongoing trade disputes with China.</p>

          <p>An impact assessment on assisted dying in England and Wales estimates that the number of assisted deaths could exceed 4,000 in the tenth year after the law is enacted, though this would still represent less than 1% of all deaths. The assessment, carried out by civil servants, projects initial savings for the NHS ranging from Â£919,000 to Â£10.3m in the first six months, growing to between Â£5.84m and Â£59.6m after ten years. However, the assessment also anticipates significant costs, including over Â£10m annually for staffing and over Â£11m for initial training, with each case involving approximately 32 hours of work by six health professionals. The article details the debate surrounding the bill, with supporters emphasizing patient choice and compassion and opponents raising concerns about risks to vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding elections as Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test against a revitalized opposition. The election is a gauge of the People's Action Party's (PAP) popularity, which has ruled since 1965, and of Wong's leadership. Singapore faces potential economic challenges due to US tariffs on its exports and broader global trade tensions. Voters are also concerned about the rising cost of living and housing availability, with the opposition arguing that the government hasn't done enough to address these issues.

          <p>Donald Trump's promised "golden age" for the US economy is off to a turbulent start, with the first quarter showing a contraction in GDP after three years of growth. While Trump blames the Biden administration for the downturn, analysts point to the new administration's trade policies, including tariffs, as a significant factor. These policies have led to increased imports as companies try to preempt tariffs and decreased consumer spending due to rising prices and uncertainty. The article suggests that the impact of Trump's trade policies will continue to shape the US economy, with potential for further instability.</p>

          <p>Over 80 people have died in recent violence in Druze-majority areas of Syria, sparked by an audio clip deemed blasphemous by some Muslims. Unidentified armed groups attacked the town of Jaramana, leading to clashes with armed Druze community members.

Amidst this, Israeli jets bombed areas near Damascus, with Israel claiming it aims to protect the Druze community, but experts warn this interference is destabilizing and making the situation worse.

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from various venomous snakes, potentially leading to a universal antivenom. Current antivenoms must match the specific snake species, but Friede's 18-year mission could save lives and prevent disabilities from snakebites. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood that target neurotoxins common in deadly snakes, offering hope for a more effective treatment.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is implementing significant administrative reforms aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and consolidating power under the Communist Party. These reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating public sector jobs. The government plans to reduce the number of provinces and municipalities and streamline governance. While officials say the changes will enhance efficiency and economic resilience, analysts suggest they also serve to centralize power and address dysfunction caused by anti-corruption efforts. The article examines the motivations and potential consequences of Vietnam's administrative overhaul.</p>
