          <h2>US Stocks and Dollar Tumble Following Trump's Criticism of Fed Chair Powell</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a significant decline after President Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" for not proactively lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy. Trump's remarks, delivered via social media, added to market anxieties already fueled by his tariff plans, which have raised concerns about a potential economic recession. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all suffered substantial losses, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022. Simultaneously, gold prices reached a new record high as investors sought safe-haven assets amidst the economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing US-China trade war, China's private sector demonstrated resilience in the first quarter of the year, with nearly 1.98 million new private companies registered, marking a 7.1% increase from the previous year. This growth, surpassing the average pace of the past three years, indicates the strength of China's private economy, even as these businesses are expected to bear the brunt of US tariffs. Private firms contribute to over half of China's exports, and analysts anticipate they will be more vulnerable to reciprocal tariffs compared to state-owned enterprises.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a budget that would eliminate a nearly $1-billion financial gap by cutting over 2,700 city positions, including approximately 1,650 layoffs. The proposed budget includes funding for new hires in the Fire Department, but many other agencies face significant spending reductions, impacting 5% of the workforce. The Los Angeles Police Department would see over 400 civilian workers laid off, reducing the number of police officers to the lowest level since 1995. Union leaders have vowed to fight the layoffs, seeking state financial assistance to avoid the job cuts.</p>

          <p>Joey Aguilar, who recently joined UCLA as a quarterback, is transferring to Tennessee after Nico Iamaleava's move from Tennessee to UCLA. Iamaleava's departure from Tennessee stemmed from a reported dispute over NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) negotiations, where he sought a deal worth $4 million for the upcoming season. Aguilar, with one year of eligibility remaining, brings a strong track record of 6,760 passing yards and 56 touchdowns from his previous two seasons at Appalachian State. This quarterback swap highlights the growing influence of NIL deals in college football and the potential for player movement based on financial incentives.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging attempts to exert control over academic decision-making by threatening to review $9 billion in federal funding. The university's lawsuit challenges the administration's demands, which include appointing an outside overseer to ensure viewpoint diversity. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that no government should dictate what private universities can teach, admit, or research. The lawsuit comes amidst the Trump administration's increased scrutiny of Ivy League institutions following campus activism related to the war in Gaza, which the administration has labeled as anti-American and antisemitic.</p>

This map reveals connections between nerve cells in the macaque claustrum and other brain regions, potentially aiding understanding of cognitive functions like memory and abstract thinking. The research also identified differences in the claustrum structure and cell types between macaques and rodents, which could provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness.

          <p>Pope Francis' last will and testament, dated June 29, 2022, expresses his desire to be interred in the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. The will specifies that his tomb should be simple, without elaborate decoration, and bear only the inscription "Franciscus." He entrusted his life and ministry to the Virgin Mary and requested that his remains await the resurrection in the basilica, where he often prayed before and after his apostolic journeys. The will also expresses his gratitude to those who have loved and prayed for him, offering his suffering for peace and brotherhood.</p>

          <p>Pope Francis died at the age of 88 due to a cerebral stroke, coma, and subsequent irreversible heart failure, according to the Vatican. The Pope had experienced several health issues in recent years, including respiratory illnesses and hospitalizations. He had part of one lung removed as a young man and battled health problems throughout his pontificate. Recent health challenges included bronchitis, bilateral pneumonia, and a bronchospasm, which led to a prolonged hospital stay earlier in the year.</p>

Test results confirmed high levels of domoic acid in the whale's urine, consistent with other marine mammals affected by the bloom. The algal bloom, which began earlier than usual this year, has impacted hundreds of sea lions and dolphins. Domoic acid is a neurotoxin produced by harmful algal blooms that accumulates in fish, which are then consumed by marine mammals.</p>

This statement comes amid increasing deportations of Venezuelan migrants, many without criminal records.

With a 145% tariff on goods imported from China and retaliatory duties from China, Cramer noted that the government appears biased against these companies. He argued that the White House prioritizes cutting off China over advancing U.S. interests, leading to uncertainty and investor reluctance towards Nvidia and Apple. Cramer suggested that the situation could change if the administration reconsiders its approach, but emphasized the difficulty in predicting future policy changes.</p>
