          <p>China has rapidly transformed into a global leader in civil engineering, particularly in bridge construction, with projects that push the boundaries of structural design and materials science. By 2030, Chinese engineers are expected to complete several record-breaking bridges, including the Huajiang Canyon Bridge and the Zhangjinggao Yangtze River Bridge. These projects leverage precision survey methods, advanced modeling, and breakthroughs in materials science to overcome geographical challenges. The integration of artificial intelligence and automated construction equipment is also expected to enhance safety and efficiency in future bridge construction efforts.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to major retailers in an effort to reduce rising rice prices, aiming to bring them down to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move bypasses the traditional auction system, giving the government more control over pricing, and addresses public criticism over the ineffectiveness of previous measures. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency of the situation, and the government plans to sell rice produced in 2021 and 2022 at around 11,556 yen per 60 kg, covering transportation costs to regional areas. Online sales are also being considered to broaden distribution.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the rate in 2022. This increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems. The company uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake submissions. Boosting and member fraud constitute the majority of fake reviews, while paid reviews are considered more pernicious and often originate in Asia; Tripadvisor penalizes violators and uses various methods, including AI and behavioral biometrics, to catch fake reviewers.</p>

Hardin had been incarcerated since 2017, and authorities are urging anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact local law enforcement. He was convicted of first-degree murder in connection with the shooting death of James Appleton and is also serving 50 years for the 1997 sexual assault of an elementary school teacher. The Stone County Sheriff's Office reported that Hardin was seen leaving the prison in a Department of Corrections uniform.</p>

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, has proposed that China should lower its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five years, considering challenges such as a protracted rivalry with the United States and domestic structural issues. This recommendation contrasts with market estimates of around 4.5% annual growth from 2026-30. Xu emphasizes that prioritizing employment expansion and debt control would be more beneficial than pursuing a higher growth target, given China's shrinking population, falling savings rate, and other economic headwinds. Xu Lin is now academic director of the Pangoal Institution, a Beijing-based think tank, and also chairman of China-US Green Fund.</p>

          <p>Spain hosted a meeting of the "Madrid Group," comprising representatives from European and Arab nations, to discuss ways to pressure Israel into ending the war in Gaza. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called for an arms embargo against Israel and suggested targeted sanctions against individuals obstructing the two-state solution. Spain will also propose the immediate suspension of a trade partnership between the European Union and Israel. The meeting underscores growing international pressure on Israel to halt its military offensive against Hamas and address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

The 5,000-ton destroyer tipped over, damaging its hull, which Kim Jong Un described as a "criminal act." Ri is the highest-level official arrested in connection with the incident, joining three officials from the Chongjin shipyard, where the destroyer was built. The incident has been attributed to "absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism," and the swift response signals Pyongyang's commitment to advancing its military capabilities.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military magazine, Naval and Merchant Ships, published an article detailing a strategy for Beijing to subdue Taiwan by targeting 30 to 40 "super critical" infrastructure nodes, potentially leading to a system-wide collapse. The article suggests that disrupting key systems like liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities could cut off electricity and water, paralyze traffic, and disrupt communications, thus undermining the will to resist. This tactic of "urban collapse warfare" aims to achieve maximum effect with minimal military cost, aligning with the principle of "defeating the enemy without fighting."</p>
