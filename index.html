          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, in collaboration with Florida state law enforcement, arrested approximately 780 immigrants across Florida this week. The operation, which began on Monday, specifically targeted undocumented immigrants with final deportation orders, resulting in over 275 migrants being detained. This initiative marks the latest effort by the Trump administration to expedite deportations, executed under a formal arrangement with state law enforcement. This operation is part of a broader strategy involving collaborations with various federal agencies to conduct raids across the United States.</p>

          <p>Two killer whales, Wikie and her son Keijo, are in need of a new home after the marine zoo Marineland Antibes in southern France closed down. Animal rights groups are advocating for their relocation to a whale sanctuary in Nova Scotia, Canada, where they would have more space and freedom. While Marineland is advocating for a swift transfer to Loro Parque in Tenerife, a Spanish scientific panel blocked the move due to inadequate facilities. The Whale Sanctuary Project is pushing for the relocation of the whales to their location in Nova Scotia, as a suitable site for Wikie and Keijo has not been secured yet.</p>

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. secured a points victory over Conor Benn in a thrilling boxing match at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, continuing one of Britain's long-standing boxing rivalries. Eubank's experience proved decisive as the judges scored the fight in his favor, extending his record to 35 wins in 38 fights. The fight marked a reconciliation between Eubank and his father, Chris Eubank Sr., who had been estranged for years. Benn, suffering his first professional loss, suggested a rematch after signing a two-fight deal with Eubank.</p>

The U.S. attorney general, Pam Bondi, defended the move, saying Judge Dugan’s arrest sent a “strong message” to judges that the Trump administration will prosecute them if they obstruct justice by “escorting a criminal defendant out a back door.”</p>

          <p>Australia's universal healthcare system is facing a crisis due to inadequate government funding, staff shortages, and rising costs. This is leading to longer wait times and increasing out-of-pocket expenses for patients. The crisis is particularly acute in rural areas, where access to healthcare is limited. Both major political parties are promising additional funding for healthcare ahead of the upcoming election, but experts say sweeping reforms are needed to ensure the system's sustainability.</p>

          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as his deputy, signaling a potential successor amid concerns about Abbas's age and health. The appointment follows a rare meeting of Palestinian leaders in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. For many Palestinians, the leadership’s focus on palace politics as the war in Gaza has raged, and a sweeping Israeli military operation in the northern West Bank has displaced tens of thousands of people, has further underscored the complacency of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. Some analysts believe al-Sheikh's promotion indicates that Mr. Abbas, 89, was signaling that Mr. al-Sheikh was his preferred heir, while others saw it as a cosmetic reshuffle to placate Arab officials frustrated by the Palestinian leader.</p>
