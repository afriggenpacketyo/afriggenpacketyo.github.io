          <p>Former Food Network star Paula Deen has suddenly closed The Lady & Sons, the Savannah, Georgia, restaurant that launched her career nearly three decades ago. The announcement, which also included the closure of her second Savannah eatery, did not provide a reason for the shutdown. Deen's four other restaurants outside of Savannah will remain open. The closure comes years after a 2013 controversy involving racial remarks that led to the cancellation of her popular cooking show.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff visited a contentious Israel- and U.S.-backed humanitarian aid distribution site in Gaza to assess the situation for the Trump administration. The visit has been labeled a "media stunt" by some Gazans and critics, as it occurs amid reports of hundreds of Palestinian deaths near these GHF-operated sites. International organizations like the UN and Oxfam continue to warn of mass starvation and have criticized the militarized aid system. The visit's purpose was to inform a plan for delivering food and medical aid, though it has been met with significant skepticism.</p>

The suspect had been previously deported to Honduras in 2011 before re-entering the U.S. illegally at an unknown time.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he ordered two nuclear submarines to be moved to "appropriate regions" in response to what he termed "highly provocative statements" from Dmitry Medvedev, a high-ranking Russian official. The move follows an escalating war of words, where Medvedev warned that U.S. ultimatums regarding the Ukraine war were a "step towards war" with America. Trump stated that words can have unintended consequences and he hopes this is not one of those instances. Medvedev had previously referenced Russia's "Dead Hand" nuclear retaliatory system in a message directed at Trump.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's stock fell approximately 8% despite reporting second-quarter earnings that largely surpassed expectations, as investors were underwhelmed by the company's profit guidance and cloud computing growth. While revenue and advertising sales were strong, Amazon Web Services (AWS) grew by 18%, trailing the faster growth rates of competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.

          <p>The new documentary "Folktales," from the filmmakers of "Jesus Camp," follows a group of Scandinavian teenagers attending Pasvik Folk High School, a remote Norwegian institution 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle.

The film focuses on the transformative experiences of three teens as they learn to manage their anxieties and social awkwardness by bonding with huskies. While the review finds the film more of a heartwarming, beautifully shot piece than a deep sociological probe, it praises the depiction of nature's healing power.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that narrows the path for millions of motorists to claim compensation over hidden commissions on car loans. The court sided with finance companies in two of three test cases, reversing earlier decisions that could have led to widespread payouts for discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs). The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had banned these deals in 2021, as they incentivized dealers to charge higher interest rates. While some motorists with specific types of unfair deals may still be eligible for compensation, the ruling significantly reduces the potential scale of the industry-wide redress.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve holding its benchmark interest rate steady, credit card debt forgiveness remains a worthwhile option for consumers with significant balances. Average credit card APRs are hovering near a record high of 22%, and any future rate cuts by the Fed are unlikely to provide substantial or immediate relief. With total U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.18 trillion, debt forgiveness offers a direct way to reduce the principal owed, which can be more effective than waiting for minor interest rate changes. The strategy is particularly relevant for those already behind on payments or at risk of default. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Industrial gas giant Linde reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, demonstrating its resilience in a challenging economic climate. The company's revenue and adjusted earnings per share both saw year-over-year increases, beating analyst estimates. Management highlighted its strong pricing power and a record sales backlog of $7.1 billion as key drivers of future growth. Despite concerns about a potential economic contraction, Linde raised the low end of its full-year earnings guidance, signaling confidence in its ability to perform through economic cycles.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has indicated he may call a special election in November to potentially redraw the state's congressional maps. This move is a direct response to efforts in Republican-led states like Texas to use mid-decade redistricting to secure a GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Before Democrats can redraw maps to their advantage, California voters would first need to approve changes to the state's independent redistricting commission. Newsom framed the potential action as a necessary response to "fight fire with fire" against what he called the "rigging of the system" by national Republicans.</p>

          <p>David Williams, the highest-ranking civil servant at the UK's Ministry of Defence, will leave his post this autumn. His departure follows the revelation of a massive data breach in February 2022 that exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans seeking refuge, as well as British spies and soldiers. The leak, which went undetected for months, has been a major embarrassment for the government. While the MoD framed the departure as part of a broader restructuring, it is understood that the Defence Secretary made it clear a change was necessary after the breach became public.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn as President Trump's announcement of new "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries triggered a broader risk-off sentiment among investors. While Bitcoin remained relatively stable, other major cryptocurrencies like Ether and XRP fell, and crypto-linked stocks saw significant losses. The slide prompted a wave of liquidations, further pushing prices down. Analysts suggest that in periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, investors tend to pull capital from speculative assets like crypto, leading to a "strategic cooldown" after a strong performance in the previous month.

The San Diego Padres, in particular, made aggressive moves to bolster their roster, acquiring high-impact players like pitcher Mason Miller and improving their lineup depth. This positions the Padres as a legitimate threat to overtake the Dodgers in the division race. The article contrasts the Padres' proactive, high-cost trades with the Dodgers' more cautious, value-driven approach, suggesting the wide-open World Series field has encouraged other teams to be bold.</p>

          <p>Experts testified to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that the night-vision goggles worn by Army pilots likely hampered their ability to see a passenger jet before a fatal midair collision over Washington D.C. in January.

The testimony is part of the NTSB's investigation into the crash that killed all 67 people aboard both aircraft.

          <p>Two large wildfires in the western U.S. have become so intense that they are generating "fire clouds," which can create their own erratic and dangerous weather. In Arizona, the Dragon Bravo fire on the Grand Canyon's North Rim has become a "mega-fire," charring over 164 square miles and forming pyrocumulus clouds. A separate large fire in Utah has produced a pyrocumulonimbus cloud, a fire-fueled thunderstorm that caused a smoke column to collapse, sending dangerous winds in all directions. These phenomena pose significant risks to firefighters and are becoming more frequent due to climate change-driven drought and extreme weather.</p>

          <p>After a period of relatively mild summer weather, Southern California is bracing for a significant heatwave next week. Temperatures are expected to soar past 100 degrees in valley areas by mid-week, with downtown Los Angeles potentially reaching the mid-90s. The warm-up is caused by a high-pressure system expanding from the southwest, replacing the low-pressure system that kept July's temperatures cooler. Officials are cautioning the public to stay hydrated and avoid strenuous outdoor activity, though widespread strong winds are not expected, which reduces the immediate risk of major fire weather conditions.</p>

          <p>A new tool called Balance, developed by security company Aura, is using artificial intelligence to help parents monitor their children's mental health by analyzing their online habits. The app establishes a baseline of a child's online behavior and uses AI to detect anomalies in language patterns, tone, and activity that could signal stress or mood shifts. The goal is to provide parents with reports that can open a dialogue with their children about potential struggles. While advocacy groups argue for broader regulation of tech companies, some parents in a clinical study found the app to be a useful conversation starter.</p>
