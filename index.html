          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the U.S. State Department has announced a new policy to revoke the visas of any foreign nationals found to be glorifying violence. Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau stated that consular officials will actively monitor social media for such rhetoric to protect the American people. This move builds on a previous policy of monitoring visa applicants' social media and comes after Kirk was fatally shot during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. The suspect in the shooting remains at large.</p>

          <p>Following an incident where Polish and Dutch jets shot down Russian drones in Polish airspace, the muted response from U.S. President Donald Trump has caused unease among NATO allies. While European leaders strongly condemned the "reckless" act, Trump's only public comment was a cryptic social media post, leaving allies questioning the U.S. commitment to collective defense under Article 5. Analysts suggest this silence may be exactly what Russian President Vladimir Putin intended, aiming to sow division within the alliance. The event has prompted calls for Europe to bolster its own defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>New data from the Department of Labor indicates a potential cooling in the U.S. job market, as initial unemployment claims rose to 263,000 last week, the highest number recorded since late 2021. This significant 27,000 increase from the previous week suggests that layoffs may be on the rise. Economists view this as one of the clearest signs yet of a downshift in job growth, which could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. While hiring has slowed, overall layoff numbers remain low by historical standards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has experienced a surprising sales success with its new "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras. The palm-sized cameras, which come in blind box packaging and feature vintage-style filters, sold out quickly on Kodak's website, tapping into Gen Z's appetite for nostalgic technology. This positive consumer response provides a bright spot for the company, which has been facing significant financial struggles, including a recent warning about its ability to continue operations. The product's popularity suggests a savvy move to capitalize on current market trends.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle's stock price fell by 7% after a report revealed that a significant portion of its projected growth is tied to a single customer, OpenAI. The decline followed a record-breaking 36% rally, which was fueled by the company's announcement of multi-billion-dollar cloud infrastructure contracts. The Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI is set to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years, tempering investor enthusiasm. This development has raised concerns among analysts about the sustainability of Oracle's growth and its heavy reliance on one client for its massive backlog. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The search for a new Federal Reserve chair is actively underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent meeting several potential candidates, including former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard. Bessent is also reportedly pushing a reform agenda for the central bank, aiming to reduce its economic footprint and shrink its massive bond portfolio in a non-disruptive manner. The process is occurring under close White House scrutiny, as President Trump has been advocating for an interest rate cut. The new chair will replace Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.</p>

          <p>The California legislature is debating a bill that would expand confidentiality for police officers involved in misconduct cases, a move critics argue would undermine recent transparency laws. The proposed legislation, AB 1178, could allow law enforcement agencies to shield the records of any officer who has worked undercover or received a death threat. While proponents, including police unions, argue the measure is necessary for officer safety, press advocates and police watchdogs contend it would gut public access to important information about police accountability.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump in September 2024, has begun in Florida, with Routh representing himself in court. Prosecutors allege that Routh's plot was "carefully crafted and deadly serious," intended to prevent voters from electing Trump. The key witness is a former Secret Service agent who testified he encountered Routh in an "ambush scenario" with a rifle protruding from bushes near Trump's golf course. Routh, who has pleaded not guilty, faces a possible life sentence if convicted on the charge.</p>

The attacks claimed 2,977 lives, marking the deadliest assault on U.S. soil by a foreign entity.

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration has filed an appeal against a federal judge's order that blocked him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had previously ruled that Cook's reinstatement was in the public interest to maintain the Federal Reserve's independence. Trump sought to remove Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Her lawyers argue the firing is a pretext in a broader campaign to pressure the Fed on interest rate policy.</p>

          <p>Legal experts are expressing growing concern over President Donald Trump's repeated threats to revoke the U.S. citizenship of his political opponents. While birthright citizenship is legally protected, the Trump administration's Justice Department has prioritized pursuing denaturalization for naturalized citizens, expanding the criteria for such actions. Scholars argue this transforms denaturalization from a rarely used legal tool against war criminals into a method of political intimidation. The threats create a chilling effect, undermining the security of citizenship and discouraging dissent among naturalized Americans.</p>

Variable and indexed annuities, as well as inflation protection riders, are presented as potential alternatives that may help hedge against rising costs, though they come with their own risks and complexities.
