          <h2>Trump Criticizes Fed Chair Powell Following Rate Decision</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 07:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to maintain current interest rates, citing economic uncertainties caused by tariffs. Trump expressed his frustration on Truth Social, calling Powell a "fool" and questioning the decision in light of low inflation and tariff revenue. The Fed indicated it would hold rates steady until the economic outlook becomes clearer, noting increased risks of higher unemployment and inflation. Powell responded to Trump's criticisms by asserting that the Fed's decisions would be based solely on economic data and the goal of maximum employment and price stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. and the United Kingdom have reached a "full and comprehensive" trade agreement. The deal, according to Trump, will solidify the relationship between the two countries for years to come, marking the UK as the first to reach such an agreement with the U.S. after recent tariff announcements. A spokesperson for the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed ongoing talks and promised an update later in the day, while The New York Times initially reported the impending announcement. The agreement is expected to alleviate some tariff burdens and foster closer economic ties between the U.S. and the U.K.</p>

          <p>An interim report indicates that the root cause of the fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport in March, disrupting hundreds of thousands of journeys, remains undetermined. The fire occurred at a nearby electrical substation, causing a power outage at the airport. The National Energy System Operator's (Neso) report noted that a transformer disconnected and caught fire, but the cause of the incident is still under investigation, with a final report due by the end of June. Heathrow Airport welcomed the findings and hopes the final report will provide answers to prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade deals might be announced this week as his administration faces pressure to finalize agreements before a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs expires. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed this timeline, stating that deals could be announced soon, with a "major trade deal" with a "big, highly respected country" expected. The announcement comes amidst ongoing market volatility and fears of a U.S. recession due to recently implemented tariffs. While the administration has not specified which countries are involved, negotiations have been ongoing with Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>President Trump briefly announced a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside America, causing immediate concern in Hollywood. Filmmakers feared the move would hurt U.S. filmmaking, leading to a drop in shares for Netflix and other entertainment companies. However, the White House quickly retracted the announcement, stating no tariff would take effect. The article explores the reasons behind Trump's consideration of protectionism for Hollywood, noting the industry's challenges, including the shift of filming locations overseas due to cheaper labor and tax incentives.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth, possibly on Saturday. The spacecraft, intended to land on Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction. Experts estimate the half-ton mass of metal could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, with a small chance of impacting someone or something. The spacecraft's landing capsule, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, may survive reentry.</p>

          <p>The CEO of United Airlines, Scott Kirby, outlined steps the FAA needs to take to fix delays at Newark Liberty International Airport, including limiting flights during construction, returning the airport to a slot-controlled system, modernizing air traffic control, and fully staffing ATC. These suggestions follow recent radar and communication outages that slowed air traffic into and out of Newark Liberty. The FAA is taking steps to improve the system, including installing new high-bandwidth communications, replacing copper wires with fiber optics, and adding a radar data center.</p>

The budget sustains a bloated government with discretionary spending remaining essentially unchanged. Entitlement programs remain largely untouched, making serious debt reduction unlikely.</p>
