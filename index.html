          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed his hope that Elon Musk and Donald Trump can resolve their differences following a recent public fallout over a multitrillion-dollar spending bill. Johnson emphasized the importance of collaboration for the country's benefit, stating that he did not craft the legislation to specifically please Musk, but rather to assist hardworking Americans. Musk had criticized the bill as a "disgusting abomination" that would lead to exploding federal deficits, while Johnson brushed aside these concerns. The Speaker has not spoken to Musk since last Monday regarding the GOP-led bill, but is hopeful that they will reconcile in the future. The Louisiana Republican believes that it is in the country's best interest for everyone to work together, despite the emotions involved.</p>

          <p>Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has called on the police to "do their bit" and embrace change as the Home Office and Treasury negotiate the upcoming Spending Review. Kyle highlighted the financial pressures faced by all sectors and emphasized the need for modernization and technological advancements within public services. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp voiced concerns about potential cuts to police numbers and urged the government to protect their budget. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to outline departmental spending allocations for the next three to four years, having already warned that not all departments will receive their desired funding levels. The government has already provided an additional £1bn to the police, but expects them to start embracing the change they need to do to do their bit for change as well.</p>

          <p>Senator Ron Johnson, a staunch ally of President Trump, has declared his opposition to the "big, beautiful bill," asserting that it falls short of Republicans' goals to cut government waste. Johnson insists that even pressure from the commander in chief will not deter him from speaking out against the legislation. He advocates for a return to pre-pandemic spending levels, a reduction significantly deeper than what House Republicans have proposed. Johnson believes that the current bill is merely rhetoric and slogans, as he claims the House picked a number out of thin air. He views the budget reconciliation process as a rare opportunity to make substantial spending cuts, though he acknowledges that many Republicans are hesitant to cut so deeply, given that the national debt continues to climb.</p>

          <p>President Trump has bypassed Governor Gavin Newsom's authority by calling up 2,000 National Guard troops to address immigration protests in Los Angeles. This deployment is being carried out under a rarely used law, indicating the administration's assertive approach to immigration enforcement. The move follows clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators in cities like Paramount and Compton, reflecting escalating tensions over federal immigration operations.

The deputy marshal matched the general description of an individual sought by ICE and was detained at a federal building in Tucson. Officials confirmed the marshal's identity was quickly verified by other law enforcement officers, leading to his immediate release. The incident occurred amid increasing pressure from the White House on ICE agents to increase arrests.

Manager Thomas Tuchel criticized the team for lacking seriousness and urgency in the World Cup qualifier. Kane noted that the team lacked quality and appeared fatigued, both physically and mentally, leading to a performance that did not meet their standards.

These bodies, believed to be prisoners executed between 1946 and 1953 for alleged communist sympathies, were found during park renovations. The supervising engineer of the project believes more bodies are buried nearby, possibly under adjacent streets. Unlike previous finds where bodies were neatly arranged, these remains were jumbled and incomplete, with torsos and heads separated. Relatives of the executed have requested DNA testing to identify the bodies, but testing has not yet commenced.</p>

Blow identifies a phenomenon he calls "The Great Blackout," which involves the erasure of Black history and Black symbols in some quarters. This includes actions such as the dismantling of the Black Lives Matter Plaza street mural in Washington, D.C., and the removal of Harriet Tubman's image and quote from a National Park Service page.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which operates the Madleen, accused Israel of jamming their communications as they approached Gaza.

Advocates for immigrants' rights reported detentions outside Home Depot and Dale's Donuts stores. L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna said non-lethal munitions were fired by federal agents before deputies arrived, and that some protestors attempted to block a U.S. Marshals Service bus, while others threw rocks and other objects at law enforcement vehicles.</p>

          <p>A Florida weatherman's candid remarks about his lack of confidence in predicting hurricane paths this year have resonated with many. The forecaster cited concerns about how federal budget cuts could affect the accuracy of hurricane season predictions. His comments touched a nerve amid growing anxieties about the potential impact of reduced resources on weather forecasting capabilities. The National Hurricane Center has predicted a 60% chance of an "above-normal" hurricane season, with between 13 to 19 named storms.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his readiness for a ceasefire brokered by the United States, accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of aiming for the "total defeat" of Ukraine. In an interview with ABC News, Zelenskyy said Putin is uninterested in peace and that only "hard pressure" led by the U.S. and joined by European allies would render Putin to be "pragmatic." He emphasized that the President of the United States has all the powers and enough leverage to step up. Zelenskyy called for a ceasefire and said that Ukraine is ready to lay down its arms without conditions if Russia will, too.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has denied that the party is in chaos following a tumultuous 48 hours in which its chairman Zia Yusuf resigned and then returned in a different role. Tice stated that chairing the party was a "tough, brutal job" and that Yusuf was "essentially exhausted" after 11 months in the role. Yusuf's initial resignation came shortly after he criticized Sarah Pochin, Reform's newest MP, for asking if the government would ban the burka. Tice insisted that the party knows "exactly what it is doing" and that Yusuf will now focus on the party's unit tasked with identifying spending cuts at councils.</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi shared the story of the most challenging money conversation he and his wife, Cassandra, ever had: negotiating their prenuptial agreement. Sethi explained that he had talked to many people and planned what he was going to say, but was still very nervous about it. Although Cassandra was open to the idea of a prenup, their negotiations became contentious due to differing expectations and understandings of money. They eventually sought help from a therapist, who helped them understand their different views on money. The therapist asked how they each view money, which opened up conversations that they hadn't been able to have before.</p>

An online safety campaigner has accused the government of delaying bringing in new laws to protect children.

          <p>A new CBS News poll reveals mixed views on the Trump administration's deportation program, with positive net approval but contrasting opinions on its scope. A slight majority believe the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, leading to strong support. However, if the focus shifts from dangerous criminals, support drops significantly. Half of Americans say Trump is deporting more people than they expected, leading to disapproval. While more people see the program making the U.S. safer, there are concerns about its potential economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

These principles are: resolving disputes through consultation on an equal footing, managing differences through rules-based co-management, achieving positive outcomes through mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing interference from external forces while encouraging them to play a constructive role. The report blames regional tensions on external actors who fuel rival claimants’ actions and weaken the “willingness for maritime cooperation”.

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused First Minister John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign ahead of last week's Holyrood by-election. Sarwar claimed the SNP were pushing voters to Reform UK through their tactics, which he described as "shameful." Swinney justified his "two-horse race" remark by saying Labour's vote share had "collapsed" in the by-election and that his party's own data showed a surge for Reform. Scottish Labour won an unexpected victory in Thursday's by-election as Davy Russell took the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse seat.</p>
