          <p>The Japanese government is allocating 100 billion yen to attract foreign researchers, aiming to create an elite research environment amidst global competition in fields like AI and semiconductors. The initiative intends to counteract the departure of researchers from the United States due to funding cuts and prioritization of American students. This policy package will fund existing programs, including Tohoku University's plan to recruit 500 researchers, and seeks to raise researcher salaries while reducing administrative burdens. Despite these efforts, Japan's ranking in highly cited scientific papers remained low last year, underscoring the need for further improvements in research output.</p>

          <p>Following a series of Israeli airstrikes on Iran, investors are flocking to safe-haven assets such as gold, U.S. Treasuries, and the U.S. dollar, amid fears of escalating regional conflict. Israel stated the operation targeted Iran's nuclear program, leading to a risk-off move across global markets, with European and U.S. stock futures also declining. Oil prices experienced a dramatic surge due to concerns about potential supply disruptions stemming from retaliation by Iran. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio clarified that the U.S. was not involved in the strikes, emphasizing the protection of American forces in the region, as the situation continues to unfold.</p>

          <p>The newly elected Canadian government is facing criticism over its proposed border bill, which grants law enforcement broad powers to access citizen data and aligns Canada's refugee policies with those of the U.S. Critics argue that Bill C-2 infringes on privacy rights by allowing warrantless access to telecommunications information and infringes on the right to due process for refugees. The legislation changes the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to grant the minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship extensive powers to cancel immigration documents, and to suspend or cancel intake in any immigration stream if a high number of applications are pending. Concerns are also raised about the bill's disproportionate impact on women, racialized claimants, and LGBTQ+ individuals, raising fears of a growing surveillance state.</p>

Iran's current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, maintains the same antagonistic stance, questioning the Holocaust and supporting groups like Hezbollah.

          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States, China is encouraging the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help exporters shift their focus to the domestic market.

While international L/Cs are limited to physical goods, domestic L/Cs can also be used in the trade of services, offering greater flexibility.

          <p>North Korea asserts it has successfully relaunched its new 5,000-ton naval destroyer, following an initial failed launch where the warship capsized. Leader Kim Jong Un reportedly reacted furiously to the incident and demanded swift repairs, leading to the arrest of several officials. State media claims the ship is now fully restored, but experts question the completeness of the repairs given the short timeframe. Kim Jong Un oversaw the relaunch and reiterated plans to build more destroyers, emphasizing the development of a nuclear-armed navy.</p>

          <p>Markets in Asia opened lower, and oil prices surged after Israel attacked Iran's capital, escalating tensions over Tehran's nuclear program. U.S. benchmark crude oil and Brent crude both experienced significant increases, while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 and Seoul's Kospi indexes fell. Despite the initial downturn, analysts expect Asian markets to recover quickly due to limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties with unaffected Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The previous day, U.S. stock indexes had risen following encouraging inflation data, though Boeing shares declined after the Air India crash.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel launched attacks on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and military personnel, due to concerns that Iran was close to assembling nuclear weapons. Israel's rationale includes the perception that Iran's regional influence and deterrent power have weakened, making this an opportune time to act. By piercing Iran's immunity through attacks on its own territory, Israel aims to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear statehood. The attacks carry risks of retaliation, but Israel calculates that these risks are manageable while Iran is at its weakest.</p>

          <p>India is taking steps to tap into its rare earth reserves to counter China's restrictions on rare earth exports. Experts suggest that India could become an alternative source for partners like the U.S., but it requires significant public and private investment. The recent shortage has highlighted China's dominance in rare earth production and processing, giving Beijing leverage over crucial minerals. India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal has called China's pause in exports a "wake-up call" and an opportunity for India to step up.</p>

          <p>Former NFL star Antonio Brown is facing an arrest warrant in Miami-Dade County on a charge of attempted murder with a firearm.

Factors contributing to this trend include changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children.
