          <p>A Florida woman, Latrance Battle, was arrested after posing as an ICE agent and kidnapping her ex-boyfriend's wife. Battle, dressed in a black shirt with "ICE" printed on it, flashed a sheriff's office business card and told the victim she had to come with her. The victim, fearing for her safety, complied until Battle took her to an apartment complex, at which point the victim fled and called law enforcement. Battle faces charges including kidnapping, robbery, and impersonating a law enforcement officer.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life in prison for murdering her two children, has been found guilty of conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Prosecutors argued that Daybell orchestrated the shooting to collect his $1 million life insurance policy and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. The prosecution also presented evidence that Daybell invoked "twisted" religious beliefs, claiming Vallow was possessed by an evil spirit and giving her brother "religious authority" to kill him. She will be sentenced following another trial where she is accused of scheming with her brother to kill her niece's ex-husband.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite repeatedly criticizing him and urging the Fed to lower interest rates more aggressively. Trump's remarks follow weeks of public pressure on Powell, with the president arguing that lower rates would stimulate economic growth. Powell has cited "uncertainty" as the reason for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. The conflict has raised concerns about the Fed's independence and its ability to make economic decisions without political influence.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks surged after investors were buoyed by potential de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. The Dow rose over 1,000 points, rebounding from a significant sell-off triggered by President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about easing conflict with China may have contributed to the turnaround. Investors also took comfort in Trump's statement that he has "no intention of firing" Powell.</p>
