          <p>Former CIA Director David Petraeus stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin is the main barrier to achieving peace in the war with Ukraine. Petraeus expressed doubt about a potential meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, arguing that Putin shows no intention of ending the conflict without gaining additional territory. He urged the United States to increase its support for Ukraine by lifting weapon restrictions, seizing frozen Russian assets, and imposing further sanctions. This increased aid, Petraeus believes, is necessary to alter the war's dynamics and compel Russia toward a resolution.</p>

          <p>An Ohio-based tiny living enthusiast, Levi Kelly, successfully built a 19.4-by-4-foot house in his yard for approximately $5,000, utilizing many materials he already owned. The month-long project resulted in a fully functional, off-grid capable home equipped with solar power, heating and air conditioning, a compact kitchen, and a toilet. Despite its closet-sized dimensions, the structure proved durable enough to withstand a snowstorm. Kelly, who documents unique Airbnbs, views the project as a testament to creative space efficiency, though he does not plan to live in it full-time.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officials and psychotherapists are warning about the increasing prevalence of nihilistic violence, characterized by destructive acts lacking clear ideological motives. According to the Global Terrorism Index, 65% of terrorist attacks in Western countries in 2024 were not associated with a specific belief system, complicating counterterrorism efforts. Experts describe perpetrators as often feeling alienated and powerless, driven by a desire for impact through destruction, making such attacks highly unpredictable. The recent mass shooting in a New York City office building is cited as an example of this disturbing trend, which erodes the public's sense of safety.</p>

          <p>Despite stringent U.S. sanctions, including the blacklisting of China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), China's nuclear industry has achieved advanced capabilities and a large industrial scale. This progress has created a situation where China has become a benchmark of efficiency that Western nations, now struggling with their own nuclear expansions, cannot access. Sama Bilbao y León, Director General of the World Nuclear Association, highlighted the complexity of the geopolitical situation. She emphasized that the nuclear industry is global and that excluding China's expertise threatens to hinder the West's own efforts to revive atomic energy.</p>

          <p>Emine Erdogan, wife of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has written a letter to U.S. First Lady Melania Trump, appealing for her to help the children affected by the conflict in Gaza. Referencing Mrs. Trump's previous outreach to Russia regarding Ukrainian children, Erdogan asked her to show similar compassion for Palestinian youth and to urge Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the humanitarian crisis. The letter highlights the severe psychological trauma experienced by children in the conflict zone. The appeal comes as the death toll in Gaza continues to rise, with the UN noting that a majority of civilians killed have been women and children.</p>

          <p>American universities are facing a crisis of public trust and identity, caught between political pressures from both the left and right that threaten their core mission. The authors argue that to save their souls, universities must vigorously defend academic freedom and adopt a stance of institutional neutrality on social and political issues. This approach would allow individual faculty and students to express diverse viewpoints freely while the university itself focuses on creating an environment for open inquiry. By failing to do so, universities risk becoming "sectarian" institutions, losing their credibility and their vital role as producers of knowledge for all.</p>

Correspondence reveals a debate among Jesuit leaders, with some raising serious concerns while others advocated for him, believing his "psychosexual problem was under sufficient control." Even the order's worldwide leader at the time, Pedro Arrupe, whose cause for sainthood is active, was involved in discussions to postpone the ordination.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has shifted his political strategy to a direct and aggressive confrontation with President Donald Trump, mirroring some of the president's own tactics. After Trump's administration took actions targeting California, Newsom launched lawsuits and a special election ballot measure to redraw congressional maps, aiming to counter a similar Republican gerrymander in Texas. This "fight fire with fire" approach includes unfiltered social media posts and sharp rhetoric, a departure from traditional Democratic decorum. The move is seen as a high-stakes gamble that could define Newsom's national political future ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>A pair of coyotes, nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, have become residents of New York's Central Park, drawing the attention of local photographers and wildlife enthusiasts. This is part of a broader trend of coyotes expanding their territory eastward and adapting to urban life across the United States, with an estimated 20 living in New York City. Experts from groups like Gotham Coyote explain that the animals are highly adaptable and pose little danger to humans if given space and not fed. City officials have shifted from a capture-and-remove policy to one promoting coexistence, educating the public to ensure both people and wildlife can safely share park spaces.</p>

          <p>Despite initial investor disappointment with trial data, some analysts believe Eli Lilly's daily obesity pill, orforglipron, remains a strong potential competitor to Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide. While Lilly's pill showed slightly less weight loss, it has key advantages as a small-molecule drug: it is easier to manufacture at scale and does not require the dietary restrictions associated with Novo's peptide-based pill. These factors could allow for global availability and potentially lower pricing, a significant edge in a market where many health plans do not cover obesity treatments. Goldman Sachs analysts forecast Lilly's pill could capture a majority share of the oral weight loss drug market by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new meme is trending on TikTok and in real-life contests, centered on the "performative male," a man who adopts an alternative, intellectual aesthetic to appeal to progressive women. This archetype is characterized by interests like feminist literature, indie music, tote bags, and matcha. While often lighthearted, the trend also touches on a deeper skepticism about whether these traits are genuine or a deceptive performance to mask more toxic behaviors. The phenomenon reflects a broader cultural conversation about modern masculinity, authenticity in dating, and the suspicion that can arise when men adopt traits and aesthetics traditionally coded as feminine or queer.</p>

          <p>In the Cayman Islands, scientists have captured the first-ever video record of the roughskin dogfish in the central Caribbean, offering new insights into the rarely seen predator. Using a baited camera lowered to 3,500 feet, researchers were delighted when several of the small sharks appeared and swam past the lens 54 times. The species is typically only seen as accidental bycatch in deep-sea fishing operations. This successful use of a noninvasive video system highlights its value as a tool for studying deep-sea biodiversity and expanding knowledge of elusive species, which is crucial for conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>A Tesla owner shared an honest review of his first year with the electric vehicle, noting that while his savings on fuel were less than expected, the real financial benefit came from reduced maintenance costs. In a TikTok video, he reported spending $1,432 on charging while saving an estimated $334 on gas. However, he contrasted this with the tens of thousands he spent on repairs for his previous car, having only spent $600 on two new tires for the Tesla after 15,000 miles. He concluded that the savings from avoiding frequent repairs will increase significantly the more he drives the car.</p>

          <p>Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator, writes that despite the Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and actions that undermine environmental protections, Americans should not despair in the fight against climate change. She argues that significant progress continues at the state and local levels, with states like California, Florida, and Texas setting records for clean energy. McCarthy emphasizes that corporations, investors, and international partners also remain committed to decarbonization because it is economically and environmentally necessary. She asserts that this widespread momentum ensures that the U.S. can still lead on climate, regardless of the federal government's current stance.</p>

          <p>Despite being offered by 86% of workplace retirement plans, only 18% of eligible participants made Roth 401(k) contributions in 2024, according to a Vanguard analysis. This feature allows for after-tax contributions that can then grow and be withdrawn completely tax-free in retirement, a significant long-term benefit. Experts suggest the low adoption rate is partly because plans often default employees into traditional pre-tax contributions. Unlike pre-tax funds, Roth 401(k)s do not have required minimum distributions for the original account owner, which can be a major advantage for managing retirement income and tax burdens.

Drawing from personal experience, she describes reading aloud not just as a way to instill a love of literature, but as a method for guiding a child's understanding of the world. The act of sharing a book creates a unique bond and provides parents with a window into their child's developing mind. From poetry in the maternity ward to board books at home, reading aloud becomes a tool for teaching language, concepts, and connection.</p>
