            <p>A significant sandstorm swept across central and southern Iraq, causing over a thousand people to seek medical attention for respiratory problems. The storm, characterized by a thick orange haze, reduced visibility to less than one kilometer, leading to power cuts and flight suspensions in affected regions. Health officials in Muthanna province reported at least 700 cases of suffocation, while other provinces like Najaf, Diwaniyah, Dhi Qar, and Basra also saw numerous hospitalizations due to breathing difficulties, with children among those affected. Experts suggest that such dust storms are becoming more frequent in Iraq due to the effects of climate change.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has stated that his country will not return Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported from the U.S. and is now held in a Salvadoran mega-prison. Bukele made these comments during a meeting with Donald Trump, highlighting the strong relationship between the two leaders. The U.S. Supreme Court had previously ruled that the Trump administration should facilitate Ábrego García's return, but Bukele's refusal creates a diplomatic and legal challenge. The U.S. government has conceded the deportation was an "administrative error," though they also allege Ábrego García is a gang member, a claim his lawyer denies.</p>

            <p>During a magnitude 5.2 earthquake at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, a herd of African elephants exhibited a remarkable display of protective behavior by forming a tight "alert circle" around their young. This defensive formation, typically used in the wild to shield youngsters from threats, demonstrates the elephants' strong social bonds and communication skills. The elephants, including adults Ndlula, Umngani, and Khosi, and younger elephants Zuli and Mkhaya, quickly assessed the situation and resumed normal activities after determining the danger had passed. This behavior was also observed during a 2010 earthquake, highlighting the elephants' consistent protective instincts.</p>

Harvard President Alan Garber argued that the demands would dictate what private universities can teach and whom they can admit, infringing on academic freedom. The administration claims Harvard is not upholding civil rights laws and has failed to address antisemitism on campus. Harvard has a $53 billion endowment, which could allow it to withstand the financial pressure.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard University due to concerns over antisemitism and alleged civil rights violations, including DEI programs. This action followed Harvard's rejection of the administration's demands to eliminate these programs and screen international students for ideological issues. Harvard President Alan Garber argued that the demands represented direct governmental regulation of the university's intellectual conditions. The administration's actions have prompted legal challenges and protests from alumni and faculty.</p>

            <p>Five years after the death of Nongjian Tao, a celebrated Chinese scientist at Arizona State University, questions remain surrounding the circumstances. Tao, known for his contributions to nanoscience, was found dead after an apparent fall, with his death ruled a suicide. Colleagues were initially told he had a heart condition and slipped while exercising. However, a police report indicated work-related stress as a factor. The case highlights the pressures faced by scientists and the lingering questions surrounding his untimely death.</p>

            <p>Research indicates a significant drop in the number of plays and musicals staged by UK theaters over the past decade, attributed to funding cuts and rising costs. The number of original productions by the top 40 subsidized theater companies decreased by 31% since 2014. Some theaters are co-producing larger shows to mitigate costs, but smaller-scale productions are being squeezed out. Additionally, changing audience tastes have made it harder to stage "serious drama," with audiences preferring more entertaining and less risky productions.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Donald Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a reshoring of supply chains to the U.S. Most companies surveyed believe that bringing back supply chains would significantly increase costs. Instead, they are more likely to relocate to lower-tariffed countries. Automation would likely dominate if manufacturing returns to the U.S., with a majority of respondents feeling that the Trump administration is "bullying corporate America."</p>
