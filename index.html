        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Epic Games announced that Fortnite is still blocked on iOS devices globally, following Apple's refusal to reinstate the game on the U.S. App Store. This decision extends to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union, despite the Digital Markets Act allowing third-party app stores. The conflict originated in 2020 when Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission fees by linking to its own website for in-app purchases, leading to Fortnite's removal from the App Store. The game had been available in Europe through Epic Games' own store, but the recent block affects all iOS users worldwide. Optimism surrounding the return of Fortnite to iOS has dwindled due to the continuing dispute between Epic Games and Apple.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent visit to Saudi Arabia has elicited varied responses from Saudi citizens, with some expressing strong support and others remaining unimpressed. Many Saudis admire Trump's direct communication style and perceived shared values, drawing parallels between his business-oriented approach to politics and the Saudi norm. Some Saudis also praised Trump's Middle East policy, including the removal of sanctions on Syria. However, some citizens voiced disapproval of Trump's economic policies and overall impact on America, while others expressed general dislike for America's culture and politics. This article from the New York Times highlights the complex and nuanced views of Saudis towards President Trump and his policies.</p>

These tariffs are paid by U.S. companies, who typically pass the costs to consumers through higher prices.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is debating proposed changes to a bill that would legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults expected to die within six months. MPs have clashed over issues such as the role of doctors and whether medical staff should raise the option of assisted dying with patients. Amendments being considered aim to ensure no one is obligated to provide assistance and to prevent undue pressure on vulnerable individuals. The bill has faced intense scrutiny, with strong opinions on both sides regarding its potential impact on society and vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>This article examines the relationship between 73-year-old Bill Belichick and 24-year-old Jordon Hudson, questioning whether it's a genuine partnership or exploitation. It delves into the resurgence of the term "gold digger" and its misogynistic undertones, particularly in light of Hudson's increasing role in Belichick's career. The piece argues that the label serves as a way to deride women who take seriously the idea that their financial well-being should depend on their relationships with men, and it is a way to avoid addressing systemic inequities.</p>
