Trump noted that Israel dropped a significant number of bombs shortly after the deal was made, while Iran allegedly fired missiles towards Israel. Despite the violations, Trump expressed his belief that Iran remains committed to peace. The president's remarks highlight the fragility of the ceasefire and the ongoing tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential consequences of Medicaid work requirements, citing examples from Arkansas and Georgia where similar measures led to increased uninsurance rates and medical debt without boosting employment. Advocates warn that these requirements could disproportionately affect older adults, people with disabilities, and caregivers, potentially leading to significant healthcare losses. The article highlights stories of individuals who rely on Medicaid and would struggle to meet the proposed work requirements, potentially resulting in severe health consequences. Researchers estimate that cuts to health programs, including Medicaid, could lead to tens of thousands of lost lives annually.</p>

          <p>A new EU report indicates that more than one in five Europeans are exposed to unhealthy levels of noise pollution from transport, impacting over 100 million people. Long-term exposure to traffic noise is linked to cardiovascular disease, mental illness, diabetes, and premature death, with children and young people being particularly vulnerable. The report identifies road traffic as the main source of noise pollution, especially in urban areas, leading to significant health and economic costs. The report says without additional regulatory or legislative action, the EU is unlikely to reach existing targets aiming for a 30% reduction in the number of people chronically disturbed by transport noise by 2030.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, faces a significant crisis as a rebellion grows within his party over planned welfare reforms. Over 120 Labour MPs have signed an amendment to block the proposed changes, which aim to save £5 billion a year by 2030. The reforms target Personal Independence Payments (Pips) and Universal Credit, and the government's ability to pass the bill is now uncertain. Labour insiders suggest that poor party management and a lack of listening to concerns have contributed to the rebellion, potentially leading to a significant challenge to the Prime Minister's authority.</p>

          <p>Three men have been sentenced to prison for kidnapping and assaulting a teenager in Middlesbrough, UK. The men chased the boy on his bike, beat him with weapons, and forced him into a van. The victim was later thrown out of the van and dragged along the road before managing to escape. The sentences range from seven to ten years, and two other gang members will be sentenced later this week.</p>

          <h2>US Marine Jailed for Sexual Assault in Japan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 07:35:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US marine has been sentenced to seven years in prison in Japan after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman in Okinawa. The case is one of several involving US service members in Okinawa, where more than half of the 54,000 US soldiers serving in Japan are based. Local opposition to the US bases goes beyond just the criminal cases, extending to aircraft noise and pollution. There have been previous efforts to move the US bases to less populated parts of Okinawa, but many locals want them removed altogether.</p>
