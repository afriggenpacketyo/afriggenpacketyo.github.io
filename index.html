          <p>A woman identified as 'Jane,' a former girlfriend of Sean 'Diddy' Combs, testified in court about Combs's alleged pattern of 'love bombing' to pressure her into participating in 'hotel nights.' According to her testimony, Combs would shower her with affection and persistence when he wanted her to have sex with other men, which she resisted. Text messages presented in court revealed 'Jane' expressing her discomfort and feeling objectified, while Combs denied her accusations. 'Jane' also testified about an incident where she vomited during a 'hotel night' and was allegedly urged by Combs to continue. After the night, she requested money from Combs to furnish her home, but he responded negatively. The testimony sheds light on the dynamics of their relationship and the alleged coercion she experienced. The article is based on the actual testimony and court records.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Tennessee was contained overnight after officers deployed chemical agents. The incident began when several inmates refused to return to their cells, leading to a multi-agency response. CoreCivic, the company that runs the facility, reported that the inmates became disruptive, attempted to destroy property, compromised security cameras, and set small fires. Three guards were held hostage but were safely released with no major injuries. The prisoners were contained within the facility fences and never reached the main fence where they could escape. One correctional officer received minor injuries and was treated at a hospital.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent New York Federal Reserve survey indicates that Americans' fears about inflation decreased in May, coinciding with President Trump's decision to ease some tariff threats. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 3.2%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease from April, while the three-year and five-year forecasts also saw slight declines. This shift in attitude aligns with Trump's initial imposition of tariffs followed by a 90-day negotiating window. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett highlighted that inflation has decreased despite rising tariff revenue. The survey also revealed positive movement in employment, with fewer respondents expecting to lose their jobs, and increased confidence in the stock market. The survey provides insights into consumer expectations regarding inflation and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic National Committee officers are accusing DNC Vice Chair David Hogg of leaking an audio recording that reveals internal party disagreements. The leaked audio features DNC Chair Ken Martin expressing frustration with Hogg, claiming his actions have hindered Martin's ability to lead and raise money. Other DNC officers have criticized Hogg's behavior, accusing him of undermining the party for personal gain. Hogg responded by deflecting the issue, pointing to Trump's actions and urging unity. The DNC is holding a vote on whether to nullify the election of Hogg and another vice chair due to gender-balance rules, though Hogg claims it's an attempt to oust him for his reform efforts. The controversy highlights internal tensions within the Democratic Party as it seeks to regroup after recent election defeats.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles, the Trump administration's border czar, Tom Homan, clarified that his comments about potentially arresting California officials were taken out of context. Homan stated that while no one is above the law, his remarks were a general assertion that anyone who commits a crime during protests would be prosecuted. President Trump echoed similar sentiments, warning that California officials who obstruct law and order would face charges. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state plans to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration for illegally federalizing the National Guard.

          <p>President Trump's proclamation restricting travel and immigration from 12 countries and partially suspending entry from seven others went into effect, citing national security concerns. The ban affects legal immigrants and temporary visa holders from countries including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Exceptions are made for U.S. permanent residents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens, and certain other categories. The White House justified the ban by citing factors such as the presence of terrorists and failure to cooperate on visa security. This action follows a series of previous travel bans issued during Trump's first administration, which were met with legal challenges but ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>

The split, expected by mid-2026, reverses the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery. The move aims to allow each company to pursue investment opportunities and drive shareholder value, as cable networks face declining viewership due to the shift to streaming services. The company will focus on scaling up HBO Max and aims to reach 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams signed an executive order adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. The order requires city agencies to use the IHRA definition, which has been criticized for potentially suppressing legitimate criticism of Israel. Adams described antisemitism as a growing problem and referenced recent attacks targeting Jewish individuals. The move comes ahead of the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, where support for Israel has become a key issue. Critics argue that the IHRA definition is designed to shield Israel from criticism by equating certain criticisms with antisemitism. The order has sparked debate about free speech and the balance between combating antisemitism and protecting political expression.</p>

          <p>China's control over the global supply of samarium, a rare earth metal, is raising concerns in the West due to its importance in military applications. Samarium is essential for rebuilding inventories of fighter jets, missiles, and other hardware. The United States and its allies rely on China for this critical mineral, creating a strategic vulnerability. The situation highlights the potential risks associated with relying on a single country for essential materials needed for defense and security.</p>

The North East London Foundation NHS Trust (NELFT) and ward manager Benjamin Aninakwa were convicted under the Health and Safety at Work Act. Alice had a history of suicide attempts and was able to access bin bags from a communal toilet, which she used to take her own life.
