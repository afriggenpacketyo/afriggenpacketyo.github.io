Despite a 7% year-on-year revenue increase, the company's net income also saw a substantial rise of 279% compared to the previous year, but this was off a low base. The article mentions that macroeconomic volatility and the U.S.-China trade war have affected consumer sentiment in China, impacting Alibaba's performance.

          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey announced that the retail giant will be raising prices on some items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reduction in duties on Chinese imports. The price increases are expected to begin towards the end of May and become more noticeable in June. The company will absorb some of the costs, but consumers will likely see higher prices on items such as toys, electronics, bananas, avocados, and coffee.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, after which it would revert to $2,000 and be indexed for inflation. However, the plan excludes 17 million children in low-income families who do not owe federal taxes and requires both parents to have a Social Security number, affecting 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present. The refundable portion of the credit is capped at $1,700 for 2025, and the tax break phases out for married couples with AGI exceeding $400,000 and other taxpayers with AGI over $200,000.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, focusing on whether a single district court judge can block a policy nationwide. The justices did not consider the legal merits of Trump's order, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born to undocumented migrants. Several justices questioned the legality of the order, with Justice Sotomayor stating it violated four Supreme Court precedents. The court also explored the history and practicalities of universal injunctions, with concerns raised about potential chaos if citizenship depended on the state where a child was born.</p>

He argues that these companies can better absorb costs or negotiate with suppliers to maintain lower prices for consumers. While Walmart warned of potential downside risks to profits due to tariffs, Cramer believes the company, along with Costco and Amazon, can leverage their strong balance sheets and private label brands to remain competitive. Costco's steady membership revenue and Amazon's profitable AWS cloud unit further bolster their ability to manage tariff costs.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his administration is nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, a key objective of his second term. Trump claimed that Iran has “sort of agreed to the terms,” but the details of the deal remain unclear. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran would never give up its right to civilian nuclear energy, adding that none of its nuclear enrichment facilities would be dismantled. Envoys from Iran and the United States have engaged in four rounds of talks, mediated by Oman, to resolve their decades-old dispute over Iran’s nuclear activities.</p>

It clarifies that there are no government-sponsored programs for credit card debt elimination, but individuals can negotiate with creditors or explore debt settlement programs. The article also mentions bankruptcy as a potential option for complete debt forgiveness, while noting the negative impacts on credit scores and the potential need to pay income taxes on the forgiven amount.

          <p>Belgium's parliament voted to drop the country's planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a law passed in 2003. The decision aims to pave the way for a realistic and resilient energy model, according to Energy Minister Mathieu Bihet. The move follows a 2022 decision to delay the phaseout by 10 years due to energy uncertainty caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. Nuclear energy currently accounts for around 40% of Belgium's power generation. Other European countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden, are also planning to build new nuclear plants.</p>

By accessing these accounts, the bad actors could then target other officials or their associates by using stolen information, according to the announcement.

Trump has long used questions about citizenship and who gets to claim to be an American to power his rise from reality TV star to commander in chief. The issue before the court on Thursday was primarily about whether federal judges have the power to order block presidential actions through wide-ranging temporary pauses, known as nationwide injunctions. A ruling in Mr. Trump’s favor could set the stage for him to implement his order ending automatic citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and certain foreign residents.</p>
