          <p>Lina Magull, a former star player for the German national team and Inter Milan midfielder, has publicly shared her struggles with depression. Magull revealed that she sought treatment at a private clinic after experiencing panic attacks and losing her passion for football and life. She credits the therapy she received during her six-week stay with helping her rediscover her love for the sport and find meaning in life again. Magull, who retired from the national team in March 2025, is now focused on her club career and is proud of her decision to prioritize her mental health, viewing it as a greater achievement than any titles she has won.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has presented the UK's spending review, detailing budgets for government departments over the next three years. The review covers day-to-day budgets for staffing and public services, along with investment budgets for infrastructure projects like hospitals and schools until the end of the decade. This is the first multi-year spending review since 2021, outlining key financial allocations and priorities for the UK government. It is important to note that spending reviews are not budgets which contain changes to taxes or new policies, but rather it is a detailing of existing spending.</p>

          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has implemented a new rule that allows players to protect their rankings while undergoing fertility treatments. This policy enables players to take time away from professional tennis for procedures like egg or embryo freezing and return with a protected ranking. Players must be out for at least 10 consecutive weeks to qualify and will receive a "Special Entry Ranking" based on their recent performance, which can be used for three tournaments upon their return. The rule expands the WTA's support programs for female athletes, addressing fertility challenges and balancing career and family choices.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 10:04:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that AI-generated art lacks the depth and sensory richness of human creativity because AI models cannot represent human senses like smell and touch. Researchers found that Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand concepts like flowers in the same way humans do, as they lack the sensory and motor experiences needed to fully grasp such concepts. The study, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, indicates that AI's creativity is often "hollow and shallow" due to its inability to connect words and concepts to sensory experiences. The authors suggest that future LLMs augmented with sensor data and robotics might improve, but independent experts remain uncertain about the future of sensory AI.</p>

          <p>President Trump's political operation has reportedly approached Texas Republicans to discuss redrawing the state's congressional map ahead of the midterm elections next year, aiming to protect the Republican's slim majority in the House. Texas Republicans have held preliminary meetings on the topic, but details remain unclear. Currently, Republicans hold a 25-12 majority of the state's seats, with one Democratic seat vacant. Any redistricting effort could target up to five Democratic seats, but it also carries the risk of legal challenges or Democratic gains in a wave election. The White House and Gov. Greg Abbott's office have not commented on the discussions.</p>

          <p>The European Union is evaluating whether a recent increase in Chinese exports to the bloc, coinciding with a significant drop in shipments to the United States due to high US tariffs, could necessitate emergency measures. Despite the surge in exports to the EU, the European Commission states that it is "too early to conclude" whether trade diversion is occurring. The EU official explained that a trend needs to be observed and the question of harm to EU industry needs to be assessed before any conclusions can be drawn. The EU has implemented a new customs surveillance system to monitor trade diversions that could negatively impact EU industries.</p>

The review promises more free school meals for children in England whose parents receive universal credit, starting in September 2026. It also includes funding for community renewal projects, such as improvements to libraries and pools, but suggests future rises in council tax. Additionally, the £3 bus fare cap will continue until at least March 2027, and there will be more help for pensioners in winter, with the winter fuel payment extended to all pensioners in England and Wales with an annual taxable income of £35,000 or less.</p>

Trump has deployed thousands of troops, including US Marines, to Los Angeles, leading to conflict with state officials who assert they have the situation under control.

          <p>Elon Musk has stated that he regrets some of the posts he made about President Trump during a previous social media feud. Musk acknowledged that his comments "went too far" on his platform X. This comes after Trump expressed openness to reconciliation in an interview, stating he felt "a little disappointed" about the fallout but harbored "no hard feelings." The two had a public disagreement after Musk stepped back from his White House role and criticized Trump's tax bill, which Musk believed would cause a recession. Musk's initial comments included unsubstantiated claims about Trump's involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, leading to Trump threatening to cancel government contracts with Musk's SpaceX.</p>

          <p>Experts say that Donald Trump's deployment of military force to Los Angeles was years in the making, stemming from his regret over not taking a more heavy-handed approach to the 2020 protests. After his first term, Trump expressed regret for not taking a more heavy-handed approach to the 2020 protests over George Floyd’s murder by police. So when demonstrations against his immigration crackdown erupted last week in Los Angeles, he turned to the playbook he wished he had used then – federalizing the national guard and deploying hundreds of US marines to confront what Democratic officials insist was a manageable situation, escalated by a president who the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has warned is increasingly behaving like a “dictator”. The move is seen as a test case for exerting federal authority over local governments that resist the president's agenda.</p>
