          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) social media account issued a strong condemnation against the production and sale of building block sets depicting Japan's infamous Unit 731, a biological warfare unit known for horrific atrocities during World War II. The PLA asserted that these toys, which were subsequently removed from Chinese e-commerce platforms, distort history and deeply offend national sentiment, labeling them as attempts to transform "bloody atrocities into assemblage 'laboratories'". This incident underscores the ongoing historical tensions and China's demand for justice concerning Japanese militarism's crimes against humanity, emphasizing that there is no room for ambiguity on issues of national feeling and historical truth. The PLA's stance highlights a zero-tolerance policy for trivializing such profound historical wounds.</p>

          <p>Fiji is facing one of the world's fastest-growing HIV epidemics, with cases soaring from under 500 in 2014 to approximately 5,900 by 2024, prompting a national crisis declaration. The surge is attributed to intravenous drug use, including "bluetoothing" (sharing blood after injection), chemsex, and a critical shortage of clean needles and syringe programs. Experts highlight a lack of education and the increasing use of crystal meth as contributing factors, with many new cases occurring among young people. The country's health infrastructure is reportedly ill-equipped to handle the escalating number of infections, raising fears of an impending "avalanche" of cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for 14 days. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's justification for deployment was "untethered to the facts" and likely exceeded his constitutional authority, citing the tradition of resisting military intrusion into civil affairs. The judge noted that protests in Portland were not "significantly violent or disruptive" enough to warrant such a measure. This legal challenge underscores the delicate balance between federal and state power, and the role of the courts in upholding constitutional law over perceived martial law.</p>

          <p>Federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shot a woman in Chicago's Brighton Park neighborhood after their vehicles were allegedly rammed and "boxed in by 10 cars." DHS initially stated the incident occurred in Broadview near an ICE facility, a site of ongoing protests. Agents claimed one driver had a semi-automatic weapon, prompting them to open fire, injuring the woman who was later released from the hospital. DHS also alleged the woman was named in an intelligence bulletin for doxxing agents and posting online threats, while Chicago police clarified their limited role in the federal investigation. The incident led to tense clashes between federal agents and protestors, with reports of pepper balls and a military vehicle drawing a gun.</p>

The "We The People Are Rising" event, supported by unions and elected officials, highlighted the fear within migrant communities, which has led to reduced business activity and temporary closures. Speakers criticized the administration's "cruel" tactics and use of fear as a campaign strategy, drawing parallels to past anti-immigrant sentiment. The rally emphasized community resilience and the demand for dignity, respect, and essential services like healthcare for all residents.</p>

          <p>Glaciers across the globe, including Switzerland's Rhône Glacier, are retreating at an alarming rate due to global warming, with Switzerland losing a quarter of its ice in the last decade alone. Scientists report that in 2024, glaciers outside Greenland and Antarctica lost 450 billion tonnes of ice, a volume equivalent to 180 million Olympic swimming pools. While natural cycles play a role, the rapid losses of the past 40 years are unequivocally linked to human-induced CO2 emissions. This irreversible trend, even if global temperatures stabilize, threatens mountain communities reliant on meltwater for essential resources like irrigation and drinking. Limiting global warming to 1.5C could preserve half of the remaining ice.</p>

          <p>Long queues, traditionally seen as an inconvenience, are becoming a desirable social activity, particularly in the UK. People are willingly waiting for hours for exclusive product launches or experiential marketing events, driven by the excitement of anticipation, the chance to meet new people, and the allure of "freebies." Psychologists explain that the anticipation of a reward releases dopamine, creating a pleasurable feeling, while brands capitalize on this by offering unique experiences and limited-edition items. This trend, often amplified by social media content creation, reflects a shift in consumer behavior where the queuing experience itself holds significant value beyond the final purchase.</p>

          <p>WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert is facing renewed scrutiny after past comments about Caitlin Clark's earning potential resurfaced, following her denial of allegedly telling a player Clark "should be grateful" for her off-court income. In an April 2024 interview, Engelbert had stated Clark would "do just fine" with millions in endorsements, distinguishing it from her WNBA base salary. The controversy stems from allegations by Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier, who claimed Engelbert made dismissive remarks about Clark and other players. Engelbert denied the Clark comment but acknowledged if players feel unappreciated, the league must improve, amid ongoing collective bargaining agreement negotiations.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since Bashar al-Assad's overthrow ten months ago, but the process faces significant concerns regarding inclusivity and democratic integrity. The People's Assembly will not be directly elected; instead, "electoral colleges" select two-thirds of representatives, with interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa appointing the remainder. Elections were postponed in three provinces due to security reasons and a stand-off with a Kurdish-led militia. Critics argue the president's influence over the electoral bodies renders the elections largely symbolic, failing to reflect the popular will. The transitional government defends the process by citing difficulties due to the civil war and millions of displaced refugees.</p>

Despite potential fines of up to €500, between 7,000 and 8,000 demonstrators, including European Parliament members, marched with rainbow and EU flags, condemning Orban's government as a "dictatorship."

Pritzker, however, asserted there was no need for military troops, stating state and local law enforcement were coordinating effectively. He accused Trump of creating a "manufactured performance" for control rather than public safety.

          <p>"Freshers' flu," a common cold-like illness, rapidly spreads among new university students due to a "mixing pot" of respiratory viruses from diverse backgrounds. Immunologists explain that late nights, poor diet, stress, and alcohol consumption during freshers' week significantly weaken the immune system, making students more susceptible. The stress of adapting to a new environment triggers cortisol release, suppressing immune responses, while lack of sleep further compromises defenses. Despite the widespread nature of the illness, experts advise students to prioritize rest and seek medical help if symptoms persist or worsen, emphasizing the importance of recovery for overall well-being during this transitional period.</p>

          <p>A recent explosion and fire at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery, which injured at least one worker and rattled local communities, underscores the facility's extensive history of safety and environmental violations. Environmental advocates lament the federal government shutdown's impact, as agencies like OSHA and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Mitigation Board are furloughed, potentially hindering a thorough investigation into the incident's root causes. This lack of federal oversight raises fears among labor unions about worker safety at other refineries and frustrates environmentalists who advocate for accountability and a transition away from fossil fuels. The article highlights the systemic issues and the risks associated with aging industrial infrastructure.</p>

          <p>An FBI agent has reportedly been suspended for insubordination after refusing to participate in a "perp walk" of former FBI Director James Comey, deeming the plan inappropriate. Comey was indicted on two federal charges shortly after President Trump publicly called for investigations into political adversaries. Reports suggest FBI leadership discussed sending "large, beefy" agents in Kevlar vests to escort Comey to his arraignment, a practice common in high-profile cases. Comey, who denies the charges of lying to Congress and obstructing proceedings, has been a frequent target of Trump's criticism since his 2017 firing. The incident highlights concerns about political influence on law enforcement and the weaponization of legal processes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for announcing the release of hostages from Gaza "in the coming days," stating that Hamas would be disarmed and Gaza demilitarized "either the easy way or the hard way." His comments followed Hamas's conditional agreement to a U.S. peace plan, which did not explicitly mention disarmament. Indirect ceasefire talks are scheduled to begin in Egypt, with U.S. President Donald Trump urging Hamas to "move quickly" or face consequences. Despite cautious optimism, significant obstacles remain, including Hamas's demands for a full Israeli withdrawal and guarantees against renewed conflict. Public sentiment in both Gaza and Israel is a mix of hope and deep suspicion regarding the deal's viability.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown has severely impacted U.S. National Parks, leading to closures, reduced staffing, and reliance on external donations to maintain operations. The lack of a unified plan has created confusion for visitors, as some parks remain accessible with limited services, while others are completely stripped of amenities like trash collection and restrooms. Several states have stepped in to fund their parks, but many visitors have been met with disappointment. Concerns are also rising about safety and potential vandalism, recalling significant damage incurred during previous shutdowns. Advocates are calling for all understaffed parks to close to prevent irreparable harm to these natural treasures.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of extra police officers have been deployed across Manchester to reassure communities following Thursday's deadly synagogue attack, which killed two Jewish men. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officers are working extended shifts, supported by other forces, with Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes affirming sufficient resources. The attack, which occurred during Yom Kippur, involved a car ramming and stabbing outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue. The incident is being treated as a terror attack, and four suspects remain in custody on suspicion of terrorism offenses. Police questioned the appropriateness of a pro-Palestine march occurring simultaneously, highlighting heightened tensions and the need for community safety.</p>

          <p>Two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were killed in a car ramming and stabbing attack outside a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent, was shot dead by armed police. One victim, Adrian Daulby, was fatally hit by police gunfire in a tragic consequence as he helped hold synagogue doors shut. The attack is being treated as a terror incident, with Al-Shamie believed to be influenced by extreme Islamist ideology and having a prior arrest for sexual assault. Worshippers and security staff demonstrated bravery in preventing the attacker from entering the building. Six others were arrested, with four remaining in custody for terrorism offenses.</p>

          <p>Premier League champions Liverpool, under new coach Arne Slot, have dramatically fallen from the top of the table, losing three consecutive games, including two to late goals. After early-season wins often secured by last-gasp strikes, the team's "high-wire act" proved unsustainable, with Chelsea and Crystal Palace both scoring winners in injury time. Pundits suggest Liverpool looks unbalanced due to significant new signings and a shift in midfield dynamics, leaving them vulnerable to counter-attacks. Despite Slot's defiant stance, the team's performance has been largely flat, and the international break is seen as a crucial opportunity for the squad to regroup and address their recent struggles.</p>

The Tories aim to remove 150,000 people annually, including illegal residents and foreign nationals with serious criminal convictions, a five-fold increase from current figures.
