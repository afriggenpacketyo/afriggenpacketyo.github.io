          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong addressed the deepening US-China rivalry at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, emphasizing Asean's capacity to shape its own future. Wong stated that the region aims to be an inclusive arena, encouraging active engagement from both the US and China, while rejecting zero-sum competition. He highlighted the region's economic significance and its desire to avoid a recurrence of proxy wars reminiscent of the Cold War era. Asean seeks shared prosperity through cooperation among major powers, as it balances its relationships with the US as its largest investor and China as its largest trading partner.</p>

          <p>The British pound is currently trading at its highest level in over three years, prompting debate among analysts regarding its potential for further gains. While the pound has surged against the US dollar, it has depreciated against the euro year-to-date. Analysts attribute the pound's strength primarily to underlying dollar weakness, influenced by factors such as unpredictable US trade policies and concerns about de-dollarization. However, some believe the pound is recovering from the aftermath of the previous Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget, while others remain bearish due to softer UK economic momentum and the potential for the Bank of England to cut rates.

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Iran is tentatively holding, leading to cautious optimism in Israel and the reopening of Ben Gurion International Airport. Both countries have claimed victory, with conflicting reports emerging about the extent of damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear program. While President Trump stated the program was set back decades, initial intelligence assessments suggest only a few months delay. Iran has threatened to accelerate its enrichment work without IAEA oversight, prompting its parliament to consider halting cooperation with the agency, leaving some Israelis uncertain about the future, but the diplomacy could help revive talks to end the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates are stuck in a narrow range around 7%, showing little movement despite economic uncertainty and international conflicts. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes have slightly decreased, remaining historically low due to inflated house prices and limited supply. Refinance applications have increased, but overall volumes are still low, leading to significant percentage changes from small shifts. The article points to the average loan size for purchase applications declining to the lowest level since January 2025, which is driven by decreasing conventional purchase loan sizes.</p>

          <p>An ongoing debate questions whether NATO expansion drove Russia to war in Ukraine, with Russia claiming NATO expansion into Eastern Europe threatened its interests. While NATO insists it is a defensive alliance, Putin views its expansion as a breach of trust following the Two Plus Four Agreement. Some argue that Western powers promised NATO would not expand eastward, while others claim these were merely suggestions during German reunification negotiations. Despite conflicting interpretations, Russia's invasion of Ukraine remains an incontrovertible act of aggression, regardless of NATO's past assurances.</p>

The case concerned â‚¬400 million in loans provided by the state development bank KfW, which were approved by the European Commission in July 2021. Ryanair challenged that approval, but the court said the Commission acted lawfully, finding no evidence that the aid discriminated against other airlines or violated freedom of establishment or the free provision of services.

          <p>Republican lawmakers are on the verge of passing massive Medicaid cuts as part of a budget bill that could lead to millions of Americans losing health insurance benefits. The proposed legislation would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled in the program by 2034. Analysis suggests these coverage losses could lead to fewer Americans reporting good health, fewer preventive screenings, and thousands of additional annual deaths. Even short of the worst-case scenario, Americans' health would be negatively impacted, with fewer people having a personal doctor and reduced access to essential health services.</p>

          <h2>Thailand Reverses Course, Moves to Criminalize Recreational Cannabis Again</h2>

          <p>Thailand is set to reclassify cannabis as a narcotic, reversing its 2022 decision to decriminalize recreational use, a move that could collapse a $1 billion industry. The decision comes after a government coalition split and concerns about the unregulated market causing social issues, especially among young people. The health ministry has issued an order banning recreational cannabis sales and requiring a doctor's prescription for legal purchases. The Thai Chamber of Commerce had estimated the industry could have been worth $1.2 billion by 2025.</p>

The war has sparked a factional battle within the Iranian political elite, with some seeking normalization with the West and others committed to rejectionism.

          <p>California residents, particularly Latinos, are experiencing heightened fear due to recent immigration raids in Southern California. Concerns about racial profiling have increased, with reports of people being targeted based on skin color. Latino parents are warning their U.S. citizen children to be cautious, and even light-skinned Latinos have expressed concerns. Studies show that skin color has long affected the lives of Latinos, and the recent immigration sweeps have added another layer of fear.</p>
