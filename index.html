          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 00:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Local officials in China are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent, locally-imposed austerity measures that often exceed national regulations. This behavioral shift is driven by a fear of violating the ever-shifting and ambiguous rules associated with the country's anti-corruption and austerity campaigns. An official from Sichuan province described this phenomenon as "ceng ceng jia ma," or adding extra layers of control, which creates a climate of caution where forgoing public meals is seen as the safest option to avoid scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A massive spending bill championed by President Donald Trump has cleared a critical procedural vote in the U.S. Senate following a dramatic session with last-minute vote changes. The measure advanced 51-49 after several Republican holdouts reversed their opposition, narrowly avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The bill now faces further debate, including a Democrat-forced full reading of the 940-page text, before a final vote on its passage can occur.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted to begin debate on a massive spending package after a tense, prolonged vote, though its final passage remains uncertain. The procedural motion succeeded only after a last-minute vote change by a Republican senator. In a separate development, a federal judge permanently blocked a Trump Administration executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, ruling the effort to punish firms representing the president's political enemies was blatantly unconstitutional and a threat to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The Leadmill, an iconic music venue in Sheffield, England, has held its final event after a 45-year history of hosting legendary bands like Pulp and the Arctic Monkeys. The closure follows a long but unsuccessful battle with its landlords, who acquired the building in 2017 and plan to continue operating it as a music venue under a different name. Fans and musicians, including local artist Richard Hawley, have expressed deep sorrow, mourning the loss of a cultural institution they considered the city's equivalent to The Cavern Club.</p>

The verdict concludes a six-year legal process for Bernstein's family, who endured numerous delays before seeing justice for the murder of their 19-year-old son, a University of Pennsylvania student.</p>

Under the plan, retailers will voluntarily implement strategies such as offering promotions on healthy food or redesigning store layouts to help tackle rising obesity rates.

          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island effect," the phenomenon causing cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Dark surfaces like asphalt and buildings absorb and radiate the sun's heat, while a lack of vegetation and water reduces natural cooling through evaporation. This effect, which can raise city temperatures by several degrees, intensifies the health risks of heatwaves for the growing urban population.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program is being trialed in primary schools across Kent, England, to teach children as young as five about sun safety. The lessons, which cover topics like reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, are designed to combat rising rates of melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. Backed by the Melanoma Fund charity, the initiative aims to instill preventative habits early in life and is planned for a nationwide rollout into the school curriculum by 2026.</p>

          <p>This article features an interview with Bain, a member of the K-pop group Just B, who publicly came out as gay during a concert in Los Angeles. This was a notably bold move within the traditionally conservative South Korean entertainment industry, where such personal disclosures are rare. Bain discusses the personal burden of hiding his sexuality, the supportive reaction from his team, and his hope that being open will provide encouragement and a sense of solidarity for his fans and others in the LGBTQ community.</p>
