          <p>Shares of Circle, a cryptocurrency firm, have experienced a significant rally after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The stock jumped nearly 13% following the bill's approval, adding to a 33% increase from the previous day. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to their potential for faster and cheaper payments. Major companies like Amazon and Walmart are reportedly exploring the use of stablecoins, and the passing of the GENIUS Act is expected to boost investor confidence in the crypto market. The House of Representatives is also working on similar legislation.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament has passed a bill allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to end their lives, by a vote of 314 to 291. The bill, now headed to the House of Lords, sparked emotional debate with MPs sharing personal stories. Proponents argue it offers a safe, effective reform while opponents fear it endangers vulnerable individuals. The bill includes amendments addressing concerns about mental health and palliative care, but disabled activists argue it is ableist and devalues their lives, while others shared stories of loved ones who suffered immensely without such options. The bill will go to the House of Lords for further review. The bill will now be reviewed by the House of Lords, and its future impact remains to be seen.</p>

The defense argued that O'Keefe was beaten inside a home and his body was later dumped outside, while prosecutors claimed Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV.

          <p>Dean Mears has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 27 years for the murder of Catherine Flynn, a 69-year-old grandmother. Mears broke into Flynn's home, and the attack was partially captured by a ring doorbell camera, which alerted Flynn's daughter, Natasha Flynn-Farrell. Natasha watched helplessly as Mears dragged her mother from bed and stamped on her, causing fatal injuries. The judge described the attack as savage and merciless, and Natasha delivered a powerful statement to Mears in court.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces reportedly killed 23 Palestinians and injured over 100 others after opening fire on crowds gathered near an aid distribution site in Gaza. Witnesses stated that tanks and drones fired at thousands of people near a distribution center run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots before striking suspects approaching troops, and the UN has criticized the aid distribution system.

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant decline in May, with sales volumes dropping by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly fall since December 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics. The decline was primarily attributed to a poor performance by food retailers, particularly supermarkets, with reduced sales of alcohol and tobacco. Separate figures revealed that government borrowing reached the second-highest level for May since 1993. The weak retail sales data adds to concerns about the UK economy's growth momentum.</p>

          <h2>Expert Doubts Effectiveness of Bombing Iran's Underground Nuclear Plant</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 07:40:12 EDT</div>

          <p>A national security expert suggests that bombing Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant might not be effective, even with the use of the U.S. military's Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs. The exact depth and protective measures of the facility are not fully known, and the bombs have never been tested in real-world conditions. The expert notes that even if the facility is damaged, Iran has the knowledge, experience, and materials to rebuild. The continued military strikes are not a good option for Israel or the U.S. in achieving a nuclear-free Iran.</p>
