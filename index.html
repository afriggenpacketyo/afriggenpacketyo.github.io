          <h2>Abandoned Queens Railway Offers a Glimpse into Nature's Reclamation</h2>

          <p>An abandoned Long Island Rail Road branch in Queens, unused since 1962, has transformed into a unique urban wilderness. Nature has overtaken the tracks, with forests growing, signal towers falling, and even coyotes colonizing the area. In Rego Park, a red maple tree has grown around a section of track, showcasing the power of nature to reclaim man-made structures, creating a strangely beautiful landscape that captures the imagination of photographers and urban explorers alike. Optimism about nature's resilience is middling, as the article focuses on a localized abandoned area, but it is a positive image nonetheless.</p>

          <p>Judge Hannah Dugan of Milwaukee County was arrested by the FBI for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest by ICE agents. The complaint states that Judge Dugan escorted Eduardo Flores Ruiz and his counsel out of the courtroom through a jury door after being informed of the administrative warrant. Flores Ruiz was later apprehended, and Judge Dugan was released on her own recognizance after appearing in court on charges that could lead to a six-year prison sentence. Her attorney maintains that the arrest was not in the interest of public safety.</p>

          <p>China's Foreign Ministry has strongly refuted claims by President Trump and his administration that trade talks are underway between the two countries. Through posts on X, the ministry stated that no consultations or negotiations are taking place and accused the U.S. of misleading the public. This firm stance indicates that China intends to remain resolute in its trade war standoff with the U.S., believing it can withstand the economic pressures better than the Trump administration due to political and financial vulnerabilities in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with the highest number of cases recorded in a single year since 2019, primarily driven by an outbreak in West Texas resulting in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Nationwide, cases have reached 884 across at least 29 states, with health officials attributing the rise to declining vaccination rates. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has voiced support for vaccination amid the deadly outbreak, encouraging people to get the measles vaccine but opposing government mandates.</p>

The Kremlin remains confident in maintaining a productive dialogue with Trump, hoping for energy deals, direct flights, and the lifting of sanctions. This brinkmanship tests Trump's patience, who has threatened to withdraw from negotiations while Putin continues attacks, creating a tense dynamic in US-Russia relations.</p>

The WFP delivered its last remaining food stocks to hot meal kitchens, which are expected to run out of food soon, exacerbating malnutrition among vulnerable populations. The UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza, while Israel claims it is complying with international law and there is no aid shortage.

          <p>The National Weather Service warns of an increased risk for rapid fire spread across portions of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania due to low humidity, warm temperatures, and gusty winds. The Jones Road wildfire in southern Ocean County has scorched approximately 15,250 acres and is halfway contained, with prosecutors charging a 19-year-old for failing to fully extinguish a bonfire that led to the blaze.

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has experienced its largest drop since 1990, falling by 32% since January, largely due to ongoing uncertainty around trade policy and potential inflation. Consumer expectations of inflation have skyrocketed, reaching the highest level since 1981, while income growth expectations have slowed. This decline in consumer sentiment suggests that Americans are becoming more hesitant to spend, potentially leading to an economic slowdown despite President Trump's insistence that tariffs will not raise prices.</p>

          <p>Online scammers are increasingly using "wrong number" text messages, aided by AI, to trick phone users into providing personal information and financial account access. These seemingly innocuous texts validate active numbers and build relationships, often leading to "pig butchering scams" that target life savings and retirement accounts. Consumers lost $470 million to scams starting with text messages in 2024, with AI making these scams more efficient by tailoring texts and combing through social media profiles. Psychologists note that loneliness and trauma can make individuals more susceptible to these scams, highlighting the need for caution and avoidance of engagement.</p>

          <p>Laurence Fox, an actor-turned-politician, has pleaded not guilty to two counts under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 for allegedly sharing an 'upskirting' image of broadcaster Narinder Kaur on X. The charges stem from an incident in April 2024, with Fox released on bail under the condition that he does not contact Kaur. Upskirting, which involves taking pictures under someone's clothes without permission, became a specific criminal offense in 2019.</p>

          <p>Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's recent remarks, including making light of reducing food for Palestinian inmates and expressing support for President Trump's plan to clear out Gaza, have drawn criticism. Ben-Gvir's controversial views and past support for Jewish terrorists have made him a divisive figure, with concerns raised about his influence on Israeli policy. During a visit to Yale, Ben-Gvir defended his actions and rejected comparisons between starving Jews after the Holocaust and starving Palestinians, failing to express remorse for his past support of violence.</p>
