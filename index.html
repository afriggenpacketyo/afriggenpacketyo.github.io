          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto of the Los Angeles Dodgers had a tough outing, allowing five runs in five innings, leading to a 5-3 defeat against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Gabriel Moreno's grand slam in the fourth inning and Ketel Marte's solo home run in the fifth contributed to Yamamoto's struggles. Despite Shohei Ohtani hitting his 11th home run of the season in the ninth, it wasn't enough to spark a comeback for the Dodgers, who face increased competition within their division. This article describes Yamamoto's worst performance of the season, impacting the Dodgers' standing in a competitive National League West.</p>

          <p>Chinese government data reveals that exports from China jumped last month, fueled by trade to Southeast Asian countries, even as President Trumpâ€™s tariffs on Chinese goods forced a sharp slowdown in shipments to the United States.

The trade numbers released on Friday capture activity in April, when tensions between the United States and China escalated more rapidly than expected. As a result, Chinese shipments to the United States plunged by 21 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. But Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21 percent.</p>

          <h2>The Aluminum Sector Isn't Moving to the U.S. Despite Tariffs Due to High Electricity Costs</h2>

          <p>Sweeping tariffs on imported aluminum imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump are succeeding in reshaping global trade flows and inflating costs for American consumers, but are falling short of their primary goal: to revive domestic aluminum production. Instead, rising costs, particularly skyrocketing electricity prices in the U.S. relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. The article states the aluminum sector is not moving to the U.S. despite tariffs due to one key reason.</p>

          <p>Household brands including Pandora, Puma and Hugo Boss all said this week that they are evaluating their pricing strategies in the U.S. and beyond in the event that President Donald Trump's most punitive levies come into effect. Some others, meanwhile, said that they are altering their supply chains and potentially revising their sales forecasts amid U.S. trade policy uncertainty. Trump last month announced sweeping so-called reciprocal import duties on all U.S. trading partners. The charges were later paused for 90 days and reduced to 10% for most countries except China, pending trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, following criticism from a conservative group. The group accused her of promoting "radical" content and material authored by Trump opponents. Democrats condemned the firing, calling Hayden a trailblazer and a dedicated public servant. The move is part of a broader trend of Trump removing officials perceived as opposing his agenda.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of reducing U.S. tariffs on goods from China as top trade officials prepare for talks. The meeting is seen as a sign of potential de-escalation in the trade war. China also expressed confidence in managing trade issues with the U.S. However, analysts caution that any tariff cuts are likely to be minor and that systemic frictions between the two countries remain.</p>
