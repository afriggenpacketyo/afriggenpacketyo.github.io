          <p>A massive class-action lawsuit has commenced in the UK High Court against Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, Renault, and Nissan over the "dieselgate" scandal. The companies are accused of using illegal "defeat devices" to cheat on emissions tests, potentially affecting 1.6 million car owners who were allegedly misled about their vehicles' environmental impact. All five carmakers deny the accusations, arguing their systems were technically and legally justifiable. A judgment in this landmark case, which could lead to significant compensation claims, is not anticipated until the summer of 2026.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is considering providing Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to aid its conflict against Russia. This potential move follows requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for stronger military capabilities and has drawn sharp warnings from Moscow about a major escalation. Tomahawk missiles have a range that could put Moscow within Ukraine's reach, a prospect the Kremlin has called a matter of "extreme concern." Trump suggested he might use the possibility as leverage, stating he could tell Russia that if the war is not settled, the U.S. may supply the weapons.</p>

          <p>A church accountability advocate is calling for former priest Mark Francis Ford to be added to clergy-abuser lists after his arrest for the alleged sexual assault of a disabled child in New Orleans. The alleged abuse occurred while Ford was involved with a program for disabled youths he helped create. Ford, who was removed from the priesthood in 2007, has a history of unexplained disappearances from official Catholic directories, raising further questions about his past conduct. The case highlights ongoing efforts to ensure transparency and accountability within the Catholic church regarding clergy abuse.</p>

          <p>The concept of the Antichrist is resurfacing in American public life, from tech billionaire Peter Thiel's lectures on the topic to a violent attack on a church by a man who believed its members were the Antichrist. This article explores the historical use of this apocalyptic symbol in U.S. politics, noting its tendency to surge during times of social disruption and perceived threats. The author warns that framing contemporary policy debates, such as AI regulation, in apocalyptic terms delegitimizes compromise and can foster extremism. The piece contrasts the theoretical discussion of the Antichrist with its real-world manifestation in deadly violence.</p>

          <h2>Political Scientist Warns of Escalating Political Violence in the United States</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political scientist Barbara Walter argues that the current wave of political violence in the U.S. is more dangerous than in the past due to three key factors. First, political leaders are weaponizing tragedies for political gain rather than promoting unity. Second, violence is becoming reciprocal, with attacks from both the far-right and far-left creating a self-sustaining cycle of conflict. Finally, the leadership of law enforcement and security agencies has become politicized, undermining their ability to act as impartial guardians of stability. Walter places the U.S. in a high-risk zone for sustained, low-level insurgency rather than a conventional civil war.</p>

          <p>The attempted suspension of Jimmy Kimmel by ABC's parent company, Disney, inadvertently proved the continued relevance of late-night television. The move, which followed pressure related to Kimmel's satirical comments about Trump supporters, sparked a massive public outcry from artists, celebrities, and viewers, forcing Disney to reverse its decision. This event energized the late-night community, with hosts like Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers showing solidarity. The article argues that this pushback served as a crucial lesson for media companies and revitalized a genre that has been struggling to maintain its cultural foothold against modern digital media.</p>

          <p>England and Aston Villa forward Ollie Watkins has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Latvia due to an injury. The striker sustained the injury during the first half of England's 3-0 victory over Wales, where he scored the team's second goal before colliding with a goalpost. While manager Thomas Tuchel initially stated Watkins was "OK," the injury was deemed too painful for him to participate in the next match. His absence may provide an opportunity for winger Anthony Gordon to play in a central role, as England aims to secure World Cup qualification with a win in Riga.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has urged UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid "half-baked fixes" and instead implement comprehensive tax reforms in the upcoming Budget.

The IFS specifically criticized stamp duty and outdated council tax valuations, arguing that systemic changes could create a better system overall.

Opponents, including some religious and family-values groups, contend that sex work is inherently exploitative and degrading.

          <p>In an interview on Marc Maron's podcast, former President Barack Obama described the Trump administration's policies as a "test" for the nation's core principles. He argued that current events are shaking Americans out of their complacency and forcing institutions and individuals to decide whether they will stand up for democratic norms. Obama also offered a critique of some liberal messaging, cautioning against a "holier than thou" approach that can alienate potential allies. He emphasized the need for Democrats to hold firm to their convictions while acknowledging that life is messy and respecting differing viewpoints.</p>

          <h2>Major Oil Companies Face Pressure to Cut Shareholder Payouts as Profits Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 03:47:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of record profits, major oil companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, and BP are now facing a weaker crude price environment, forcing them to cut costs and reconsider generous shareholder payouts. Having returned up to 50% of their cash flow to investors through dividends and buybacks, these companies are now under pressure to avoid taking on new debt. While some, like BP and TotalEnergies, have already begun reducing share buybacks, analysts believe the industry will prioritize protecting dividends. This shift marks a significant change from 2022, when soaring prices led to what were described as "monster profits." (not investment advice)</p>
