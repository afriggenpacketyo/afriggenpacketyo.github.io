          <p>The perpetually grumpy German children's TV character, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread), has achieved viral fame in the US after being featured on John Oliver's "Last Week Tonight." For 25 years, this world-weary loaf has been a cult figure in Germany, embodying a humorless German stereotype. Fans appreciate his stoic humor and constant listlessness, which contrasts with typical cheerful children's programming. His recent appearance with Oliver, where he quipped, "My life is hell," resonated with US audiences, garnering thousands of new fans.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have reached an all-time high of $3,800 per ounce, prompting investors who bought at lower prices to consider selling for profit. Experts recommend evaluating the timing, reviewing investment types (physical gold, ETFs, stocks), and comparing selling options, including local dealers or buyback programs. It is crucial to research current prices and understand potential tax implications, such as capital gains. While selling can lock in profits, some analysts suggest gold may still have room to appreciate, making continued holding an option for portfolio diversification and market turbulence hedging.

          <p>A Chinese military magazine, Ordnance Industry Science Technology, has revealed details about the new Liaoyuan-1 (LY-1) shipborne laser weapon, asserting its capabilities surpass American counterparts. Unveiled at a recent Beijing military parade, the LY-1 is designed for close-range interception of missiles and drones, serving as a shipborne air-defense system's final defense line. The article claims the LY-1 features a considerably more robust structure and a lens aperture nearly twice the diameter of the US Helios laser weapon, alongside more advanced auxiliary equipment and sensors.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, resulted in four deaths and eight injuries during a Sunday service. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove a vehicle into the building, opened fire with an assault-style rifle, and set the church ablaze using an accelerant before being fatally shot by police. Authorities are investigating the incident as an "act of targeted violence," with the FBI leading the inquiry to determine the motive. Churchgoers were praised for their heroism in sheltering children during the attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack stated that the U.S. central bank faces a "challenging time" balancing inflation control and job protection. She remains worried about inflation, particularly in services, noting it has been above the 2% target for over four and a half years. Hammack suggests the Fed needs to maintain a restrictive policy stance to bring inflation down, not expecting it to reach 2% until late 2027 or early 2028. Her comments follow a recent rate cut and stronger-than-expected economic data, which have tempered market expectations for rapid monetary easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing for a "clean continuing resolution" to prevent a government shutdown, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stating there's "nothing to negotiate" with Democrats. President Trump also announced a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, citing job loss in the US. Additionally, Trump is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss efforts to broker a deal to end the war in the Gaza Strip. Later, he will host bipartisan congressional leadership to address the looming government funding deadline.</p>

          <p>As the US government faces another potential shutdown, this article reviews the 14 instances of federal funding lapses since 1980. Historically, agencies continued operating until 1980, when legal opinions mandated shutdowns during funding gaps. President Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns, mostly brief, while President Clinton's disputes with Republicans led to longer closures in 1995. More recently, shutdowns under Presidents Obama and Trump, often over healthcare or border wall funding, caused billions in losses. The current standoff involves President Trump and Democrats disagreeing on healthcare tax credits, with the White House threatening mass layoffs.</p>

Reaching out to lenders for hardship assistance, such as payment deferrals or zero-interest loans from credit unions, is also recommended. Workers should research unemployment benefits and health coverage options, as the administration's "reduction in force" plan marks uncharted territory compared to traditional furloughs.

The lawsuit contends the deployment is a political move rather than a public safety necessity, despite White House claims of protecting federal assets from "violent riots."

          <p>A stress physiologist, Dr. Rebecca Heiss, argues that conventional stress management advice often misses a crucial element: channeling stress energy outward to help others. Her research, spanning two decades, suggests that 58% of people stress more when trying to control it internally. Instead, "stress springboarding" involves using stress as fuel for meaningful actions that benefit others, such as assisting a struggling colleague or volunteering for a cause. Brain imaging indicates that helping others activates reward centers and reduces activity in stress-related regions, effectively rewiring the brain for more effective stress handling.</p>

          <p>Maya Rogers, CEO of Tetris, shares that not all career advice is worth following, highlighting the importance of trusting one's own instincts. She recounts a pivotal decision to pursue a crossover project with the Japanese game Puyo Puyo, despite an advisor's caution about diluting the Tetris brand. This risk led to a successful series, expanding Tetris's audience and strengthening its presence in Japan. Rogers, who also co-founded Blue Startups to support Hawaii-based and women-led businesses, advocates for thoughtful risks as crucial for innovation and growth, particularly for women entrepreneurs who face funding disparities.</p>

          <p>Dan Porter, CEO of Overtime, identifies certain interview questions as red flags, such as inquiries about dental plans or easily researchable company history, indicating a lack of preparation. Career expert Suzy Welch agrees that benefit questions are better reserved for after a job offer, not for the CEO. Instead, candidates should ask specific, pointed questions about company culture, collaboration, or what kind of person would not thrive there, to elicit more insightful answers. Porter prioritizes character and intelligence, particularly the ability to think critically about the world, over a lengthy resume when hiring.</p>

          <p>JK Rowling has issued a strong rebuke to Emma Watson, dismissing the Harry Potter actress as "ignorant" regarding the trans rights debate. Rowling stated her feelings towards her "former friend" soured after Watson "publicly poured petrol on the flames" during the peak of threats against the author. Rowling criticized Watson for her perceived lack of "real life" experience, arguing that Watson's privileged background prevents her from understanding the impact of eroding women's rights on less privileged women.

The ongoing humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by recent funding cuts, necessitates a permanent solution beyond aid. Rakhine state is crucial for China's Belt and Road Initiative, with projects like the Kyaukphyu deep-sea port requiring regional stability. Therefore, Rohingya repatriation is presented as both a humanitarian and economic imperative, aligning with China's strategic development goals and the refugees' desire to return home.</p>
