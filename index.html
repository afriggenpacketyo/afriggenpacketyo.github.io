          <p>Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) is set to vote on a 144-page coalition agreement with the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), giving its 358,000 members until 11:59 p.m. (2159 GMT) to cast their votes.

          <p>Japan and the Philippines are expected to initiate discussions on key security pacts, including an intelligence-sharing agreement and a bilateral acquisition and cross-servicing agreement, to bolster their security cooperation amid concerns over China's maritime activities. During a summit in Manila, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will also discuss joint coast guard drills and the global economy in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs. This move reflects a shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific and a response to China's assertive actions in the South and East China Seas. The strengthened alliance aims to address common security challenges and promote regional stability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has faced a barrage of approximately 220 lawsuits in its first 100 days, challenging various executive orders, firings, and other actions. Federal judges have blocked key parts of Trump's agenda, including immigration policies, military guidelines, and diversity initiatives. Lawyers challenging the administration have alleged multiple violations of court orders, leading to rebukes from judges for acting in "bad faith." The constant conflict between the administration and the judiciary raises concerns about potential damage to the separation of powers and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched 100 attack drones across Ukraine overnight, resulting in casualties, hours after President Vladimir V. Putin ordered a unilateral three-day cease-fire starting on May 8. Ukrainian authorities reported that a child was killed and several people were wounded in the attacks. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine dismissed the cease-fire announcement as a manipulative tactic, calling for an immediate, full, and unconditional 30-day cease-fire. The Kremlin brushed off Zelensky's suggestion, stating that details matter for a lengthy cease-fire. The attacks occurred shortly after President Trump expressed frustration with Russia's continued bombardment of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that the White House may propose nearly a 50% cut to NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, which would have disastrous consequences, potentially closing the Goddard Space Flight Center and canceling missions to Mars and Venus. These cuts would halt various projects, including those crucial for understanding the sun’s effects on global communications, a potential national security threat. Critics warn that this would undermine American leadership in space and shift talent to other countries, while also wasting billions already invested in space science. Despite these proposed cuts, bipartisan support for NASA in Congress remains strong.</p>

Head Start serves 800,000 low-income families across the country, providing child care, health screenings, and meals. The lawsuit argues that the administration's actions violate the free speech of teachers and fail to provide clear guidance for providers to avoid losing federal funding.</p>

This discrepancy has raised questions regarding Calderon's sponsorship of legislation favored by Edison that would reduce credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels.

          <p>Bernie Sanders has reintroduced Medicare for All in the Senate, advocating for comprehensive healthcare coverage to all Americans without out-of-pocket expenses. He argues that the current US healthcare system is outrageously expensive and cruel, leaving millions uninsured or underinsured. Sanders contends that Medicare for All would be less expensive than the current system by eliminating bureaucracy and profiteering, and would provide freedom to switch jobs without losing health insurance. He criticizes Republican efforts to decimate Medicaid and calls for a transformative moment in American healthcare.</p>

          <p>Thousands of California inmates wrongly tested positive for opiate use due to a laboratory mistake, raising concerns that parole decisions could be tainted. Approximately 6,000 drug tests are believed to have generated false positive results in 2024, potentially affecting parole hearings. Attorneys at UnCommon Law are advocating for the state to address the issue, as the incorrect test results may have unfairly swayed parole decisions. The false positives occurred due to a temporary change in the reagent used in urine drug tests, and while the tests are meant for clinical use, they are included in inmates' parole hearing records.</p>

          <p>The American “pronatalist” movement, including figures in the Trump administration, is advocating for policies to incentivize procreation, particularly among traditional families. One proposal involves public education programs about the menstrual cycle to help girls and women understand when they are able to conceive. This initiative raises concerns about framing menstrual literacy as a means to increase pregnancy rates rather than empowering women to make informed decisions about their bodies. The article argues that menstrual literacy is essential, especially with restricted abortion access, and advocates for better, healthier, and more accurate information.</p>

          <p>The Republican Party is considering reducing the federal match for Medicaid expansion to each state’s level for traditional Medicaid, a move that could jeopardize healthcare coverage for as many as 21 million Americans. This proposal, aimed at dismantling the Medicaid expansion passed as part of the Affordable Care Act, would significantly reduce federal funding to states, potentially forcing them to cut back on their Medicaid programs. Critics warn that this change would disproportionately affect low-income individuals and families, while benefiting the wealthy through federal income tax savings.

Despite Conservative gains, the Liberals' victory highlights divisions in the country, with limited support in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The election also saw a collapse of the left-wing New Democrats, as voters coalesced around the two major parties.</p>
