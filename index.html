Kennedy Jr., announced the termination of approximately $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. Kennedy stated that HHS has determined the technology poses more risks than benefits for certain respiratory viruses, citing concerns about its effectiveness against mutations. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from public health experts and a former surgeon general, who argue the move is dangerous, will cost lives, and undermines a technology credited with saving millions and holding potential for treating other diseases.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced that Apple has committed to increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over four years, bringing its total domestic pledge to $600 billion. The move is widely seen as an effort by the tech giant to avoid potential tariffs on its products, which rely on a complex international supply chain. The investment aims to reshore the production of critical components, with Apple also planning to directly hire 20,000 U.S. workers during this period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook described the recent U.S. jobs report as "concerning," suggesting its significant downward revisions could indicate a turning point in the economy. The July report showed weaker-than-expected job growth, and data for May and June was revised down by a combined 258,000 jobs, a pattern Cook noted is typical of economic inflection points. She also highlighted an "uncertainty tax" on businesses due to macroeconomic instability, which she believes will translate to lower GDP activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, citing the country's continued purchase of oil from Russia. This new levy, set to take effect in 21 days, brings the total duties on Indian products to 50%. The action is part of the administration's strategy to pressure countries doing business with Russia to compel a ceasefire in Ukraine. The U.S. trade deficit with India was $45.8 billion last year, an increase over 2023.</p>

          <p>An active-duty sergeant allegedly opened fire on his colleagues at Fort Stewart, Georgia, wounding five soldiers before being taken into custody. The suspect, identified as 28-year-old Quornelius Radford, used his personal weapon in the attack. All five victims are in stable condition and expected to recover, with officials crediting other soldiers who immediately tackled the gunman with preventing further casualties. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation, but authorities do not believe it is related to terrorism.</p>

Trump alleged the BLS released "phony" strong numbers before the 2024 election and revised them down afterward, but a major downward revision of 818,000 jobs was actually announced in August 2024, two months before the election. Furthermore, the final pre-election report in November showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which Trump himself used at the time to criticize his opponent.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could deliver a multibillion-dollar blow to India's economy, though the overall impact may be moderated. While only a fraction of India's GDP is tied to U.S. exports, specific sectors like gems, jewelry, apparel, and textiles are highly vulnerable. Analysts note that key exports such as IT services and pharmaceuticals are not targeted by the current duties, which may insulate Indian equities from the most severe effects of the trade dispute.

          <p>This article examines how China is using its control over the global supply of rare earths as a strategic countermeasure in its technological and economic rivalry with the United States. As the U.S. has imposed export bans on advanced technology like AI chips to slow Chinese progress, Beijing has retaliated with export controls on critical rare earth elements. These minerals are essential for a vast range of technologies, from consumer electronics to advanced defense systems, giving China significant leverage.</p>

          <p>A report alleges that Vice President JD Vance's team requested the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to alter the water level of Ohio's Little Miami River to accommodate a family boating trip. The Army Corps confirmed it received a request from the Secret Service to increase the outflow from Caesar Creek Lake to "support safe navigation" for the vice president's security detail. The incident raises ethical questions about the use of public resources for personal recreation, particularly as the administration has implemented widespread budget cuts.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's constant claims of a "rigged" system are a form of projection, as he himself actively works to rig outcomes in his favor. The author cites several examples, including his firing of the BLS commissioner over unfavorable jobs numbers and his open pressure on Republican-led states to re-gerrymander congressional maps mid-decade. The column concludes that from elections to economic data, Trump's actions demonstrate a pattern of undermining institutions and constitutional norms to serve his personal and political agenda.</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol is scheduled to make history as the first woman to serve as an umpire in a Major League Baseball regular-season game during a weekend series between the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves.

Her promotion marks a significant milestone for baseball, breaking a gender barrier for on-field officials that has already been crossed in the NBA, NFL, and men's World Cup soccer.</p>

          <p>England all-rounder Chris Woakes has revealed he "never considered not batting" during the final moments of the fifth Test against India, despite suffering a suspected dislocated shoulder. With England needing 17 runs to win, Woakes emerged at number 11 with his arm in a sling, batting left-handed to protect the injury, and managed to run for four crucial runs. Although India ultimately won by a narrow six-run margin, Woakes's courageous effort was widely praised as a testament to his dedication to his team.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the true death toll from the January Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles County may be significantly higher than official counts. A study published in a medical journal estimates there were 440 more deaths than expected in the county during the period of the fires. Researchers argue that official figures, which count direct fire-related fatalities, often miss the broader impact of such disasters, including deaths from poor air quality and disruptions to healthcare services.</p>
