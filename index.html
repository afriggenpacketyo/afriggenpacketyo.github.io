          <p>Former President Donald Trump responded to claims made by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, regarding the potential supply of nuclear warheads to Iran. Trump expressed disbelief and demanded immediate confirmation, cautioning against casual discussions about nuclear weapons. He then touted the superiority of U.S. nuclear submarines, asserting their dominance. This exchange follows U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and highlights ongoing tensions in the region.

          <p>This article discusses the trend of criticizing women online, often under the guise of feminism, for being "male-centered" or not being "girl's girls." The article traces the origins of terms like "pick-me" and "male-centered woman," and examines the underlying concerns about gender, power, and the influence of social media. It notes that such criticisms often focus on individual women rather than structural forces, and that they can be reductive and misguided. The author draws parallels to previous feminist movements and highlights the challenges of navigating complex social issues on platforms like TikTok.</p>

          <p>An expert in international relations analyzes the potential consequences of the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities. While military strikes may seem like a quick solution, they can create long-term problems, including the possibility of Iran rebuilding its program in secret. The expert suggests that the attacks may encourage escalation, ruin the option of future diplomacy, and provoke Iran into developing nuclear weapons. The analysis highlights the risks of Trump's unpredictable foreign policy and its potential to destabilize the region. The optimism score reflects the high potential for escalation.</p>

India were eventually dismissed for 364, setting England 371 to win. England survived six overs on Monday to close on 21-0, setting up a grandstand finish on Tuesday. The pitch is increasingly producing venomous bounce from a length, which could influence England's approach as they never play for a draw under Stokes, making for an intriguing final day.
