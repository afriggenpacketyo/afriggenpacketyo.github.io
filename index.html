          <p>Stocks of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks surged after the companies announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. A new company listed in Sydney will acquire all outstanding shares of both firms, creating an entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger will unwind a 56-year mutual ownership structure designed to fend off hostile takeovers, which critics argued suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency.

Short-haul domestic travel bookings increased by 23% year on year, driven by “summer escapes” with parent-child orders making up 35% of overall bookings. Family hotel packages and activities such as suburban “water fun” and picnics are also in high demand, as Chinese officials look to tourism as a driver of support for the nation’s service sector.</p>

          <p>Mexico became the first nation in the world to hold an election for the judicial system, a move championed by President Claudia Sheinbaum and her predecessor. Supporters believe this is needed to overhaul a judicial system known for corruption and inefficiency, but critics argue it will politicize the judiciary. Voters had to elect around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates. Turnout appeared to be low, with many voters struggling to choose from hundreds of largely unknown candidates.</p>
