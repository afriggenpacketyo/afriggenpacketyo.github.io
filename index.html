          <p>Law enforcement officials are warning that drug dealers are using emojis on social media sites as code names for illicit drugs. An investigation in Lompoc, California, revealed that emojis were used in payment transactions and messages about the products, including cannabis, psilocybin, nicotine, codeine, and alcohol. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has investigated over 80 cases involving drug trafficking on internet apps. Officials are urging parents to review their children's social media accounts for suspicious activity and to discuss the dangers of illegal drug activity.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed reinstating an "asset test" for low-income and disabled Medi-Cal applicants, potentially causing millions to lose eligibility. The proposal aims to address rising costs in the Medi-Cal and In-Home Supportive Services programs. If approved, the "asset test," including the value of a person's primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund, would go into effect Jan. 1, 2026. Health and disability advocates are criticizing the proposal, arguing that it would disproportionately impact vulnerable populations and force people into poverty. (not investment advice)</p>
