          <p>President Trump signed executive orders to soften some automotive tariffs, addressing concerns from automakers about rising production costs. While tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles will remain, the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff burden by preventing additional levies on steel and aluminum from stacking on top of each other. Automakers assembling cars in the U.S. will also be eligible for partial reimbursements on parts-related tariffs for two years. This article explains the administration's intent to provide a transition period for automakers while encouraging domestic manufacturing, but also notes the industry's concerns about the longer-term challenges and potential for higher car prices.</p>
