          <p>Indian officials stated that Pakistan has been moving troops into forward areas, indicating an offensive intent, after claiming Pakistan attacked 26 locations across India. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri asserts that Pakistan's actions are provocative and escalatory, while Indian Army Col. Sofiya Qureshi claims the forward movements of Pakistani troops indicate an offensive intent. Indian Air Force Wing Commander Vyomika Singh refuted Pakistani claims of damage to India's military infrastructure, dismissing them as misinformation. The Indian armed forces have reiterated their commitment to non-escalation, provided Pakistan reciprocates, amid rising tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reports that fighting between India and Pakistan intensified on Saturday, with both sides targeting air bases and military sites, each blaming the other for striking first. Pakistan claimed India targeted its air bases with missiles, retaliating with its own strikes on Indian military locations. India, however, stated it targeted Pakistani military infrastructure in response to drone and airstrikes on 26 locations. Diplomatic efforts are underway by various countries to de-escalate the crisis, which has become the most expansive confrontation between the two nations in half a century, raising fears among the people of India and Pakistan about what might happen next.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, stated that the Trump administration is considering suspending immigrants' right to challenge their detention in court, known as habeas corpus, citing the Constitution's allowance during times of invasion. This move would dramatically escalate the administration's conflict with the courts over deportation efforts. Legal experts, however, argue that only Congress has the power to suspend habeas corpus, a right generally guaranteed in the Constitution. The administration likens its crackdown on illegal immigration to a war or invasion, despite recent court rulings rejecting this argument.</p>

          <p>Rand Laycock, a 70-year-old music conductor with Parkinson's disease, has seen significant improvement in his symptoms through deep brain stimulation (DBS). Diagnosed nearly a decade ago, Laycock's tremors and involuntary movements progressed despite medication. After undergoing DBS therapy, including a brain implant, Laycock transitioned to adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), which fine-tunes stimulation in real-time. As a result, his tremors are now minimal, and his dyskinesia is well-controlled, allowing him to continue his career and enjoy time with his family, while encouraging others with Parkinson's to explore DBS as a treatment option.</p>

          <p>As China and the United States engage in formal trade talks, analysts predict a wide range of outcomes, from a pause in import duties to a complete breakdown with no consensus. Jayant Menon suggests a best-case scenario where China receives a similar pause in duties as other countries, creating a timeline for negotiating prohibitive tariffs. Conversely, the worst-case scenario involves one or both parties walking out, sending markets into turmoil and further damaging trade. Since Trump's return, the US has significantly raised tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures from China.</p>

          <p>This New York Times news analysis details how Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been strategically working to make the world dependent on China's exports and know-how. Since 2020, Xi has directed the central bank to lend trillions to industrial borrowers and introduced economic warfare tactics like export controls to counter foreign actions. This strategy aims to give China leverage in global trade and challenge the supremacy of the United States. While successful in some areas, this approach has also strained relationships with trading partners and may come at a cost to the Chinese economy and households.</p>
