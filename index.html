          <p>This article revisits the unsolved 1991 yogurt shop murders in Austin, Texas, where four teenage girls were brutally killed. Despite decades of investigation, numerous suspects, and even overturned convictions, the case remains open. The article highlights the impact on the victims' families and the investigators, focusing on the enduring pain and frustration caused by the lack of closure. New DNA evidence offers a glimmer of hope, but the case continues to haunt the community, with the original investigator still seeking justice for the families. The article also discusses the Homicide Victims' Families' Rights Act, motivated by this case, which allows families to request federal review of cold cases. The enduring mystery and the search for answers persist after all these years. </p>

          <p>This article explores the theory that two unidentified customers present at the Austin yogurt shop on the night of the 1991 murders may be connected to the crime. Despite extensive investigation and interviews with 52 customers, these two men were never identified, raising suspicion. The article details the descriptions provided by witnesses and the efforts of investigators, including hypnosis, to locate them. The article also discusses the flawed confessions and overturned convictions of previous suspects, leading some involved in the case to believe these mysterious customers are the key to solving the decades-old mystery, with the former lead investigator still wondering about them. The focus shifts to these unknown figures as potential persons of interest.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential for DNA evidence collected from the 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders to finally solve the case. Despite arrests and convictions that were later overturned, a DNA sample from one of the victims did not match any of the original suspects. The article details the advanced DNA testing methods used and the challenges faced in identifying the source of the DNA. Congressman Michael McCaul is involved, and the FBI assisted in further testing, but a promising lead turned into disappointment when the DNA sample didn't match a sample in a public database. Despite setbacks, officials remain hopeful that advancements in DNA technology will eventually provide answers.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the escalating campaign of retribution by President Trump against his perceived political enemies, following the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. The charges against Comey are described as weak, and the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, a former personal lawyer to Trump, as interim US Attorney is highlighted as potentially problematic. Trump has indicated that the Comey indictment is just the beginning, and there are reports of efforts to prosecute George Soros's Open Society Foundation. The article concludes that this is a grave abuse of power and a serious attack on the rule of law, with the potential for further actions against Trump's opponents.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Allows Trump to Withhold Foreign Aid Approved by Congress</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 17:43:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the ability to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid funding that Congress had already approved. This decision follows a dispute over the allocation of power between the executive and legislative branches, with the court dividing 6-3 along ideological lines. The funds were intended for overseas development assistance, peacekeeping operations, and democracy promotion. A lower court had ruled the administration's refusal to spend the money illegal, but the Supreme Court sided with the executive branch, with Justice Kagan dissenting and arguing that this decision undermines the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>This article reports on the significant financial resources pouring into campaigns surrounding California's Proposition 50, a ballot measure to redraw congressional districts. Supporters, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, have raised substantially more than opponents, who have ties to President Trump. The measure aims to help Democrats win control of the U.S. House of Representatives, but faces opposition arguing that it inappropriately redraws districts created by an independent commission. The special election is expected to cost the state millions, and its outcome could significantly impact the 2026 congressional elections and Trump's agenda, with polling about the proposition remaining uncertain.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a Category 3 storm, is currently swirling over the Atlantic and could potentially interact with another developing system, leading to a rare phenomenon called the Fujiwhara effect. This effect occurs when two storms merge or become entangled around a common center, depending on their relative strength. While the outcome is unlikely, the interaction could slightly alter the paths of both storms, potentially impacting parts of the southeastern United States. Forecasters are closely monitoring the second storm, which could become Tropical Storm Imelda, increasing the chances of storm surge, wind, and rainfall along the U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>An appellate court is considering a case that could cost Planned Parenthood $1.8 billion related to Medicaid funds in Texas and Louisiana. The case stems from the states stripping Planned Parenthood affiliates of their Medicaid qualifications after the release of controversial video footage. An anonymous litigant is seeking to claw back millions of dollars Planned Parenthood collected while an injunction allowed them to receive Medicaid reimbursements. The issue before the court is whether Planned Parenthood had immunity when it collected the funds, with Planned Parenthood arguing they acted on counsel's advice.

          <p>This article compares debt relief programs and credit counseling as options for managing credit card debt, which has reached $1.21 trillion nationwide. Debt relief programs aim to reduce the total owed through strategies like debt settlement or consolidation, while credit counseling focuses on education, budgeting, and repaying debt over time. Debt relief programs can impact credit scores and involve fees, while credit counseling emphasizes structured payments and has lower fees. The choice depends on financial goals, risk tolerance, and ability to commit to a plan, with research and expert consultation recommended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has argued in a Supreme Court filing that President Trump's firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged misconduct would not cause a "financial market disaster." Solicitor General D. John Sauer urged the high court to allow Trump's bid to fire Cook to take effect while proceedings in her lawsuit against the president continue. Cook is accused of mortgage fraud, which she denies, and her attorneys argue that Trump's request would undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve Board. (not investment advice)</p>
