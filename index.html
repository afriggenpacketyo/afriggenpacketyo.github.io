          <p>President Trump issued an executive order to create a National Center for Warrior Independence on the VA campus in West Los Angeles, aiming to house 6,000 veterans by 2028.  This plan, however, lacks consultation with local VA officials and raises concerns about its feasibility and funding. The order suggests using funds previously allocated for housing undocumented immigrants.  The initiative is met with mixed reactions, with some expressing hope and others skepticism regarding its implementation and potential impact.</p>
