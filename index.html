          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, impacting citizens from 12 countries mainly in Africa and the Middle East, has taken effect amid rising tensions over immigration enforcement. The ban, which restricts entry for nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and others, doesn't revoke previously issued visas but rejects new applications unless they meet specific exemption criteria. Immigration experts note that this version is more carefully crafted to withstand legal challenges by focusing on the visa application process and citing national security concerns, specifically referencing countries with "deficient" screening processes. Groups providing aid to refugees have denounced the ban, while supporters express concern over the inclusion of Afghanistan. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling weak domestic demand despite Beijing's stimulus efforts. The consumer price index dropped by 0.1% year-on-year, while factory-gate prices also decreased significantly, marking the steepest decline since July 2023, as price wars in the automotive industry exacerbate downward pressure. Despite strong exports, economists emphasize the need for China to bolster domestic demand to combat deflation, with the government urged to implement more forceful stimulus measures. Trade tensions with the U.S. persist, with ongoing negotiations and accusations of violating previous agreements, as markets closely monitor potential monetary easing measures from Beijing.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 03:17:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nurses in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, amidst a bitter dispute over compensation that previously led to strikes. The Royal College of Nursing has criticized the offer as inadequate, potentially leading to further industrial action. Ministers assert that the pay rise would bring new starter nurses' earnings above Â£30,000 for the first time, while the RCN argues that nursing has been undervalued and subjected to pay erosion for over a decade. The vote is considered crucial in determining the next steps, with resident doctors already being balloted on strike action over pay, casting a shadow over the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England.</p>

          <p>The UK government has proposed an extension to the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method involving dragging large nets along the seafloor, across a larger area of UK waters. This proposal aims to expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas, covering 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, and follows warnings about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine life. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation.</p>

The US delegation is led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng represents his country. The talks aim to build on the preliminary agreement struck in Geneva that removed the effective trade embargo between the two nations, which amounted to a 90-day reduction in effective tariff rates. A phone conversation between Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping set the scene for Monday's negotiations.</p>
