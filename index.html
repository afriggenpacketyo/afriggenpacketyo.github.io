          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly praised Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of Washington, D.C., for her collaboration with his administration's federal crime crackdown. In a social media post, Trump claimed that their joint efforts have significantly reduced crime in the city, citing statistics showing sharp declines in carjackings and violent crime. He contrasted Bowser's cooperative approach with that of other Democratic governors and mayors, suggesting their resistance hinders crime reduction efforts. The praise comes as part of a broader initiative where Trump has threatened to deploy National Guard troops to other cities to address crime.</p>

          <p>The Venezuelan government has accused the United States of threatening its sovereignty and seeking "regime change" through military intimidation. The accusation follows the deployment of a significant number of U.S. warships to the Caribbean, which the White House has described as part of an anti-drug trafficking operation. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro characterized the deployment as the "biggest threat" in a century and vowed to defend the nation's sovereignty. The heightened tensions are compounded by ongoing poor relations, with the U.S. not recognizing Maduro's recent re-elections and offering a bounty for his capture.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a bilateral meeting, affirming their nations' "special and privileged" partnership during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China. The meeting occurs as India faces new U.S. tariffs of up to 50% in retaliation for its continued purchase of discounted Russian oil, a move Washington argues helps fund the war in Ukraine. Both leaders emphasized their strong, trust-based relationship, with plans for Putin to visit India later in the year. Analysts suggest that U.S. economic pressure may be inadvertently strengthening the strategic alignment between India, Russia, and China.</p>

          <p>Two-time champion Naomi Osaka has advanced to the quarter-finals of the US Open after securing a decisive victory over American third seed Coco Gauff. Osaka, who returned to professional tennis after giving birth in 2023, won the match with a convincing 6-3 6-2 scoreline in just over an hour. The 23rd-seeded player capitalized on an unsteady performance from Gauff, whose game appeared to lack confidence, particularly on her forehand. The win marks one of Osaka's most significant achievements since her return to the sport, demonstrating a return to formidable form on a major stage.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, residents of New Orleans are reflecting on the storm's enduring legacy of loss and resilience. The catastrophic levee failure resulted in widespread flooding, claimed nearly 1,400 lives, and remains the costliest storm in U.S. history.

          <p>Global food corporation Nestlé has dismissed its CEO, Laurent Freixe, with immediate effect after an investigation revealed he had failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate.

The inquiry, triggered by a whistleblower, was led by Nestlé's chairman and lead independent director. Freixe, who had been with the company for nearly four decades and served as CEO for one year, will not receive an exit package. Philipp Navratil has been appointed as his successor.</p>

          <p>A new film titled "The Smashing Machine," written and directed by Benny Safdie, chronicles the life of pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as Kerr, exploring the fighter's personal crisis following his first professional loss. The review praises Johnson's casting as the physically imposing athlete and notes the film's solid portrayal of his struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. While the movie offers touching moments of vulnerability, the review suggests it doesn't fully explore its emotional themes or elevate itself beyond a conventional sports drama.</p>

The violence occurred as President Donald Trump renewed threats to deploy the National Guard to the city, citing ongoing crime issues. In response, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have strongly opposed federal intervention, calling it illegal and unconstitutional. Mayor Johnson signed an executive order to protect the city from what he termed "federal overreach," highlighting the escalating tension between local and federal authorities over crime management strategies.</p>

          <p>An analysis of federal data reveals a significant decline in the number of immigrant workers in the United States, with a drop of 1.2 million recorded in the first seven months of the year. This trend coincides with the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, which have slowed the flow of new immigrants and increased deportations. Immigrants constitute a vital part of the U.S. labor force, particularly in sectors like agriculture, construction, and services. Economists express concern that this reduction in labor could exacerbate shortages, strain regional labor markets, and complicate the overall economic picture for the country.</p>

The government argues the current unconditional route is out of step with other European nations and has strained local councils, which face increased homelessness cases among refugee families.

          <p>An American man has died in the Bahamas following a collision between a vessel and the jet ski he was riding near Paradise Island. The man was found unresponsive with visible injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. This fatal incident is one of several recent events involving American tourists in the area that are under police investigation, including an alleged sexual assault at a resort and another non-fatal jet ski crash. The events draw attention to a U.S. Embassy security alert from April that warned of security risks associated with renting jet skis in Nassau.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, has sharply criticized comments made by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen regarding potential plans for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine. Von der Leyen had reportedly stated that "precise plans" were being developed as part of post-conflict security guarantees. Pistorius called public discussion of such topics "completely wrong" and premature before any peace negotiations have begun. He emphasized that the European Union does not have the jurisdiction to deploy troops, though he acknowledged that deliberations about future security possibilities are ongoing behind the scenes among allies.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has confirmed his team for the upcoming match at Bethpage, which includes 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. Despite the team's continuity, Donald warned against expecting a "rinse and repeat" strategy, emphasizing that playing on American soil presents a completely different challenge. He noted that Europe has not won an away Ryder Cup since 2012 and that the team must adapt its approach to handle the notoriously raucous New York crowd. Donald's wildcard picks included Shane Lowry, Jon Rahm, and Viktor Hovland.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Canadian author Margaret Atwood has responded to a new book ban in Alberta by releasing a satirical short story criticizing the policy. The provincial education ministry has ordered schools to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," a move that has led to the removal of Atwood's iconic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," from some library shelves. Her new story humorously describes "very good children" who grow up without any biological realities, taking aim at the perceived puritanical nature of the ban. The protest highlights a growing cultural debate in Canada over censorship and intellectual freedom in schools.</p>

Authorities reported that the male driver was ejected and died at the scene, while an adult female later died from her injuries at a hospital. The seven injured children, ranging in age from one to twelve, were transported for medical care.

          <p>European stock markets started the month on a positive note, with the defense sector showing significant gains following a major international deal. The U.K. announced it had secured a £10 billion order from Norway for British-made Type 26 frigates, marking the U.K.'s largest-ever warship export deal. This news caused shares of defense contractor BAE Systems to rise, lifting the broader Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index. The health-care sector also performed well, with Novo Nordisk shares climbing after new data suggested its weight-loss drug Wegovy is highly effective in reducing heart disease risks.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly supported his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over her past property dealings. Conservative opponents have accused Rayner of hypocrisy and called for an investigation into whether she avoided paying the correct amount of tax on a flat she purchased in Hove. The controversy centers on whether the property was her primary or secondary residence. Starmer dismissed the criticism as a "big mistake," praising Rayner's success story from a humble background and suggesting the attacks are politically motivated attempts to "talk her down."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that human activity, particularly during the Middle Ages, caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic species. Researchers discovered that while wild animals like deer and foxes began to shrink due to habitat loss and intensified hunting, domesticated animals such as cattle and chickens grew larger. This change marks a departure from previous eras where both groups evolved in similar cycles. The findings illustrate the profound and lasting impact of human practices like selective breeding and land management on the natural world.</p>

          <p>The intense fan enthusiasm for the Prime Video series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has escalated into online hostility, prompting the streaming service to issue a statement against bullying. A psychiatrist weighs in on the phenomenon, where viewers passionately debate the main character's romantic choices and sometimes direct harassment at the actors. The expert explains this behavior can stem from parasocial relationships—one-sided bonds with media figures—where the line between fiction and reality becomes blurred. The anonymity of social media can embolden fans, potentially indicating a broader societal void where people are seeking connection, sometimes in unhealthy ways.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is legally challenging a decision by the World Boxing federation that mandates she undergo gender testing to remain eligible for competition. The rule was implemented following controversy surrounding Khelif and another boxer during the 2024 Paris Olympics. Khelif has filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), seeking to be declared eligible for the upcoming World Boxing Championships without submitting to the test. CAS has dismissed her initial request to suspend the rule pending a full hearing, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over gender eligibility rules in the sport.</p>
