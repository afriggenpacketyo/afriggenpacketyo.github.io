        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described a climate of fear gripping the city due to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. In an interview, she criticized the tactics of federal agents, including the use of masks and unmarked cars, which she likened to kidnappings and argued has created a "reign of terror." Bass stated that these raids, which have detained non-criminals and even legal residents, have severely impacted community life and local businesses, with many residents now afraid to leave their homes. She also condemned the deployment of military troops to the city as an unnecessary and wasteful political stunt.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:12:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new mural immortalizing the late Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, nine months after his passing. Created by Mexican-American artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts the iconic pitcher in his wind-up motion and tipping his cap, celebrating his legacy and symbolizing unity within the Latino community. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, became a cultural phenomenon known as "Fernandomania," inspiring a generation of Latino fans. The article highlights the emotional reactions from fans who saw Valenzuela as a hero who represented triumph over adversity.</p>

In a social media post, Trump called the story "typically untruthful," asserting that he understands the markets better than anyone and does not need such matters explained to him.

          <p>Germany is facing the challenge of managing increasingly frequent and intense heat waves, with recent temperatures soaring near 40°C (104°F). Experts attribute this to climate change and authorities are urging public caution, though official action remains largely at the state and local levels. The federal government provides information and a warning app, but infrastructure like air conditioning is still uncommon in homes, hospitals, and schools due to high electricity costs. The article highlights the particular vulnerability of outdoor workers and residents of socially disadvantaged urban areas, with health experts warning of deadly risks.</p>

          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Todd Lyons, has stated he will continue to permit his officers to wear masks during arrest operations. This controversial practice has drawn criticism from legal advocates and attorneys general, who argue it undermines accountability and fosters a climate of fear. Lyons defended the policy as a necessary tool to protect agents and their families from doxxing and assault, claims which critics dispute. The statement comes amid an intensified deportation campaign by the Trump administration and reports of criminals impersonating masked ICE agents.</p>
