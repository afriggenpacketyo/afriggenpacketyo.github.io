          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the legendary frontman of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath and a successful solo artist, has passed away at the age of 76. His family confirmed his death, which followed a public battle with Parkinson's disease and other health issues that led to his retirement from touring. Known as the "Godfather of Heavy Metal," Osbourne was celebrated for his influential music and iconic, often controversial, stage persona, later endearing himself to a new generation through the reality show "The Osbournes." He was a two-time inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

          <h2>Hershey Announces Double-Digit Price Increases Due to Surging Cocoa Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hershey Company is implementing a "low double-digit" price increase across its candy portfolio to combat the unprecedented rise in cocoa costs. The price of cocoa has skyrocketed due to a global shortage caused by adverse weather conditions and disease affecting crops in West Africa. In response, Hershey is also shifting focus toward products that are less reliant on cocoa as part of a broader strategy to become a more diversified "snacking powerhouse." The company's share prices saw a notable increase following the announcement of the price adjustments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has updated its policy to effectively bar transgender women from competing in women's sports. The committee stated it has an "obligation to comply" with a recent executive order from President Trump aimed at "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports." This policy change requires all national governing bodies for individual sports to align their rules accordingly. The move follows similar actions by the NCAA and international federations for sports like swimming and track, amid a contentious nationwide debate over fairness and inclusion in athletics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated he is considering a proposal to eliminate the federal capital gains tax on profits from home sales. Proponents, including the National Association of Realtors, argue the current tax policy discourages older homeowners from selling, thereby constricting housing inventory. Critics, however, suggest that such a move would primarily benefit wealthy Americans and could further inflate home values by attracting more investors to the market. The current law allows individuals to exclude up to $250,000 of profit and joint filers up to $500,000 from their taxable income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Predicts AI Will Eliminate Entire Job Categories</h2>

          <p>Speaking at a Federal Reserve conference, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that artificial intelligence will lead to the complete disappearance of certain job categories, specifically citing customer support roles. He envisioned a future where AI handles these tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans. Altman also claimed that AI like ChatGPT can already outperform most doctors as a diagnostician, though he stressed the need for a human doctor to remain in the loop. His remarks were part of a broader discussion on AI's transformative and potentially disruptive impact on the economy and national security.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn attention for his choice of hiking attire: dark blue jeans worn during a strenuous climb up Camelback Mountain near Phoenix in over 90-degree heat. The 71-year-old's decision puzzled fellow hikers and social media users, who noted the risks of wearing heavy clothing in such high temperatures. The CDC, which is part of Kennedy's own department, recommends wearing loose, lightweight clothing in extreme heat. This is not the first time Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, has been seen exercising in jeans, a sartorial choice that adds to his contrarian public image.</p>

          <p>Advocacy groups are calling for the immediate closure of a controversial immigrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," citing inhumane and appalling conditions. The camp, which holds over 1,000 men in flood-prone tents, reportedly suffers from sewage backups, lack of medical care, and is located in a remote wetland teeming with alligators and mosquitoes. Mexico's president confirmed 14 of its citizens are being held there and is seeking their repatriation. Florida officials have denied the allegations, but advocates describe the situation as a public health crisis.</p>

          <p>Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, briefly posted and then deleted a fake letter on social media that purported to be the resignation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The letter, which appeared to be AI-generated, featured a distorted Fed seal and unusual formatting. Lee reportedly wrote "Powell's out!" in his post before removing it, later stating he did so out of caution because he was unsure of its legitimacy. The incident occurred amid ongoing criticism of Powell by President Trump, who has repeatedly urged the Fed chair to resign over interest rate policy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) is set to name Gita O’Neill, a career city attorney, as its new interim chief executive. O'Neill will guide the agency through a significant downsizing over the next year as Los Angeles County establishes a new homelessness department, which will assume control of about 40% of LAHSA's budget. The leadership change follows a period of intense scrutiny over LAHSA's financial management and operational effectiveness, including critical audits that found lax accounting and poor oversight of contractors. O'Neill's appointment is scheduled for a vote on Friday.</p>

          <p>A new income-driven student loan repayment option, the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), was established by recent legislation signed into law by President Trump. Available by July 2026, RAP will calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with payments ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings and a minimum of $10 per month. The plan offers loan forgiveness after 30 years. As the legislation also phases out some existing plans, RAP may become the primary affordable option for new borrowers, who will only have a choice between it and a standard 10-year plan.</p>

          <p>Venture capital funding for AI startups in the U.S. reached a staggering $104.3 billion in the first half of the year, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Massive fundraising rounds by companies like OpenAI and Anthropic drove this investment bonanza. However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized through acquisitions and IPOs during the same period. This indicates that while vast sums of money are flowing into AI development, investors are seeing limited liquidity, with the trend favoring smaller acquisitions over high-value public offerings.
