          <p>A group of international culinary experts recently toured Higashikagawa and Miki to delve into the food culture of Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. The chefs participated in local traditions such as visiting a soy sauce brewery and a traditional tea ceremony. They learned to make matcha and enjoyed a performance of classical court music. Chef Luciano Tona noted the common emphasis on simple cooking highlighting local ingredients between Japan and Italy, with many participants finding the matcha experience in a historic setting particularly memorable. The event was organized in conjunction with a national conference for promoting food education in Tokushima.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany may face tax hikes and increased debt as NATO allies consider a higher defense spending target. While Germany currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defense, a proposed 5% target could require tens of billions of additional euros annually. Experts suggest these expenses may need to be financed through loans, potentially leading to budget conflicts, funding cuts in other areas, and tax increases. Germany's debt brake, which limits government debt, and EU fiscal rules could also pose challenges, although temporary suspensions are possible under exceptional circumstances.

Blaze went missing while visiting family in Orange County, California, and his parents found messages on his Snapchat from Woodward, a high school classmate. Woodward initially claimed Blaze walked off in a park, but investigators later found Blaze's body buried in a shallow grave, having been stabbed multiple times. Woodward was eventually convicted of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement, and sentenced to life in prison without parole, while Blaze's parents started a movement called "BlazeItForward" inspiring acts of kindness.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the 'Meteor-1,' the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, marking a significant advancement in using light for computation. The chip boasts a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz, rivaling advanced Nvidia GPUs. This development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors. Optical computing's inherent advantages, such as high speed and low power consumption, position it as a crucial future direction for AI and data centers.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices decreased to $66.57 per barrel, and global benchmark Brent fell to $69.50, reaching levels below those before Israel's attack on Iran. Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following the initial U.S. strikes on Iran, with President Trump suggesting the Islamic Republic should move toward peace and encouraging Israel to do the same. The oil market sell-off reflects the perception that tensions may be easing.</p>

Trump announced a ceasefire on Truth Social, claiming a complete agreement between the two nations, but the article questions the durability of this agreement. It asks whether Tehran can trust Trump after he previously floated the idea of regime change in Iran, and whether Israel will scale back its military advantage.

          <p>This article discusses how Myanmar has become a critical source of rare earth minerals for China, particularly heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium. While China is the world's top producer of rare earths, it relies on imports from Myanmar, which accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. The extraction methods in Myanmar, particularly of ionic adsorption clay deposits, have significant environmental costs, and the country's instability poses supply chain risks for China. China's reliance on Myanmar highlights its vulnerability to disruptions in the global rare earth supply chain.</p>

The amendment also points to an inadequate impact assessment on the consequences for the jobs market and people's health.

          <p>Florida is constructing a migrant detention center, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' on an air strip in the Everglades to temporarily house migrants. The facility, costing approximately $450 million a year to run, is intended to hold an estimated 1,000 people. Officials claim the location acts as a natural deterrent for escapees due to the presence of alligators and pythons, but critics argue that the impacts on the Everglades ecosystem could be devastating. The facility will be built on the site of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded the 2001 'Roadless Rule,' which protects 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. The USDA claims the rule is outdated and overly restrictive, arguing that rescinding it will enable better forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups denounce the decision, stating it will harm wildlife habitats, drinking water sources, and recreational opportunities. Opponents argue that the move is a giveaway to timber companies and will exacerbate climate change.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own without advance warning. The court lifted an injunction that had blocked the practice, enabling the administration to deport migrants to conflict-ridden places such as South Sudan. Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin praised the ruling, while the head of the legal group representing the immigrants criticized it for stripping away due process protections. Justice Sotomayor dissented, citing concerns about the government's past deportations to unsafe countries.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential success of President Trump's high-risk strategy of intervening in the conflict between Iran and Israel, which may have resulted in a ceasefire. Trump announced that the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire, potentially stepping back from the brink of a regional conflict. While the agreement's long-term impact remains to be seen, the initial reports suggest a de-escalation of tensions.

Democrats, however, appeared to be withholding their congratulations, with some expressing concerns about the legality of the US intervention. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated that Trump's admission of unilaterally bringing the US into a war without congressional approval was a grave and illegal act. Representative Thomas Massie said he would not push a resolution requiring Trump to gain congressional approval before attacking Iran, given the ceasefire.</p>
