          <p>Three Iranian men, Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, have been charged under the UK's National Security Act for allegedly assisting Iran. The arrests occurred on May 3, and the charges pertain to activities between August 14, 2024, and February 16, 2025. Commander Dominic Murphy of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command described the investigation as "very complex and fast-moving." The three men are currently in custody and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Saturday, facing serious allegations related to national security concerns in the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen are stuck in South Korea after their boat drifted south of the maritime boundary, marking the longest period any reluctant defectors have been held. Despite repeatedly expressing their desire to return home, North Korea has refused to communicate with South Korea, a sign of deteriorating relations. Experts suggest Pyongyang is displeased with Seoul's hard-line policies. With no communication channels open, the fishermen's fate remains uncertain until relations between the two countries improve, leaving them in a state of limbo and highlighting the deep divide between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people in the Americas from modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. Researchers found that early settlers split into distinct groups, isolated by natural barriers like the Amazon rainforest and Andes Mountains. The findings provide insights into the genetic makeup and health vulnerabilities of modern Indigenous groups, emphasizing the importance of preserving their cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels defeated Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers with a 6-2 victory, but manager Ron Washington emphasizes that the team aspires to compete at a higher level. Despite the win, Washington acknowledges the Dodgers' superior position and focuses on his team's growth and competition within their current talent level. The Angels' victory was fueled by Jack Kochanowicz's strong pitching and YoÃ¡n Moncada's early home run. Meanwhile, the Dodgers, despite Ohtani's home run, are anticipating reinforcements to bolster their already strong lineup.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post that President Donald Trump's supporters interpreted as a veiled threat. The post featured seashells arranged to form the shapes "86 47," which some saw as a call to harm the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post, but Trump and administration officials rejected his explanation. This incident underscores the contentious relationship between Trump and Comey, who was fired in 2017 during an investigation into Trump's campaign.</p>

The special counsel's report, in addition to gaffes seen during Biden's public appearances, amplified pressure from Republicans who said he lacked the mental fitness needed to serve as president.</p>

The storm disrupted travel, leading to flight delays at Midway International Airport and congested expressways.

Prosecutors are using Ventura's testimony to build their case that Combs ran a criminal enterprise, coercing her into unwanted acts and using his network to cover up his alleged crimes, highlighting the challenges of proving sex trafficking versus domestic violence.</p>
