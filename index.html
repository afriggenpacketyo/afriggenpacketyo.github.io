          <p>ABC has preempted its late-night show "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely after the host made controversial comments linking the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The decision followed major broadcast groups, including Nexstar and Sinclair, announcing they would pull the show from their local stations. The move has ignited a fierce debate about free speech, corporate responsibility, and political pressure from government figures, including President Trump and the FCC chairman.</p>

          <p>A potential threat to Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp has been averted after The Conservation Fund, a nonprofit, purchased land for $60 million from a company that planned to mine for minerals nearby. The project, which involved pumping over a million gallons of water daily, raised alarms among environmentalists and hydrologists about the risk of severe droughts and fires in the vital ecosystem. While this specific project is stopped, the fight continues as other nearby private lands could still be targeted for mining.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation for August fell to 2.7%, its lowest point since November 2024, meeting economists' expectations and marking a third straight month of decline. The data comes as the Bank of Japan is anticipated to maintain its current policy rate in its upcoming decision. However, analysts suggest a potential rate hike could occur in October, citing signs of economic resilience and ongoing inflationary pressures from factors like high rice prices.

          <p>France is experiencing significant political chaos and economic strain, raising concerns that it could become the "new sick man of Europe." The country has cycled through five prime ministers in under two years and is struggling to form a majority to pass a budget amid spiraling national debt, which now exceeds 114% of its GDP. This instability has led to a credit downgrade and fears that the nation's paralysis could make it vulnerable to political extremism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown looming at the end of the month, House Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for a vote on a 52-day continuing resolution to keep federal agencies funded. The Republican measure faces unified opposition from Democrats, who object to the bill's failure to address expiring healthcare subsidies and restore Medicaid cuts. With a razor-thin majority, Johnson must navigate internal party divisions to pass the bill and shift pressure to the Senate.</p>

          <p>The suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by ABC has triggered widespread calls for a boycott of its parent company, Disney, as well as the broadcast groups that pulled the show. Activists and supporters of Kimmel argue that the decision, which came after direct pressure from the FCC chairman, represents state-sanctioned censorship and a dangerous attack on free speech. The boycott movement is gaining traction online, urging the public to use economic pressure to protest what they see as authoritarian behavior.</p>
