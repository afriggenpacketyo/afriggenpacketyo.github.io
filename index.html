          <p>Pakistan has reported that India launched missile strikes targeting three air bases within the country, with retaliatory strikes on India now underway; however, most of the missiles were intercepted. The Pakistani military claims it targeted an Indian missile storage facility and airbases in Pathankot and Udhampur using medium-range Fateh missiles. Tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals have escalated following an attack at a tourist site in Kashmir, which India blames on Pakistan. The Group of Seven nations has urged both countries to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further military escalation.</p>

          <p>Newark, N.J. Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility while visiting with members of New Jersey's congressional delegation. He was charged with trespassing after allegedly ignoring warnings to leave the Delaney Hall detention center, which recently began housing migrants. Baraka, who was later released, claims he was there to support the touring members of Congress, not to protest. Other officials and witnesses suggest the arrest was an act of intimidation, while the Department of Homeland Security asserts that members of Congress "stormed the gate" at the facility.</p>

The meetings, the first since increased tariffs were imposed by both countries, seek to de-escalate tensions and potentially reduce tariffs that have disrupted global supply chains. While expectations for a significant breakthrough are tempered, the fact that discussions are occurring has raised hopes for a possible détente and a tempering of hostile rhetoric between the two economic powers.

However, concerns persist among VA staff and veterans, who fear that the reductions could impact the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.

          <p>China's consumer prices experienced a decline in April, adding to concerns about deflation amid the ongoing trade war with the United States. The national consumer price index (CPI) edged down by 0.1 per cent year on year, slightly less than economists had predicted. The fall in consumer prices is unwelcome news for China, which is struggling to combat the effects of tariffs that continue to stifle trade and leave manufacturers with unsold goods. While negotiations with the United States may ease trade tensions, tariffs remain high.</p>

          <p>With interest rates decreasing, first-time home buyers are finding innovative ways to enter the housing market, including using Lifetime ISAs, income booster mortgages, and relocating to cheaper areas. Many are also opting for shared ownership schemes or buying fixer-uppers to make homeownership more accessible. One couple saved for nearly three years using Lifetime ISAs to buy a three-bedroom flat, while another used an income booster mortgage by adding a family member's income. These strategies offer various pathways to homeownership despite rising house prices.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have introduced the initial components of a proposed $4 trillion tax cut, aiming to extend key provisions from President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and offer temporary tax breaks. The plan includes making permanent the larger standard deduction and lower individual income tax rates established in 2017. Additionally, the bill proposes temporary expansions, such as increasing the standard deduction and child tax credit for the duration of Trump’s second term. Democrats have criticized the legislation, arguing that it favors the wealthy and relies on cuts to programs for the poor. This article is from The New York Times.</p>

Ozturk was arrested for an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas.

          <p>In Bristol, dedicated police teams are working to combat night-time exploitation by engaging with street sex workers and disrupting kerb crawlers. The approach focuses on criminalizing the men buying sexual services rather than the women, who are often vulnerable. Police officers conduct patrols, issue community protection warnings, and send offenders to courses to prevent reoffending. This tactic, aligned with the Nordic Model, aims to safeguard the women and reduce harm. The police also work with charities to offer support and gather intelligence from the sex workers.</p>

          <p>The film industry is facing uncertainty after President Trump suggested imposing 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, including the UK. Hollywood has increasingly shifted productions to the UK due to tax incentives and lower labor costs.

The potential tariffs could disrupt this trend and increase costs for moviegoers, as studios may pass these costs onto audiences.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, for undocumented migrants, according to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. This move, if carried out, would curtail a constitutional right and dramatically escalate the administration's immigration policy. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus and that a president cannot do so unilaterally.
