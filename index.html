          <p>North Korea has refloated a 5,000-tonne warship after it capsized during a launch attempt, an incident which drew criticism from Kim Jong Un. The warship was restored to balance using manual processes, including workers pulling tethers and using barrage balloons. Kim Jong Un criticized the incident as a "criminal act" resulting from "absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism," leading to the arrest of at least four officials. Analysts suggest Kim's severe response signals Pyongyang's determination to advance its military capabilities and protect the leader's image as a rising military power.</p>

          <p>Numerous undocumented immigrants were detained at their ICE check-in appointments in Los Angeles and held in the basement of a federal building, some overnight. Immigration lawyers reported that hundreds were detained, with dozens held in rooms without beds and limited access to necessities. One attorney described a couple and their U.S. citizen child being detained despite the father having a stay of removal. Internal government data revealed a surge in ICE arrests, with the agency approaching demands from administration officials for a minimum of 3,000 arrests each day, far exceeding the daily average under previous administrations.</p>

          <p>The private equity industry is facing pressure as a previously forecast boom in M&A and IPO activity has not materialized, leading to discussions about its ability to generate top returns. The SuperReturn conference in Berlin highlighted concerns over geopolitical tensions, volatility in public markets, and the impact of U.S. tariffs on market risk appetite. Despite these challenges, attendees expressed optimism about growth areas such as European defense firms, undervalued mid-caps, and Middle Eastern data centers. Experts suggest that private equity outperforms public markets over the long term, although many firms overpaid during the peak dealmaking period in 2021.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a plan to enhance the disaster resilience of the country's infrastructure over the next five years, with an expected cost exceeding 20 trillion yen ($139 billion). The plan focuses on addressing aging infrastructure and includes 326 measures to be implemented by government bodies from fiscal 2026 through 2030. This decision follows prolonged water outages after the Noto Peninsula earthquake and a sinkhole formation in Saitama Prefecture, prompting the allocation of funds for vital services, disaster prevention infrastructure, and disaster preparedness. The plan aims to repair damaged sewer pipes and bridges while enhancing preparedness through measures such as installing air conditioners in schools used as evacuation centers.</p>

During a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump likened the conflict to a fight between two children, stating that sometimes it's better to let them fight before separating them. Merz emphasized the agreement between the U.S. and Germany on the war's terribleness, urging Trump to pressure Russia to halt the violence. Trump also indicated that sanctions could be imposed on both Russia and Ukraine if necessary.</p>

Over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offences. The number of cases collapsing due to missing evidence is increasing, with physical and digital evidence being lost or damaged during storage. A leading criminologist suggests that the increase is due to resourcing issues brought about by cuts to police forces throughout the 2010s.</p>

          <p>Job growth is expected to have slowed in May, reflecting the impact of President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariffs on the economy. Economists anticipate the U.S. added 125,000 jobs in May, a decrease from the previous month's 177,000. While a trade agreement between the U.S. and China led to tariff reductions, concerns remain regarding the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending and business performance. Several major companies have warned of potential losses due to the uncertainty tied to tariffs, though the unemployment rate remains historically low. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts argue that Kennedy's approach individualizes public health, potentially undermining community-based benefits and limiting access to preventive medicine.

          <p>This article discusses the rise of anti-managerialism as a key component of President Trump's second term, particularly in light of Elon Musk's departure from the Department of Government Efficiency. The essay argues that the Trump administration's efforts to transform institutions stem from a belief that a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats has usurped democracy. This perspective suggests that much of populist politics is an anti-managerial revolution aimed at rolling back bureaucratic control. The author asserts that understanding this anti-managerialism is essential for grasping the Trump administration's efforts to reshape various sectors.</p>

          <p>Operation Guardian Angel, launched by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli in California, aims to force sanctuary cities to comply with federal immigration laws. This initiative seeks to close loopholes that allow sanctuary cities to ignore ICE detainer warrants by obtaining judicial warrants for felony re-entry. By using federal criminal warrants, local officials are compelled to hand over illegal criminal aliens to ICE. The operation has already led to arrests and is expected to make numerous arrests weekly, despite sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>Pride celebrations are moving forward despite a significant decline in corporate sponsorships, leading to budget shortfalls for organizers. Several major sponsors, including Nissan, Comcast/Xfinity, and Anheuser-Busch, have withdrawn or reduced their support, citing various reasons, including economic strain and internal transitions. Organizers attribute these cancellations to the current administration's policies and attacks on the LGBTQ community. Despite these challenges, Pride events will continue, but the long-term impact on programming remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk raises questions about the future of SpaceX and Tesla, both heavily reliant on federal support. Trump's threat to end subsidies and contracts could impact SpaceX's role in the U.S. space program and Tesla's electric vehicle initiatives. While SpaceX's crucial role in space travel makes immediate cancellation of contracts unlikely, Tesla faces potential challenges with federal support for electric vehicle infrastructure. Experts suggest that Musk's wealth and resources could allow him to navigate these challenges, though Tesla's business faces challenges independent of the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is leading to a potential 'China shock' for the global economy. With domestic consumption weak and exports to the U.S. deterred by tariffs, Chinese producers are offering steep discounts, flooding global markets with cheap goods. This situation has raised concerns among Asian economies about squeezed local industries. However, the influx of low-cost Chinese goods could ease inflationary pressures in inflation-worn economies, offering some relief to central banks.</p>

          <p>The feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has escalated publicly, with both figures trading insults over policy disagreements. The conflict began with Musk criticizing Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to retaliatory remarks on social media. Musk took credit for the Republican victory in the election, while Trump suggested terminating Musk's government subsidies and contracts.
