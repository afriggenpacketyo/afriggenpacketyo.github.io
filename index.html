          <p>U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic legislators have introduced the Price Gouging Bill of 2025, aiming to make excessive price hikes by large corporations illegal. The bill grants new enforcement powers to the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, specifically targeting companies that exploit market shocks, such as President Trump's tariff policies, to justify unreasonable price increases. Under the proposed law, companies with over $100 million in revenue would need to publicly disclose significant price changes and their cost structures. The legislation is a response to rising inflation and concerns that major corporations are using tariffs as a pretext for profit-taking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sudden lightning strike at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey, resulted in one fatality and fourteen injuries during a children's competition. The deceased, identified as 61-year-old club member Robert Montgomery, was remembered as a charitable volunteer helping with the event. The incident occurred without prior signs of a storm, with a witness describing the earth as exploding. The injured, including a 7-year-old, were transported to local hospitals with various non-life-threatening conditions. This marks the third serious lightning-related incident in the Tri-State Area in the past month, raising public safety concerns.</p>

          <h2>Trump Addresses Supporter Backlash Over Epstein Files by Alleging a 'Hoax'</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump is attempting to quell dissent within his base regarding his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files by labeling the controversy a "hoax." In a recent interview, Trump suggested without evidence that political opponents may have doctored the files, comparing the situation to the Steele dossier. This response comes as some prominent Republicans and his own former vice president call for greater transparency and the release of all related documents. Trump has characterized his supporters who are questioning the situation as "naive" and "foolish," escalating his defense against the growing political firestorm.</p>

          <p>The live-action adaptation of Disney's "Lilo & Stitch" has become the first Hollywood film of 2025 to earn over $1 billion worldwide, with a sequel already in development. The movie has grossed $416.2 million domestically and $584.8 million internationally, setting a record as Disney's highest-grossing live-action film in Mexico. Its success builds on the enduring popularity of the Stitch character, whose merchandise sales reached $2.6 billion last year, and continues a trend of family-friendly films dominating the box office. The film's massive opening weekend even surpassed "Top Gun: Maverick" for the biggest Memorial Day weekend debut ever.</p>

          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, fell after President Trump announced he had persuaded Coca-Cola to use cane sugar in its U.S. products. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, stating more details on innovations would be shared soon, ADM's stock dropped by as much as 6% in premarket trading. The Corn Refiners Association warned the switch could cost American manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and increase foreign sugar imports. Meanwhile, PepsiCo's CEO noted a potential industry-wide transition could be facilitated if government policy made U.S. sugar more affordable for manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola will switch to cane sugar in the U.S., health experts are weighing in on whether it is a healthier alternative to high-fructose corn syrup. Dietitians note that while there are minor chemical differences—corn syrup has a slightly higher fructose content—both sweeteners have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess. Both are considered "empty calories" with a high glycemic index, contributing to conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Some research suggests high-fructose corn syrup may be associated with higher levels of inflammation, but experts ultimately agree that moderation of all added sugars is key.</p>

The whistleblower, a fired DOJ attorney, alleged Bove had advocated for defying court orders related to immigration policy. Bove's nomination has faced fierce opposition due to this complaint and his role in firing prosecutors involved in January 6 cases, with over 900 former DOJ employees urging his rejection.

          <p>Stargazers are preparing for the annual Perseid meteor shower, one of the year's most impressive celestial events, which will be active from July 17 to August 24. The phenomenon occurs as Earth passes through the debris trail of Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, causing small particles to burn up in the atmosphere and create bright streaks of light. For optimal viewing, experts recommend finding a dark location away from city lights, preferably between midnight and sunrise. No special equipment is needed, but clear skies are essential. Viewers should allow their eyes to adjust to the darkness for the best chance of spotting the meteors radiating from the constellation Perseus.</p>

The author contends that such subsidies misallocate capital and favor established companies over innovators, ultimately hindering true progress. While acknowledging the reform was diluted and grandfathered in many existing projects, the piece celebrates the estimated $500 billion in savings as a significant victory against special interests. The author dismisses claims of unfairness by noting that green energy receives vastly more in subsidies than fossil fuels and advocates for the elimination of all private-sector subsidies to foster a healthier, more competitive market.

          <p>Three doctors in Poland have been found guilty in connection with the 2021 death of a 30-year-old pregnant woman named Izabela, who died of sepsis after being denied an abortion. Her case ignited nationwide protests and became a symbol of the country's restrictive abortion laws. Although an investigation concluded the laws did not directly influence the doctors' actions, they were convicted of directly endangering her life. Two doctors received prison sentences and were banned from practicing medicine, while a third received a suspended sentence. Women's rights advocates called the sentences too mild, stating that justice was only partially served for a death that occurred consciously and with suffering.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to pass the GENIUS Act, a historic bill to regulate cryptocurrency, after overcoming a rebellion from right-wing Republicans. The legislation, which establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, was initially stalled when a dozen conservatives blocked a procedural vote. After a meeting with President Trump, the holdouts relented, allowing the bill to advance. The drama highlighted internal GOP divisions but ultimately cleared the path for the first major crypto legislation to be passed by Congress, a move President Trump has urged to position the U.S. as a leader in digital assets.

One man, now in the UK, believes the leaked data explains a sudden spike in the Taliban's efforts to hunt down his father-in-law. The Ministry of Defence stated a review found limited evidence of systematic retribution resulting from the leak, but affected individuals describe being in shock and fearing the worst for their relatives still in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, "Too Much," describing it as a deliberately unromantic take on the romantic comedy genre. The show follows an impulsive American, Jess (Megan Stalter), who moves to London and enters a relationship with a cynical musician, Felix (Will Sharpe). The review notes the characters' near-total lack of screen chemistry, arguing it's an intentional choice to reflect a modern, pragmatic approach to love. Instead of giddy infatuation, the relationship is built on inertia and mutual need, presenting a vision of love for a cold, precarious economic climate where stability and security trump passionate connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent uptick in inflation is making it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate soon, which in turn means homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) should not expect lower rates. Since HELOC rates are variable and closely tied to the Fed's policy, the central bank's cautious stance will likely keep borrowing costs elevated. If inflation continues to climb, further rate hikes could even be possible later in the year. Despite this, HELOCs remain a more affordable borrowing option compared to high-interest credit cards or unsecured personal loans for many homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>
