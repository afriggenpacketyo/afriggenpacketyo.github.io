          <p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reportedly conducted a large-scale drone operation targeting four Russian military airfields, claiming to have hit over 40 military aircraft. The operation, planned for over a year and a half, involved drones concealed in makeshift 'mobile houses' with retractable roofs. In addition, railway bridges collapsed in Russia's Bryansk and Kursk regions, derailing trains and causing casualties, with accusations of Ukrainian involvement disputed by Ukrainian officials. The Ukrainian air force reported a large Russian aerial attack, launching 479 drones and missiles, while a Russian missile strike on a Ukrainian military training facility resulted in casualties. The ongoing conflict sees continued strikes in Russian border regions and Moscow's long-range campaign against Ukraine, as talks are set to resume in Turkey. </p>

          <p>Poland's presidential runoff election features a stark ideological choice between Rafal Trzaskowski, a pro-European liberal backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and Karol Nawrocki, a staunch nationalist endorsed by outgoing President Andrzej Duda.

The outcome of the election could significantly impact the direction of Poland's policies and its relationship with the European Union.

          <p>Bill Clinton and James Patterson have collaborated on a new thriller, "The First Gentleman," where the commander-in-chief is a woman, and her husband is accused of murder. Clinton drew on his experiences and thoughts about the role of a presidential spouse, which he considered during Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. The authors discussed how their partnership has evolved, with Clinton noting they've played more golf, while Patterson joked about Clinton having more 'presidencies' but fewer holes-in-one. They hope the book offers an escape for readers amidst real-life political drama while reminding them to believe in the democratic system.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Original Sin," by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios political correspondent Alex Thompson, explores Jill Biden's influential role during Joe Biden's presidency. The book portrays Jill Biden as a strong force within the White House, deeply protective of her husband and a key supporter of his decision to run for reelection, while also allegedly downplaying concerns about his cognitive state. It details her involvement in campaign decisions, staff evaluations, and foreign trips, noting her sensitivity to questions about Biden's age and capabilities. The book suggests a family dynamic of 'the family against the world' regarding the president's public image.</p>
