          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian prime minister has achieved this feat. Despite facing a cost-of-living crisis and criticisms of adopting "American-style politics," Albanese's Labor Party secured a victory over opposition leader Peter Dutton. Albanese emphasized his government's success in improving relations with China, leading to the removal of trade barriers that had previously cost Australian exporters billions. The election took place against a backdrop of changing demographics, with younger voters outnumbering Baby Boomers for the first time, and both parties focused on policies to assist first-home buyers.</p>

          <p>Mali's military junta is planning to extend its rule for at least another five years without organizing elections, drawing criticism from the opposition. General Assimi Goita, the current interim president, has secured support from allies to remain in power until 2030. A "national conference" proposed dissolving the 2005 Political Parties Charter and limiting the number of permitted parties, moves condemned by Amnesty International as attacks on freedom of expression and association. Opposition parties argue that these changes violate the Malian constitution and represent an attempt to undermine the country's hard-won democracy.</p>

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially raising prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. Ordered by President Trump, the tariffs aim to promote domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign imports. The tariffs do not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico that meet North American trade agreement requirements, and companies making cars in the U.S. receive a two-year exemption on a portion of the tariffs. These measures have already pushed up new car prices, impacting the used car market and potentially contributing to overall inflation, despite the president's promises to lower it.</p>

The result represents an improvement for the PAP compared to the 2020 election, strengthening Wong's position as he navigates economic uncertainties and rising living costs.
