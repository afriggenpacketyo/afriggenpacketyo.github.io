        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alaska's governor has issued a disaster declaration for the Juneau area due to the imminent risk of a catastrophic glacial lake outburst flood. The National Weather Service and U.S. Geological Survey confirmed that Suicide Basin, a part of the Mendenhall Glacier, has filled to or beyond record-breaking levels, with a release of water expected at any moment. This marks the third consecutive year of serious glacier-related flooding, with a similar event last year causing extensive damage to homes and infrastructure. In response, local authorities and the Army Corps of Engineers have installed over two miles of flood barriers to mitigate potential damage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a 5.8% drop in job vacancies to 718,000 between May and July, the lowest since early 2021. The number of employees on payrolls also saw a modest decline, falling by 8,000, particularly in the hospitality and retail sectors. Despite this slowdown, average wage growth remained steady at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%, suggesting a gradual rather than sharp downturn. Economists note that the cooling may be calming the fallout from recent increases in business taxes and the minimum wage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish police have arrested three individuals and are investigating five others for running a "spiritual retreat" in Pedreguer that allegedly provided dangerous hallucinogenic substances to clients. For over $1,160, participants were offered multi-day stays involving the consumption of ayahuasca, San Pedro cactus, and Kambo, a toxic frog venom. The investigation began after a victim filed a complaint, revealing a company that promoted mystical experiences online to a global clientele but lacked medical safeguards. Authorities seized various substances, including 11 liters of ayahuasca, and said the group generated hundreds of thousands of euros in undeclared income.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Families of soldiers killed in action in the Sahel region, particularly in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, are experiencing profound neglect from their countries' military leadership. Bereaved relatives often learn of their loved ones' deaths through social media and receive no official information, counseling, or financial assistance from the authorities. Analysts suggest the ruling juntas deliberately suppress information about military casualties to maintain a facade of security and control, as these regimes justified their coups by citing a deteriorating security situation. This lack of transparency creates a "war of narratives" with jihadist groups and leaves families to grieve in isolation and financial hardship.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced that over 100,000 people have applied for positions with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in just over two weeks. This surge follows the launch of a recruitment drive by the Trump administration aiming to hire 10,000 new agents to address what it calls "failed immigration policies." The campaign offers incentives like signing bonuses up to $50,000 and student loan forgiveness to attract candidates for roles such as deportation officer and criminal investigator. The hiring push comes amid a reported 1,000% increase in assaults on ICE agents.</p>

          <p>China's National Intellectual Property Administration has rejected a trademark application for "GPT-5" filed by a subsidiary of US-based OpenAI. The decision, which is currently pending appeal, represents a setback for the artificial intelligence company's efforts to protect its branding in the competitive Chinese market. This follows a similar refusal from the United States Patent and Trademark Office in February 2024, which denied trademarks for "ChatGPT" and "GPT" on the grounds that the terms were merely descriptive of the product's function. The rejection highlights the challenges OpenAI faces in establishing its brand identity globally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, the author contends that Democrats should resist the urge to engage in aggressive gerrymandering, even in response to Republican efforts in states like Texas. The argument is twofold: strategically, Democrats are likely to lose a "gerrymandering arms race" due to controlling fewer state legislatures and having more concentrated urban voter bases. Principally, resorting to such tactics would violate the core democratic value of voting equality, undermining the party's position as a defender of democracy. The author suggests that Democrats should instead focus on winning elections by advancing more attractive policy platforms and mobilizing voters.</p>

This work is crucial for supporting bee populations, which are in decline due to various threats including disease and climate change. Wearing a custom protective bee suit, Maple's detection skills help beekeepers prevent significant financial losses and contribute to a broader effort to protect vital pollinators.</p>

          <p>This article examines the strong American cultural condemnation of adultery, noting it's consistently rated as one of the most immoral acts in surveys, on par with human cloning. This intense view is linked to the revered status of marriage in the U.S. as a "moral pinnacle," which in turn frames infidelity as the ultimate betrayal. However, the piece highlights a contradiction, as studies show that cheating is not uncommon, and public reaction can be more forgiving toward celebrities involved in affairs. The author suggests that the simple, vilifying narrative applied to non-famous individuals serves as a way to avoid the complex realities surrounding trust.</p>

          <p>The selection of Alaska as the location for a summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin brings a unique historical context to the forefront, as the state was a Russian colony from 1799 to 1867. Russia sold the territory to the United States for $7.2 million to pay off debts from the 1853-56 Crimean War, a conflict that, like the current war in Ukraine, involved the Crimean peninsula. While the meeting's location is primarily practical, the shared history is being noted, with some in Russia pointing to the region's past. This historical backdrop adds a layer of symbolism to the talks focused on the current war.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not genuinely preparing to end the war, despite an upcoming peace summit with the U.S. in Alaska. Citing intelligence reports, Zelenskyy claimed that Putin is instead readying for new offensive operations and aims to use the meeting with President Trump as a personal political victory. He emphasized that Russia's current military redeployments are inconsistent with any preparations for a post-war situation or a ceasefire. Ukraine, which is not expected to attend the talks, maintains its stance against ceding territory or abandoning its NATO aspirations.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their tariff truce for another 90 days, averting a significant escalation in their trade war just before the deadline. The extension keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 10%, providing more time for negotiations on a range of economic and security issues. This move is seen as a stabilizing factor for global trade and increases the likelihood of a future summit between President Trump and President Xi. Analysts believe the next steps will involve further official meetings to lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend is part of a broader, albeit slow, move towards de-dollarization. As of May, foreign investors held $587 billion in yuan-denominated Chinese bonds, a rebound from a low in 2023. The influx is supported by Beijing's efforts to simplify foreign investment procedures and the inclusion of Chinese bonds in major global indices like the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index, attracting institutional investors such as central banks and pension funds.

Speaking at a press conference, Trump suggested he could approve a version with its performance reduced by "30% to 50%," and mentioned he plans to meet with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. This potential policy shift follows a recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses.

While the Corps maintains that keeping the sediment within the system is beneficial for long-term renourishment, opponents claim it is choking the estuary. The coalition is lobbying Congress to ban the practice and force the Corps to use the dredge material for coastal restoration.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will be shutting down its dial-up internet service, a technology synonymous with accessing the web in the 1990s, effective September 30th. The service, known for its distinctive series of beeps and static noises during connection, was a gateway to the internet for millions. It played a significant role in bridging the "digital divide" by using existing telephone lines, making access more widespread. While broadband has long since replaced dial-up for the vast majority of users, a small percentage of households, particularly in rural areas, still relied on the service and will now need to find an alternative.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to use the National Guard and federalized D.C. police to address crime in the nation's capital is also targeting vulnerable populations, sparking concern among advocates. In his announcement, Trump described the city as being overtaken by "violent gangs," "roving mobs of wild youth," and "homeless people," vowing to remove them. Critics and experts worry that this approach, which includes clearing encampments and displacing people without clear plans for housing or support, could be devastating for the unhoused and mentally ill. The strategy of using aggressive policing to solve complex social issues is being met with significant skepticism.</p>

          <p>A week after devastating flash floods and a mudslide struck the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, 66 people, including Nepalese workers and army personnel, remain missing. So far, only one body has been recovered from the village of Dharali, which was partially submerged when heavy rains caused the Kheerganga river to swell. Rescue operations are ongoing but have been hampered by bad weather and blocked roads. The disaster, which also created a temporary lake by blocking a major river, highlights the region's vulnerability to extreme weather events, with heavy rains predicted to continue.</p>

Al-Sharif was known for his raw, on-the-ground reporting from besieged areas of northern Gaza.

          <p>President Trump is moving forward with a high-stakes, face-to-face summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska this Friday, aiming to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting, which is not expected to include President Zelenskyy, has sparked concern in Kyiv and European capitals about potential concessions made without their involvement. Trump has described the meeting as a "feel out" opportunity and suggested a deal could involve "swapping territories," a notion Ukraine rejects. With Russia showing little public sign of backing down from its demands, observers are wary that the summit may be a diplomatic maneuver rather than a genuine step toward peace.</p>

          <p>Tottenham are reportedly considering a move for Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze to strengthen their attack. The interest comes after Spurs' attacking midfielder, James Maddison, was ruled out for most of the season with a serious knee injury. Eze, 27, had a strong season, scoring 14 goals, including the winner in the FA Cup final, and earned 11 caps for England. While Spurs are also in talks with Manchester City for winger Savinho, sources indicate that Eze has emerged as a player of significant interest, though it is unconfirmed if the club will pursue both players.</p>

          <p>A severe frost in Turkey, the world's largest hazelnut producer, has devastated the 2025 crop, leading to a more than 35% jump in prices since April. This significant shortfall poses a major challenge for confectioners globally, particularly for Ferrero, the maker of Nutella, which uses about a quarter of the world's hazelnut supply. The shortage could force companies to raise prices on popular products, reformulate recipes, or shrink product sizes. While corporate buyers are looking to other countries for supply, the event highlights the vulnerability of food supply chains to the increasing unpredictability of climate change.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination comes shortly after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, blaming her for a weak July jobs report and claiming without evidence that she had "faked" numbers. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has been supported by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. The move has drawn sharp criticism from some economists, who describe Antoni as an unqualified partisan, raising concerns about the future independence of the federal statistical agency.
