          <p>SoftBank Group's shares plunged over 9% for a second consecutive session, reflecting a broader decline across Asian technology stocks that tracked losses in their U.S. peers. This market movement followed SoftBank's recent $2 billion investment in Intel, which paradoxically saw its shares rise by nearly 7%. The downturn significantly impacted major Asian semiconductor firms like Advantest, TSMC, and SK Hynix, and was spurred by a dip in Nvidia's stock. Amidst this, the U.S. Commerce Secretary is considering federal equity stakes in semiconductor companies receiving CHIPS Act funding, aiming to boost domestic industry and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.

          <p>Sarah Ezekiel, who lost her voice to Motor Neurone Disease (MND) at 34, has had her voice miraculously recreated using artificial intelligence from just eight seconds of distorted audio found on an old VHS tape. For 25 years, her children only heard her speak through an emotionless, robotic voice machine. Bristol-based Smartbox, an assistive technology company, collaborated with ElevenLabs to reconstruct her natural voice, overcoming significant technical challenges from the poor audio quality. This breakthrough has profoundly impacted her family, enabling Sarah to express emotions and feel more genuinely connected, highlighting AI's transformative potential in restoring personal identity and communication.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Superior Court ordered the release of former President Alvaro Uribe from house arrest, pending his appeal against a 12-year conviction for witness tampering and bribery. This landmark decision marks the first time a former Colombian president has been convicted of a crime, with Uribe receiving the longest possible prison term. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010 and oversaw the fight against leftist rebels, denies the charges, calling the case politically motivated. The court cited no flight risk, allowing Uribe freedom until a final ruling in mid-October, after which the conviction will be annulled if no decision is issued.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has downplayed the likelihood of an immediate summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite Donald Trump's renewed diplomatic push for direct talks. Following separate meetings with both leaders, Trump conceded the conflict's difficulty and the possibility that Putin might not be interested in ending hostilities, though he still suggested a bilateral meeting without him first. While Putin had expressed openness, Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed the need for gradual, expert-level preparation. This article highlights the ongoing, complex international diplomatic efforts to find a peace framework for the Ukraine war, with security guarantees for Kyiv emerging as a key point.</p>

This follows a broadly positive reaction to recent U.S. diplomatic talks involving President Trump, President Zelenskyy, and European leaders. Investors are keenly awaiting the UK's July inflation data, expected to show a rise to 3.7%, and the Federal Reserve's July meeting minutes, which could offer clues on future interest rate decisions. The article notes that despite recent positive political developments, market participants remain focused on economic indicators and central bank policies, with a high probability of a September Fed rate cut.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced declines, mirroring Wall Street's overnight losses, as investors analyzed Japan's latest trade data and China's loan prime rate decision. Japan's exports notably fell 2.6% year-over-year in July, marking their sharpest drop in over four years, exceeding economists' expectations and signaling potential economic headwinds. This downturn impacted key regional indices like the Nikkei 225 and Kospi, and saw SoftBank Group shares plunge significantly. In contrast, Chinese toymaker Pop Mart saw its shares reverse course to rise after reporting a substantial profit surge, driven by global demand for its Labubu dolls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that Donald Trump, despite his divisive rhetoric, is paradoxically becoming Europe's greatest unifier since the Cold War, particularly concerning Ukraine. European leaders, including those from NATO and the EU, presented a rare united front in Washington following Trump's controversial meeting with Vladimir Putin. The author suggests that Trump's actions, such as his alarming summit with Putin, provided the urgent impetus for Europe to converge on a collective stance. This unity is pushing towards a concrete peace framework for Ukraine, emphasizing security guarantees and potential territorial concessions.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how the Trump administration is increasingly using tariffs as a political weapon rather than a traditional economic tool, replacing diplomacy. President Trump has imposed tariffs on countries like India and Brazil, linking them to geopolitical demands such as India ceasing Russian oil purchases or Brazil's political trials. Experts argue these "national security tariffs" aim to compel loyalty and realign global leadership, rather than solely rebalance trade deficits. Critics suggest this approach, coupled with the dismantling of other diplomatic instruments, could alienate allies and make future trust-building difficult for the U.S.</p>

          <p>India and China are showing signs of a diplomatic thaw, with talks on border delimitation and boosting trade, as both nations face mounting U.S. tariff pressure from the Trump administration. Experts suggest this rapprochement signals a desire to push back against Washington's aggressive trade policies and explore alternative partnerships. The article notes the creation of an "expert group" to address disputed border areas and pledges to increase trade and investment. This development highlights a strategic realignment among BRICS countries in response to perceived U.S. coercion, potentially complicating future U.S. foreign policy efforts.

          <p>Three firefighters were injured, one severely, after a hit-and-run driver crashed into a North Carolina veterinary clinic, causing a gas line rupture and subsequent explosion. The driver, Jason Lee Beach, was later arrested and charged with felony DWI and other offenses. The explosion occurred as firefighters were searching the building to ensure it was empty. Fortunately, no civilians were inside at the time. Authorities secured the gas leak and brought the fire under control, but the incident highlights the dangers faced by emergency responders and the consequences of reckless driving.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to expand his "anti-woke" crusade from the Smithsonian Institution to museums nationwide, instructing his attorneys to initiate a process similar to efforts in universities. Trump criticized the Smithsonian for focusing on negative aspects of American history, such as slavery, rather than "Success" or "Brightness." This move follows his earlier executive order to remove "improper ideology" from the Smithsonian and attempts to influence its leadership. Museum organizations are expressing alarm, warning that such directives risk censorship and the "erasure of history," undermining museums' role as places of truth and open inquiry.</p>

The investigation focuses on whether an earlier fire, believed extinguished, might have reignited. Critics, including a city Fire Commission member, express concern about the delay, emphasizing the need to understand what worked and what didn't during fire season, especially after the Fire Chief's removal.</p>

The decline in auto exports to the U.S. was particularly steep, despite a recent reduction in U.S. tariffs on Japanese automobiles.
