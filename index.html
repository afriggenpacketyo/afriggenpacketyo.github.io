          <p>Sir John Curtice analyzes Reform's significant gains in recent local council elections, noting their success goes beyond a mere protest vote. The Reform party secured the most votes and seats, gaining control of multiple councils, outperforming the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, and Labour. The article highlights that Reform's appeal is particularly strong among those who voted for Brexit and feel left behind by globalization. This success poses a challenge for both Conservative and Labour parties, which must address the concerns of this segment of the electorate to regain their support.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools by siphoning away funds to benefit wealthier students already in private education. The bill's passage marks a significant victory for school choice advocates and a shift in Texas education policy.</p>

          <p>UPS and the U.S. Postal Service are planning significant job cuts this year due to cost-cutting measures and operational streamlining. UPS will cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 distribution facilities, while the USPS will eliminate 10,000 positions and reduce its budget. These changes come as both companies adapt to evolving economic conditions, including the impacts of tariffs and the rise of digital communication. While UPS anticipates no impact on customer experience, USPS customers may experience some changes in delivery times.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers are attempting to provide relief to condominium owners facing rising costs in aging buildings, following strict new requirements passed after the 2021 Surfside collapse. The measure pushes back the deadline for structural integrity inspections and allows a grace period for fully funding reserves. The bill also allows condo associations to secure loans for repairs with member approval. Lawmakers aim to balance safety with the financial impact on condo owners, acknowledging the need for further attention to condo safety measures in future legislative sessions.</p>
