          <p>A gunman opened fire in a Midtown Manhattan high-rise, resulting in the deaths of four people, including an on-duty police officer providing security. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a history of mental health issues, used an MR rifle in the lobby and on an upper floor before taking his own life. The attack prompted a major police response and lockdown in the busy commercial district. Authorities are still investigating the motive for the shooting, which also left several others injured.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and bribery, marking the first time a former head of state in the country has been criminally convicted. The court determined Uribe conspired to influence testimony from imprisoned former paramilitary members who had accused him of having ties to their groups. Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010 and remains a polarizing figure, faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal. The verdict has drawn mixed reactions, including criticism from some U.S. politicians.</p>

          <p>British newspapers are widely covering U.S. President Donald Trump's recent meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his subsequent comments. Several outlets are focusing on Trump's acknowledgment of "real starvation" in Gaza and his call for more humanitarian aid, a position some papers credit to Starmer's influence. Other headlines highlight Trump's political advice to the Prime Minister, urging him to cut taxes and control immigration to counter political rivals. The media roundup also touches upon the England women's football team's Euro victory celebrations and ongoing disputes over a new EU trade deal.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held his first official phone call with his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun, urging Seoul to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling." The conversation reflects Beijing's efforts to improve relations with South Korea's new administration under President Lee Jae-myung, who is seen as more open to China than his predecessor. The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to advancing their strategic partnership and agreed to cooperate on the upcoming APEC summit. This diplomatic outreach signals a potential thaw in relations between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat a looming demographic crisis, China's government has announced its first nationwide subsidy to encourage more births. The new policy will offer parents 3,600 yuan (approximately $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a program expected to assist around 20 million families. This move follows various local initiatives and comes as China faces a declining population for the third consecutive year. Despite the end of the one-child policy, high child-rearing costs have contributed to one of the world's lowest birth rates.</p>

          <p>Singapore Airlines experienced a sharp 59% drop in its first-quarter net profit, leading to its stock falling by over 8%. The decline was primarily attributed to lower interest income and a share of losses from associated companies, particularly Air India, in which SIA holds a 25.1% stake. While the airline noted that overall demand for air travel remains strong, analysts expressed concern that Air India's significant losses and complex restructuring could continue to negatively impact SIA's financial performance. The company's cargo business also faces uncertainty due to trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to challenge a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants in the U.S. illegally who are arrested by ICE.

Advocacy groups argue the policy is a misinterpretation of the law and violates due process rights, causing irreparable harm to families.

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen has spoken out after a video of his violent arrest by immigration agents in Florida gained widespread attention. Kenny Laynez, who is Hispanic, was detained in May after a traffic stop, during which an officer told him, "You got no rights here. You're an amigo, brother." The video also captured an officer suggesting they might end up shooting people who resist. The incident has intensified scrutiny of Florida's crackdown on illegal immigration and the expanded role of state and local law enforcement in federal immigration operations.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is drawing mixed reactions, with some economists arguing it is an unbalanced agreement that will harm the EU's economy. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a significant increase that could reduce the EU's annual GDP, while American goods will face no new tariffs. In return, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make substantial investments. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American manufacturers, European industry groups are concerned about the financial hit.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking to play this season after the organization denied his waiver request for a final year of eligibility. Wingfield, a transfer who was projected to be a key starter, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing his case has merit due to disruptions from the pandemic and a past injury. The lawsuit claims the denial causes him irreparable harm by costing him a significant NIL opportunity and a chance to enhance his career.

Cramer also noted that investors may be experiencing "tariff ennui," as many of Trump's trade negotiations follow a similar pattern of high threats followed by a moderated deal.

          <p>A federal appellate court is reviewing the legality of aggressive U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) tactics in Southern California, including the use of "roving patrols" to detain individuals. The case follows a lower court's injunction that blocked agents from using criteria like race, location, or language as a pretext for enforcement without reasonable suspicion, finding it violates the 4th Amendment. The 9th Circuit judges intensely questioned the Justice Department's lawyer about the constitutionality of the sweeps.

          <p>This article analyzes how President Donald Trump's reliance on television news appears to shape his policy perspectives, using his recent comments on the Gaza crisis as a key example. After seeing images of malnourished children on TV, Trump publicly contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's claim that there is no starvation in Gaza. This reliance on media visuals over intelligence briefings makes the president susceptible to public opinion shifts but also to manipulation and misinformation. The author argues this approach narrows his understanding and can lead to policy decisions based on punditry rather than expert analysis.</p>
