          <p>A targeted act of violence at a Michigan church resulted in four fatalities and eight injuries during a Sunday morning worship service. The 40-year-old suspect, identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his vehicle into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, opened fire on hundreds of churchgoers, and then set the building ablaze. Police engaged Sanford, who died at the scene, though his motive remains unknown. This horrific event prompted a large FBI investigation into what is being called an act of targeted violence, alongside responses to additional bomb threats in the community, intensifying the tragedy.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the mayoral reelection race, citing constant media speculation and a Campaign Finance Board decision to withhold millions in campaign funds. His departure sets up a three-way contest between Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who took office in 2022, faced a federal corruption scandal and consistently low poll numbers, despite his previous defiance against dropping out. His name will still appear on the ballot as an independent candidate, but his campaign is effectively over, marking a significant shift in the city's political landscape.</p>

          <p>More than 100,000 federal workers are expected to formally resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation in US history, as part of a Trump administration program designed to implement sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. This unprecedented exodus coincides with Congress facing a critical deadline to authorize more funding or risk a government shutdown, prompting the White House to order agencies to prepare for large-scale firings. Departing workers described experiencing months of "fear and intimidation," feeling compelled to leave when their mission and job security were undermined.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's ambition to significantly expand its use of green marine fuels, particularly methanol, is critically dependent on establishing a reliable supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has already implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel fueling operations, green methanol requires a streamlined system to bring mainland-produced fuel into Hong Kong, store it, and sell it tax-free. The company's new dual-fuel vehicle carrier, CM Hong Kong, currently uses a quarter green methanol and plans to increase this from 2027, driven by Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs.</p>

          <p>Staff at Schoen Clinic York's specialist eating disorder unit were reportedly photographed sleeping while on duty, leading to multiple "unsafe" incidents and severe patient harm, according to whistleblowers and former inpatients. Allegations include staff witnessing self-harm without intervention, serving unhygienic food, and using triggering language towards vulnerable patients. The unit, which recently closed due to low referrals, had been rated "good" by regulators, but patients vehemently disagreed, claiming their conditions worsened. Safety concerns have also emerged regarding the clinic's co-located dementia unit, prompting further inspection.</p>

          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy reflected on the intensely hostile and often abusive fan behavior he experienced at the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, where he was a frequent target of heckles and insults throughout the event. Despite enduring personal attacks, including one instance where he directly responded to a fan's taunts, McIlroy maintained his composure for the majority of the competition. His European team ultimately secured a 15-13 victory over the Americans, a triumph McIlroy had boldly predicted two years prior. He humorously suggested he would be open to the Ryder Cup returning to New York if the outcome remained the same.</p>

          <p>President Trump is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order that attempts to redefine birthright citizenship, challenging over a century of settled legal precedent. The order unilaterally declares that only newborns of parents with permanent legal status are eligible for citizenship, representing a controversial reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment. Federal courts have twice blocked the order, but the administration argues it is crucial for national border security. Legal experts, however, widely believe the Supreme Court is unlikely to side with Trump, citing the landmark 1898 U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark ruling.</p>

          <p>Federal officials confirmed that the shooter at the Dallas U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility specifically targeted ICE agents and acted alone, driven by an animus towards the agency. Joshua Jahn, the suspect, used a legally purchased rifle and apps designed to track agents, firing from a nearby rooftop early Wednesday morning. The attack tragically resulted in one detainee's death and two others critically injured inside vans targeted by Jahn.

          <p>The rising popularity and high cost of weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro are sparking concerns that effective obesity treatment could increasingly become a "wealth issue," exacerbating existing health inequalities. While some of these drugs are available on the NHS, access is tightly restricted by varying regional criteria, leading over 90% of users to pay privately at significant monthly costs. With potential price increases and higher obesity rates in deprived areas, critics warn that weight management could become a luxury, further entrenching social disparities rather than leveling the playing field.</p>

          <p>The New York Mets' playoff aspirations were decisively crushed with a 4-0 loss to the Miami Marlins in their regular-season finale, marking a stunning and familiar collapse after holding the best record in MLB in mid-June. The team, boasting the league's highest payroll, finished outside the postseason, a disheartening outcome for fans who have endured similar late-season meltdowns in past years. This loss allowed the Cincinnati Reds to clinch the final NL wildcard spot. Manager Carlos Mendoza expressed deep frustration over the team's inability to overcome persistent pitching woes in the second half.</p>

The scheme will involve collaboration with private companies to cover some wages and is funded from existing budgets, seeking to draw a clear policy distinction with Reform UK ahead of the November Budget.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels concluded their season in last place for the fifth consecutive year, prompting significant scrutiny over owner Arte Moreno's leadership and the organization's direction. Despite numerous management changes, the team's performance has not improved, with general manager Perry Minasian overseeing a worse winning percentage than his predecessor. Moreno, 79, is expected to decide on retaining Minasian and manager Ron Washington. Analysts point to a weak farm system, low payroll, and persistent poor fundamentals as critical issues hindering the team's competitiveness and frustrating fans.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer contends that the current AI boom and data center buildout are fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble, dismissing comparisons as uninformed. He highlights that current investments come from financially robust hyperscalers and that the infrastructure being built has clear, immense demand, unlike the debt-fueled, client-lacking connectivity bubble of 2000. Cramer acknowledges skepticism about AI's immediate, visible impact but asserts its necessity for major tech players like Microsoft, Meta, and Google. He believes the ongoing innovation and demand make it an industrial revolution, not a speculative bubble. (not investment advice)</p>
