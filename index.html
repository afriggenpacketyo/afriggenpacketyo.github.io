          <p>A paramedic in Scotland has been sentenced to ten and a half years in prison for secretly administering an abortion-inducing drug to his pregnant partner, leading to a miscarriage. Stephen Doohan, who was a clinical team leader and featured in a BBC documentary, pleaded guilty to assault, sexual assault, and causing an abortion. The judge described his actions as a calculated and heinous breach of trust, leaving the victim with a lifetime of pain and loss. The court heard he committed the act under the guise of consensual sexual activity after learning the woman, whom he had not told he was married, was pregnant with his child.</p>

          <p>An investigation into impeached former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has uncovered evidence suggesting he ordered military drones into North Korean airspace. The alleged incursions in October 2024 were reportedly intended to provoke a military response from Pyongyang, which Yoon could have used as a pretext to declare a national emergency and martial law. While North Korea protested, it did not retaliate militarily, and Yoon's subsequent martial law declaration in December was short-lived, leading to his impeachment and arrest. He now faces charges of insurrection, with the drone allegations being investigated as a potential act of treason.</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded over 1,277 measles cases this year, the most severe outbreak since 1992, resulting in three deaths. The spread is attributed to declining vaccination rates, with public health officials expressing concern as summer camps and travel increase transmission opportunities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged summer camps to verify the vaccination status of attendees to mitigate risks. This resurgence of a nearly eradicated disease highlights a significant public health challenge, as the highly effective MMR vaccine faces renewed skepticism, even from top health officials.</p>

Navarro characterized Cook's requests for more time as a "long-running soap opera," suggesting that with modern technology, it is "inconceivable" that iPhones could not be produced elsewhere, including in the U.S. This criticism aligns with President Trump's intensified demands for Apple to shift production to the United States and avoid countries like India. Apple has been gradually increasing production in other countries, partly to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>

Currently, leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after this point.

Campaigners and politicians have praised the move as a significant step forward, recognizing that such an event is a bereavement, not an illness.

          <p>Citigroup has raised its price target for Nvidia to $190 per share, anticipating the chipmaker will capture a significant portion of the rapidly expanding market for AI infrastructure. Analysts believe that demand from governments building their own national AI capabilities is already a major revenue driver and will increase substantially. The firm noted that Nvidia is involved in nearly every sovereign AI deal, making it central to the global AI race. Despite potential risks like renewed export restrictions, Citi projects strong growth in Nvidia's data center and networking sales over the next few years. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global copper market is confronting a potential supply shortage as demand, driven by clean energy technologies, is projected to double by 2050. This challenge is exacerbated by geopolitical factors, including threatened U.S. tariffs, which are creating price volatility and prompting nations to prioritize sovereign access to the critical mineral. Australia, holding the world's second-largest copper reserves, is a key player, but faces challenges in accessing deeper, lower-grade ore deposits. Innovators are racing to develop new technologies, such as more efficient hydrometallurgy, to make these less accessible resources economically viable and bolster supply chain independence.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to communication experts, a successful apology from a boss or leader requires proper timing, genuine empathy, and a clear plan of action. Waiting too long can signal a lack of care, while speaking too quickly without a plan can erode credibility. An effective apology involves taking full responsibility, demonstrating an understanding of what went wrong, and outlining steps to fix the issue and prevent its recurrence. Leaders are advised to sound human and show vulnerability without making the situation about themselves, as audiences want to hear from a person, not just a brand, to rebuild trust.</p>

          <p>Despite its focus on streaming over traditional theatrical releases, Netflix consistently lures major Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig, and Rian Johnson. The company achieves this by offering an appealing combination of lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to its vast global subscriber base of over 300 million. Netflix has become a haven for filmmakers with projects that traditional studios might deem too expensive or risky, such as "The Irishman" or the upcoming "The Electric State." This strategy allows Netflix to produce award-contending films and maintain a steady flow of exclusive, high-profile content for its platform.</p>

From nonstick pans and food packaging to clothing and cleaning supplies, plastics and their chemical components like PFAS are unavoidable. Scientific research links these substances to a range of health problems, yet finding ways to meaningfully reduce exposure proves incredibly challenging. While experts recommend steps like avoiding processed foods, using HEPA filters, and choosing natural fibers, the author concludes that individual actions feel insufficient against a systemic problem, highlighting the need for broader governmental regulation.</p>

Persistent deficits could lead to higher inflation and interest rates, "crowd out" private investment, and strain funding for other government priorities like defense.

The summit, marking the 50th anniversary of EU-Chinese relations, will bring European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa to Beijing.

          <p>Apple is appealing a €500 million fine from the European Union, calling the penalty "unprecedented." The European Commission imposed the fine in April, ruling that Apple violated the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by restricting app developers from informing users about cheaper offers outside the App Store. Apple argues that the EU is overstepping by mandating how it runs its store and forcing confusing business terms. The company stated it had implemented changes to comply with the DMA and avoid daily fines but will now challenge the decision in the EU's General Court.</p>
