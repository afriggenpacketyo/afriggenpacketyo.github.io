          <p>President Trump intensified his focus on Chicago, sharing a social media post that read, "Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR." He later clarified to reporters that he is not "going to war" but intends to "clean up" cities with high crime rates. The post follows his executive order to rename the Department of Defense, a move requiring congressional approval, and comes amid his administration's broader strategy of deploying federal forces to Democratic-led cities for immigration and crime enforcement.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Kansas Senator Roger Marshall defended HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership at the CDC, describing him as a necessary "disrupter" tasked with increasing transparency. Marshall pushed back against criticism from fellow Republican senators, arguing that not every individual needs every vaccine and that medical decisions should be left to parents and doctors. He contrasted the current situation with the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, stating that widespread natural immunity has changed the public health landscape.</p>

          <p>Major trade unions in the United Kingdom are warning the government against watering down the forthcoming Employment Rights Bill, a significant piece of legislation aimed at strengthening workers' protections. Leaders from unions like Unison fear that a recent cabinet reshuffle has removed key champions of the bill, potentially leaving it vulnerable to amendments that would weaken its impact. The proposed law includes major reforms such as a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and enhanced protection against unfair dismissal.</p>

          <p>John L. Burton, a towering and proudly liberal figure who shaped California politics for over six decades, has passed away at the age of 92. As a lawmaker in the Assembly and Congress, and later as the powerful leader of the state Senate, Burton was instrumental in crafting policies on welfare, foster care, and civil rights. Known for his rumpled demeanor, profane language, and fierce advocacy for the underprivileged, he was a key architect of the Democratic Party's dominance in the state.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has confirmed that its Azure cloud computing platform is experiencing disruptions due to damage to undersea fiber optic cables in the Red Sea. The cuts are causing increased latency and delays for users whose internet traffic is routed through the Middle East. While Microsoft has managed to reroute traffic through alternative paths, the incident underscores the vulnerability of the critical global internet infrastructure concentrated in this strategic maritime corridor.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church has canonized Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died from leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, making him the first millennial to be declared a saint. Acutis, who was an avid gamer and self-taught coder, became known as "God's influencer" for using his technical skills to create websites documenting Catholic miracles and spreading his faith online. His sainthood is seen by many as a significant step by the Vatican to connect with younger, digitally native generations of believers.</p>

The 51-year-old man was tracked to his home after the red, Ferrari-liveried vehicle was spotted again. Previous attempts to identify the driver were thwarted because he always wore a full racing helmet, concealing his face. He now faces fines and a possible license suspension for driving an unregistered and unequipped vehicle on a public road.</p>

          <p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is poised to fundamentally disrupt traditional career paths by automating and eliminating many entry-level, white-collar jobs. As companies increasingly adopt AI for routine tasks, the first rung of the corporate ladder is disappearing, making it harder for new graduates to gain initial work experience and progress within an organization. This trend, combined with corporate flattening, suggests that the well-known success stories of rising from the mailroom to the CEO's office may become a relic of the past.</p>
