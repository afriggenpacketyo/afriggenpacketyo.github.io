          <p>Walmart's CFO indicated that consumers could start seeing price increases later this month due to tariffs, even after recent duty reductions on imports from China. Despite this, Walmart beat quarterly earnings expectations, reporting its first profitable quarter for e-commerce both in the U.S. and globally. The company expects net sales to increase, but declined to provide specific earnings guidance due to fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. Walmart is working with vendors to mitigate price increases and plans to maintain its price advantage over competitors, but the speed and magnitude of the tariff-related price increases are unprecedented.

          <p>Americans for Prosperity (AFP) is collaborating with Republican representatives to target competitive House districts, advocating for the extension of President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

The focus is on states with contentious races expected in 2026, and the AFP urges Republicans to offset budget cuts by eliminating former President Joe Biden's "Green New Deal giveaways."</p>

Despite maintaining its full-year financial forecast, Walmart executives acknowledged the pressure from tariffs and the potential need to raise prices for consumers. The article notes that Walmart is relatively insulated from tariff-induced cost increases compared to competitors due to its large grocery business, but it is not entirely immune to the economic effects of the Trump administration's policies. The retailer is seen as a bellwether for U.S. consumer trends, with consumer sentiment dampened by concerns about tariff-related price increases.</p>

          <h2>Investors Worry About Deficit-Stretching Potential of Trump's Tax Plan</h2>

          <p>Investors are growing uneasy about the potential for President Trump's tax plan to expand the deficit, even as Republicans debate the specifics. Government bonds have sold off amid these concerns, with yields on the 30-year Treasury bond climbing to nearly 5 percent. Fiscal hawks, such as Stephen Jen, express alarm about the growing U.S. debt, drawing parallels to Liz Truss's ouster in Britain after unfunded tax cuts roiled bond markets. The Republican bill, which would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and introduce new ones, could add trillions to deficits over the next decade, sparking debate within the party over budget cuts.</p>

          <p>Germany is backing President Trump's call to increase NATO members' defense spending target to 5% of their GDP, according to German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. This endorsement comes as NATO chief Mark Rutte proposed a 3.5% target for defense spending and an additional 1.5% for wider security-related matters. The move signals a close alignment between Germany and the U.S. on foreign policy, with Germany ready to take a leadership role in Europe and strengthen its military capabilities.</p>

          <p>The article distinguishes between two types of police officers: showboaters, who prioritize appearances and tough talk, and real cops, who quietly and effectively uphold the law while respecting constitutional rights. It criticizes the Trump administration's emphasis on flashy roundups and federal intervention, arguing that true policing involves a legal sensibility and defending the weak within a constitutional framework. The author advocates for supporting real cops who build trust within their communities and focus on winning over individuals rather than imposing repression.</p>
