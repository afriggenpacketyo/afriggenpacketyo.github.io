          <p>Elon Musk has indicated he may be backing down from his public feud with Donald Trump after a series of exchanges on social media. This follows Trump's criticism of Musk's views on the tax and spending bill, as well as Musk raising Trump's connections to Jeffrey Epstein. Musk initially threatened to decommission his Dragon spacecraft in response to Trump's threat to cancel government contracts, but later stated he would not do so after receiving advice to "cool off." The White House has reportedly scheduled a call with Musk to mediate a resolution to the conflict, and Musk responded positively to Bill Ackman's call for peace between the two influential figures. Optimism surrounding this development could potentially foster a more stable environment for both the technology sector and government relations.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany stated in an interview with Fox News that migration is a contributing factor to the increase in antisemitism within Germany. Merz emphasized that the German government strongly opposes antisemitism and is actively working to reduce its prevalence. Data indicates a significant rise in antisemitic incidents in Germany, with 8,627 cases reported in 2024, a 77% increase from 2023. A substantial portion of these cases, 5,857, were classified as "antisemitism related to Israel," while 544 cases were attributed to right-wing extremist views. The German government aims to address this imported antisemitism through legal prosecution and comprehensive measures.</p>

          <p>Undocumented immigrants attending ICE check-in appointments at a federal building in Los Angeles were detained, some held overnight in the building's basement. Immigration lawyers reported that hundreds were detained, with dozens held in rooms lacking beds and with limited access to necessities. One attorney described a case where a father with a stay of removal and his family were detained, highlighting the unexpected nature of these actions. Arrests by ICE have surged during President Trump's second term, with daily arrests significantly higher than during President Biden's last year in office, leading to concerns about the capacity and planning for large-scale deportations. The increased detentions raise concerns about inhumane treatment and potential violations of due process.</p>

          <p>The private equity sector is facing pressure as a previously anticipated boom in M&A and IPO activity has not materialized, leading to concerns about its ability to generate top returns. Private equity firms are holding a large number of unsold companies, impacting investors' ability to realize returns. Despite these challenges, attendees at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin expressed resilience and highlighted growth opportunities in areas like European defense firms and Middle Eastern data centers. Experts suggest that private equity firms may have overpaid for companies during a period of low interest rates, and consolidation within the industry is expected to continue. The industry is adapting to changing market conditions with new trends such as continuation vehicles and NAV lending.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a five-year plan to enhance the country's infrastructure resilience to disasters, with an expected cost exceeding 20 trillion yen ($139 billion). The plan focuses on addressing aging infrastructure and includes 326 measures to be implemented by government bodies from fiscal 2026 through 2030. This decision was prompted by prolonged water outages following the Noto Peninsula earthquake and a sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture. The plan allocates funds for maintaining vital services, disaster prevention infrastructure, and enhancing disaster preparedness, including installing air conditioners in schools used as evacuation centers. This initiative aims to improve Japan's ability to withstand and recover from future disasters.</p>

          <p>Thousands of criminal cases are collapsing annually due to lost, damaged, or missing police evidence, according to a BBC investigation. Over 30,000 prosecutions in England and Wales failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offenses. The data indicates an increasing number of cases recorded as an "E72," which signifies that the CPS cannot proceed to trial because police lack necessary evidence. Former police officers attribute the issue to resourcing problems and the overwhelming amount of evidence they handle. A criminologist suggests that the loss of the dedicated Forensic Science Service in 2012 has contributed to the problem, as police forces now manage their own evidence storage and contract private providers.</p>

Economists anticipate the U.S. added 125,000 jobs in May, a slowdown from the previous month's 177,000. A trade agreement between the U.S. and China in May reduced tariffs and boosted the stock market. However, companies like Pepsi, Goldman Sachs, and Target have warned of potential losses due to tariff-related uncertainty. Consumer spending, a key economic driver, could weaken if import costs increase, potentially leading to layoffs.

Critics argue these actions contradict the idea of medical freedom by restricting access to certain products. Public health experts express concern that Kennedy's approach individualizes public health, potentially undermining community-based strategies and support for preventive medicine.

          <p>The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has deteriorated into a public feud, with both men trading insults on social media. The dispute appears to stem from disagreements over government spending and electric vehicle subsidies. Musk has criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, while Trump has accused Musk of ingratitude. The feud has created new pressures for Republican politicians and presents an opportunity for Democrats. The falling out highlights the instability within the Republican coalition.</p>

          <p>A new program called Operation Guardian Angel, launched by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, aims to force sanctuary cities to comply with federal immigration laws. The program seeks judicial warrants for illegal aliens with prior deportations who are arrested locally. This approach is intended to close loopholes that allow sanctuary cities to ignore ICE detainer warrants. By obtaining federal criminal warrants, local officials are compelled to hand over criminal illegal aliens to ICE. This initiative is a step toward enforcing immigration laws and removing criminal illegal aliens from sanctuary cities.</p>

Organizers report a 20% to 30% decrease in corporate support compared to previous years.

          <p>The feud between President Trump and Elon Musk raises questions about the future of government support for SpaceX and Tesla. Musk's companies have received billions in federal backing, making the U.S. government reliant on them. Trump threatened to end Musk's government subsidies and contracts, but experts are skeptical about the feasibility of canceling SpaceX contracts due to its crucial role in the U.S. space program. Federal support for Tesla and electric vehicle infrastructure is also in doubt, potentially impacting the company's growth. The outcome of the feud could have significant financial implications for Musk's businesses.</p>

          <p>Kari Lake, a senior adviser to President Trump, plans to significantly reduce the staff at Voice of America, potentially impacting its ability to provide comprehensive news to a global audience. The proposed cuts would reduce the workforce from 1,300 to 81 employees. Lake claims the actions are to comply with Trump's executive order to reduce the agency to minimum statutory requirements. This plan is being challenged in federal court, with concerns raised about the network's ability to fulfill its mandate. The move has sparked outrage among Voice of America journalists and former leaders, who fear it will undermine the network's effectiveness.</p>

In Great Britain, over half of respondents support a strong leader who breaks the rules to address the problems they see in their economy.

This decision overturns a 2022 court ruling that ordered the former executives to pay around 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. The trial focused on whether the management's inaction regarding tsunami countermeasures was acceptable. The ruling has been criticized by shareholders seeking the damages.</p>
