          <p>A baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco, who was initially suspended for flipping it in celebration of a home run, has been sold at auction for $9,882. The suspension, which sparked a legal battle and drew support from major league players, was eventually overturned by a judge. All proceeds from the auction, which drew 68 bids, will be donated to the Haddonfield Little League program where Rocco plays. His father expressed Marco's happiness in being able to give back to an organization that has been a significant part of his life.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a massive overnight assault on 14 regions of Ukraine, utilizing nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles, resulting in one death and 30 injuries in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack and called for stronger international sanctions against Moscow. In response, Ukrainian drones targeted and hit Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran. The aerial exchange occurs as international diplomatic efforts to end the two-year-long war remain stalled, with EU ministers considering freezing Russian assets.</p>

          <p>A performance at the Hollywood Bowl titled “Sarabande Africaine” featured a unique collaboration between cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo, exploring the African origins of Baroque-era dances like the sarabande. The concert blended works from Bach and Handel with African drumming, Caribbean percussion, and interpretations of pieces by Philip Glass and George Gershwin. The review praises the show's ability to demonstrate a harmonious fusion of diverse musical traditions, though notes it could occasionally feel preachy. The event showcased how different musical languages can create a compelling and unified artistic statement.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are proceeding with legal action to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, despite a Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction against the practice in Epping Forest. The ruling was seen as a setback for councils arguing that using hotels for asylum seekers constitutes a breach of planning laws and creates public safety risks. Protests are ongoing in multiple English towns, reflecting heightened community tensions. The government maintains it is working to end the use of hotels, while critics argue the system is unsustainable and creates flashpoints for conflict.</p>

          <p>Andriy Parubiy, the 54-year-old former speaker of Ukraine's parliament, was shot and killed in the western city of Lviv. Parubiy was a prominent figure in the 2014 Euromaidan protests that led to the ousting of the pro-Russian president. Unverified footage shows a gunman, reportedly disguised as a food delivery courier, approaching Parubiy and shooting him before fleeing the scene. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack a "terrible murder," and a nationwide manhunt is underway for the suspect, with some Ukrainian officials hinting at Russian involvement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Donald Trump's broad "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most trading partners are an illegal use of emergency powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump used to justify the levies, does not grant the president the authority to impose taxes or duties. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for an appeal to the Supreme Court. This ruling represents a significant legal challenge to a cornerstone of Trump's economic policy and creates uncertainty for global trade and business.</p>

          <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has ordered a nationwide review to ensure undocumented immigrants are not residing in federally funded public housing. HUD Secretary Scott Turner announced that all Public Housing Authorities have 30 days to conduct an audit of residents' citizenship or eligible immigration status. The administration states this move prioritizes housing for American citizens, citing that HUD currently serves only one in four eligible families. The policy has drawn praise from Republicans for enforcing existing law, while critics worry it will divert resources from serving eligible residents.</p>

          <p>After a landmark study identified agricultural pollution as a major source of Iowa's water quality problems, funding for publicizing the report's findings has been quietly withdrawn. The two-year, $1 million study was intended to inform the public about contaminants like nitrates and pesticides in drinking water sources, which are linked to the state's high cancer rates. However, over $400,000 remaining in the budget, earmarked for communications and public awareness, was reportedly "zeroed out" without explanation.

Menzies was convicted for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker. The court ordered a lower court to re-evaluate his competency, citing a significant change in his condition.

          <h2>Opinion: The Belated Western Recognition of Genocide in Gaza Reflects Dehumanization of Palestinians</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent willingness of Western academics and media to label the situation in Gaza as a genocide comes only after 21 months of Palestinian testimony being dismissed. The author contends that this delay stems from the philosophical dehumanization of Palestinians, which is essential to the colonial project. The piece criticizes the media's framing of the conflict, which often starts with the events of October 7, 2023, ignoring decades of occupation. It concludes that the shift in discourse is not a moral awakening but a reaction to visible suffering like starvation, which is easier for Western audiences to process than the violence of bombings.</p>

          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review has identified the private colleges in the U.S. that offer the best return on investment (ROI), with Princeton University taking the top spot. While Princeton's tuition is over $65,000, the average student on financial aid pays just over $10,500 per year and goes on to earn a median income of more than $110,000 a decade after attending. Other top institutions include Caltech, MIT, and Stanford. The report highlights that elite private schools with large endowments often provide generous financial aid, including "no-loan" policies, which significantly boosts their value proposition.</p>

The article critiques the intense media focus on the engagement, contrasting it with Swift's silence on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, arguing that choosing not to use her immense influence on such issues is a deliberate political choice.</p>

          <p>After a nearly five-decade career at The Washington Post covering 12 presidential elections, political correspondent Dan Balz is retiring. In a recent interview, Balz reflected on the most significant shift he has witnessed in American politics, stating that it has become progressively "tougher, coarser, and meaner." He noted that public trust in government plummeted during the Vietnam War and Watergate eras and has remained low ever since. Balz observed that while politics has always had its ebbs and flows, the current landscape is marked by a persistent and concerning decline in civility and faith in institutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is part of a broader strategy that experts warn could undermine the central bank's political independence. A compliant board could give the president influence over not just interest rates but also bank regulation and the stability of the U.S. financial system. While the administration frames its actions as necessary reform, critics argue it could lead to the politicization of monetary policy, risking hyperinflation and eroding global confidence in the U.S. dollar.
