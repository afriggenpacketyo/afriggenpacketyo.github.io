          <p>The U.S. administration has announced plans to levy a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to take effect on August 1. The announcement, made in a letter to Canada's prime minister, cites the need to combat the flow of fentanyl and address trade deficits as key reasons for the new duties. The letter also warns that the tariff rate could increase if Canada chooses to retaliate, adding to existing tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos. Canadian officials have responded by stating their commitment to defending national workers and businesses while continuing to work with the U.S. on the fentanyl issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A confrontation occurred between U.S. Border Patrol agents and protesters in Ventura County, California, during a federal raid on a marijuana facility. Agents deployed tear gas and less-lethal rounds after a standoff, while officials reported that ten undocumented juveniles, eight of them unaccompanied, were discovered at the site, prompting a child labor investigation. The incident drew sharp criticism from California's governor, who condemned the raid's tactics, while federal authorities defended their actions as lawful enforcement. The clash resulted in several injuries and highlighted the escalating tensions surrounding federal immigration enforcement operations in the state.</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a celebrated IVF treatment pioneer and Labour peer, has resigned from the British Medical Association (BMA) in protest of planned strikes by resident doctors. He argued that the five-day walkout over pay, scheduled for late July, is ill-timed and could erode public trust in the medical profession. Lord Winston, a BMA member since 1964, emphasized the vulnerability of patients and urged doctors to consider their responsibilities more seriously. The BMA maintains that the strike is necessary as the government has refused to negotiate on pay, which they claim remains significantly lower in real terms than in 2008.</p>

          <p>According to a comprehensive study by Princeton University, harassment and threats directed at local school officials have increased by 170% since the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers found that initial conflicts over mask mandates evolved into disputes over cultural issues like diversity initiatives and LGBTQ+ policies, affecting officials across the political spectrum. The study highlights how misinformation on social media fuels these confrontations, creating an exhausting and hostile environment for school board members. Despite the risks, some officials remain committed to their public service roles, viewing the challenges as a necessary sacrifice.</p>

The initiative aims to restore the natural habitat for rare and endemic fish species, which have been severely impacted by decades of river fragmentation. These structures had blocked migratory routes, reduced water flow, and degraded spawning grounds, sometimes causing sections of the river to dry up completely.

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin a significant reduction of its domestic workforce, cutting its staff by approximately 15%, which amounts to nearly 1,800 positions. The move, part of a broader reorganization plan, will involve both layoffs and voluntary departures and aims to streamline operations and eliminate redundant departments. Critics and some department staff express concern that the cuts could undermine diplomatic work and morale, while the administration argues the changes are necessary to create a more efficient and mission-focused bureaucracy.

The NAO noted a "disappointing return" on the £11 billion spent so far, with the fleet's mission-capable rate falling far short of targets.

          <p>China is experiencing a significant boom in the sales of electric-powered heavy trucks, which is rapidly eroding the market for diesel fuel and curbing the nation's overall oil demand. Driven by government subsidies and an expanding charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks, mostly electric, surged by 175% in the first half of the year. This unexpected growth has led analysts to revise down their forecasts for diesel consumption and accelerate their predictions for when China's oil demand will peak. The shift is further supported by the lower long-term operating costs of electric trucks compared to their diesel and LNG counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House criticized the ruling as an unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court, vowing to fight the decision.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a key negotiator during pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, has filed a $20 million administrative claim against the Trump administration for wrongful detention. Khalil, who was held by ICE for over three months as the government sought his deportation, alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution, and emotional distress. His legal team argues his detention was a retaliatory act against his constitutionally protected speech. In lieu of payment, Khalil stated he would accept an official apology and an end to what he calls the administration's unconstitutional policy of targeting activists.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two men convicted for the 'Hillside Strangler' serial murders that occurred in Los Angeles during the 1970s, has been denied parole. The California Board of Parole Hearings made the decision after Bianchi had served 46 years in prison. Bianchi and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., were responsible for the murders of twelve women, where they impersonated police officers to lure their victims before torturing and killing them. Bianchi, now 74, will not be eligible for another parole hearing for ten years.</p>

The meteorite, weighing over 54 pounds, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It is believed to have been ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact before traveling 140 million miles and crashing into the Sahara Desert. This rare object offers a significant dataset for scientists studying the red planet and is currently on public display in New York before the auction.</p>

          <p>Despite high-level meetings between U.S. and Israeli leaders, a ceasefire agreement for Gaza has not been reached, with an Israeli official suggesting a deal could still be weeks away. Meanwhile, the conflict continues, with a recent Israeli strike in central Gaza killing 15 civilians, including ten children, who were waiting for aid at a health clinic run by the charity Project HOPE. The organization condemned the attack as a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. The Israeli military stated the strike targeted a terrorist and said it was investigating the incident and regretted any harm to non-combatants.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science has made an exceptionally rare fossil discovery directly on its own property. A bone fragment, believed to be a vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur that lived 67.5 million years ago, was found in a core sample drilled over 750 feet deep under the museum's parking lot. The drilling was part of a study for geothermal heating potential, making the find entirely unexpected. Museum officials described the discovery as incredibly improbable, likening the odds to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon, and have now put the unique fossil on display for the public.</p>

The meeting occurs as Nvidia navigates U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, which have effectively cut off sales to the multi-billion dollar Chinese market. The administration has indicated it plans to implement new, simpler restrictions on AI technology exports later this year. The president praised Nvidia's stock performance, linking its rise to his administration's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The administration's recent threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports is drawing legal and political criticism for its use of emergency economic powers. The justification for the tariff, which partly cites Brazil's treatment of its former president, relies on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the same law currently being challenged in federal court over other tariffs. Critics argue this move is an abuse of power and factually flawed, as the U.S. maintains a trade surplus with Brazil, not a deficit as claimed in the announcement letter. This stretches the interpretation of presidential authority to address foreign threats. (not investment advice)</p>

The plaintiff, Lauren Pisciotta, claims the artist forced her to perform oral sex, engaged in sexual activity with other employees in the office, and stalked her after her initial lawsuit was filed. The complaint details a disturbing workplace culture involving antisemitic slurs and demands for employees to draw swastikas. Pisciotta is seeking unspecified damages for multiple counts including assault, battery, and false imprisonment.</p>

The occasion was celebrated with a street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display from the venue's roof. The restoration of the landmark, a symbol of Parisian nightlife since 1889, brings back a key feature of the Montmartre district's skyline.</p>

          <p>Political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe, in his new book, claims to have identified a formula for creating effective political slogans by analyzing 20,000 campaign messages. He identified eight key words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, together—that consistently resonate with voters across different cultures and political affiliations. Bruni-Lowe argues these words act as 'emotional shortcuts' that form the building blocks of successful messaging, citing examples like Bill Clinton's 'Putting People First'. The article notes that while this formula exists, the rise of AI-driven, hyper-targeted messaging may soon change the nature of political slogans entirely.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, author of the cult novel 'Trainspotting,' is releasing a new sequel and reflecting on the cultural shifts since his book's debut in the 1990s. In an interview, Welsh expressed concern that the internet and AI are creating a 'post-culture society' where humans have become 'dumbed down machines' taking instructions. He argues that the 90s were a time when people 'had lives' and that today's society is defined by precarity for all classes. Welsh's new novel, 'Men in Love,' explores relationships and is set in the 1980s, a time he notes had very different social norms.</p>
