          <p>A new report reveals that Wales is the least affordable region in Great Britain for first-time homebuyers, with Ceredigion and Powys being the most challenging areas.  High house prices coupled with low median incomes mean that less than 3% of potential buyers can afford homes in these areas. This situation raises concerns about the impact on Welsh culture and the ability of young people to remain in their hometowns.</p>
