          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit to remove Democratic State Representative Gene Wu from office, labeling him the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout. Dozens of Democrats fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan, denying the House a quorum. Abbott's lawsuit argues this constitutes an abandonment of office, while Wu defends the action as a fulfillment of his constitutional duty to oppose a "racist gerrymandered map." The legal challenge escalates the high-stakes political battle over congressional representation in Texas.</p>

          <p>A congressional committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The bipartisan panel is also summoning former top Justice Department officials to scrutinize the federal government's handling of the case. The subpoenas focus on the Clintons' past connections to Epstein, including documented flights on his private plane. This action intensifies the political and legal examination of the long-running Epstein saga and the powerful individuals associated with him.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is terminating 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines, totaling nearly $500 million. Kennedy, a long-time vaccine skeptic, claimed the technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses and that the funds would be shifted to "safer" platforms. This decision has drawn sharp criticism from health experts, who credit mRNA technology with saving millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and warn that the move could undermine future pandemic preparedness.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has arrested and charged two Chinese nationals in California for illegally shipping advanced AI chips, including Nvidia's powerful H100 units, to China. The defendants allegedly used their company to export tens of millions of dollars in sensitive technology without the necessary licenses, violating U.S. export controls. These regulations are in place to restrict China's access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology that could have military applications. The case underscores the U.S. government's ongoing efforts to prevent the illicit transfer of critical technology.</p>

At the city's Peace Memorial Park, officials and survivors gathered, with Hiroshima's mayor warning of a growing global military build-up and the erosion of non-proliferation treaties. Survivors shared powerful testimonies, connecting their past trauma to current world conflicts and urging humanity to learn from the tragedy that killed over 200,000 people. The event served as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Australia's Great Barrier Reef has suffered its most significant annual decline in coral cover since records began nearly 40 years ago, a new report reveals. The Australian Institute of Marine Science attributes the unprecedented damage primarily to extreme heat stress from climate change, which triggered the most widespread coral bleaching event ever recorded. Scientists warn that the vital marine ecosystem may be approaching a tipping point where it can no longer recover between catastrophic events. The findings underscore the escalating and severe threat that climate change poses to the world's oceans.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in the U.S. have decided not to pursue the death penalty against three reputed high-level Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. The latter is accused of the 1985 murder of a DEA agent. This decision is notable given the Trump administration's strong rhetoric supporting capital punishment for drug traffickers. The move avoids potential diplomatic complications with Mexico, which opposes the death penalty and typically requires assurances against it before extraditing its citizens for trial in the United States.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has achieved a historic $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliated companies to address decades of pollution from "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other contaminants. This agreement is the largest single-state environmental settlement in U.S. history. It requires the chemical giants to fund extensive cleanup efforts at four major industrial sites and compensate the state for damages to its natural resources. The landmark deal holds the companies financially accountable for the widespread environmental and public health impacts of their operations in the state.</p>

          <p>A fast-spreading wildfire in the Corbieres hills of southwestern France has burned over 11,000 hectares, injuring nine people, one of whom is in critical condition.

          <p>An analysis by BBC Verify reveals that Russia has more than doubled its rate of drone and missile attacks on Ukraine since President Trump's inauguration in January, despite his public calls for a ceasefire. The data, compiled from Ukrainian Air Force reports, shows a sharp escalation in aerial bombardments, which have reached their highest levels of the war. This intensification has occurred alongside a reported increase in Russian munitions production and two temporary pauses in U.S. military aid. The findings present a stark contrast between the administration's stated diplomatic goals and the escalating violence on the ground.</p>

          <p>Shares of real estate tech company Opendoor dropped significantly after it released a weak forecast, citing a "further deteriorated" housing market due to persistently high mortgage rates. Despite a recent surge in investor interest, the company projected a sharp decline in revenue and home acquisitions for the upcoming quarter. This outlook overshadowed a slight revenue increase in its latest report. The company is now emphasizing a strategic pivot to a less capital-intensive business model to navigate the challenging macroeconomic environment. (not investment advice)</p>
