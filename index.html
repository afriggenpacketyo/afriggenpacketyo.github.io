          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a significant increase of over 7% on Friday, driven by concerns about potential disruptions to Middle Eastern oil supplies following Israeli airstrikes on Iran.  The attack, launched without U.S. support, is considered the most significant geopolitical event since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.  Oil prices rose sharply, with U.S. crude oil closing at $72.98 per barrel and Brent crude at $74.23. Iran retaliated with missile strikes against Israel.</p>

Many are attempting to leave Tehran, but heavy traffic is hindering escape efforts.  Residents report a lack of official warnings before attacks, leaving them to react to the sounds of explosions.  The current situation is reminiscent of the Iran-Iraq war for some, but without the prior warnings of that conflict.</p>

          <p>Given economic uncertainty, the traditional 4% rule for retirement withdrawals may be insufficient. Vanguard suggests two alternative strategies: the bucket strategy and the glide path strategy. The bucket strategy involves dividing assets into categories based on spending timelines (short-term, medium-term, long-term).  This allows for customized risk management and flexibility in meeting various spending needs. (not investment advice)</p>
