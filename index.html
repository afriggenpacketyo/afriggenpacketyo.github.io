          <p>The Israeli military has initiated extensive ground operations in Gaza, accompanied by evacuation orders for specific areas and strikes on sites, including a hospital. This offensive, dubbed Operation Gideon's Chariot, aims to free hostages and defeat Hamas, with strikes impacting Khan Younis and northern Gaza towns. Simultaneously, negotiations between Israel and Hamas continue in Qatar, with both sides presenting conditions for a ceasefire and hostage release, but a breakthrough remains elusive. The situation is dire for civilians, with hospitals overwhelmed and aid agencies warning of potential famine amid ongoing military actions.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has broadened its ground operations in both northern and southern Gaza, aiming to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages or surrendering. This expansion follows days of airstrikes and involves dividing Gaza into separate areas, with civilians urged to evacuate. Despite ongoing negotiations for a cease-fire in Doha, Prime Minister Netanyahu has reiterated firm conditions for ending the war, including the release of hostages and demilitarization of Gaza. The intensified military campaign has resulted in numerous casualties, and residents express deep concern over renewed displacement.</p>
