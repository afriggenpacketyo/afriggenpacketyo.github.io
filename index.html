          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 17:02:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has significantly broadened its 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, extending them to cover 407 additional product types. This expansion, which took effect recently, now includes items such as machinery, fire extinguishers, construction materials, and various specialty chemicals. The move aims to close loopholes and support American industries by regulating a wider range of steel and aluminum derivatives. Experts estimate the tariffs now impact at least $320 billion worth of imports, a substantial increase from previous figures, though the specific products are obscured in government documents by customs codes.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose by 3% after the company maintained its full-year sales growth forecast, signaling confidence despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The retailer reported seeing encouraging signs, such as a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and sales growth in most merchandising departments. This performance comes amid a persistent "deferral mindset" from homeowners, who cite general economic uncertainty as the primary reason for postponing large projects. The company's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate home improvement activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fitness trainer Jillian Michaels has publicly refuted several allegations made in the new Netflix documentary about the reality show "The Biggest Loser." Using social media, she posted screenshots of alleged emails and text messages to counter claims that she distributed banned caffeine pills and had a falling out with co-star Bob Harper. Michaels asserted that the use of caffeine was approved by the show's doctor and producers, and that her friendship with Harper had soured years before his heart attack. She also denied allegations of extreme calorie restriction for contestants, presenting evidence of her correspondence.</p>

          <p>A political ideology known as "abundance liberalism" is gaining traction among Democratic party elites as a potential new vision for the party. The concept advocates for aggressively building more clean energy, infrastructure, and affordable housing to overcome bureaucratic stagnation and solve key national issues. However, the article highlights that this forward-looking agenda faces significant political resistance at the local level. The high-powered suburbs of Maryland are presented as a case study where the politics of abundance, particularly concerning housing, prove to be treacherous and unpopular with some Democratic voters.</p>

          <p>Following high-profile summits in Alaska and Washington, President Trump's efforts to broker peace in Ukraine have yielded limited tangible progress despite generating significant diplomatic activity. The article notes that while Trump appears open to providing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, numerous obstacles remain, including uncertainty about Vladimir Putin's willingness to end the war while his forces are advancing. Furthermore, the mercurial nature of American foreign policy and potential skepticism from Trump's own political base about new foreign commitments present considerable challenges to achieving a durable peace agreement.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has officially registered a local unit in Argentina as a car manufacturer, signaling a potential move into vehicle production in the country. The filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina S.A.U. to not only import and sell vehicles but also to manufacture and service them, along with their batteries and parts. This development follows the company's 2017 investment in an electric bus plant in Argentina and its recent announcement of regional expansion plans. If production begins, it would mark BYD's second vehicle factory in Latin America, following a major project in Brazil.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his administration will target what he terms "woke" content in museums, employing a strategy similar to the one used to pressure colleges and universities. In a social media post, Trump criticized the Smithsonian Institution for focusing on negative aspects of American history like slavery, rather than success and brightness. He stated he has instructed his attorneys to review museums across the country to remove such narratives, suggesting that federal funding could be used as leverage. This follows a White House directive for a comprehensive review of eight Smithsonian museums.</p>

          <p>Shares of artificial intelligence software company Palantir fell more than 9%, marking the fifth straight day of declines and a continued retreat from its recent all-time highs. The stock has dropped over 15% during this period, following a surge earlier in the month driven by its first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter. Despite the recent slump, Palantir remains one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 for the year, having more than doubled in value. This rapid ascent has been fueled by AI enthusiasm and major government contracts under the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

While overall spending is projected to decline slightly compared to last year, these companies can leverage their flexible pricing models, private-label brands, and discount events like Prime Day.

While rail ridership saw a slight recovery, bus boardings, which make up the majority of the system's passengers, dipped by nearly 2%. The June decline was the lowest on record since 2022, with fears of being swept up in raids believed to be a significant factor, as over 60% of bus riders are Latino.
