          <p>President Trump has indicated that a government shutdown is probable due to an impasse with Democratic leaders over a spending bill. He expressed confidence that the public will support his position, which focuses on spending cuts and linking any healthcare negotiations to immigration policy. A key meeting with congressional leaders is scheduled for Monday ahead of the October 1 funding deadline, though the White House has suggested a shutdown could be used to implement program cuts via executive power. Democrats have strongly contested Trump's portrayal of their stance on both funding and immigration. (not investment advice)</p>

This acquisition is seen as a step toward focusing on secular growth markets like Healthcare and Water ahead of the planned spinoff of its electronics business, Qnity, on November 1. Analysts expect the breakup to unlock shareholder value, as Qnity's peers trade at significantly higher multiples. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, appeared in court remotely for a hearing. His legal team requested a preliminary hearing to determine if sufficient evidence exists for a trial, where prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty. Authorities allege Robinson was motivated by Kirk's political views, citing text messages where he purportedly wrote, "I had enough of his hatred."

          <p>The United States has recorded over 1,500 measles cases this year, the highest number in more than three decades, with infections confirmed in at least 39 states. A significant portion of these cases is linked to a major outbreak in West Texas that resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health experts attribute the rise in this preventable disease to declining vaccination rates, with kindergarten immunization levels falling below the critical 95% threshold required for community immunity. The CDC warns that measles can lead to severe complications, including brain damage and death.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the fintech startup Frank, is set to be sentenced after being found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase in a $175 million acquisition deal. A jury convicted Javice of fabricating millions of customer accounts to inflate the value of her company, which was designed to help students with financial aid applications. JPMorgan discovered that Frank had fewer than 300,000 real users, not the 5 million claimed, months after the 2021 purchase. In court, Javice expressed profound remorse for her actions, while prosecutors argued her crime was fueled by greed, stating the bank had acquired a "crime scene."</p>

The potential benefits include locking in rates and securing a guaranteed income stream, which can provide peace of mind amid market volatility. However, the decision depends on individual circumstances, as annuities are illiquid investments and could limit financial flexibility during a crucial decade before retirement.

          <p>Brandon Stanton, the creator of the popular photography project "Humans of New York," has revealed his past struggles with drug addiction and failure that preceded his success. In a recent interview, Stanton shared that he flunked out of college at 19 and battled an Adderall addiction before finding a job in finance, which he later lost. He described this period as hitting rock bottom but said being fired was a turning point that allowed him to pursue his passion for photography. This journey led to the creation of his project, which has raised $20 million for various causes and is the subject of his new book.</p>

          <p>Following their 15-13 victory over the United States, Europe's Ryder Cup team celebrated by playfully trolling U.S. President Donald Trump. The players were filmed singing "Are you watching Donald Trump?" after Rory McIlroy received a congratulatory text message from the president, who is an avid golf fan and was present at the Bethpage Black course a day earlier. Trump responded positively on social media, confirming he was watching and congratulating the team. European captain Luke Donald explained the moment as good-natured banter that the president seemed to take in good spirits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced new tariffs, set to begin October 1, that will likely increase the cost of home furnishings and renovations for American consumers. The new levies include a 50% tariff on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture. The president justified the move as a matter of national security to protect U.S. manufacturing. Industry analysts predict that retailers will be forced to pass these costs on to consumers, potentially in the form of double-digit price increases, which will disproportionately affect low-income households who rely on more affordable imported goods.</p>

Kirby recalled running back into the church, feeling shrapnel hit his leg as a bullet shattered a nearby glass door. He described the experience as the scariest moment of his life, driven by the fear of not knowing if his family was safe amidst the chaos.</p>

          <p>The gunman in the deadly attack on a Michigan church has been identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, a 40-year-old U.S. Marine veteran who served in Iraq. According to a White House official, the FBI believes Sanford "hated people of the Mormon faith," and the attack is being investigated as an act of targeted violence. A local political candidate who met Sanford while campaigning reported that the shooter expressed a strong dislike for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, stemming from a past relationship.

          <p>Approximately 58 million pounds of frozen corn dogs and other sausage-on-a-stick products are being recalled nationwide due to potential contamination with pieces of wood in the batter. The recall, issued by Hillshire Brands, a subsidiary of Tyson Foods, affects certain State Fair corn dogs and Jimmy Dean brand products. The issue was discovered after the company received multiple consumer complaints, including five reports of minor injuries. The affected products were produced between March and September 2025 and were distributed to retailers, schools, and Defense Department facilities, prompting concerns they may still be in consumers' freezers.</p>

          <p>The Taliban has imposed a total internet blackout across Afghanistan, cutting off both high-speed fiber optic connections and mobile data services. This move is the latest in a series of crackdowns by the Islamist regime, with a local Taliban spokesperson stating the ban was ordered by their leader to "prevent immoral activities." The shutdown has disrupted communications and business operations, with Afghan television channel TOLO reporting that its broadcast has been affected. Analysts warn the blackout will be devastating for the country's youth and economy, further isolating a nation already facing a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government has issued new guidance requiring schools to provide separate toilet facilities for boys and girls based on biological sex. This policy shift follows two landmark court rulings, including a Supreme Court decision that defined a woman by biological sex under equalities law. While single-sex facilities are now mandatory, schools are also permitted to offer gender-neutral toilets. The previous guidance allowed transgender pupils to use the facilities they felt most comfortable with, but the updated document removes this specific line while still emphasizing the importance of supporting transgender students' wellbeing and gender identity in other school activities.</p>

          <p>According to behavioral scientists, a simple two-step plan can significantly help individuals achieve their savings goals: set a specific goal, and then create a reminder to take action. Behavioral economist Katy Milkman notes that associating goals with reminders is incredibly helpful, whether through a calendar notification or asking for a prompt from a partner or financial advisor. For better results, experts recommend automating savings by dedicating a percentage of income to be deposited automatically. Research also shows that people are most motivated to start new financial habits during "fresh starts," such as the beginning of a new year or week. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal combines Compass's regional strength with Anywhere's national brands like Century 21 and Coldwell Banker. While the companies state the merger will deliver more value to consumers, some industry analysts express concern that the consolidation will intensify pressure on independent, smaller brokerages, making it harder for them to compete. Proponents argue the combined entity would still control less than 20% of the market, leaving ample competition.</p>

Research indicates that the top 1% of Americans now control more than a third of the nation's wealth, a significant increase since 1980.
