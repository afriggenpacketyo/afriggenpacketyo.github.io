          <p>Community kitchens in Gaza are warning that food supplies are dwindling rapidly due to a two-month Israeli blockade, preventing essential goods from entering the region. The kitchens, a crucial lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, are struggling to provide meals as stockpiles diminish, and meat and fresh vegetables are unavailable. International pressure is mounting on Israel to lift the blockade, with the UN warning of potential war crimes due to the intentional starvation of civilians. The article highlights the dire situation faced by Gazans, relying on these kitchens for survival, and the urgent need for aid to avert a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

          <p>China experienced a significant surge in inbound tourism during the Labor Day holiday, with bookings jumping 141% year-on-year, attributed to relaxed visa policies and improved travel services. Domestic tourism also saw modest growth, with cross-region trips expected to increase by 8%. This travel boom is part of China's efforts to boost domestic spending amid trade tensions with the United States. However, box office sales during the holiday are expected to fall short of previous years, indicating a mixed economic picture.</p>

          <p>Roche has entered a $5.3 billion agreement with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for obesity treatment, marking Roche's entry into competition with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. The deal involves upfront payments of $1.65 billion to Zealand, with potential milestone payments reaching $5.3 billion. Petrelintide mimics a hormone that increases satiety, potentially offering better tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to existing GLP-1 drugs. The collaboration aims to develop petrelintide as a standalone treatment and in combination with Roche's incretin asset CT-388.</p>

          <p>China is showing signs of easing its ban on K-pop acts, signaling a potential boost to domestic demand and cultural exchange amid a trade war with the United States. K-pop concerts are being scheduled in mainland China for the first time since 2016, representing a "structural turning point" for the sector. K-pop is seen as a tariff-proof sector, with core revenue drivers like streaming and concerts being digital and intangible. This move also aligns with China's efforts to restore ties with neighboring countries and diversify cultural offerings.</p>
