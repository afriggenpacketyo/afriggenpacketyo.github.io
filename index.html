        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Family offices are increasingly adopting structured, long-term incentive plans to attract and retain top executive talent, leading to higher compensation packages. A report from Morgan Stanley and Botoff Consulting indicates that median total pay for CEOs at investment-focused family offices is now $825,000, with averages exceeding $3 million for firms managing over $1 billion. These incentive structures, which are becoming more formalized than previous 'handshake agreements,' often include co-investment opportunities, carried interest, and phantom equity. This trend reflects a growing need for specialized professionals to manage the complex financial strategies of wealthy families in a competitive market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, even as profits declined compared to the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company's adjusted earnings were $1.77 per share against an expected $1.70, aided by record second-quarter production output which helped mitigate the impact of the price drop. Chevron recently completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation after a favorable arbitration ruling against Exxon Mobil. The company anticipates the Hess deal will start contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter and aims to achieve $1 billion in annual cost reductions by the end of 2025.

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, significantly missing forecasts and marking a continued slowdown in the labor market. Compounding the weakness, job gains for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, indicating that hiring was much softer than previously thought. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.2%, and underlying data revealed an increase in long-term unemployment, raising concerns about the economic impact of ongoing trade tensions. This report may increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts to support the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Air quality alerts have been issued for millions of residents in multiple states, including Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan. Simultaneously, a separate weather system is bringing a significant flood threat to the southern United States. Heavy rainfall is expected in the Carolinas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Texas, following recent flash flooding that inundated parts of the Northeast corridor.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, visited a controversial aid distribution site in Gaza operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and backed by Israel and the U.S. The visit, accompanied by the Israeli military, comes amid reports of hundreds of Palestinian deaths near these sites, a figure the GHF disputes. While a U.S. ambassador praised the GHF's efforts, some Gazans criticized the visit as a 'media stunt' that ignores the severe humanitarian crisis and ongoing violence. The UN has reported that over 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while trying to access food aid, with a majority of those deaths occurring near GHF locations.</p>

The attackers impersonate well-known cryptocurrency brands like Binance and TradingView, often featuring celebrity faces like Elon Musk to appear legitimate. When users click these ads, they are directed to convincing fake websites that prompt them to download a supposed 'desktop client,' which is actually a sophisticated malware installer. The campaign uses advanced filtering to evade detection, targeting users interested in finance and technology, highlighting a significant challenge in Facebook's ad moderation.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of administering poison after eight children and one adult fell ill at a summer camp at Stathern Lodge in Leicestershire, UK. All nine individuals were hospitalized but have since been discharged. Residents described chaotic scenes as emergency services, including critical care teams and multiple ambulances, responded and set up a triage center in a nearby village hall. Leicestershire Police, which is now being investigated for its handling of the initial reports, was granted more time to question the suspect who was detained at a local pub.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have significantly improved the durability of modern artillery by refining an ancient anti-corrosion technique. Inspired by the chromium-salt treatment found on 2,000-year-old swords from the Terracotta Army, scientists developed a new coating that doubles the service life of high-pressure gun barrels. This advanced method addresses the severe erosion, microcracking, and thermal shock that degrade modern cannons, which operate under extreme temperatures and pressures. The innovation represents a modern application of a sophisticated metallurgical process first mastered by Chinese artisans over two millennia ago.</p>

The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) requires large firms to address human rights and environmental issues in their supply chains, including climate transition plans. Qatar argues the rules are overly burdensome and could expose its state-owned energy company to massive fines, potentially jeopardizing a key 2022 agreement to supply Germany with LNG starting in 2026.

          <p>U.S. stock markets experienced a significant downturn after President Trump issued an executive order imposing new tariffs on numerous countries, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling over 600 points.

This combination of trade policy uncertainty and signs of a cooling labor market interrupted a period of market resilience.

While these rates are elevated compared to previous years, they present a more affordable borrowing option than personal loans or credit cards for homeowners. Experts suggest that rates may stabilize or decline if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes, but advise borrowers to strengthen their credit profiles and shop among different lenders to secure the best possible terms.

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his public attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a 'stubborn MORON' for not cutting interest rates. In a series of posts on his social media platform, Trump urged the Federal Reserve Board to 'assume control' and implement rate cuts immediately. The president's comments came after the Fed decided to hold its benchmark rate steady this week. Trump also used the opportunity to condemn Russia's recent deadly attack in Kyiv, calling the war a 'disgrace' and confirming that his administration would proceed with sanctions against Moscow.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an ultimatum to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, demanding they provide 'binding commitments' to lower U.S. prescription drug prices to 'most favored nation' levels by September 29. The White House letters stipulate that companies must not offer better prices to other developed countries than they do in the U.S. and must provide these lower prices to all Medicaid patients. The administration warned it would use its full 'arsenal' against firms that do not comply, adding to the pressure on an industry already facing potential new tariffs and scrutiny over pricing practices.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, which is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain to the country on Monday. It is the sixth named storm of the season and the first since January. Forecasters predict wind gusts of 60-70 mph in northern coastal and hilly areas, with some exposed parts of Scotland potentially seeing gusts up to 85 mph. Due to trees being in full leaf, there is an increased risk of them being toppled, which could lead to travel disruptions and power outages. The storm system is currently developing over the Atlantic and its exact track will determine the most affected areas.</p>

          <p>At the urging of President Trump, Texas Republicans have unveiled a new congressional map designed to give their party an advantage in five additional seats, potentially increasing their hold to 30 of the state's 38 districts. The plan achieves this by redrawing districts in South Texas and major metro areas to dilute the voting power of Democrats, particularly Hispanic voters. This aggressive gerrymandering approach is being challenged by voting rights organizations, who argue that the existing map already diminishes the influence of non-white voters, who have driven the state's population growth. The new map is being proposed amid an ongoing legal battle over the current district lines.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has rebuked the new wave of U.S. tariffs, stating that 'there are no winners in tariff or trade wars.' The statement came after the Trump administration imposed new duties on 69 trading partners, with rates ranging from 10% to 41%. Under the new plan, most Asian economies will face levies between 15% and 20%, while Canada will be hit with a 35% tariff on many goods. An analyst noted that while the final rates are lower than some initial threats, they still represent a significant increase in trade barriers and create ongoing uncertainty for the global economy.</p>

          <p>Two Federal Reserve governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, have publicly explained their dissenting votes against the central bank's decision to hold interest rates steady. Both officials argued for a quarter-point rate reduction, stating that the Fed's 'wait and see' approach is overly cautious and risks harming the labor market and economic growth. They believe the inflationary impact of new tariffs will be temporary and that delaying action could cause monetary policy to 'fall behind the curve.' Their public dissent, the first by two governors since 1993, highlights a growing debate within the Fed about how to balance economic risks.</p>

          <p>The Swiss government and business leaders have reacted with shock to a new 39% U.S. tariff on Swiss goods, one of the highest rates imposed on any country in the latest trade measures. Swiss officials had been negotiating for a much lower rate, similar to the 10-15% baseline given to the EU and Japan, and expressed 'great regret' over the unilateral U.S. decision. The high tariff poses a significant threat to Switzerland's export-driven economy, with manufacturing associations warning that tens of thousands of jobs are at risk. While the pharmaceutical sector may be excluded, the move has created major uncertainty for key Swiss industries like watchmaking and electronics.</p>

With the SAVE plan repealed by Congress, experts are advising borrowers to quickly enroll in an alternative, such as the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, to manage their payments, though monthly bills under IBR will likely be higher than they were under SAVE.
