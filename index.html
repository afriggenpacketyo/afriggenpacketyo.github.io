          <p>Rob Howard, the recently elected leader of Warwickshire County Council, has resigned due to health issues, leaving his 18-year-old deputy in charge. Howard was elected in May, when Reform made unprecedented gains in the local elections, becoming the largest party in Warwickshire and forming a minority administration. He stated that the demanding role of leader is incompatible with his current health challenges. The article's tone is neutral and factual, reflecting the unexpected nature of the resignation.</p>

          <p>While Iran has the potential to disrupt the global economy by blockading the Strait of Hormuz, doing so would likely be an own goal due to the economic implications. Iran relies heavily on oil exports, particularly to China, and a blockade would harm its own revenue and upset its trading partner. Neighboring countries like Kuwait, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates also rely on the strait for oil transport. Furthermore, a blockade would likely provoke a swift military response from the US and European countries, and would only undermine remaining alliances with countries in the region.</p>

          <p>After 20 years, a search team is ending its efforts to locate Northwest Orient Flight 2501, which crashed into Lake Michigan in 1950, killing all 58 people on board.

The search, which began in 2004, uncovered nine shipwrecks but not Flight 2501, with scientists believing the plane broke up into pieces too small to be detected by side-scan sonar and likely "sunk into the muck" on the bottom.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve proposed easing a key capital rule for large Wall Street banks, a move that drew dissent from officials concerned about undermining financial safeguards. The proposal would reduce the top-tier capital big banks must hold, with the goal of encouraging them to take on more lower-risk assets like Treasurys. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the change is prudent given the increase in safe assets on bank balance sheets. However, Governors Adriana Kugler and Michael Barr opposed the move, arguing that it would primarily benefit shareholders rather than increase Treasury intermediation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Between June 6 and June 22, immigration enforcement teams arrested 1,618 immigrants for deportation in Southern California, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Demonstrations and confrontations with immigration officers have resulted in 787 arrests for assault, obstruction, and unlawful assembly. While the White House indicated that about one-third of those arrested had prior criminal convictions, data suggests that a majority had never been charged with or convicted of a crime.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Flagstar bank shares dropped following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary due to his campaign promise to freeze rent increases in stabilized units. Analysts estimate a significant portion of Flagstar's multi-family loan portfolio is exposed to New York rent regulations. While some analysts believe a short-term rent freeze would be manageable, a longer-term pause could lead the bank to raise loan loss reserves. Other real estate stocks with New York City exposure also experienced downward pressure, as Mamdani has also called for a higher corporate tax rate. (not investment advice)</p>

Bove described himself as unfairly maligned and not a "henchman," while Democrats accused him of weaponizing the Department of Justice against Trump's enemies.</p>

Pollster Frank Lutz described the win as a wake-up call for the Democratic Party, signaling a demand for a more ideological and confrontational approach to politics.</p>

The company's success is attributed to its dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) used for building large language models and running AI workloads.

His success suggests that attacking opponents as insufficiently pro-Israel is not a surefire strategy. The win also potentially elevates Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's prospects for the 2028 presidential nomination, while underscoring the challenges progressives face in appealing to diverse voter bases.</p>

          <p>President Trump ignited controversy by stating that U.S. strikes had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear sites, a claim contradicted by a preliminary U.S. intelligence analysis suggesting only a few months of setback for Tehran's nuclear program. Trump defended his description at a NATO summit, asserting that Israel is conducting its own report that will corroborate his assessment. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth supported Trump's claim, emphasizing the "devastation underneath Fordo." The conflicting reports have prompted criticism from House Democrats and raised questions about the administration's policies and the true extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities. The optimism score is based on the severity of a potential international incident. </p>
