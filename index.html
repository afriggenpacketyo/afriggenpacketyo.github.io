          <p>CBS News's annual "Money Issue" provides a comprehensive guide to retirement, addressing a range of critical topics. The program examines the stability of the Social Security system following significant staffing cuts and explores the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement, which promotes frugality for an early exit from the workforce. Additional segments cover the trend of Americans retiring overseas for a lower cost of living, the history of the 401(k), and modern retirement lifestyles, from "grandfluencers" on social media to themed communities. The collection of stories offers varied perspectives on achieving a fulfilling and financially secure post-career life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the tri-state area, including New York City and western Connecticut. The event, which occurred late Saturday night, is the second minor quake to strike the state in less than two weeks. Officials reported no immediate damage but warned residents about the potential for aftershocks in the coming days. Geologists note that earthquakes of this size are common along the region's Ramapo Fault line and rarely cause significant damage, though a stronger 4.8 magnitude quake in April 2024 did cause some disruption.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that focusing on individual high-profile sexual abuse cases, like those involving Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, obscures the larger, systemic issue of violence against women. The author, Rebecca Solnit, contends that these are not isolated incidents but part of a pervasive pattern rooted in misogyny that serves to maintain inequality. The piece points out that a sexual assault occurs in the US every 68 seconds and that this constant threat shapes the lives of all women. It calls for a shift from treating these crimes as exceptions to recognizing and addressing the underlying social structures that enable them.</p>

          <p>NBA superstar Stephen Curry, one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, revealed he does not know his exact net worth and is not concerned with the figure. Instead, Curry focuses on building a portfolio of investments he is proud of and creating a positive legacy with the resources he has been blessed with. Financial planners interviewed in the article praised this approach, suggesting that focusing on tangible goals and values over a single number like net worth can lead to greater financial well-being. They advise that tracking cash flow and aligning spending with personal goals is a more powerful indicator of financial health.</p>

The passenger was recovered safely and is expected to be okay. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after responding to initial reports of the animal in the bay. Due to tidal conditions, the whale's carcass will remain on a shallow sandbar until Monday, when crews can tow it to a nearby park for a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death.

          <p>In a prison interview marking 40 years since his arrest, convicted serial killer David Berkowitz discussed the 1976-77 shooting spree that terrorized New York City. Berkowitz, who is serving six life sentences, claimed he was serving a demonic entity at the time and expressed regret for his actions, which killed six people and wounded seven. He described his childhood struggles with depression and feeling isolated after returning from the army. Now a born-again Christian, Berkowitz stated he works to warn young people away from Satanism, though survivors and investigators remain unforgiving of his heinous crimes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is facing criticism from environmental groups after declining to reappoint a clean energy advocate to the state's public utilities commission and instead selecting an appointee seen as an industry ally. Campaigners allege the move was influenced by utility giant DTE Energy, which was reportedly unhappy with former board member Alessandra Carreon's positions on clean energy and rate increases. The new appointee, Shaquila Myers, previously worked for a state legislative leader viewed as friendly to corporate interests. Critics fear the decision could slow Michigan's energy transition and lead to higher costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>In a powerful op-ed, a senior UN humanitarian aid coordinator details the devastating conditions in Gaza, arguing that the suffering is the result of deliberate political choices and obstruction by Israeli authorities. The official recounts witnessing starvation, a crumbling health system, and civilians being killed while trying to access food convoys, which are systematically delayed and obstructed. After speaking out, the author's visa was not renewed, a move described as part of a broader pattern to silence humanitarian voices. The article is a plea for the enforcement of international law to end the engineered scarcity and suffering of Gaza's population.</p>

          <p>Engineers at China's Zhejiang University have developed the "Darwin Monkey," the world's first brain-like computer composed of over 2 billion artificial neurons. This advanced computing system is built on 960 domestically produced Darwin 3 brain-inspired chips, creating a network of more than 100 billion synapses. The university announced that the system has already been successfully used for complex tasks such as content generation, logical reasoning, and mathematics. This achievement marks a significant step toward developing more advanced, brain-like artificial intelligence and showcases China's progress in cutting-edge computing hardware.</p>

          <p>At a time when major global powers like the United States and the UK are cutting their foreign aid budgets, Spain is leading a small group of countries in the opposite direction. Spain has passed a law to more than double its aid budget by 2030, aiming to reinvest in global development, climate resilience, and human rights. This move, along with similar pledges from Ireland, South Korea, and Italy, comes as the world faces a projected $56 billion funding vacuum for critical programs. The shift could signal a new, more collaborative future for foreign aid, potentially less dominated by a few wealthy nations.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler is receiving praise for his cameo in the new film "Happy Gilmore 2," where his comedic timing and self-effacing humor are seen as a gift to his public image and the sport. While Scheffler's dominance on the course is undisputed, his robotic efficiency can sometimes lack drama for viewers. The article argues that his fun, roll-with-the-punches persona in the movie, which playfully references his real-life arrest earlier this year, helps to humanize him beyond his on-course stoicism. This portrayal could make the often-unbeatable champion more engaging for a wider audience.</p>

          <p>Dan Ardell, who had a brief but memorable stint with the Los Angeles Angels in 1961, looks back on a baseball career he never truly desired. Known for being the only player whose sole major league hit resulted in a walk-off loss, Ardell retired at 23, finding professional baseball boring. He went on to have a successful career in real estate and found a new mission to make a positive difference in the lives of others through philanthropy. Ardell's story is one of finding true passion and purpose outside of the spotlight, a journey he came to fully appreciate later in life.</p>

          <p>The Czech Republic has amended its criminal code to criminalize the promotion of communist ideology, placing it on the same legal footing as Nazi propaganda. The law, signed by President Petr Pavel in late July, makes it illegal to support or promote movements aimed at suppressing human rights and freedoms. The move was praised by anti-communist advocates but has been condemned by the country's Communist Party (KSCM) as a political attack by the current government. The new legislation could potentially lead to a ban on the KSCM, which currently holds a seat in the European Parliament.</p>
