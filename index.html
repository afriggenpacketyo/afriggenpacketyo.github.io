          <p>President Trump has requested that Harvard University provide the identities of its international students. Trump also threatened new tariffs against Apple and suggested a 50% tariff rate for the European Union starting next month. He told West Point graduates that his foreign policy would prioritize peace and partnership opportunities. Hundreds of investors in Trump's cryptocurrency meme coin attended a dinner with the president, drawing criticism for potential pay-for-play implications. The House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" to fund Trump's domestic agenda, which now goes to the Senate.</p>

          <p>President Zelensky stated that the United States' "silence" following recent Russian attacks is emboldening President Putin, after Moscow launched its largest aerial assault yet. The overnight attack involved 367 drones and missiles, the highest number in a single night since the full-scale invasion in 2022, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including three children, and numerous injuries across Ukraine. Zelensky emphasized that Russia's "brutality cannot be stopped" without stronger international pressure.

          <p>Following the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea is seeking a more balanced foreign policy approach. Society remains divided, and the ruling People Power Party (PPP) has struggled to find a stable presidential candidate. Opposition Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung is leading in polls, having shifted towards the center to appeal to undecided conservative voters. While economic concerns are paramount, foreign policy demands equal attention due to South Korea's geopolitical position.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a complaint with the referees' body PGMOL following a perceived "big mistake" by referee Thomas Bramall during their 2-0 loss to Manchester United, which impacted their Champions League qualification hopes. Villa thought they had taken the lead when Morgan Rogers scored, but Bramall blew the whistle for a foul, incorrectly believing the United goalkeeper had two hands on the ball. The VAR could not intervene because the play was stopped before the ball entered the net. Villa's director of football operations expressed dissatisfaction with the selection of an inexperienced referee for such a crucial game.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert has developed a new framework called "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes a child's emotional needs and focuses on building emotional resilience, trust, and connection. This approach emphasizes accepting a child's emotions without rushing to fix them, responding without shaming, and viewing "bad" behavior as stress signals. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, do internal work to become less reactive, and create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves. The method involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame.</p>

          <p>Following agreements between the Trump administration and several elite law firms to provide pro bono legal work, Trump allies are now requesting these firms to fulfill their commitments. Veterans and conservative groups are seeking free legal assistance on various issues, leading to a surge in requests to firms like Skadden, Kirkland & Ellis, and Paul Weiss. The firms are navigating uncharted territory, trying to honor their commitments while maintaining autonomy and addressing concerns from their staff. This situation has raised questions about the definition of pro bono services and the extent to which law firms can balance their obligations.</p>

          <p>Federal officials arrested Joseph Neumayer, a dual US and German citizen, for allegedly attempting to firebomb the US embassy branch office in Tel Aviv.

          <p>Iran summoned France's envoy to protest against "insulting" remarks made by the French foreign minister after Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. The French foreign minister's congratulatory message was described as "irresponsible and provocative" and a "blatant interference" in Iran's internal affairs. The Iranian spokesperson added that France had "no moral authority at all" to comment on Iran, citing France's failure to support Palestinians in Gaza.

It is known that Kevin de Bruyne played his final game against the Cottagers, bringing to an end a trophy-laden decade at the club.

One player they won't be moving for - at this stage - is Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz owning to the cost of doing a deal, but Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White remains of interest while AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders has been heavily linked, external with a move to Etihad Stadium.</p>
