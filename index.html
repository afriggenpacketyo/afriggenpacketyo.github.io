          <p>The Royal Navy's flagship, HMS Prince of Wales, has set sail from Portsmouth for an eight-month deployment, leading a multinational fleet of warships to 40 countries across the Mediterranean, Middle East, Southeast Asia, Japan, and Australia. The deployment, dubbed Operation Highmast, will involve exercises demonstrating the UK's ability to operate fast jets at sea, including up to 24 F-35B stealth jets, and carry out large-scale military operations. The carrier strike group includes warships from Norway, Canada, and other NATO members, with approximately 2,500 personnel from the Royal Navy, 600 from the RAF, and 900 from the British Army participating in the exercises. The mission's agility allows for changes to address fast-moving world events and ongoing conflicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund has sharply reduced its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.7%, attributing the revision to the negative impact of tariffs implemented by President Trump. These tariffs have triggered retaliatory measures from other trading partners, posing a significant headwind to both the U.S. and global economies. The IMF also lowered its global growth forecast to 2.8%. The IMF now estimates the odds of a U.S. recession at 40%, up from 25% in October 2024. The report also revised inflation expectations higher for advanced economies, including the U.S., due to persistent price dynamics and the supply shock from the tariffs.</p>

          <p>At least five people have been killed after gunmen opened fire on a group of domestic tourists visiting Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attack occurred in Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow near Pahalgam. Indian troops have been deployed to the scene, and a search is underway for the perpetrators. The area has been cordoned off. While no group has claimed responsibility, the incident marks a significant escalation in violence against civilians in recent years in the Muslim-majority region, which has experienced a long-running insurgency.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reclaimed the $90,000 level, reaching its highest point since March, as investors seek refuge in cryptocurrency amid stock market volatility and a weakening dollar. This surge coincides with President Trump's increased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin saw significant inflows, indicating renewed investor confidence in the digital asset. Bitcoin's decoupling from traditional risk assets suggests it is being viewed as an alternative investment during economic uncertainty, although analysts note that the recent strength has been accompanied by light trading volumes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Margaret Sullivan argues that President Trump's attacks on National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) are part of a broader strategy to undermine the reality-based press and consolidate control over the political narrative. Trump's administration is reportedly drafting a memo to eliminate federal funding for public media, which would disproportionately impact small, local member stations. Sullivan contends that public funding is essential for maintaining a fact-based news ecosystem, especially as media companies are increasingly owned by large corporations with their own agendas, and that Congress should continue to provide funding to NPR and PBS.</p>

The plan focuses on enhancing the functionality of the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) as an alternative to SWIFT and expanding its global network, reducing China's reliance on the U.S. dollar-based financial system.</p>

Burnley's chief finance officer notes that the average wages of promoted clubs are significantly lower than top clubs, making it difficult to compete. To survive, promoted teams must focus on grinding out results and finding ways to outsmart the opposition due to limited financial resources.</p>

The asteroid, located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is larger than anticipated, measuring about 5 miles long and 2 miles wide. Data collected during the flyby will help scientists clarify the asteroid's shape and geology. The Lucy mission, launched in 2021, aims to study the Trojan asteroids near Jupiter, with eight Trojan flybys planned through 2033.</p>

          <p>Joseph Mallord William Turner, born in London in 1775, is celebrated as one of the greatest Romantic painters, known for his mastery of light, color, and atmosphere. Turner's artistic style evolved during his travels, particularly in Venice, where he created increasingly blurred and mystical landscapes. His unconventional and almost abstract style, initially criticized, inspired later Impressionists and is now considered a forerunner of modern art. Turner's paintings also depicted contemporary events and technological achievements, such as locomotives and steamships, which was unusual for the Romantic era.</p>
