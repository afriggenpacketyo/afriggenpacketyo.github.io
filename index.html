          <p>Peru's Congress has voted to remove President Dina Boluarte from office, citing her government's inability to curb crime and her perceived "moral incapacity" to lead. The decision followed an overwhelming 124-vote against her after she did not appear before lawmakers to defend her position. This action underscores the deep political instability and public dissatisfaction prevalent in Peru, marking a critical juncture in its governance. Congress leader Jose Jeri, who announced the impeachment, could potentially assume the interim presidency until new elections in April 2026. This article highlights the country's turbulent political landscape, where leadership changes often occur amidst public unrest and calls for accountability. The move is a significant response to persistent societal issues and a deeply unpopular administration.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings predicts China's real estate market will experience a much steeper decline in 2025 than previously anticipated, extending its slump for a fifth consecutive year. New home sales are now projected to drop by 8% from last year, a significant revision from May's 3% forecast. This weaker outlook is primarily attributed to fragile homebuyer sentiment, despite Beijing's ongoing efforts to stabilize the sector, including limited policy easing. The article notes that the property market has effectively halved in just four years, from 18.2 trillion yuan in 2021, with a turnaround remaining elusive. Continued government support is deemed necessary to restore confidence and prevent further contraction. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hargreaves Lansdowne, the UK's largest retail investment platform, has issued a strong warning to investors regarding Bitcoin, stating it is not a viable asset class for portfolios. This caution comes despite the recent lifting of a UK ban on retail investors accessing crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which allow exposure to digital tokens via regulated exchanges. The platform argues that cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic value and make performance assumptions impossible to analyze, advising against their inclusion for growth or income goals. This stance contrasts with some market watchers who consider Bitcoin "digital gold" or a hedge against traditional asset volatility, fueling an ongoing debate about its place in investment strategies.

          <p>Ferrari's stock experienced its worst trading day ever after the luxury carmaker updated its full-year and 2030 guidance, which fell short of analyst expectations. The company also significantly scaled back its electrification ambitions, now targeting a 2030 lineup of 40% internal combustion engine, 40% hybrid, and only 20% fully electric vehicles, a reduction from a prior 40% EV goal. This strategic pivot is attributed to a client-centric approach and the current evolving market environment, mirroring trends seen with other carmakers. Despite the substantial stock drop, some analysts, like those at JPMorgan, remain bullish on Ferrari's long-term plan, citing strong demand and effective leadership.</p>

          <p>The American trucking industry is urging lawmakers to pass the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act (CORCA) as online cargo theft has surged by 1,500% in the past four years. This modern form of theft, often orchestrated by transnational organizations from Eastern Europe, targets expensive freight and costs the industry an estimated $19 million daily. The lack of mandatory reporting and a dedicated federal law enforcement agency exacerbates the problem, leading to increased insurance rates and higher prices for consumers. Industry leaders testified to Congress, emphasizing the urgent need for a unified framework and a national cargo theft database to combat these sophisticated criminal rings.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has defended his "golden generation" teammates against Steven Gerrard's recent comments, which controversially labeled them "egotistical losers" who "weren't a team." Speaking on his BBC podcast, Rooney argued that his squad worked hard and simply "didn't quite manage to get over the line" in major tournaments, despite having immense talent. He acknowledged the historical difficulty of fostering close relationships between rival club players, particularly from Liverpool and Manchester United, but insisted everyone fought for each other on the pitch. Rooney also suggested current England squads benefit from a different generational dynamic and improved media relations, creating a more positive public perception.</p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has declared his party ready to replace Welsh Labour at the next Senedd election, promising "new energy and new ideas" for the nation. Labour has dominated Welsh politics since devolution began in 1999, but recent opinion polling suggests Plaid is now vying for leadership alongside Reform UK. Ap Iorwerth aims to position Plaid Cymru as the leading anti-Reform party and a government-in-waiting, even if it means potential coalition with other parties, as no single party has ever won a Senedd majority. The article notes Plaid's strategy to appeal beyond its traditional Welsh-speaking heartlands with "radical" policies like a payment to tackle child poverty.</p>

          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has threatened to fire air traffic controllers who are calling in sick during the ongoing government shutdown, labeling them "problem children." Duffy claimed these absent employees are responsible for over half of the country's flight delays as the government remains unfunded. He praised controllers who continue to work, stating that only about 10% are "lashing out" by not reporting for duty. The article highlights that air traffic controllers are considered "essential workers" and are required to work without pay, and Duffy warned that those not showing up would not receive backpay, despite the president suggesting some federal workers might not get retroactive pay. This situation underscores the growing consequences of the prolonged shutdown on essential services and federal employees.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dramatic 2-1 walk-off victory against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 of the National League Division Series, advancing to the NL Championship Series. The decisive moment came in the 11th inning when Phillies pitcher Orion Kerkering fumbled a grounder and made an inexplicable throwing error home, allowing pinch-runner Hyeseong Kim to score the winning run. This "instant classic" win, marked by strong pitching from Tyler Glasnow and an "all-time" relief appearance from rookie Roki Sasaki, spared the Dodgers a decisive Game 5 in Philadelphia.

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, is expected to launch her campaign for Senate next week, aiming to unseat longtime Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, who is term-limited as governor, drew national attention earlier this year for verbally confronting President Trump over his administration's push to block transgender girls and women from competing in female sports. Her entry into the race is a significant development for Democrats, who view this contest as a rare opportunity to flip a GOP-held seat and challenge the Senate's 53-47 Republican majority. The article notes Mills will join an expanding primary field, including progressive Graham Platner, in a state that has shown a Democratic lean in recent presidential elections.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's victory in Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race marks a symbolic ideological shift, positioning her as Japan's first female prime minister-in-waiting. Her ascent signals a potential end to the centrist pragmatism of previous administrations, favoring a nationalist twist on Abenomics that blends fiscal expansionism with protectionist undertones. Takaichi's vision emphasizes state-led industrial revival and strategic investment in defense and technology, aiming to reduce reliance on China and reinforce security autonomy. The article suggests this approach could deepen Japan's "friendshoring" strategy in Southeast Asia, redirecting investment, but may also lead to more demanding economic engagement tied to geopolitical alignment, potentially alienating neutral countries.</p>

Additionally, the legislation increases oversight by requiring Assembly Speaker and Senate Rules Committee representatives to serve as non-voting members on the plan's governing committee.
