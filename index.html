          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators urges the U.S. to cease funding the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and resume support for UN-led aid. They cite grave concerns over GHF's distribution methods, including the use of armed contractors, which have reportedly caused over 1,000 deaths near its sites. The senators also question if GHF funding bypassed required audits, stressing the dire humanitarian crisis and need for safe aid. This article highlights political pressure on U.S. Gaza policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that Donald Trump's core economic drive, termed "egonomics," is rooted in insatiable avarice and a unique approach to dealmaking, rather than traditional market principles. It argues that Trump views deals as personal, adversarial, and incomplete stages to boost his brand and wealth, regardless of their success or market efficiency. The analysis draws parallels to non-monetary prestige systems like the Trobriand Islands' kula system, but ultimately concludes Trump's singular focus is on accumulating money, exemplified by his crypto ventures.</p>
