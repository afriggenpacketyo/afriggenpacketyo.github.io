            <h2>China's Exports Surge Amid Trade War Concerns</h2>

            <p>China experienced a significant surge in exports, exceeding expectations with a 12.4% jump in March, driven by businesses accelerating shipments to avoid anticipated U.S. tariffs as the trade war intensifies. However, imports declined by 4.3%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand, despite recovering from a sharper drop in February. The Chinese leadership faces challenges in achieving its ambitious 5% annual growth target due to escalating trade tensions and weak consumer spending. Despite these challenges, China has vowed to implement countermeasures against the U.S. while continuing to open its economy for mutually beneficial trade with other nations.</p>

Governor Shapiro, who is Jewish, addressed the incident, stating that the attack was targeted but he would not be deterred from celebrating his faith or performing his duties.

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant to prevent its closure, sparking a race against time to secure essential raw materials and keep the blast furnaces operational. Ministers accused the plant's Chinese owner, Jingye, of selling off existing materials and not buying more, leading to fears of sabotage and increased reliance on Chinese imports. The government's intervention aims to protect jobs and ensure the UK's ability to produce virgin steel, deemed critical for economic security. Rival businesses are offering support, but challenges remain in securing the necessary materials and maintaining the plant's operations.</p>

            <p>South Africa is reopening the inquest into the 1967 death of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Albert Luthuli, who was the leader of the then-banned African National Congress (ANC). The initial inquiry ruled his death, caused by being struck by a train, was accidental, but activists and Luthuli's family have long suspected foul play by the apartheid regime. The National Prosecuting Authority will present evidence to overturn the original findings. This reopening occurs alongside another inquest into the death of anti-apartheid lawyer Mlungisi Griffiths Mxenge, highlighting ongoing efforts to address unresolved cases from the apartheid era.</p>

            <p>Singapore's central bank eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time in response to a lower-than-expected GDP growth of 3.8% for the first quarter. The Monetary Authority of Singapore reduced the rate of appreciation of its policy band, the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER). The Ministry of Trade and Industry also downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, citing declines in manufacturing and some service sectors. The ministry noted that the U.S. tariffs and the U.S.-China trade war would likely deteriorate the growth outlook for both countries.</p>

            <p>Washington's decision to exempt some electronic devices from its 125% tariffs has created uncertainty for Chinese suppliers. While it offers some relief for firms serving major U.S. multinationals, many smaller companies will not be covered. The Trump administration's warning of new 'sectoral tariffs' targeting the industry has further complicated the situation. Many Chinese businesses are frustrated as they navigate policy changes from across the Pacific. China supplied over 70 per cent of the PC monitors and smartphones, and 66 per cent of the laptops imported into the US in 2024.</p>

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio warned of a potential recession due to Trump's trade policies. Peter Navarro, a trade advisor, downplayed Elon Musk's criticism of Trump's tariff proposals.

            <p>President Trump warned that exemptions on smartphones and electronics from import tariffs on China would be short-lived, promising future tariffs. Trump said the products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs and are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket’. The White House had announced the exclusion of some electronic products from steep reciprocal tariffs on China. Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said that critical technology products from China would face separate new duties along with semiconductors within the next two months.</p>

            <p>Recent volatility in the bond market has prompted investors to seek strategies for generating stable income while mitigating risk. One approach is the bond ladder, which involves investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity for regular income. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offers this strategy in an ETF format, investing in treasuries with maturities up to 10 years and distributing monthly income. While ultrashort fixed-income bond ETFs have gained popularity, bond ladders can provide a broader goal of protecting buying power and immunizing against liabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

While President Trump has expressed interest in acquiring Greenland for its untapped natural resources, geologist Minik Rosing argues that assumptions about getting rich quickly are unrealistic. Rosing says there is no special concentration of minerals in Greenland, and that the U.S. already has many untapped rare earths and minerals. He argues that the focus should be on developing facilities for processing raw materials and fostering a competitive market.</p>
