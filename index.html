        <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in Britain has warned all 1,400 McDonald's branches about potential legal action if they fail to adequately protect staff from sexual abuse.  This follows a BBC investigation revealing claims of a toxic work environment with widespread sexual assault and harassment. McDonald's maintains its commitment to a safe workplace, while the EHRC outlines steps restaurants must take to prevent future incidents, including risk assessments and effective complaint procedures.  Non-compliance could result in significant fines.</p>

        <h2>Putin's Ceasefire Proposal: Genuine Peace or Tactical Maneuver?</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-14 05:29:40 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>Vladimir Putin has stated Russia's willingness to halt fighting in Ukraine, but his conditions—including a halt to Western arms supplies and the demilitarization of Ukraine—are viewed as unacceptable by Kyiv and its allies.  Analysts question whether Putin's proposal is a genuine attempt at peace or a tactic to consolidate Russia's gains and regroup its forces. Putin's statements suggest he believes Russia currently holds a strong military position.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s claims about treating measles with vitamin A and cod liver oil, and linking severe cases to poor diet, are contradicted by scientific evidence.  Experts emphasize that while vitamin A supplementation is recommended for measles patients with deficiencies, it's not a treatment for the virus itself. They also stress the importance of vaccination and debunk claims about the MMR vaccine's safety and efficacy.</p>
