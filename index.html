          <p>Senator Mark Warner of Virginia has denounced the Trump administration for what he termed an "outrageous" pressure campaign that led to the resignation of University of Virginia President Jim Ryan. According to Warner, Ryan was explicitly threatened with major funding cuts to the university if he did not resign by a specific deadline, a move linked to a federal probe into the school's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Warner characterized the action as political extortion that damages a flagship public university and sets a dangerous precedent for academic freedom across the country. He warned that if such pressure can be applied to UVA, it could happen at any public university.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Mavericks have selected 18-year-old forward Cooper Flagg with the number one overall pick in the NBA Draft, making him the new cornerstone of the franchise. Flagg, a standout from Duke University, was the consensus college player of the year and is expected to make an immediate impact. He joins a talented Mavericks roster that includes Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, who recently signed a new contract with the team. The selection of Flagg is seen as a pivotal moment for the Mavericks, helping the organization move forward after the surprising trade of Luka Donƒçiƒá earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Brazil's former President, Jair Bolsonaro, held a rally in S√£o Paulo to protest his ongoing trial before the Supreme Court on charges of conspiring to stage a coup. Bolsonaro, who denies the allegations, is accused of plotting to overturn the 2022 election results, with the plot reportedly including plans to assassinate political rivals. Addressing thousands of supporters, he framed the demonstration as a fight for "freedom and justice," despite being barred from running for office until 2030 for separate abuses of power. If convicted in the coup trial, he could face a lengthy prison sentence.</p>

          <p>A report from the eastern German city of Dessau highlights a troubling trend of rising right-wing extremism and racism among young people, where Nazi slogans and glorification of Hitler have become "cool." This phenomenon is part of a broader radicalization of youth across the region, linked to economic decline and a sense of disenfranchisement since German reunification. The situation is further complicated by the local political landscape, where the far-right AfD party has gained significant power, with Dessau's mayor having a past in a banned neo-Nazi youth group. Despite these challenges, local civic groups and some young people are actively working to counter the spread of hate.</p>

Health Secretary RFK Jr. has publicly described these oils as "poison," a claim that has gained traction among some online wellness communities. However, many nutrition researchers and scientists maintain that the available evidence does not support these strong condemnations. They argue that when consumed as part of a balanced diet, these oils, which are high in polyunsaturated fats, can be part of a healthy lifestyle, challenging the narrative that they are inherently toxic.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic cautions against making hasty judgments about the effectiveness of the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, drawing parallels to historical "battle damage assessments." The article argues that while initial reports and political statements may vary, a true assessment takes time and considers factors beyond physical destruction, such as functional and indirect effects. It suggests that despite conflicting preliminary reports, the cumulative impact of the campaign was likely severe, targeting the entire nuclear ecosystem. The author posits that the use of advanced munitions and platforms against well-known targets likely resulted in significant, lasting damage to Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the Senate's version of President Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" could increase the national debt by nearly $3.3 trillion. The report also estimates the legislation would lead to significant cuts in healthcare, potentially affecting nearly 12 million Americans through a $1 trillion reduction in funding for programs like Medicaid. These figures are complicating Republican efforts to pass the bill, as some lawmakers have expressed concern over its fiscal impact and healthcare provisions. Democrats have strongly criticized the bill, framing it as a plan that provides tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of essential services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NBA free agent Malik Beasley is the subject of a federal investigation by the U.S. district attorney's office concerning allegations of gambling on league games. The probe is reportedly related to the 2023-24 season when Beasley played for the Milwaukee Bucks. The NBA has confirmed it is cooperating with the investigation, which comes just over a year after the league issued a lifetime ban to another player, Jontay Porter, for a similar betting scandal. Beasley's attorney has stated that no charges have been filed and urged the public to reserve judgment during the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Two tropical storms, Barry and Flossie, formed simultaneously on Sunday, threatening both of Mexico's coastlines with heavy rainfall. Tropical Storm Barry developed in the Atlantic and is forecast to make landfall in southeastern Mexico, bringing three to six inches of rain and a risk of flooding to several states. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Flossie formed in the Pacific off Mexico's southwest coast. While Flossie is expected to strengthen into a hurricane, it is projected to remain offshore, though it will still bring significant rainfall to coastal regions through the beginning of the week.</p>

          <p>According to a Washington Post report citing U.S. intelligence sources, intercepted communications from Iranian officials indicate they are downplaying the severity of the damage from recent U.S. military strikes on their nuclear program. While President Trump has claimed the facilities were "obliterated," these internal Iranian discussions suggest a less catastrophic outcome, though the reliability of these communications is questioned by some officials. The report adds to the conflicting narratives about the true impact of the attack, with a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency assessment also suggesting a more limited setback for Iran. The White House has dismissed the report, insisting the Iranian nuclear weapons program is "over."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent overhaul of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has drawn sharp criticism from leading medical organizations. Health Secretary RFK Jr. dismissed numerous members of the scientific panel, replacing them with appointees who critics, including Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, say lack relevant experience and may hold biases against certain vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics stated that federal immunization policy is "no longer a credible process" due to politicization. Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb also expressed concern that the new panel's decisions could restrict public access to life-saving vaccines.</p>

He expressed concern over the whereabouts of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, as his inspectors currently have no access to the sites.

The article contends that despite years of warnings, the U.S. has failed to create a coherent strategy to build an independent supply chain, leaving it exposed to Chinese leverage.
