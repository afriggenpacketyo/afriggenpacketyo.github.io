          <p>Despite ongoing prisoner exchange negotiations, Russia launched a large-scale assault on Ukraine, deploying missiles and drones across the country. Ukraine's air force reported that it neutralized numerous missiles and drones, but strikes still affected 22 locations, causing damage to residential buildings and resulting in casualties. The attacks occurred even as both sides were engaged in a prisoner exchange involving approximately 1,000 troops, the largest since the conflict began.

          <p>Sir Alan Bates, a former subpostmaster and advocate for victims of the Post Office scandal, asserts that the government's compensation offer is less than half of his claim. He accuses ministers of employing "quasi-kangaroo courts" and altering judgment criteria, criticizing the promises of a "non-legalistic" compensation process as "worthless." The scandal involved over 900 subpostmasters wrongly prosecuted due to the faulty Horizon IT system. A Department for Business and Trade spokesman stated that the government aims to give postmasters the benefit of the doubt, offering a review panel for those dissatisfied with their offers.</p>

          <p>Following the detection of West Nile virus fragments in UK mosquitoes, a Nottingham virologist urges the public to remain calm, emphasizing that the risk to humans is currently low. Professor Jonathan Ball notes that while mosquito-borne diseases are likely to increase due to climate change, the public need not be overly concerned. He highlights that most infected individuals show no symptoms, and severe disease is rare, with no locally acquired human cases reported in the UK to date. Surveillance projects are planned to monitor mosquito activity, and the best preventative measure is to avoid mosquito bites through protective clothing and insecticides.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee, a California bank manager, and her daughter Breea were kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank in 2000 after being threatened with fake dynamite.

The defense focused on her past as a stripper and financial difficulties to undermine her credibility, even falsely accusing her of being involved in the plot.

Unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing staffing, while the opposition Conservatives are demanding that Labour fulfill its promises. The Transport Secretary described the nationalisation as a "real watershed moment," though the first service under public ownership was a rail replacement bus due to engineering work.</p>
