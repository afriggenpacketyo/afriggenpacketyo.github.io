          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native facing human trafficking charges, have petitioned a Tennessee court to issue a gag order against the Trump administration. The filing argues that numerous officials, including President Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, have made "highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements" that jeopardize his right to a fair trial. The attorneys state that previous court orders have been ineffective, and continued public vilification by the government could irreparably taint any potential jury pool. Abrego Garcia, who denies allegations of being an MS-13 gang member, was previously deported despite a court order barring it.</p>

          <p>The White House has appointed Jim O’Neill, a biotech investor and top aide to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His appointment follows the controversial firing of Dr. Susan Monarez and is expected to advance Kennedy's agenda of reshaping federal vaccine policies. O'Neill, who has no formal medical or infectious disease training, previously worked for conservative tech investor Peter Thiel and has supported unproven COVID-19 treatments. The leadership change has sparked criticism from public health experts and politicians, who express concern over the agency's direction and scientific integrity.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed the media to explain the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating it gives the team a "chance to be a better team." Jones emphasized that acquiring Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark helps address the team's long-standing weakness in stopping the run. He also highlighted the acquisition of two future first-round draft picks as valuable assets for building long-term strength. Jones confirmed he made Parsons a record-setting contract offer in April but asserted the final decision to trade was a consensus among the front office and coaching staff.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, is still in a protracted battle with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for rebuilding funds. Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich states that FEMA owes the city $34 million to complete critical upgrades to its sewage and stormwater systems, a project planned 20 years ago. The agency has denied requests for increased funding to cover rising costs, creating a stalemate that prevents the final phase of work from beginning.

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether the prestigious Hundred Acre winery in Napa Valley played a role in starting the nearly 7,000-acre Pickett fire. A spokesperson for the winery confirmed they are cooperating with the investigation, which reportedly focuses on the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard sparked the blaze. The fire began on August 21 at an address associated with the Hundred Acre property and has threatened hundreds of buildings and wineries in the Calistoga area. While the fire's growth has stalled, it remains 33% contained, with crews working in difficult terrain to establish control lines.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its long-standing "customer of size" policy, which previously guaranteed a refund for an extra seat purchased by plus-size travelers. Effective January 27, a refund will only be issued if the flight departs with at least one open seat, a shift that advocates say will create financial burdens and anxiety for travelers. The airline's former policy was praised for promoting accessibility and dignity, easing the stress many plus-size passengers face. This change, part of a broader policy update ahead of the airline's transition to assigned seating, has been described as "heartbreaking" by community advocates.</p>

The investigation identified that two staircases were hit almost simultaneously, followed by a rapid "double-tap" strike nine minutes later on an area where first responders and journalists had gathered. The attack, which killed at least 20 people including five journalists, has drawn international condemnation. Munitions experts suggest the rapid succession of the final two strikes indicates the involvement of at least two tanks.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's 425th Assault Regiment Skala has announced it is now equipped with M-1 Abrams tanks, making it the second Ukrainian unit to operate the U.S.-designed armored vehicles. This new deployment is believed to consist of tanks donated by Australia, which began arriving in July and feature modifications such as diesel-configured engines to simplify logistics. The unit is currently engaged in intense fighting in the Pokrovsk region of eastern Ukraine. The arrival of these tanks provides a boost to Kyiv's armored capabilities, though the effectiveness of tanks has been challenged by the prevalence of drones on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged a former Department of Justice employee with a misdemeanor for allegedly throwing a "Subway" sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer in Washington, D.C. The charge was reduced after a grand jury declined to indict Sean Charles Dunn on a more serious felony assault charge. The incident occurred in August when federal officers were deployed to the capital by President Trump to address what he claimed was a crime problem. This marks the second recent case where the D.C. U.S. Attorney's office has failed to secure a grand jury indictment for alleged assaults on federal law enforcement.</p>

In an interview, he stated that the city's future success hinges on the speed at which its regulators act to embrace Web3 technologies and expand their framework. Zhao suggested an immediate improvement would be to allow licensed exchanges to trade a wider range of cryptocurrencies beyond the current four permitted tokens. He praised the Hong Kong government for showing a clear intention to support the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 40 Rohingya refugees allege that Indian authorities forcibly deported them to Myanmar by abandoning them in the Andaman Sea. Testimonies gathered by the BBC describe how they were taken from Delhi, flown to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and put on a naval vessel where their hands were bound. They claim they were then forced onto smaller boats, taken out to sea, given life jackets, and told to jump into the water, eventually making their way to shore in war-torn Myanmar. The UN's special rapporteur says there is "significant evidence" supporting these claims, which put the refugees' lives at extreme risk.</p>

          <p>An angler in Lake Huron discovered an unusually large grass carp, an invasive species that poses a significant threat to the Great Lakes ecosystem. The sterile female fish measured over 1.2 meters long and weighed 26 kilograms, one of the largest specimens ever processed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO). Grass carp are highly destructive due to their voracious appetite for aquatic vegetation, which can destroy fish habitats and degrade water quality. The DFO is conducting early detection surveys and has urged the public to report any sightings of the invasive fish immediately.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of 8,000 Americans has found that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is more likely to dissuade potential buyers than attract them. The report revealed that 35% of consumers were less likely to purchase a Tesla because of FSD, while only 14% said it made them more likely to buy one. The findings present a challenge for Tesla, which has positioned the technology as a key advantage amid a sales slump and increasing competition. The survey also indicated strong public support for stricter regulation of autonomous vehicle technology and a decline in Tesla's overall brand reputation for safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire Voice of America (VOA) Director Michael Abramowitz without the approval of a congressionally mandated advisory panel. The ruling states that Lake's attempt to remove Abramowitz violates the law designed to insulate the international broadcaster from political pressure. Because President Trump has not filled the vacant seats on the advisory board, Lake lacks the legal authority to proceed with the termination. The judge's decision is a significant development in the ongoing legal battle over Lake's efforts to drastically reduce the operations and workforce of VOA.</p>
