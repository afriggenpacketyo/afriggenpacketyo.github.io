          <p>A knife attack at the central train station in Hamburg, Germany, resulted in injuries to at least seventeen people. Police arrested a 39-year-old German woman at the scene, believing she acted alone and may have been in a state of mental distress. The attack occurred on a crowded platform, causing chaos as the attacker randomly stabbed travelers. The incident prompted condolences from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who offered federal assistance, while authorities continue to investigate the motive behind the attack.</p>

          <p>Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security moved to block current and future international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accuses the administration of a ‚Äúcampaign of retribution‚Äù for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights. Harvard argues that the administration's actions would destabilize the school and erase a quarter of its student body, who contribute significantly to the university and its mission. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the federal edict, agreeing that its implementation would cause ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable injury‚Äù to the university.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached the building on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at a Washington airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna setup during control tower construction. Federal air traffic controllers also had difficulty pinpointing the helicopter's location, leading to the aborted landings. The Army has paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon to address safety concerns after the incident, which added to unease following a deadly midair collision in January.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Jenner & Block is unconstitutional, blocking the administration from enforcing it. The judge found that the order infringed on the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The order, which instructed officials to review and revoke security clearances and terminate government contracts with the firm, was seen as retaliation for Jenner & Block's legal challenges against Trump's executive orders. The judge described parts of the order as a "screed" reflecting animosity towards the firm.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed a "partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, reversing his previous opposition to the Japanese firm's acquisition bid. While not fully endorsing the takeover, Trump announced a deal where U.S. Steel would remain in the U.S., with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The arrangement is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Trump's stance marks a significant shift from his earlier vehement opposition to the transaction.</p>

          <p>A new study projects that climate change-related extreme weather could lead to a significant increase in foreclosures across the U.S., potentially soaring by 380% over the next 10 years. Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable, with climate-driven events accounting for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035. The study estimates that lenders will lose billions annually due to mortgage defaults, highlighting the "hidden risks" of climate change. Rising insurance premiums and the lack of climate risk integration into loan assessments are contributing factors.</p>
