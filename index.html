          <p>Shares of Texas Instruments experienced a significant 12% drop after the company issued a cautious outlook for its third quarter. CEO Haviv Ilan cited customer concerns over tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty, noting a "shallow" recovery in the automotive sector. Despite the stock's slump, the semiconductor supplier reported a 16% year-over-year revenue increase and surpassed second-quarter earnings expectations, with some strength potentially attributed to customers stockpiling inventory ahead of tariffs.

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will seek re-election to the U.S. House rather than run for governor of New York in 2026. Lawler, who represents a competitive Hudson Valley district, stated his decision was based on the importance of maintaining the Republican House majority. The announcement shifts the landscape for the GOP gubernatorial primary, potentially clearing a path for Rep. Elise Stefanik, who has been encouraged by former President Trump to consider a run against incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without parole after pleading guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. During the emotional hearing, families of the victims delivered powerful impact statements, while Kohberger declined to speak. The judge called Kohberger a "faceless coward" and noted the plea deal, which spared him the death penalty, was reached to provide finality for the families and avoid decades of appeals, though the motive for the killings remains unknown.</p>

          <p>A massive high-pressure system, known as a heat dome, is causing dangerously high temperatures and humidity for over 160 million Americans. This weather phenomenon works by trapping sinking, compressing air, which heats up and prevents cloud formation, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of extreme heat. Climate change has made such events at least five times more likely, with experts highlighting the particular danger of elevated nighttime temperatures that prevent bodies from cooling down, increasing health risks for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami stars Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba are set to be suspended for their club's next league match after not participating in the MLS All-Star Game. Despite being selected for the event, both players were absent from the festivities in Austin, Texas. League rules mandate that uninjured players who skip the All-Star game must sit out their team's subsequent match, meaning the duo will likely miss a key game against Eastern Conference leader FC Cincinnati.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a decade, with nearly 150,000 recorded in the first six months of the second Trump administration.

The aggressive crackdown has targeted a wide range of immigrants, leading to criticism and protests over the separation of families and communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate experts are debating whether eliminating or increasing the exemption for capital gains tax on home sales, a move floated by President Trump, would significantly impact the housing market. The National Association of Realtors argues that the tax discourages some homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling and downsizing, thereby limiting inventory. However, some analysts contend that while it might help high-end homeowners, the real key to unlocking the market is restoring broader economic confidence and stability, not a targeted tax cut.

          <p>Researchers have successfully used CRISPR gene-editing technology to alter a single amino acid in mosquitoes, making them largely incapable of transmitting the malaria parasite. The genetic tweak disrupts the parasite's journey to the mosquito's salivary glands, effectively blocking its path to a new host. Scientists hope this modification can be spread through wild mosquito populations using a gene drive, offering a promising new tool to combat a disease that infects over 260 million people annually, though the technology remains controversial.</p>
