            <h2>IDF Inquiry Finds 'Professional Failures' Led to Deaths of Gaza Medics</h2>

            <p>An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry concluded that "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders," contributed to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The IDF stated that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat, identifying six of the casualties as Hamas members, a claim disputed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). The report cited poor visibility as a factor and disciplined officers involved, but a UN official criticized the investigation for not going far enough in ensuring accountability. The incident occurred during renewed offensives in Gaza following stalled ceasefire negotiations after Hamas killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostages in Israel on October 7, 2023, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned nations against appeasing the United States in trade negotiations amid President Trump's tariffs, responding to reports that Washington intends to pressure countries to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from US import taxes. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson stated that "appeasement cannot bring peace," and that China will firmly oppose any deals made at its expense, promising resolute countermeasures. These remarks echo earlier warnings against the European Union attempting to appease the US, as Trump has imposed significant tariffs on Chinese imports and initiated trade talks with various partners. The escalating trade tensions underscore the complexities of global trade relations and the potential for retaliatory actions.</p>

            <p>Women protesters in Guinea-Bissau attacked a Chinese-run zircon mining site, setting fire to equipment, due to grievances that the mining activity was damaging their farms and the local environment. The protest occurred in Nhiquin, near Valera, where Chinese companies have been operating since 2022, with several women and a village leader arrested following the incident. Interior Minister Botche Cande expressed irritation, stating that the state makes an effort to find partners, and no one has the right to destroy their property. The incident highlights growing tensions between local communities and foreign mining operations over environmental impact and resource management.</p>

            <p>Home Plate BBQ, an American-style restaurant in Beijing, is reprinting its menus to remove American beef due to the ongoing US-China trade war, which has made the meat unaffordable due to retaliatory tariffs. The restaurant is switching to Australian beef and Canadian pork ribs, as the 125% tariffs on top of the existing 22% have made US beef prohibitively expensive. This shift reflects a broader trend among Beijing restaurants, with suppliers noting that even American steak restaurants are transitioning to Australian beef. The change highlights the tangible impact of the trade war on businesses and consumers.</p>

            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart that killed 23 people, is expected to plead guilty in state court to avoid the death penalty. Crusius, who targeted Hispanics in the attack, has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level after pleading guilty to hate crimes and weapons charges. Texas prosecutors opted not to pursue the death penalty, driven by the wishes of a majority of the victims' relatives. The plea arrangement will allow families to give victim impact statements, similar to those made during the federal court hearing in 2023.</p>

            <p>Approximately 60,000 Americans are at risk of losing their rental assistance and facing eviction as the Emergency Housing Vouchers program, launched in 2021, is running out of funds. The program, which aids individuals and families fleeing homelessness or domestic violence, is expected to exhaust its $5 billion allocation by the end of next year due to rising rent costs. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters is pushing for an additional $8 billion infusion, but the future of the program rests with Congress, where Republicans are focused on cutting federal spending. The loss of assistance could reverse the progress made by vulnerable individuals and families.</p>

            <p>China has warned that it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that compromise Beijing's interests, following reports that the U.S. is pressuring trading partners to limit trade with China in exchange for tariff exemptions. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce stated that Washington is using reciprocity as a pretext for unilateral economic pressure, violating international norms. The ministry cautioned that any deals made at the expense of Chinese interests would not be tolerated and vowed to take firm countermeasures. China's warning highlights the escalating tensions in the global trade landscape.</p>

            <p>A nine-year-old boy's death at a New South Wales beach has increased Australia's Easter weekend drowning toll to seven, with two people still missing. Most of the deaths were attributed to strong swells washing people off rocks. Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steven Pearce described it as the "worst" spate of drownings on record for the Easter long weekend. The tragedies occurred during a period meant for joy and religious observance, highlighting the dangers of coastal conditions.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has kept its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision reflects a focus on stabilizing the yuan amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and pressures on the currency. The move follows better-than-expected economic data from China, including a 5.4% GDP growth in the first quarter, providing room for the PBOC to maintain steady rates. The PBOC's decision aligns with economists' expectations, as the central bank balances economic growth with currency stability.</p>

Venezuela's chief prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, criticized Bukele's proposal, accusing El Salvador of unlawfully imprisoning the Venezuelans.

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the war-linked Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo as it began its three-day spring festival, but is not expected to visit the shrine. The Yasukuni shrine is seen by Japan's neighbors as a symbol of its past militarism, honoring wartime leaders convicted as war criminals. Ishiba's decision not to visit the shrine is likely due to diplomatic considerations, as Japan's ties with China and South Korea have been improving. Past visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders have drawn criticism from China and South Korea.</p>

The sharing of the details reportedly occurred around the same time in mid-March when key members of President Donald Trump's National Security Council, including Hegseth, inadvertently shared details about the March 15 missile strike in Yemen with the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.

The win marks a significant achievement for Lindblad, who credited her background in figure skating for developing the balance and precision needed in golf.

The firm suggests that this scenario will lead to slower economic growth, increased unemployment, and higher inflation, but it expects the US to narrowly avoid a full-blown recession. JPMorgan recommends that investors consider structured notes, which provide defensive exposure to stocks while generating income, and hedge funds in diversified portfolios, which can exploit market mispricings and offer downside protection.

While the TV adaptation expands on the game's storyline, some plot detours feel awkwardly inserted and diminish the emotional impact. The season focuses on fractured bonds and the cyclical nature of violence, leading to a more punishing and cheerless narrative. Subsequent episodes offer glimpses of ingenuity, but the show's limited imagination and emphasis on misery create a more suffocating storytelling experience.</p>
