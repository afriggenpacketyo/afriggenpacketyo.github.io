        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese strongly criticized WNBA officials following a close loss to the Minnesota Lynx, expressing frustration over what she perceived as biased officiating. Reese highlighted a significant free-throw disparity, with her team attempting only eight shots compared to Minnesota's seventeen. She stated that when she questioned an official about the low number of calls, she was told it wasn't the official's job to monitor that. Voicing a sentiment shared by other players this season, Reese declared she was "tired of this" and was willing to accept a fine for her candid remarks about the need to fix the officiating.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI has officially concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in federal custody in 2019. The investigation found no evidence to support the existence of a so-called "client list" or any indication that Epstein was blackmailing prominent individuals. Despite prior speculation and political promises, the review confirmed that materials released to the public were largely documents already in the public domain. The memo stated that perpetuating unfounded theories serves no purpose in bringing justice to the more than 1,000 victims identified.</p>

          <h2>Clayton Kershaw Expresses Gratitude for Honorary All-Star "Legend Pick"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 20:33:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was named to his 11th All-Star team, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner, an honor that caught him by surprise. Having pitched in only nine games this season after returning from surgery, Kershaw initially felt he didn't deserve the selection on merit alone. However, he has since embraced the recognition as a "tremendous honor," acknowledging the unique nature of the selection. The future Hall of Famer, who recently recorded his 3,000th career strikeout, is enjoying a season free from the injuries that have plagued him in recent years.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas during the July Fourth weekend have resulted in more than 100 fatalities, with many victims being children and counselors from a summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, driven by a unique combination of geographic and meteorological factors that overwhelmed the flood-prone region. Officials now face intense scrutiny over the lack of timely evacuation warnings, citing the unprecedented nature of the deluge and prior public resistance to the cost of a robust alert system. As search and recovery efforts continue, the state is considering funding for improved warning infrastructure to prevent future tragedies.</p>

Competitors like SK Hynix have secured key supplier positions with AI leader Nvidia, while Samsung has reportedly faced delays in getting its own advanced HBM chips certified. This setback in the lucrative AI sector, combined with continued losses in its chip foundry business, is a primary driver of the disappointing financial forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas were triggered by an immense amount of rainfall, with some areas receiving over 20 inches over the holiday weekend. This deluge caused the Guadalupe River to rise an unprecedented 26 feet in only 45 minutes during the predawn hours, catching residents and campers by surprise. The article explains that the region's geography, characterized by dry, packed soil, exacerbates runoff and makes it naturally susceptible to flash flooding.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests U.S. Defense Policy Is Disjointed Under Trump Administration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that U.S. foreign and defense policy under the Trump administration lacks coherent leadership, creating a dysfunctional and unpredictable environment. With the President's interest being episodic and key cabinet positions filled by individuals with little influence, critical decisions are either neglected or driven by lower-level appointees like Undersecretary Elbridge Colby. This has led to confusing policy shifts, such as halting weapons to Ukraine and reviewing the AUKUS pact without clear top-level direction. The article suggests this ad-hoc process, typical of authoritarian states, leaves America's response to global challenges dangerously fragmented and reactive.</p>

          <p>A brush fire in Laguna Beach that prompted evacuation orders for several hundred homes on Monday is suspected to have been caused by fireworks. The blaze, dubbed the Rancho fire, ignited in a hilly residential area and grew to approximately 3 acres. Firefighting helicopters, aircraft, and ground crews were deployed, and officials reported making good progress in containing it, with no homes damaged thus far. City officials credited the rapid response and recent wildfire mitigation efforts, including vegetation thinning and the installation of a high-capacity water tank for helicopters, for helping to control the fire's spread.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as President Joe Biden's White House physician, has requested a delay in his scheduled testimony before the House oversight committee. His lawyer cited the need to establish protections for doctor-patient confidentiality amid the Republican-led investigation into Biden's health and mental fitness during his time in office. The committee, led by Rep. James Comer, has subpoenaed Dr. O'Connor and insists he cannot decline to appear, arguing that congressional authority supersedes professional ethics codes. This conflict is part of a broader political struggle over the scope of the inquiry into the former president's capacity while serving.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed a United Nations working group that the United States holds exclusive legal responsibility for the more than 200 migrants sent to its CECOT mega-prison. This claim contradicts the Trump administration's position that it cannot retrieve the migrants because they are under Salvadoran authority. The migrants were deported under the Alien Enemies Act, with the administration accusing them of being part of a violent gang. In its report, El Salvador clarified that its role was limited to facilitating prison infrastructure for individuals detained under another country's justice system, intensifying the legal battle over their fate.</p>

He noted that debris removal has progressed rapidly with federal help but stressed that long-term funding is crucial for rebuilding. Newsom expressed confidence that a bipartisan path for disaster aid for all affected states, including Texas, will ultimately be found.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) issued a correction after sending a misleading email claiming a new Republican law eliminated federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. In reality, the provision to eliminate the tax was removed from the final bill. The law instead provides an additional $6,000 income tax deduction for Americans aged 65 and older for the 2025-2028 tax seasons. Advocacy groups criticized the SSA for the initial confusion and for its unusually political tone in heralding the legislation, emphasizing the need for the agency to remain a neutral administrator of benefits for millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder after she served a lunch containing toxic death cap mushrooms in July 2023.

The 10-week trial, which garnered global attention, rejected Patterson's claim that she had accidentally served the poisonous fungi. The verdict brings a sense of closure to the small, tight-knit community of Korumburra, Victoria, which has been reeling from the tragedy for nearly two years.</p>

Provincial leaders are aligning with this national strategy, aiming to leverage their comparative advantages to serve Beijing's broader goals.
