          <p>Deliveries of China's domestically produced C919 narrowbody passenger jet to major airlines appear to be falling behind schedule, according to recent company financial reports. Air China and China Eastern Airlines each received only one C919 in the first half of the year, despite plans for ten each in 2025, while China Southern Airlines noted leasing only three of its anticipated twelve. Independent aviation analysts speculate that these delays may stem from disruptions in the aircraft's engine supply chain. The C919, which began commercial flights in May 2023, has already transported over two million passengers, but faces new turbulence in its market penetration efforts.</p>

Authorities identified the suspect as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, an Iraq War veteran who served in the U.S. Marines from 2004 to 2008. Sanford drove a vehicle through the church doors before opening fire and was later killed by police in the parking lot. The incident occurred during a particularly violent weekend in the U.S., which also saw mass shootings in North Carolina, Texas, and New Orleans, highlighting a broader issue of gun violence.</p>

          <p>An article discusses how to identify and manage friendships with 'energy vampires' – individuals who drain your emotional and mental energy. These friends often monopolize conversations, complain excessively, or offer backhanded compliments, leaving you feeling depleted. Psychologists and journalists suggest common signs include an excessive need for attention and a lack of interest in your life. To handle such dynamics, the article advises open communication about unmet needs, setting clear boundaries on time and topics, and trying different activities like walks or exercise to shift the focus from intense emotional sharing, helping to protect your well-being.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the mayoral reelection race, citing constant media speculation and a Campaign Finance Board decision to withhold funds. His departure sets up a three-way contest between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

          <p>More than 100,000 federal workers are poised to formally resign, marking the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration initiative to significantly reduce the federal workforce. This comes as Congress faces a deadline to authorize funding, with the White House also instructing agencies to prepare for large-scale firings if a budget deal isn't reached. Departing workers describe months of 'fear and intimidation' as the driving force behind their decision. The Guardian reports that employees feel their mission has been undermined and job security uncertain, leading them to leave public service.</p>

Wang highlighted this during the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol.

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing for an expedited Supreme Court review of its executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, seeking a definitive judgment by next summer. Solicitor General John Sauer argues the government has a compelling interest in limiting American citizenship to those lawfully entitled, citing border security concerns. This move follows two federal courts universally blocking the order, which unilaterally reinterprets the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause to exclude children born in the U.S. to non-permanent legal residents.

Tragically, one detainee died, and two others were critically injured in a van targeted by Jahn.

          <p>A seven-month investigation by 60 Minutes reveals concerns over potential Russian sabotage in the Baltic Sea, following a series of critical undersea cable and pipeline damages. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo authorized special forces to board an oil tanker, the Eagle S, after it severely damaged an electric cable while dragging its anchor. Orpo suspects Russia's shadow fleet, operating since the Ukraine war, is responsible, seeing it as part of broader aggression. Similar incidents involving Chinese ships, the Newnew Polar Bear and Yi Peng 3, have also been investigated, leading NATO to establish 'Baltic Sentry' to monitor infrastructure and fleet activity.</p>

          <p>Two eyewitnesses to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University have united to call for a return to civilized debate in America. Hunter Kozak, a liberal who was the last person to speak with Kirk, and Jeb Jacobi, a conservative student volunteer for Kirk's organization, both stressed the importance of respectful dialogue despite differing viewpoints. They recounted the traumatic event where Kirk was fatally shot by a sniper during a campus debate. Utah Governor Spencer Cox echoed calls for civility, emphasizing that disagreement is not the problem, but rather how it is conducted.</p>

          <p>A Texas man, Joshua Cole, has been arrested by the FBI for allegedly threatening to commit a shooting at a local gay pride event in Abilene. Cole reportedly posted on Facebook, expressing a desire to 'pay them back for taking out Charlie Kirk,' referencing the conservative activist's recent assassination.

Authorities deemed his threats specific and serious, leading to his detention pending trial due to strong evidence and prior criminal history.

The village director highlighted issues of privacy invasion and overcrowding. While local shop and restaurant owners fear a loss of business, the fee will include museum and windmill access, with revenues allocated for maintenance and new infrastructure, sparking a debate on balancing tourism with local quality of life.</p>

          <p>The growing popularity of weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro is raising concerns that obesity management could become a wealth issue, deepening health inequalities. While some of these drugs are NHS-prescribed, access is tightly restricted by varying regional eligibility thresholds, creating a 'postcode lottery.' Consequently, over 90% of the estimated 1.5 million UK users pay privately, with monthly costs ranging from £100-£350, a sum out of reach for many, particularly in deprived areas where obesity rates are higher. Experts fear that without broader NHS access and investment in prevention, health disparities will worsen, making good health a luxury.</p>

Despite holding the best record in MLB in mid-June with a league-high $322.6 million payroll, the Mets finished outside the postseason. A hamstring injury to starter Kodai Senga in June marked a turning point, leading to a 38-55 record in the second half. This familiar disappointment for Mets fans, reminiscent of 2007 and 2008, left players like Juan Soto calling the season a 'failure,' underscoring the team's inability to overcome pitching woes.</p>
