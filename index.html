          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% annually in July, a figure slightly cooler than economists' predictions. On a monthly basis, the index increased by 0.2%, meeting expectations. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, reached a five-month high at 3.1%, suggesting underlying price pressures persist. While falling gasoline prices provided some relief, food costs continued to climb, adding financial stress for many American households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>E.J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has suggested suspending the agency's monthly jobs report. Antoni, a conservative economist from the Heritage Foundation, claims the widely-followed report is unreliable and should be replaced with less timely but more accurate quarterly data. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from other economists, who view it as an attempt to undermine the BLS's integrity, especially after Trump fired the previous commissioner over a report showing slowing job growth.</p>

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a move backed by several investors. The offer comes as the U.S. Department of Justice has proposed that Google divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the internet search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine and recently launched browser, Comet, is positioning itself amidst the intense competition for AI dominance. Google has not yet responded to the bid or disclosed its plans following the antitrust ruling.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, currently moving west across the Atlantic, is expected to intensify and could become the first hurricane of the 2025 season by late Thursday. The storm has already been linked to eight deaths in Cape Verde due to severe rains. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict Erin will approach the Caribbean, with potential impacts on Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and possibly the U.S. East Coast next week. This aligns with NOAA's prediction for an above-average hurricane season, influenced by warmer ocean temperatures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his pressure on the Federal Reserve, threatening to allow a "major lawsuit" against Chairman Jerome Powell and demanding an immediate interest rate cut. In a social media post, Trump criticized Powell's leadership and management of renovations at the Fed's headquarters, which he called "grossly incompetent." This represents another direct challenge to the central bank's independence, as Trump continues to blame Powell for not slashing rates to boost the economy, despite the Fed holding them steady throughout 2025.

This development marks another critical challenge for the photography pioneer, which has struggled to adapt since the digital revolution and a 2012 bankruptcy.

          <p>President Trump's move to federalize Washington, D.C.'s police force brings the city's unique governance structure into focus. The 1973 Home Rule Act granted D.C. limited self-governance, but Congress and the president retain significant authority, a legacy of a century-long period where the city was run by presidentially appointed commissioners. This article details D.C.'s history, from the post-Civil War era when Congress established a commission to govern the majority-Black city, to the 1990s when a federal "Control Board" managed its finances. This context highlights the long-standing tensions over local autonomy in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has invoked the Home Rule Act to federalize Washington, D.C.'s police force, legal analysis points to a crucial constraint on this power. The 1974 law explicitly states that such presidential control cannot extend beyond 30 days unless Congress passes a joint resolution to authorize an extension. Although the act gives the president broad authority to determine if an "emergency" exists, this time limit is firm. The key question is whether courts, particularly the current Supreme Court, would prevent the president from simply declaring a new emergency after 30 days to circumvent the statute.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who is on a family holiday in the UK, held a private meeting with Robert Jenrick, the Conservative shadow justice secretary. The meeting took place in the Cotswolds, where Vance is staying, and was reportedly initiated by the Vice President's team. Vance, who has taken similar policy positions to Jenrick on issues like immigration, also met with Foreign Secretary David Lammy last week but is not scheduled to meet with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch.

          <p>Elon Musk has escalated his feud with OpenAI, threatening legal action against Apple over its partnership with the AI firm and calling OpenAI CEO Sam Altman a "liar." Musk claims Apple has made it "impossible" for other apps to compete with ChatGPT in its App Store, a claim that comes as several rival AI apps have topped the charts. The conflict stems from Musk's belief that OpenAI, which he co-founded, has abandoned its original non-profit, open-source mission to maximize profits for investors like Microsoft. The rivalry has involved lawsuits and public criticism from both sides.</p>

          <p>Everton has completed the signing of Manchester City and England winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old, who became a record signing for City in 2021, said he was "over the moon" to join Everton, citing conversations with manager David Moyes as a key factor. After falling out of favor at Manchester City last season and being left out of the Euro 2024 squad, the move offers Grealish a chance to rejuvenate his career. He will wear the number 18 shirt, a nod to his favorite players Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne.</p>

          <p>Tennis player Emma Raducanu feels more confident about her chances at the US Open than at any time since her historic 2021 victory. Despite a narrow three-set loss to Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati, her performance reflected significant progress during the North American hard-court season. Raducanu stated she feels calmer and more self-assured in big moments, a stark contrast to previous years marked by injuries and inconsistent play. Her improved form and ranking suggest she will be a formidable opponent for anyone in the early rounds in New York.</p>

The text highlights the security and predictability of CDs, which offer a fixed return and protect the principal investment.

          <p>China is reportedly instructing its companies to avoid using specific AI chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for government and national security purposes. The warning targets Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI380 chips, which were designed to comply with earlier U.S. export restrictions. This development comes after the White House confirmed a deal where the chipmakers would give the U.S. government 15% of their China revenues.

The court's decision, which mandates capturing, sterilizing, and relocating 5,000 dogs from "high-risk areas," followed reports of nearly 2,000 daily dog bites in the capital. Protesters argue the policy is inhumane and ineffective, calling instead for the strict enforcement of existing animal birth control rules, which involve sterilizing and vaccinating dogs before returning them to their communities.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Israeli public opinion on the Gaza war, revealing a complex mindset where a majority supports a ceasefire while showing little concern for Palestinian suffering. Pollster Dahlia Scheindlin explains that Israeli opposition to the war is primarily driven by concerns for the safety of hostages and soldiers, not empathy for Gazans, whose suffering is often dismissed or disbelieved. This indifference is fueled by a lack of media coverage, dehumanization, and a widespread belief that reports of starvation are Hamas propaganda, creating a significant barrier to a peace process based on mutual understanding.</p>
