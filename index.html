            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, effective from 6 p.m. Saturday to midnight Sunday. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the announcement, citing ongoing Russian attacks and drone strikes, and did not confirm if Ukraine would observe the truce. The announcement follows frustration from the Trump administration regarding the pace of peace talks. Russia and Ukraine also conducted a prisoner exchange mediated by the United Arab Emirates.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act. The court's order followed an emergency appeal from the ACLU, arguing that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the wartime law. The ACLU cited concerns about the detainees' ability to contest their cases in court and the conditions they would face if deported to El Salvador. The White House responded by claiming the men were "foreign terrorists."</p>

            <p>Property owners affected by wildfires are suing major California insurance carriers, including State Farm, alleging collusion to force homeowners into the California FAIR Plan. The lawsuit claims insurers conspired to eliminate competition and intentionally push homeowners into the FAIR Plan, which has higher premiums and lower coverage limits. The suit alleges the insurers are required by law to back FAIR, but colluded to cancel plans, leaving homeowners underinsured. The plaintiffs are seeking three times the damages each has sustained.</p>

            <p>Roki Sasaki pitched six solid innings for the Dodgers, but a walk-off home run by Adolis García of the Texas Rangers spoiled his chance for his first MLB win.
