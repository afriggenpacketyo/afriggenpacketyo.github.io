          <p>SoftBank Group has agreed to purchase the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a move designed to significantly enhance its focus on artificial intelligence. The acquisition aligns with founder Masayoshi Son's vision for "Physical AI," which aims to merge advanced robotics with what he terms "Artificial Super Intelligence." This deal supersedes ABB's previous plans to spin off the robotics unit as a separate entity. The acquisition strengthens SoftBank's portfolio, which already includes key technology players like chip designer Arm and a major stake in OpenAI.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority has proposed a compensation scheme for millions of consumers affected by the mis-selling of car finance. The plan could result in lenders paying out £8.2 billion, with an average payout of around £700 per agreement for deals made between April 2007 and November 2024. The redress scheme addresses issues like undisclosed discretionary commissions and unfair contracts, aiming to provide fair compensation without the need for claims management companies. While consumer advocates welcome the long-overdue action, some in the lending industry argue the scale of the proposed compensation is implausibly high. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions stated that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed due to a lack of evidence from the government. Specifically, prosecutors were unable to secure witness statements that officially designated China as a "national security threat" at the time of the alleged offenses. This classification became a necessary legal threshold following a precedent set in a separate case involving Russian spies. The failure to obtain this specific wording from the government, despite months of requests, meant the evidential test for a trial under the Official Secrets Act could no longer be met.</p>

          <p>American golfer Collin Morikawa has acknowledged that some US fans at the recent Ryder Cup in New York likely "crossed the line" with their verbal abuse directed at the European team. The event, which Europe won, was marked by hostile crowd behavior, particularly targeting Rory McIlroy, whose wife was also hit by a thrown cup. Morikawa, who had previously called for fans to create "chaos," clarified that he did not intend for them to be rude or disrespectful.

          <p>Police in East Sussex have arrested a second individual in connection with an arson attack that caused severe damage to a mosque in Peacehaven. A 25-year-old man of no fixed address was taken into custody on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. This follows the earlier arrest of a 46-year-old man, who has since been released on bail. The fire occurred on a Saturday night, and while no one was injured, the building was badly damaged. Authorities are urging community members with any information about the attack to come forward.</p>

          <p>A medical helicopter crashed on a freeway in Sacramento, leaving its three crew members—a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic—with critical injuries. The REACH helicopter had just departed from the UC Davis Medical Center when it experienced an in-air emergency and went down on Highway 50. Remarkably, no vehicles on the busy freeway were struck during the incident. First responders, with assistance from bystanders, were able to lift the aircraft to free one of the crew members who was trapped underneath. The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA are investigating the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surpassed a record $4,000 per ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets due to growing economic and political instability. The rally, the largest since the 1970s, is being fueled by concerns over global trade disruptions and delays in economic data releases caused by the ongoing US government shutdown. Gold is traditionally valued as a stable investment during turbulent times, and its price often rises when the US dollar weakens. Analysts note that increased purchasing by central banks and retail investors has also contributed significantly to the precious metal's unprecedented surge. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts and former teammates praise his exceptional long-range distribution, which can initiate counter-attacks, and his improved all-round play. With over 78 caps and crucial performances in major tournaments, Pickford has effectively silenced debates about his role, providing stability in a position that has historically been a point of discussion for England.</p>

          <p>Persistent political chaos in France, highlighted by the recent resignation of its fifth prime minister in under two years, is intensifying concerns over the nation's fiscal health. The country's inability to form a stable government has stalled necessary reforms to address a budget deficit of 5.8% of GDP and a public debt level of 113% of GDP, both far exceeding EU limits. President Emmanuel Macron has given the outgoing prime minister a 48-hour extension to find a solution, but the political deadlock makes significant fiscal consolidation unlikely. Economists now predict France's deficit will remain high, posing a challenge for both the country and EU regulators.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, the author and illustrator of the bestselling book "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," has revealed that his new book was significantly delayed after his iPad was stolen. The device contained a substantial amount of unbacked-up work, including rough drawings and text for the new book, "Always Remember." Mackesy described the theft from his unlocked car as a major setback that forced him to try and reconstruct the lost material from memory. The six-year process of completing the book was also marked by personal grief, including the loss of his mother and his beloved dog.</p>

          <p>Residents of a Portland, Oregon apartment building located opposite a federal ICE facility describe living in a "war zone" due to nightly clashes between protesters and federal agents. The sustained unrest has prompted President Trump to threaten the deployment of the National Guard, a move temporarily halted by a federal judge. Those living in the area report constant exposure to tear gas and confrontations, though they are divided on whether to blame the protesters or the federal agents for the escalating violence. While the conflict is localized to one city block, it has placed Portland at the center of a national debate over federal authority and civil unrest.</p>

The ad campaigns, split evenly between the two states, feature military veterans criticizing the Republican candidates on economic issues. In New Jersey, the ad targets Jack Ciattarelli over taxes, while in Virginia, it connects Winsome Earle-Sears to former President Trump's economic policies. Both Democratic nominees, Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Rep. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, have military or intelligence backgrounds, aligning with the group's focus on backing veteran candidates.</p>

          <p>A supermoon, known as the Hunter's Moon, has been visible in skies across the globe, appearing noticeably larger and brighter than a typical full moon. This celestial event occurs when the moon's orbit brings it to its closest point to Earth, a position called the perigee. The name "Hunter's Moon" is traditionally given to the first full moon of October in the northern hemisphere. It historically signified the time for hunting in preparation for the coming winter, as the bright moonlight would extend the day for hunters. The event provided a spectacular sight for sky-watchers and photographers around the world.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps has won a crowded Republican primary in the special election for a Tennessee congressional seat, boosted by a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Van Epps, a former aide to Governor Bill Lee and an Army veteran, will now face Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the December general election. The seat, located in a safely Republican district that includes parts of Nashville's suburbs, was vacated by former Rep. Mark Green. The race is seen as a test of Trump's influence and could provide an early look at voter sentiment ahead of the next election cycle.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is appealing a federal judge's order that restricts the Los Angeles Police Department from using less-lethal munitions, such as rubber bullets, against journalists and nonviolent protesters. The injunction was issued last month following multiple lawsuits alleging excessive force by the LAPD during protests. City attorneys have argued that the ban is overly broad and impractical, claiming it could cause officers to hesitate in chaotic situations and that it is not always possible to identify journalists in a crowd. Civil rights lawyers for the plaintiffs counter that the police actions were deliberate and unlawful.</p>

This partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals, such as copper and cobalt, from Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed focus on securing domestic supply chains for resources vital to defense, energy, and manufacturing.

A surgeon warned that such projectiles can cause severe injuries, including vision loss and potentially lethal skull fractures. While catapults are not illegal to own, police and campaigners argue that existing laws are insufficient to address their misuse as dangerous weapons.</p>

          <p>A controversial proposal to redraw California's congressional districts before the next census has become a major point of debate among candidates for the 2026 governor's race. The plan, known as Proposition 50, would allow the Democratic-controlled legislature to create maps more favorable to their party, potentially flipping five House seats. Democratic candidates generally support the measure as a necessary counter to Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas. However, Republican and Green Party opponents have condemned it as a corrupt and unconstitutional power grab that violates the will of voters who previously established an independent redistricting commission.</p>

          <p>The state of Kentucky has filed a lawsuit against the popular gaming platform Roblox, alleging it knowingly facilitates the sexual exploitation of children and fails to safeguard them from violent and inappropriate content. The complaint claims that predators use the in-game currency, "Robux," to lure children and that users can easily find games simulating sexual activity and extreme violence. Attorney General Russell Coleman referred to the platform as a "playground for predators" and urged parents to remove their children from it. Roblox responded that the lawsuit is based on sensationalized and outdated information.</p>
