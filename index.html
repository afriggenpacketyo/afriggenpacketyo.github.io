          <p>Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old US-Israeli hostage, was released by Hamas after being held captive in Gaza for 19 months, marking the first hostage freed since Israel restarted its military offensive in March. The release occurred during a brief pause in Israeli military operations as a goodwill gesture ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. Alexander was reunited with his family in Israel, and his family thanked Trump for his support while urging further efforts to release the remaining hostages. Hamas stated the release was intended to facilitate humanitarian aid entry into Gaza, but Israel intends to continue its military actions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on Chinese products for 90 days, following trade talks in Geneva, a move that sent stocks soaring but also raised questions about the long-term benefits of the trade war. The agreement will lower U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from as high as 145%, while China will reduce its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the shared interest in avoiding a decoupling of the two economies, and officials said they would use the 90-day period to negotiate a more lasting trade deal. American businesses, particularly retailers and manufacturers, expressed relief but remained cautiously optimistic about the future of trade relations. </p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to assess costs and efficiency for the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, a multibillion-dollar Amtrak project connecting Baltimore to Washington. The project, initially estimated at $6 billion, has seen costs rise to $8.5 billion, prompting the FRA to seek alternative solutions. The Boring Company claims it can build the tunnel more cheaply and efficiently. This move has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's other business ventures and his advisory role to President Trump, particularly regarding federal agencies that regulate his companies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A guest essay highlights concerns about the safety and regulation of food additives in the United States, where an estimated 10,000 additives are allowed in food, including flavors, emulsifiers, pesticides, preservatives, and dyes. Unlike Europe, the U.S. allows food companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals through the GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) regulatory pathway, without prior FDA approval. This means the food industry often vets the safety of ingredients, not federal regulators, and there are roughly 1,000 chemicals in the food supply whose identities are unknown to regulators. Research on chemicals tends to be narrow, mostly looking for cancer or organ damage, rather than subtle effects on long-term health.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian Authority has lifted its ban on Al Jazeera in the West Bank, which was imposed in January over accusations of inciting sedition and interfering in internal Palestinian affairs. Attorney General Akram Khatib announced the decision, but did not provide details on what had changed since the ban was implemented. The ban had been criticized by some Palestinians and human rights groups as an authoritarian stifling of dissent. Al Jazeera's bureau chief noted that the broadcaster's offices would not immediately reopen due to a separate closure order by Israeli authorities.</p>

          <p>A new software update prevented a third radar outage at Newark airport when a telecommunications line failed again, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Duffy criticized the previous administration for not adequately equipping the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia after earlier hardware issues. Despite the system staying online, controllers stopped all traffic at Newark airport for about 45 minutes as a precaution. Duffy also announced that he would request an investigation into the move of Newark air traffic controllers from New York to Philadelphia, while also laying out an extensive plan to replace the nation's outdated air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>This article examines Attorney General Pam Bondi's approach within the Trump administration, highlighting her willingness to execute White House directives with little resistance. An early setback involved the release of “Epstein Files: Phase 1” to Trump-allied influencers, which yielded no significant findings. Bondi's actions, such as signing off on the acceptance of a luxury Boeing 747-8 plane donated by the Qatari royal family, have raised ethical questions. Critics suggest that Bondi's role is more of a surrogate and high-volume messenger, ceding authority to other powerful figures within the administration, and that the Justice Department's decisions are being made at the White House and then pushed down to the DOJ.</p>

Emergency services were called to the property in the early hours of Monday, and counter-terrorism police are investigating the cause. There was damage to the property's entrance but nobody was hurt, the Metropolitan Police said. Two other fires - a vehicle fire on 8 May and a fire at the entrance of a property in Islington on 11 May - are being investigated to see if there are possible links to the other incident.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices, but the details and long-term effects are unclear. The order directs US officials to ensure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in "unreasonable or discriminatory" price hikes for Americans. The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers, cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers, and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices. The order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.</p>

          <p>Receipts from U.S. tariffs hit a record level in April as revenue from President Donald Trump's trade war started kicking in. Customs duties totaled $16.3 billion for the month, some 86% above the $8.75 billion collected during March and more than double the $7.1 billion a year ago, the Treasury Department reported Monday. The influx in tariffs helped shave some of the imbalance for April, a month in which the Treasury generally runs a surplus because of the income tax filing deadline hitting mid-month. High interest rates are still posing a budgetary burden.</p>

The decision follows Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s inflammatory public statements targeting transgender troops and his ultimatum to resign during Pride Month or be kicked out.</p>

          <p>A US-funded flight carrying 59 white South Africans who are to be granted refugee status has landed at a Washington DC-area airport. President Donald Trump has said the refugee applications for the country's Afrikaner minority had been expedited as they were victims of "racial discrimination". The South African government has denied this saying any allegations of persecution would not meet the threshold required under refugee law. Immigrant rights activists have criticised the fast-track refugee initiative, describing it as unfair for the "most vulnerable". The Trump administration has halted almost all refugee admissions including those coming from countries at war.</p>
