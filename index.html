          <p>Former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Republican Thom Tillis in 2026. In his announcement, Cooper framed his campaign as a fight for the middle class against corporate interests and criticized recent federal spending bills for increasing national debt while cutting social programs. His campaign reported raising $1 million within hours of the launch, signaling strong initial support for his bid to flip the Senate seat. The Republican National Committee chairman is also expected to enter the race.</p>

          <p>A tragic collision between a barge and a sailboat in Biscayne Bay, near Miami Beach, has resulted in the deaths of two children and left two others in critical condition. The sailboat, carrying five children and a counselor from a Miami Yacht Club summer program, sank after the impact, throwing all occupants into the water. First responders rescued the individuals, with some reportedly trapped under the barge. The U.S. Coast Guard has established a safety zone around the submerged vessel and is leading an ongoing investigation into the fatal incident.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines pilot, Rustom Bhagwagar, was arrested at San Francisco International Airport on multiple charges of oral copulation with a child under ten. The arrest, which occurred after he co-piloted a flight, stems from an investigation that began in April following a report of sex crimes against a child. Bhagwagar has been suspended by Delta, which stated it was "appalled" by the charges and is cooperating with law enforcement. He is currently being held on $5 million bail, and the incident has drawn significant attention after videos of the on-plane arrest circulated online.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted an "unconditional donation" of a luxury jet from Qatar, according to a signed memorandum of understanding. The agreement specifies that the Department of Defense can use or dispose of the aircraft at its discretion, with no stipulations for its use after the president leaves office. The Air Force will now begin retrofitting the plane, a process with a classified cost that some lawmakers speculate could reach $1 billion. The deal has raised concerns among critics about the use of taxpayer funds for a plane that may see limited presidential service.</p>

This fire, which burned 23,000 acres and killed at least 12 people, devastated wealthy neighborhoods and destroyed numerous high-value homes.

          <p>Spirit Airlines has announced it will furlough 270 pilots and demote 140 captains to first officers this fall as it navigates financial difficulties. The move is intended to align staffing levels with a reduced flight schedule for the off-peak season, part of the airline's broader effort to return to profitability after emerging from bankruptcy. The pilots' union expressed concern that the airline continues to shrink, eroding the value of pilot careers at the company. Spirit stated the decision was a necessary step to operate more efficiently in a market with softer travel demand.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump Administration's Focus on 2016 Russia Probe Seen as Distraction from Epstein Scandal</h2>

          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's recent focus on the origins of the 2016 Russia election interference probe as a deliberate attempt to divert public attention from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The piece argues that claims of an Obama-era plot to fabricate the intelligence community's findings are a baseless distraction. It asserts that the conclusion of Russian interference to help Trump was well-supported by public evidence and a bipartisan Senate committee report. The author suggests this "promiscuous dissembling" is a political strategy to change the subject from a damaging story to a manufactured controversy.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization has filed a federal lawsuit against unidentified online merchants for allegedly selling counterfeit branded merchandise on platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay. The complaint accuses the sellers of trademark infringement by offering "inferior imitations" of products such as hats, mugs, and T-shirts without authorization. The company is seeking a court order to stop the sales, destroy the counterfeit goods, and close the merchants' online accounts. The lawsuit highlights the ongoing challenge that major e-commerce platforms face in policing the sale of inauthentic goods by third-party sellers.</p>

This provision is intended to help the EU diversify its energy sources and reduce its dependence on Russian gas. The market's positive reaction reflects investor optimism about the significant increase in demand for U.S. energy exports resulting from the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The federal tax credits for electric vehicles, offering up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs, are scheduled to end on September 30. The termination of the incentive is part of the "Big Beautiful Bill" passed this month, reversing a key Biden-era climate policy. Auto dealers and industry analysts anticipate a short-term surge in EV sales as consumers rush to take advantage of the credit before the deadline. The elimination of the credit is expected to further slow EV sales, which have already been impacted by plateauing interest and high tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal trade court has declined to issue a preliminary injunction that would have blocked the administration's elimination of the 'de minimis' tariff exemption. This exemption allowed packages valued under $800, heavily used by retailers like Shein and Temu, to enter the U.S. duty-free. The court ruled that the lawsuit, brought by auto parts retailer Detroit Axle, was redundant as the issue is covered by a broader, ongoing case challenging the administration's tariffs. The decision means the tariffs on low-value imports will remain in place while the legal challenges proceed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The "4% rule" is a long-standing guideline for retirees, suggesting they can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually without depleting their savings over 30 years. When considering annuities, this rule serves as a useful benchmark to compare the guaranteed income from an annuity against potential portfolio withdrawals. An annuity might offer a higher payout rate, providing protection against outliving one's savings, but often lacks the inflation adjustments and flexibility of a traditional portfolio. This article explains how retirees can use both strategies to balance security and growth in their financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>
