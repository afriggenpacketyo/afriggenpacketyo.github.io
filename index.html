          <p>Honeywell's shares experienced a significant jump after the company announced robust first-quarter results, with revenue and adjusted earnings per share exceeding expectations. The positive results were driven by strong organic revenue growth in aerospace technologies and building automation, as well as smaller-than-expected sales declines in other segments. While management maintained its full-year outlook, they acknowledged the impact of tariffs and potential demand risks due to global uncertainty, but Jim Cramer is suggesting some caution because these early stock gains may not hold, as executives have to say about the second half of the year on the conference call could be more subdued.

          <p>The Trump administration is set to ease tariffs on automakers by removing the additional 25% import duty on imported steel and aluminum, on top of the existing 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts. This decision, aimed at preventing automakers from being doubly hit by tariffs, will also include reimbursements for automakers who have already paid the double tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley praised Trump's decision, noting that some vehicles could increase in price by as much as $10,000 due to tariffs if this action was not taken. General Motors has postponed its first-quarter conference call to assess potential tariff changes, indicating that prior guidance cannot be relied upon due to the tariffs.</p>

The father urges Trump to apply financial pressure on Hamas and directly negotiate for the release of U.S. citizens, rather than relying on third parties.

          <p>President Trump's first 100 days of his second term have been marked by a flurry of executive actions, aiming to reshape the federal government and advance his agenda.

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a narrow victory in Canada's pivotal election, marking a fourth term for the party. Carney, a former central banker, campaigned on a platform of confronting President Trump's trade war and threats to annex Canada. During his acceptance speech, he struck a combative tone toward the United States, vowing to push back against what he described as American attempts to take over Canadian land and resources. While the Liberals may need support from smaller parties, Carney's win represents a significant political comeback amid rising concerns over Canadian sovereignty.</p>

BP's green strategy U-turn and underperformance compared to peers have also made it a potential takeover target, though Auchincloss maintains that BP is a strong, independent company with sector-leading growth.</p>

          <h2>Trump Giving Putin Everything He Wants in Ukraine Negotiations</h2>

          <p>Despite claims that Russia is weak and desperate, President Trump has failed to win any concessions from Putin in negotiations regarding Ukraine, leading to a deal heavily favoring Russia. Trump's proposal lacks security guarantees for Ukraine and leaves open the possibility of a European peacekeeping presence, which Putin rejects. This situation demonstrates Trump's inability to leverage supposed advantages and highlights the challenges of the new era in international affairs.</p>

          <p>Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, has requested a "real apology" from the band Kneecap after footage emerged of them allegedly calling for MPs to be killed. This follows the band's defense and apology to the Amess and Cox families, claiming the footage was taken out of context. Cox views the apology as insincere, as the band suggests they are victims of a conspiracy. Counter-terrorism police are assessing the footage, and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for prosecution.</p>
