          <p>Several Waymo autonomous vehicles were vandalized and set on fire during protests in downtown Los Angeles, prompting the company to suspend service in the area. The protests erupted following immigration enforcement operations, leading to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. California National Guard members were deployed in response to the unrest, further escalating tensions. Photos show Waymo vehicles engulfed in flames with anti-ICE graffiti, raising concerns about the safety of autonomous vehicles in protest zones and the potential for targeted attacks. The incident underscores the challenges of operating autonomous vehicles in unpredictable environments and the need for enhanced security measures to protect against vandalism and arson.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated he would support the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, escalating tensions amid ongoing protests. This statement followed Newsom's lawsuit against Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for deploying the National Guard to address the protests, which Newsom described as an illegal federalization of state troops. Newsom condemned Trump's actions as a step towards authoritarianism, highlighting the unprecedented nature of a president calling for the arrest of a sitting governor. The situation is further complicated by the arrest of labor leader David Huerta on felony conspiracy charges related to impeding an officer during the protests. The political climate is tense, with both sides accusing each other of overreach and abuse of power. Optimism regarding a quick resolution to the conflict is low, given the deep partisan divisions and the legal challenges underway.</p>

          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on the set of 'It Ends With Us.' Lively had filed a suit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios, claiming harassment and retaliation, which Baldoni argued was a smear campaign to ruin his career. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to adequately prove that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion or that she was responsible for defamatory statements beyond her lawsuit, which is considered privileged. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication, while Baldoni has been granted the opportunity to amend and refile allegations related to interference with contracts.</p>

Rudd, who took her own life in May 2022, was the youngest girl charged with terrorism offences in the UK, but charges were dropped after the Home Office determined she was exploited.

          <p>President Donald Trump said it would be a 'great thing' if border czar Tom Homan arrested California Governor Gavin Newsom, escalating tensions amid immigration protests in Los Angeles. Newsom responded by accusing Trump of authoritarianism, stating that calling for the arrest of a sitting governor crosses a line. Trump also labeled the protesters as 'professional agitators' and 'insurrectionists,' further fueling the conflict between the federal government and California officials. The situation highlights the deep divisions over immigration policy and the use of federal authority in response to local protests.</p>

          <p>An Italian referendum aimed at granting faster citizenship to certain immigrants and strengthening labor rights failed due to low voter turnout, influenced by calls for a boycott from Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and right-wing parties. The referendum sought to reduce the naturalization period from 10 to 5 years and liberalize the labor market, addressing Italy's aging population and low birthrate. With turnout far below the required 50%, the referendum was declared void, highlighting a crisis of democracy according to trade union leader Maurizio Landini. The outcome reflects the ongoing debate over immigration policies and national identity in Italy.</p>

          <p>A new study in JAMA Pediatrics reveals a significant increase in firearm-related deaths among children following the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago Supreme Court decision, which gave states greater power to set their own gun laws. The study found that over 7,000 more children died from firearm-related injuries in the years following the decision, with most deaths occurring in states that made it easier to purchase and carry firearms. The increase in deaths was specific to firearms and not part of a broader rise in youth mortality, with non-Hispanic Black children and teens disproportionately affected in states with loosened gun laws. Researchers emphasize the need for evidence-based policymaking and tailored approaches to address gun violence, comparing gun laws to nationwide mandates for child car seats.</p>
