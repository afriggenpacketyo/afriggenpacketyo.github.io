          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors has caused mixed reactions in Asian markets. Japanese chip-related stocks like Tokyo Electron saw declines, while South Korean giants Samsung and SK Hynix, along with Taiwan's TSMC, rose on expectations of exemptions due to their significant investments in U.S. manufacturing facilities. The policy aims to incentivize domestic production by waiving the tariff for companies building plants in the United States. Analysts note that large, well-capitalized firms are positioned to benefit most from this new trade dynamic. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the Justice Department, he met with an individual he believed was a Russian government representative to hand over the sensitive material.

          <p>A significant technology issue prompted United Airlines to ground its mainline flights across the country, causing hours of delays at major hubs like Chicago O'Hare, Denver, and Newark. The airline confirmed the problem was internal and not related to cybersecurity, resolving it after several hours but warning of residual disruptions. According to reports, United is treating the event as a preventable delay, indicating that the company will cover customer expenses such as hotel stays where applicable.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a plan to levy a 100% tariff on imported computer chips, a move aimed at compelling companies to manufacture domestically. The policy would exempt firms that build or commit to building facilities in the United States, directly affecting the cost of electronics, vehicles, and appliances. This "stick" approach contrasts sharply with the Biden administration's "carrot" strategy, which used subsidies via the CHIPS Act to encourage U.S. production. While major international players like TSMC and Samsung are expected to be exempt due to their U.S. investments, the policy could be devastating for other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

He praised the agency for arresting dangerous criminals, including terrorists, murderers, and those who commit violent crimes. The article contrasts his claims with nonpublic data suggesting most ICE detainees have no criminal convictions. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security used an image from "South Park" in its own recruitment post, prompting a satirical response from the show's creators amid a major ICE hiring campaign.</p>

Known for his highly percussive and innovative piano style, he fused Afro-Caribbean rhythms with jazz, creating a new sound with his orchestra, La Perfecta, in the 1960s and 70s. Born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, Palmieri won multiple Grammy awards, including for his landmark 1974 album "The Sun of Latin Music." He was recognized as a National Endowment for the Humanities Jazz Master, leaving behind a profound legacy that shaped the course of salsa and Latin jazz.</p>

          <p>French authorities have stripped the residency permit of a 47-year-old Moroccan man who was arrested for desecrating the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris. The man was captured on video lighting a cigarette from the eternal flame at the base of the Arc de Triomphe, an act that sparked widespread outrage. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau described the incident as "indecent and pathetic," and the man was taken into custody for violating a burial site. The memorial honors a soldier killed in World War I and is a deeply respected national monument in France.</p>

          <p>Louisiana officials have canceled the $3 billion Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, which was designed to rebuild the state's rapidly disappearing coastal wetlands. The project aimed to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to naturally restore marshland, which serves as a critical buffer against hurricane storm surge. The cancellation, directed by Governor Jeff Landry, came after strong opposition from the local fishing industry, which feared the diversion would harm their livelihoods. Coastal scientists and advocates argue that without large-scale restoration projects like this, Louisiana's coastline and communities remain critically vulnerable to future land loss and severe storms.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given China two weeks to provide unredacted plans for its proposed new embassy in London, located near the city's financial district. The government is scrutinizing the project due to fears of potential espionage and security risks to nearby residents, who also worry about large protests. The plan, which would create the largest embassy in Europe, was previously rejected by the local council but resubmitted after the recent change in government.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study from the World Weather Attribution group concludes that climate change likely made Pakistan's recent monsoon rains heavier and its floods more dangerous. Researchers found that rainfall was approximately 10% to 15% more intense due to global warming, which allows the atmosphere to hold more moisture. The severe weather has resulted in at least 300 deaths this season, with many victims crushed by collapsing buildings in flood-prone urban areas. The report underscores Pakistan's vulnerability to extreme weather, coming just a few years after the catastrophic floods of 2022.</p>

          <p>A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that councils in inner London are poised to be the biggest losers under a government plan to reform local authority funding. Some boroughs like Camden and Westminster could see their funding drop by as much as 12% after accounting for inflation. The new system, set to be phased in from 2026, aims to redistribute funds based on updated needs, redirecting money to areas with more lower-band council tax properties. While outer London and other urban areas are expected to benefit, the proposed changes are projected to create a significant financial challenge for the affected inner London councils.

          <p>Airbnb reported second-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The company earned $1.03 per share on $3.10 billion in revenue, compared to expectations of 93 cents per share and $3.04 billion in revenue. Despite what the company called a volatile macroeconomic backdrop, travel demand remained strong, with nights and seats booked up 7% from the previous year. For the upcoming third quarter, Airbnb provided a revenue forecast that aligns with analyst expectations and announced a new share repurchase program of up to $6 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook described the recent U.S. jobs report as "concerning," pointing to significant downward revisions in hiring for May and June as a potential signal of an economic shift. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 258,000 fewer jobs were created than initially estimated, a revision Cook noted is typical of economic turning points. She also spoke of an "uncertainty tax" weighing on businesses as they navigate new tariffs and a slowing economy. The comments provide insight into the Fed's thinking following a weaker-than-expected jobs report that has been a subject of political controversy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has defended his firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner by claiming the agency manipulated jobs data before the 2024 election, but the actual timeline of events contradicts his account. This article provides a fact-check, noting that a major downward revision of 818,000 jobs occurred in August 2024, months before the election, not after. Furthermore, the final jobs report before the election showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which Trump himself used to attack his opponent at the time. Experts assert that it would be nearly impossible for a BLS commissioner to rig the data as the president has alleged. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report highlights a growing crisis in Florida's home insurance market, warning that parts of the state could become uninsurable due to the increasing risk of extreme weather events. In Fort Myers Beach, for example, average annual premiums have surged from $9,000 in 2019 to $14,000 in 2024. This trend is fueled by warmer oceans and rising sea levels, which create conditions for more frequent and devastating hurricanes like 2022's Hurricane Ian. As private insurers raise rates or exit the state altogether, Florida's state-backed insurer is forced to take on more risk, impacting property values and the state's economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could deliver a significant blow to India's economy, though the impact will be concentrated in specific sectors. While only about 2% of India's GDP is tied to U.S. exports, industries like gems and jewellery, apparel, textiles, and chemicals are particularly vulnerable. However, major Indian export categories such as IT services and pharmaceuticals are currently exempt from the duties, which may insulate the broader market and investors to some degree. The tariffs are a response to India's oil trade with Russia, escalating trade tensions between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>
