          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, a pioneering American televangelist whose global ministry reached millions, has died at the age of 90. His church announced his passing, noting he had been hospitalized in critical condition after a cardiac arrest in mid-June. Swaggart built a media empire starting in the 1960s with radio sermons, becoming a major figure in televangelism before a significant sex scandal in the late 1980s severely damaged his reputation and organization.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will lose access to a crucial satellite data program by July 31, just as the U.S. enters peak hurricane season. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, operated by the Department of Defense since the 1960s, is being discontinued due to cybersecurity and modernization concerns. While NOAA states its remaining data sources are sufficient, former officials have called the timing of the cutoff "ill-timed, poorly planned, and dangerous," raising concerns about forecasting capabilities.</p>

          <p>The spending package recently passed by Senate Republicans includes a permanent increase to the child tax credit, raising it from $2,000 to $2,200 per child starting in 2025. This provision, which differs from the House version's temporary $2,500 credit, aims to provide more financial relief to families. However, policy experts note that due to the credit's partial refundability rules, the lowest-income families may still be unable to access the full benefit, limiting its impact for those most in need.

          <p>With credit card balances and interest rates at record highs, debt consolidation can be a useful tool for managing finances, but it requires careful preparation. This article advises consumers to first calculate their complete debt picture, including all balances, interest rates, and fees, to establish a clear baseline. Secondly, individuals should thoroughly shop around and understand all consolidation options, such as personal loans and balance transfer cards, comparing their respective terms and costs. Finally, exploring debt consolidation programs offered by relief companies can be a viable alternative for those who may not qualify for traditional loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has added a new product to his extensive line of personal merchandise: a branded perfume and cologne collection called "Victory 45-47." Priced at $249, the fragrance is described by Trump as being "all about Winning, Strength, and Success." This new venture joins other Trump-branded items like sneakers and Bibles, which, according to financial disclosures, generated $2.5 million in income for him last year, raising continued concerns from government watchdog groups about potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed states it is withholding more than $6 billion in federal education grants, a day before the funds were expected to be dispersed. The Education Department stated it is reviewing funding for several programs, including those for migrant education, teacher professional development, and after-school activities.

          <p>A business school professor and CEO suggests that job seekers should always ask one crucial question at the end of an interview to understand a company's true values: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" The question often elicits more honest and revealing answers than direct inquiries about company culture, exposing the real day-to-day work environment. Examples of responses include mentioning people who don't want to text on weekends or those who are too social, providing valuable insight for candidates to determine if the company is a good personal fit.</p>
