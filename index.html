          <p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) is taking over the investigation into claims that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused children in Rotherham during the 1990s and early 2000s. This decision follows calls for transparency, as the allegations involve former officers from the same force. The claims, brought by five women who were victims of grooming gangs, include one harrowing account of a woman who said she was raped by a serving officer in a police car. The move to an independent NCA investigation has been welcomed as a step toward ensuring victims remain the central focus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stark contrast has emerged between the global legal view on climate change and current U.S. policy. The International Court of Justice recently issued a unanimous opinion stating that countries have a binding legal obligation to protect the climate system, making failure to do so an illegal act. A week later, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced a plan to rescind its 2009 endangerment finding for greenhouse gases, the legal foundation for most federal climate regulations. This move highlights a growing divergence, with the U.S. appearing to abdicate climate responsibility while international law moves toward greater accountability.</p>

          <p>Shares of the salad chain Sweetgreen dropped by over 25% after the company reduced its financial outlook for the second time in two quarters. The company cited a combination of internal and external pressures for the poor performance, including challenges with its new loyalty program, weaker consumer spending, and the impact of tariffs. Sweetgreen now projects a full-year revenue of $700 million to $715 million, down significantly from its initial forecast. CEO Jonathan Neman described it as a "really, really rough quarter," acknowledging that the company is focused on improving store operations and customer satisfaction.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine has expired, leaving uncertainty about whether the U.S. will impose threatened "secondary tariffs" on countries buying Russian oil. The president, who has expressed growing frustration with Vladimir Putin, had set the deadline to pressure Moscow into ending the conflict. Despite eleventh-hour diplomatic talks, no deal has been announced. When asked about the deadline, Trump stated it was "up to" Putin and that he was "very disappointed," leaving markets and international observers waiting to see if the administration will follow through with the steep penalties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to increase the presence of federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C., deploying officers from agencies including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and Secret Service. This move follows an alleged assault on a former government staffer and a threat from the president to "federalize" the city if it doesn't address crime. The operation will focus on tourist areas and known hotspots. The deployment comes despite D.C. police data showing that violent crime, including robberies and assaults, has significantly decreased in 2025 compared to the previous year.</p>

Experts suggest this would allow manufacturers to align their vehicle production more closely with current consumer demand, which has seen a slight stall in EV adoption. However, the industry's long-term investment in EVs and global competition may temper any drastic immediate shifts in strategy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Commerce to develop a census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for apportioning congressional seats. This move represents a significant and legally contentious change to the decennial census, which the Constitution requires to be an "actual enumeration" of all persons. A previous attempt by the administration to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census was blocked by the Supreme Court. The new effort faces a long legal and logistical runway but could have profound impacts on political representation and federal funding.</p>

          <p>The UK fashion retailer River Island has received High Court approval for a major restructuring plan to prevent its collapse. The plan involves closing 33 stores and seeking rent reductions at 71 others, which the company says is necessary due to a customer shift to online shopping and rising operating costs. The brand had warned it was at risk of running out of cash if the turnaround proposal was not approved. The restructuring, which also includes about 110 head office redundancies, is intended to create a strong platform for the company's future.</p>

          <h2>Explaining the Current Price of Gold and Its Influencing Factors</h2>

          <p>This article details the current market price of gold and explores the key factors that influence its fluctuations. As a traditional safe-haven asset, gold's value is affected by supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Its price, denominated in U.S. dollars, also has an inverse relationship with interest rates and can be impacted by currency movements and the policies of central banks. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors considering gold as part of their portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Togo's Constitutional Changes Raise Concerns of a New Blueprint for Authoritarian Rule</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 09:22:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent constitutional amendments in Togo have allowed President Faure Gnassingbe to shift to a newly created, unelected position as president of the Council of Ministers while retaining most of his executive power. Critics and human rights activists have denounced this as a "constitutional coup," designed to allow the Gnassingbe family, which has ruled for 58 years, to maintain power indefinitely without facing direct elections. This development is seen by observers as a worrying model that could inspire other authoritarian-leaning leaders on the African continent to further entrench their rule.</p>

          <p>Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope have found compelling evidence of a giant gas planet located in Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to our own. At just four-and-a-half light-years away, the potential planet is an astronomical neighbor and orbits a star similar to our Sun. Although the gas giant itself could not support life, researchers are excited about the possibility that it could have habitable moons. Further observations are needed to confirm the planet's existence and to analyze its composition.</p>

          <h2>High Turnover Rate Sees Only One Manager Remain in Championship from Last Season</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 09:04:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The highly competitive and "brutal" nature of England's Championship football league is highlighted by a stark statistic: only one manager has kept his job from the start of last season. Of the 18 teams that competed in the league in both the 2024-25 and 2025-26 seasons, Portsmouth's John Mousinho is the sole survivor. This high turnover rate, which saw 11 clubs appoint new managers just since May, contrasts sharply with the relative stability in the Premier League and lower divisions, underscoring the immense pressure for results in the second tier.</p>

          <h2>Ohio Planned Parenthood Affiliate to Stop Accepting Medicaid Amid Legal Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 09:00:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Ohio affiliate of Planned Parenthood has announced it will no longer accept Medicaid insurance, citing the financial risk posed by ongoing legal battles with the Trump administration. The affiliate fears that if a court injunction currently protecting its federal funding is overturned, the government could attempt to "claw back" any reimbursements. This decision, along with another Ohio affiliate's move to stop offering long-acting contraceptives to Medicaid patients, highlights the severe operational and financial pressures that healthcare providers are facing due to the uncertain legal and political landscape.</p>
