          <p>Jamie Borthwick, an actor on the British soap opera EastEnders, has been suspended by the BBC after using a slur against people with disabilities on the set of Strictly Come Dancing.

The BBC condemned his language as "entirely unacceptable" and stated that it does not reflect the values or standards they uphold, and Borthwick apologized for any offense caused.

          <p>A death row inmate, Julian Mendez, was killed at Kern Valley State Prison in California after being attacked by fellow inmate Mario Renteria, which then escalated into a mob assault involving over 30 inmates.

Mendez suffered multiple wounds and was pronounced dead at the prison's triage area. Renteria is currently in restricted housing pending investigation, and officials are limiting population movement to facilitate the investigation.</p>
