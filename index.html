          <p>Honeywell and Dover executives provided positive updates at a Bank of America conference, indicating that reduced U.S.-China tariffs are improving their business outlook. Honeywell anticipates lower tariff exposure due to the temporary agreement between the two countries, with CFO Mike Stepniak estimating a $100 million reduction in tariff exposure, and he also expressed confidence in meeting fiscal guidance, citing strong orders in April and May. Dover's CFO, Chris Woenker, highlighted the company's advantage due to its North American manufacturing footprint and low China exposure, with ongoing efforts to reshore production to the U.S. Both companies emphasized their ability to manage tariffs through strategic price hikes and supply chain adjustments.

          <p>Kseniia Petrova, a Harvard Medical School researcher who fled Russia in 2022 due to her opposition to the war in Ukraine, is facing deportation back to Russia by the Trump administration.

The government formally stated its intention to deport her to Russia during a court hearing, raising concerns among scientists and academics, and Harvard faculty and students attended the hearing in support of Petrova. Judge Christina Reiss scheduled a bail hearing, potentially paving the way for her release, and the case has drawn attention due to concerns over the treatment of international academics.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to consider the legality of President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, a principle long upheld under the 14th Amendment. Trump has argued that the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States, is misunderstood and primarily about slavery. The case originated from a legal theory popularized by John Eastman, who later advised Trump on overturning the 2020 election. The court will primarily focus on whether federal judges can issue nationwide injunctions, but the underlying issue of birthright citizenship remains central to the debate.</p>

Newsom unveiled a revised spending plan that proposes cuts to healthcare for low-income undocumented immigrants and reductions in other state programs. The new deficit is in addition to $27.3 billion in fiscal remedies already agreed upon, including cuts and withdrawals from the state's rainy day fund. Newsom's budget includes a controversial proposal to grab funding from Proposition 35 and shift funding for Cal Fire from the general fund.</p>

This action follows the Trump administration's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dropping a similar suit against Capital One.

Alternatives like a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan should also be considered to potentially lower interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than a thousand inmates will be released early in England and Wales to free up spaces in prisons grappling with an overcrowding crisis. The justice secretary announced that offenders serving one to four years who are recalled to prison for breaching their licenses will be released after 28 days. This measure aims to free up approximately 1,400 prison places and provide ministers with time to overhaul the system, which is described as being "on the brink of collapse." The government projects that it will run out of prison places for male offenders by November without this action.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez are closer to potential freedom after a judge reduced their sentences for the 1989 killings of their parents to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole. Their family and supporters celebrated the decision, which means they will soon appear before the parole board. The brothers confessed to the killings, claiming they acted in self-defense due to long-term sexual abuse by their father, while prosecutors argued they killed their parents for financial gain. The case has garnered renewed attention in recent years, with increased focus on their allegations of abuse and support from criminal justice reform advocates.</p>

Republicans, however, claim the purpose is to protect Medicaid beneficiaries, despite intending to use the savings on a regressive tax cut.

          <p>President Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, marking the first meeting between the leaders of the United States and Syria in 25 years, and announced a plan to lift sanctions on Syria. The meeting, facilitated by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, represents a significant shift in U.S. policy toward Syria. Trump urged al-Sharaa to normalize relations with Israel and remove foreign terrorists from the country. The meeting was described as "historic" by the Syrian Foreign Ministry, signaling Syria's reintegration into the international community.</p>
