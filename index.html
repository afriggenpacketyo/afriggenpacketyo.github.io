          <p>Protests in Kenya against the government have resulted in at least 31 deaths and over 100 injuries in a single day, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. The demonstrations, which call for improved governance, police accountability, and the removal of President William Ruto, coincided with the anniversary of historic pro-democracy protests. Despite police blockades, Kenyans took to the streets, prompting the UN to call for calm and for the protesters' grievances to be addressed. The violence marks a significant escalation in the ongoing civil unrest.</p>

          <p>A new book by columnist Christine Brennan alleges that an anonymous WNBA official believes the league's players are unprepared for increased media attention. The official's comments, featured in "On Her Game: Caitlin Clark and the Revolution in Women's Sports," suggest that players don't understand "real media exposure" or how to handle critical questions. The book details a specific confrontation between Brennan and players DiJonai Carrington and DeWanna Bonner, which prompted a strong reaction from the players' association. This highlights a growing tension between the rapidly expanding league and the media covering it.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against five non-profits that sued the Trump administration for rescinding millions in public safety grants, stating he lacked the authority to reverse the decision. Judge Amit P. Mehta described the cuts to programs aimed at preventing gun violence, substance abuse, and hate crimes as "shameful" and likely to harm vulnerable communities. The Department of Justice had redirected the funds to support law enforcement operations and combat violent crime. The ruling leaves the non-profit organizations without the contested grant funding, highlighting a significant shift in federal public safety priorities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a forthcoming 50% tariff on all copper imports, a move intended to bolster domestic production of the essential metal. The announcement caused copper prices to surge to a record high and boosted the stock value of U.S. copper miners like Freeport-McMoRan. The U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile. According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the tariff aims to bring copper production back to the United States and aligns with similar duties recently placed on steel and aluminum.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly rebuked longtime bullish analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, telling him to "Shut up" on the social media platform X. The comment was in response to Ives's suggestions that the Tesla board should rein in Musk's political activities and establish "guardrails" for his time commitment to the company. Ives's note to investors followed a drop in Tesla's stock price and expressed concern that Musk's new political party was a distraction. The exchange highlights growing unease even among Tesla's staunchest supporters regarding Musk's ventures outside the company.</p>

          <p>A senior White House economic adviser, Stephen Miran, downplayed the risk of President Trump's tariffs causing significant inflation, comparing the likelihood to that of "a meteorite striking Earth." Speaking on CNBC, Miran argued that despite widespread fears, there has been no evidence of broad price increases resulting from the tariffs so far. He promoted a White House report showing that import prices had actually fallen between December and May. Critics argue that the full impact of the tariffs has not yet been felt due to implementation delays and corporate stockpiling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Essence Festival has publicly taken responsibility for a performance by Lauryn Hill that began at 2:30 a.m., long after its scheduled time. Organizers stated the delay was due to their own production issues, not the artist, who is famously known for her tardiness. The festival's statement came after fellow performer Stephanie Mills issued an open letter criticizing the event's lack of professionalism, chaotic time management, and technical problems. The incident has sparked a broader conversation about the operational challenges and artist experiences at the major cultural event.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that real estate investors are purchasing a growing share of U.S. homes, accounting for nearly 27% of sales in the first quarter of the year. This trend reflects a housing market where high prices and mortgage rates are sidelining traditional homebuyers, creating opportunities for cash-rich investors. The market has slowed significantly, leading to higher inventory and longer selling times, which benefits those who can bypass typical financing. The report notes that the majority of these investors are smaller, "mom-and-pop" operations, not large institutional firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hotel Oloffson, an iconic 19th-century mansion in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, has been burned down amid escalating gang violence in the capital. The hotel was a cultural beacon, hosting luminaries from Mick Jagger to Jackie Kennedy Onassis and immortalized in Graham Greene's novel "The Comedians." For decades, it was also home to the manager's popular band, RAM, making it a center of Haitian cultural life. Its destruction is a symbolic loss for a nation already ravaged by violence, with gangs controlling nearly 90% of the capital.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's "Reconnaissance General Bureau," for his involvement in a fraudulent IT worker scheme. The scheme involves recruiting North Korean operatives to pose as American remote workers, using stolen U.S. identities to secure jobs at foreign companies. The income generated from this global fraud is then funneled back to support Kim Jong Un's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt North Korea's illicit fundraising through cyber espionage.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing requirement for travelers to remove their shoes at some U.S. airport security checkpoints. The rule, in place since 2006, was a response to the 2001 "shoe bomber" attempt. Travelers at several airports have reported passing through security with their shoes on, and officials have confirmed the change at some locations. While the TSA has not made a formal nationwide announcement, the move is seen as an effort to enhance the passenger experience and speed up screening lines with modern technology.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece describes a recent immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park as a "farce" and a "Battle of the Photo Op" orchestrated by the Trump administration. The author argues that the massive show of federal force, complete with agents on horseback and tactical gear, was a spectacle designed for media attention rather than effective enforcement. The article contends that these raids, which have detained over 1,600 people, are a reckless waste of taxpayer money. It frames the operation as a warning to other cities and a microcosm of the administration's focus on spectacle over substance.</p>

          <p>An unusually large swarm of over 400 small earthquakes was detected beneath Washington's Mount Rainier on Tuesday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The tremors, with the strongest reaching magnitude 1.7, are occurring at a shallow depth below the volcano's summit. Scientists have stated there are no other signs of volcanic unrest, such as ground deformation or gas emissions. They attribute the earthquake swarm to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids interacting with existing fault lines, a phenomenon that has occurred in the past, most recently in 2009.</p>
