            <p>In Medford, Oregon, the disappearance of Aaron Friar and his daughter Ellie sparked a frantic investigation. Detective Bill Ford's hunch about Russell Jones, a talkative suspect, led to an unusual interrogation tactic involving a cigarette break. During this break, Jones confessed to helping dispose of Aaron's body, guiding police to the remains. This confession unraveled a complex case involving forbidden love and a brutal murder, ultimately leading to convictions for Gavin MacFarlane, Ellie Friar, and Russell Jones. Optimism remains low given the violent nature of the crime and the betrayal within a family.</p>
