          <p>Germany's governing coalition has approved an 8% cut to its foreign aid and development budget, reducing it to under €10 billion. Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan acknowledged this is insufficient given rising global crises but differentiated the cuts from more severe ones made by the US. Aid organizations have warned of dire consequences, stating the reductions could leave millions without food aid and over a million people without basic healthcare, exacerbating instability in crisis regions.</p>

Leaders from the three nations stated the decision is a coordinated effort to build momentum for peace and is not a reward for Hamas, which they still classify as a terror organization. This symbolic but historic decision has been met with strong opposition from Israel and the United States, who argue it legitimizes terrorism.</p>

Securing a total of five medals, the team met the low end of its target but recorded its joint-lowest overall medal count since 2005. The performance has prompted reflection, with officials and former athletes citing missed opportunities and challenging conditions, including extreme heat and humidity, as contributing factors.</p>

          <p>For the first time in almost 100 years, hundreds of swimmers participated in an organized event in the Chicago River, marking a significant milestone in the waterway's recovery. Once a notoriously polluted industrial sewer, the river has been transformed over the last 50 years due to environmental regulations like the Clean Water Act and local cleanup efforts. The event symbolizes a dramatic shift in public perception and highlights the potential for urban waterway restoration across the United States.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has deemed comments by U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner criticizing France's handling of antisemitism as "unacceptable" for a diplomat. Kushner had publicly linked France's foreign policy, including its move to recognize a Palestinian state, to a rise in antisemitism, a connection Macron firmly rejected. The French president emphasized that while anti-Zionism can be a form of antisemitism, disagreeing with the Israeli government's policies does not make one antisemitic, highlighting a significant diplomatic rift.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas is poised to significantly impact India's $283 billion IT industry, which relies heavily on the program.

This policy shift is expected to challenge the traditional onsite-offshore strategy, potentially affecting project timelines and profit margins for companies serving major U.S. clients.</p>

          <p>Matt Beard, the former manager of Liverpool's women's team who led them to consecutive Women's Super League titles in 2013 and 2014, has died at the age of 47. He was remembered fondly by former players and colleagues, including Fara Williams, who described him as a "great mentor and friend" with the "purest of souls." Beard had a significant impact on the growth of women's football in England, with a managerial career that also included spells at Chelsea, West Ham, and Bristol City.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has dismissed former U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that the U.S. could retake control of Bagram Air Base. A Taliban spokesman reiterated that Afghanistan's territorial integrity is paramount and cited the Doha Agreement, in which the U.S. pledged not to threaten the country's independence. Trump had claimed discussions were underway to get the base back, a strategic asset abandoned during the chaotic 2021 U.S. withdrawal, but the Taliban's public statement firmly denies any such possibility.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, while McLaren's Oscar Piastri, the current championship leader, crashed out on the opening lap. Piastri's mistake allowed his teammate and main rival, Lando Norris, to slightly close the points gap, though Norris finished in seventh after a frustrating race stuck in traffic. The win marks Verstappen's fourth of the season and reinforces the sense that Red Bull is mounting a late-season challenge for the title.</p>

          <p>Historians and political theorists observe a recurring pattern where authoritarian and fascist regimes promote traditional domesticity for women to maintain social stability and advance state ideology. By glorifying roles centered on "children, kitchen, and church," these movements can make women feel valued while simultaneously rolling back rights related to reproductive health and workplace equality. This dynamic is being observed today in the rise of the online "womanosphere," which promotes traditional femininity and homemaking, echoing historical strategies used to align women's unpaid labor with a nationalist agenda.</p>

          <p>China has entered the top 10 of the UN's Global Innovation Index for the first time, an achievement that some analysts argue demonstrates the ineffectiveness of U.S. tech containment strategies. Instead of stifling China's progress, policies like export controls and blacklisting have spurred massive domestic investment in research and development, accelerating the nation's drive for technological self-sufficiency. This outcome suggests that U.S. attempts at decoupling may be inadvertently catalyzing the very innovation they were intended to slow down.</p>
