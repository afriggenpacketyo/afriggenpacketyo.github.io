            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House cannot exclude Associated Press reporters and photographers from covering events in the Oval Office and on Air Force One. The ruling stated that blocking AP journalists due to their reporting viewpoint violates the First Amendment. This decision comes after the White House curtailed AP's access following a disagreement over the name of the Gulf of Mexico. The judge's order is temporarily paused to allow the White House time to appeal, affirming the press's right to cover the government without viewpoint-based retaliation.</p>

            <p>Nearly three years after its launch, the 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline faces understaffing and underfunding challenges. Despite a 40% increase in calls since its launch in 2022, access to care after initial calls has not increased. Public health services nationwide could face further federal cuts. Experts emphasize the need for more resources, therapists, and technology to improve the hotline's effectiveness. Cuts could lead to more hospitalizations, deaths, and mental health issues.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang, using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court clarified that those subject to removal are entitled to judicial review. The decision split 5-4, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the liberal justices in dissent. The court stated that detainees must receive notice and a chance to challenge their deportation. This decision comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary.</p>

            <p>President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being gang members has triggered legal challenges. The Supreme Court has cleared the way for deportations to resume, but said that individuals subject to removal are entitled to judicial review. The law, enacted in 1798, allows the president to detain and deport citizens of an enemy nation during war or invasion. The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history.</p>

The sell-off began after President Trump unveiled tariffs on imports from almost every nation. The 104% tariff rate is a result of an escalation in the trade war. Analysts say the tariffs threaten the long-term growth of U.S. businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A public feud has erupted between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro, with Navarro claiming Tesla is merely a car assembler using foreign parts. Musk refuted this, stating Tesla has the most American-made cars. Data shows Tesla's Model 3 Long Range sources 75% of its parts from the U.S. or Canada. The Model Y tops the Cars.com "Made in America" index. While tariffs on car parts are expected to disrupt the industry, Tesla is projected to be less affected than its rivals.</p>
