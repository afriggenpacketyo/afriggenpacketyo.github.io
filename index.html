          <h2>Thames Water Pauses Executive Bonus Scheme Amid Public Outcry</h2>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to halt its executive bonus scheme, responding to criticism from the government and public regarding potential payouts amidst the company's financial struggles and environmental performance. The decision follows accusations that the company was attempting to bypass regulations aimed at preventing water companies from awarding bonuses despite mismanagement and failures. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with both turnaround objectives and public expectations. Thames Water has faced scrutiny over sewage discharges, leaks, and its Â£20bn debt, requiring a Â£3bn emergency loan to avoid collapse, and the government has expressed strong disapproval of executives being rewarded despite these issues.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old man in California, Jordan Murray, is accused of murder after being released from jail on 'mental health diversion' just six months prior. Murray allegedly committed two violent robberies in May and June of 2024, leading to his initial incarceration, but was released in November due to his mental health. He is now charged with the May 18 stabbing death of a 40-year-old man, with authorities noting the incident as a 'completely preventable murder.'

          <p>A leaked memo from Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department reveals internal discussions within the Labour party regarding potential tax increases prior to the Spring Statement. The memo suggested raising taxes by Â£3bn to Â£4bn annually, a proposal not implemented by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who instead opted for welfare cuts. The memo included proposals like increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. This highlights ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding fiscal policy, particularly concerning welfare cuts and alternative revenue-raising measures.</p>

          <p>A third man, Petro Pochynok, has been charged in connection with alleged arson attacks at properties linked to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Pochynok, a Ukrainian national, faces charges of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, joining two other men, Roman Lavrynovych and Stanislav Carpiuc, already charged in connection with the fires. The charges relate to three incidents, including a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at the prime minister's private home, and a fire at an address where he previously lived.

While Nvidia's market share in China has decreased, Chinese companies are still conducting A.I. research using domestically produced chips.

However, the new pope's choice of name signals a potential confrontation with Trumpian nationalism, as he aims to address issues like inequality, climate change, and migration. Pope Leo XIV intends to follow in the footsteps of Leo XIII, who confronted the ruthless economics of the Industrial Revolution, promoting social solidarity and a just wage. This stance challenges the nationalistic and insular form of solidarity embraced by the Maga movement, setting the stage for a clash over Catholic social teaching.</p>

Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stated that this measure is intended to protect residents' lives and daily living, given declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer.

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to meet with Donald Trump at the White House to address strained relations between the two countries. The U.S. administration has repeatedly criticized Pretoria for alleged persecution of white Afrikaner farmers, which South Africa denies. Ramaphosa aims to correct Trump's misconceptions about race relations and his government's policies, with a vital free trade agreement at stake. The meeting comes after Trump's televised hostility towards Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, raising concerns about a similar reception for Ramaphosa.</p>

          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses report that operating in China has become increasingly challenging, citing regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, and geopolitical uncertainties. The British Chamber of Commerce in China is calling for a more favorable policy environment with clear and consistently enforced rules. Despite these challenges, British firms remain substantially engaged with and committed to the Chinese market. Escalating tensions between China and the US are also causing many British firms to delay investments in China and globally, highlighting deeper structural and geopolitical concerns.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned following an uproar over his remark that he had never bought a bag of rice, which is currently in short supply nationally. The comment drew attention to the government's failure to resolve the rice shortage, driving up prices and causing frustration among voters. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister to address the issue. The shortage has been attributed to decades-old policies protecting small-time farmers, which have hindered new entrants and left land uncultivated.</p>

Farm minister Taku Eto resigned after facing backlash over a remark about rice prices, and Shinjiro Koizumi was picked as the new agriculture minister. Japan reported a trade deficit in April due to export growth failing to offset imports. The G7 aims for stability despite tensions over U.S. tariffs, according to Canada. Japan will give South Koreans fast-track entry in June to mark the anniversary of diplomatic ties.

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to pressure them to pass a budget package containing his legislative priorities, but divisions within the party threatened to derail the plan.

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall 'mega tsunami' could potentially devastate parts of America's West Coast if a strong earthquake hits the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the region within the next 50 years, potentially sinking coastal land and inundating cities like Seattle and Portland. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this earthquake would happen within minutes, leaving no time for adaptation or mitigation. The most severe effects would be felt in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California, with Alaska and Hawaii also at risk.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that the United States' export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China were a failure, as companies were turning to locally-developed cutting-edge technology. Huang said that companies would use the 'second best' option if they couldn't get chips from the American AI leader. The US curbs on sales of state-of-the-art AI chips to China have forced companies there to buy semiconductors from Chinese designers like Huawei. The American action has also pushed China to aggressively invest and develop a supply chain that is not dependent on foreign manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, provided an incorrect definition of habeas corpus during a Senate hearing, stating it was the president's 'constitutional right' to deport people. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem, explaining that habeas corpus is the legal right of people to challenge their detention by the government. Noem's answer reflected the Trump administration's view of presidential power, turning a shield against unlawful detention into broad presidential authority. The incident occurred amid discussions about suspending habeas corpus for immigrants, a move legal experts say only Congress can authorize.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has considered suspending habeas corpus, a foundational principle of the Constitution that protects people from unlawful detention. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly described it as the presidentâ€™s right to deport people, highlighting confusion about its purpose. Habeas corpus ensures that people are not detained without valid legal grounds, allowing individuals to challenge their detention in court. While the Constitution allows Congress to suspend habeas corpus during rebellion or invasion, the executive branch cannot do so unilaterally, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in cases involving GuantÃ¡namo Bay detainees.</p>
