          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant collapse in its commercial honeybee colonies, while China's bee population has surged to a record high, solidifying its status as the world's top apiary producer. Researchers attribute this divergence to different management styles. American beekeeping often involves large, clustered operations with minimal intervention, whereas Chinese practices are more hands-on. This contrast highlights how varying agricultural and apicultural strategies can lead to vastly different outcomes for these crucial pollinators.</p>

          <p>State Representative Nicole Collier, a Texas Democrat, has returned to the state Capitol but is refusing to leave her office or the House chambers due to a mandatory police escort rule. This requirement was imposed on Democrats who left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting effort by denying a quorum. Collier is protesting the escort as an infringement on her rights and a tactic of intimidation, vowing to remain confined until the House reconvenes. The standoff highlights the intense political battle over the proposed new congressional maps in Texas.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied a preliminary injunction for USC's DJ Wingfield and UCLA's Kaedin Robinson, effectively blocking them from playing this season. The players had sued the NCAA, arguing its five-year eligibility rule violated antitrust laws by limiting their potential to earn name, image, and likeness (NIL) compensation. However, the judge ruled that the NCAA's regulation was a true eligibility rule, not a commercial one subject to antitrust scrutiny. This decision deals a significant blow to both athletes and their respective teams.</p>

A notable drop was seen in SoftBank Group's shares, which fell after the company announced a $2 billion investment in Intel.

The Dodgers twice blew leads before the Rockies clinched the victory in the ninth inning with a walk-off single by Warming Bernabel. The winning run was set up by a double that dropped between two Dodgers fielders. The loss ended the Dodgers' winning streak against the Rockies and marked a disappointing start to a series against the last-place team.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed one claim in a lawsuit concerning the controversial 'Alligator Alcatraz' immigrant detention facility in Florida, ruling the issue of court jurisdiction is now moot. Civil rights attorneys had argued that detainees' rights were violated because it was unclear which immigration court could hear their cases. While the judge agreed the government's recent designation of a court resolves that specific issue, he allowed other claims regarding confidential access to lawyers to proceed. The case concerning attorney access has now been transferred to a different federal district.</p>

          <p>A new report from S&P highlights a significant shift in China's trade patterns, with exports to the Global South doubling since 2015. This growth accelerated following the U.S.-China trade war, with these exports rising by 65 percent in the last five years alone. China now sends approximately $1.6 trillion in goods to developing nations, substantially more than its combined exports to the U.S. and Western Europe. This trend suggests a reordering of global commerce as Chinese firms increasingly pivot away from traditional Western markets. (not investment advice)</p>

In 2024, nearly 900 of the 3,133 abandoned seafarers worldwide were Indian nationals. Experts attribute the problem to shipowners who sever ties with crews, failing to pay wages or provide for their repatriation, often after registering ships under flags of convenience in countries with lax regulations. This practice obscures the true ownership and leaves crews stranded in foreign waters, often in precarious situations.</p>

Instead, he proposed a sequence of bilateral and trilateral talks, a process that could take significant time to arrange. This approach, while averting an immediate, unfavorable settlement for Ukraine, allows the conflict to continue while Putin faces little new pressure.</p>

Alibaba claims the tool's performance is on par with industry leaders, attributed to extensive training on coding-specific data. This rise occurs as numerous Chinese tech giants, including ByteDance and Tencent, enter the competitive AI coding market.</p>

          <p>Several of China's coastal provinces are rolling out ambitious economic development plans focused on the marine sector, aligning with a national strategy to bolster the 'blue economy'. Regions like Fujian are prioritizing emerging areas such as digitalized marine governance, offshore energy production, and tourism. Fujian has already launched a provincial marine data platform to aid in decision-making and is expanding its offshore wind and solar power capacity. These initiatives aim to cultivate new sources of economic growth by leveraging the provinces' extensive coastlines and maritime resources.</p>

          <p>A group of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department for imposing new immigration enforcement conditions on federal grants for crime victims. The lawsuit argues that tying billions of dollars in funding to cooperation with federal immigration agents is an illegal attempt to coerce so-called "sanctuary states." The states contend that the rule forces them to choose between forfeiting critical resources for vulnerable victims or compromising the trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities. They are seeking an injunction to block the new conditions.</p>

          <p>The opening of Camp East Montana, a new large-scale migrant detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, was met with protests from immigration advocates over the weekend. Critics are demanding that detainees at the facility, which can hold up to 1,000 people, be given proper access to legal counsel. Democratic Representative Veronica Escobar condemned the high cost of the center, arguing the funds could be better used for community services. The Trump administration defended the facility, stating it is a necessary part of its plan for mass deportations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to fundamentally realign the sport geographically. Speaking at the Little League World Series, Manfred suggested that moving away from the traditional American and National Leagues in favor of regional groupings could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason formats. This potential shift to an East/West conference structure, similar to the NBA, would represent one of the most significant structural changes in the league's history. Expansion could be approved by 2029.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has completed a mission in the Antarctic Peninsula to collect long tubes of seafloor mud, which hold centuries of scientific data. By analyzing the distinct layers of sediment, scientists can reconstruct the history of marine life and measure the impact of human activities, such as industrial whaling. The samples will also be used for environmental DNA analysis to understand how much carbon was stored on the seafloor by whale populations before they were decimated. This research aims to reveal crucial insights into the ocean's role in regulating the global climate.</p>

          <p>Body camera footage described in a new court filing suggests that a top Justice Department official, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, personally ordered the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka in May. The filing states a Homeland Security agent announced he was arresting the mayor "per the deputy attorney general" during a chaotic confrontation at an immigration detention center. This revelation adds to concerns that the Trump administration is using law enforcement for political purposes against its opponents. The trespassing charge against Mayor Baraka was later dropped.</p>

          <p>A landmark wooden church in Kiruna, Sweden, is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5 kilometers away to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The 672-tonne structure, built in 1912, has been placed on giant transporters for the two-day journey to the new city center. This complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the city's buildings away from the expanding mine. The delicate operation will transport the church with its valuable interior, including an altar painting, still inside.</p>

The case was part of a broader effort by a state task force to combat misleading automatic renewal practices.</p>
