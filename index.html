The vehicle struck multiple people outside and inside the building before exiting on the opposite side. State police indicated that the incident does not appear to be a targeted attack, and the cause of the crash is under investigation. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker expressed his administration's monitoring of the situation, while state senator Doris Turner conveyed her heartbreak and readiness to assist local authorities.</p>

House Speaker Mike Johnson hosted the ceremony, recognizing the unit's loyalty to a nation that had long failed to reciprocate.

          <p>Harvard University has announced plans to reform its academic offerings and admissions policies in response to internal reports on antisemitism and anti-Arab prejudice on campus. These reforms come as Harvard is also battling the Trump administration over demands to limit campus activism, which the government claims is necessary to combat antisemitism. Harvard President Alan Garber stated the university will redouble its efforts to ensure it is a place where ideas are welcomed and contested constructively. The reforms include reviewing admissions processes, updating hiring practices, and implementing antisemitism training for students and staff.</p>

The judge, Royce C.

James Wong, a former CBP official, alleges that Scott, then a top Border Patrol official, oversaw a "critical incident team" that sought to mitigate liability for Border Patrol senior management. Wong claims the team unlawfully obtained Hernández Rojas's medical records to spin information for PR purposes. Senator Ron Wyden has called the allegations "deeply troubling" and requested related records from the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

          <p>A California judge has issued an order restricting Border Patrol agents from arresting individuals suspected of living in the U.S. illegally without a warrant or reasonable suspicion that they may flee. Judge Jennifer L. Thurston's ruling comes after a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, alleging that Border Patrol agents unconstitutionally detained people based on their appearance. The order requires CBP to submit regular reports detailing arrests and detentions, along with the reasoning behind them. CBP argues that the ruling is unnecessary due to updated agency guidance and training.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed executive orders that roll back some tariffs on carmakers, addressing concerns that the levies would harm U.S. manufacturing. The changes modify the tariffs to prevent carmakers from being subject to multiple levies on imported vehicles and parts. Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, which will be phased out over two years. While the changes are welcomed by automakers, analysts warn that the administration's policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers and their suppliers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to soften some automotive tariffs his administration put into place earlier this month. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies. Additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years. It's unclear how an automaker would get such a reimbursement, but the offer is retroactive to when the tariffs took effect on April 3.</p>

          <p>Japan's industrial output experienced a decline of 1.6% in fiscal year 2024, according to recent reports. This contraction in industrial production reflects broader economic challenges and uncertainties impacting the country's manufacturing sector. The decrease in output may be attributed to factors such as global trade tensions, supply chain disruptions, and shifting consumer demand. Government data indicates that the decline occurred across various industries, signaling a widespread impact on Japan's industrial base.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has temporarily suspended Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan after she was arrested by the FBI and charged with obstructing and impeding a federal proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent arrest. Dugan allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant evade arrest by ICE agents during a court appearance. The court cited its constitutional authority and the need to uphold public confidence in the judiciary as reasons for the suspension. A reserve judge will cover Dugan's cases during her suspension.</p>

          <p>Two dozen states have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over cuts to AmeriCorps, alleging an attempt to "dismantle" the volunteer service organization. The lawsuit claims the cuts violate federal law and separation of powers, as Congress created and funded AmeriCorps. The administration has put 85% of AmeriCorps staff on administrative leave and slashed the National Civilian Community Corps. The White House stated that AmeriCorps has failed consecutive audits and identified millions in improper payments. Governor Gavin Newsom of California stated that these actions by President Trump and Elon Musk vandalize our values, and that California is suing the Trump administration to defend thousands of hardworking service members and the communities they serve.</p>

The announcement contradicts previous comments from officials, who had suggested that some remains showed traces of cremation.

The Trump administration has made immigration arrests with the state's help, and a detention center has added capacity to deal with overcrowding. The laws have entangled every level of state government and led to threats against city council members who opposed cooperating with federal officials.

Cramer criticized both political parties for not adequately supporting investors and highlighted the unpredictability of government actions that can negatively impact companies. He concluded by asserting that his show, 'Mad Money,' aims to help people understand and navigate the stock market, advocating for the advantages of investing over traditional savings accounts.

          <p>A BBC report examines life in the "Forbidden Zone" in northern Iraq, where Turkey has been expanding its military presence in its war against the PKK. The analysis reveals that Turkey has built at least 136 fixed military installations and controls over 2,000 sq km of Iraqi land. The expansion has forced thousands from their land and led to civilian casualties from drone and air strikes. While Iraq's government has condemned Turkey's military presence, it has also accommodated some of Ankara's demands, leading to a complex and precarious situation for the local population.</p>
