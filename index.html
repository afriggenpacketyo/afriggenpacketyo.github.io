        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A critical review of Kamala Harris's memoir, "107 Days," argues that the book exposes a profound lack of self-awareness within Harris and the Democratic party. The article contends that Harris focused excessively on political machinery and celebrity endorsements, rather than articulating a unique vision or diverging from unpopular policies like those concerning Gaza or economic inequality. This approach, according to the review, fostered a disconnect with voters and contributed to the campaign's perceived failure, revealing a party still deluded about its appeal. The piece suggests that the memoir inadvertently highlights the challenges Democrats face in mounting a meaningful challenge to Trumpism.</p>

          <p>A BBC cyber correspondent was targeted by the Medusa ransomware gang, receiving an offer of millions for providing insider access to BBC systems, promising he would "never need to work again." The reporter, acting under editorial advice, engaged with the criminals to understand their modus operandi, which involved demands for login details and a subsequent "MFA bombing" attempt when he delayed. This unique firsthand experience exposed the aggressive recruitment tactics of sophisticated cybercrime groups, believed to operate from Russia, and highlighted the critical vulnerability of organizations to insider threats. The incident underscores the urgent need for heightened awareness and robust security protocols to counteract such pervasive and impactful attacks.</p>

Mykolaienko also voiced concern over civilians being targeted by drones and criticized men not actively contributing to the war effort, stressing the importance of national defense.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs anticipates that China's central bank will likely implement monetary easing in the fourth quarter, predicting a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. This forecast is driven by a significant deceleration in China's economic momentum, with year-on-year growth projected to slow sharply towards 4% from a high base last year. While the People's Bank of China maintained a dovish bias in its recent meeting, a subtle shift in its economic description suggests a more cautious outlook. Policymakers are facing increasing pressure to support growth, making these data-dependent actions crucial for the country's economic stability and future trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The decline of traditional American shopping malls is paradoxically opening up significant real estate opportunities for small, local businesses, including health practitioners, yoga instructors, and artists. With national shopping center vacancy rates increasing and rent growth decelerating, independent retailers are now securing prime commercial spaces with more favorable terms, such as flexible leases and partial fit-outs. This trend allows entrepreneurs to test physical presences without overextending capital, fostering local regeneration and reimagining spaces as community destinations.

          <p>USC women’s basketball star JuJu Watkins has announced she will miss the entire upcoming college basketball season to focus on recovering from a serious knee injury sustained during the NCAA tournament in March. Watkins, a Wooden Award and Naismith Trophy winner who led USC to a Big Ten title, expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support during her challenging healing process. Coach Lindsay Gottlieb confirmed the program's full support, emphasizing Watkins's continued vital role as a leader. While her absence is a significant setback for USC's championship aspirations, the arrival of highly-touted prospect Jazzy Davidson is expected to help mitigate the impact.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has asserted that future nuclear disarmament talks, while initially bilateral between Russia and the U.S., must ultimately include the arsenals of Britain and France. This statement follows Russia's proposal to the U.S. to voluntarily uphold the New START treaty limits for a year post-expiration. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted the integral role of British and French arsenals in overall global and European strategic stability. This position complicates potential arms control negotiations, signaling Russia's desire for a more expansive framework beyond the traditional U.S.-Russia focus, reflecting evolving geopolitical dynamics and security concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is largely anticipated to hold its key policy rate at 5.50% this week, though some economists are flagging the possibility of a surprise rate cut. This potential easing is motivated by mounting downside risks to economic growth, exacerbated by U.S. trade tariffs, and a consistently benign inflation outlook. Despite stronger-than-expected Q2 growth, private investment remains subdued, and financial conditions have tightened. Analysts suggest the RBI might implement an "insurance" rate cut to preempt external shocks or deliver a dovish pause, aiming to position itself as a forward-looking central bank amidst evolving economic challenges.

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are anticipated to formally resign on Tuesday, marking what could be the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration program designed for sweeping workforce reductions. This exodus coincides with a looming government shutdown deadline, with the White House instructing federal agencies to draft plans for extensive firings if Congress fails to authorize more funding. Employees preparing to leave describe an environment of "fear and intimidation," feeling compelled to depart due to a perceived loss of mission and job insecurity. This situation underscores significant instability and low morale within the federal government's workforce.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's ambitions in green marine fuels are significantly dependent on developing a comprehensive methanol supply chain, as highlighted by CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. Despite existing liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations, the city needs to establish a reliable system for bringing in, storing, and selling mainland-produced green methanol tax-free. The recent maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large-vehicle carrier capable of dual-fuel operation with methanol, underscores this industry shift. With Europe's impending carbon emissions-based import tariffs, the urgency for Hong Kong to develop this infrastructure and secure its green fuel future is paramount.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed alarming conditions at a specialist eating disorder unit in York, where staff were photographed sleeping during shifts when they should have been monitoring vulnerable patients. Whistleblowers and former inpatients reported numerous "unsafe" incidents, including staff failing to intervene during self-harm and serving unhygienic food, which patients felt exacerbated their conditions. The unit, now closed due to low referrals, had also received a one-star food hygiene rating. This article exposes severe systemic failures in patient care, a distressing lack of oversight, and the profound impact on seriously ill individuals seeking treatment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, after two federal courts universally blocked its enforcement. Solicitor General John Sauer argues the government has a compelling interest in ensuring citizenship is granted only to those lawfully entitled, claiming the lower court decisions undermine border security. The order unilaterally reinterprets the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, which has historically applied to all persons born in the U.S. regardless of parental immigration status. Critics, including the ACLU, denounce the order as illegal and cruel, warning of an "earthquake" if the Supreme Court rules in Trump's favor.</p>

Governor Tina Kotek stated that there is no insurrection or threat to public safety necessitating military intervention, despite a Pentagon memo authorizing the deployment. Oregon's Attorney General Dan Rayfield asserted that Trump's action is unlawful, as it's not in response to a foreign invasion or mass anarchy, but rather a small protest outside an ICE facility. The lawsuit challenges the president's authority and reliance on what officials call "bad information" from social media and biased news reports.</p>
