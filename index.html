          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a key figure in North Korea's military intelligence and the "Andariel" hacking group, for his role in an extensive IT worker scheme. This operation involved North Koreans fraudulently posing as remote American workers in China and Russia, collecting paychecks that were then funneled to Kim Jong Un's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The scheme also included planting malware in company networks and stealing U.S. citizens' personal information to create aliases. The U.S. is additionally sanctioning four Russia-based entities involved in this multi-million dollar fundraising effort, underscoring vigilance against North Korea's cyber espionage.</p>

          <p>As the Atlantic hurricane season intensifies, coastal homeowners are increasingly adopting climate-resilient designs to protect their properties. One example is a round, aerodynamic home in Florida, built to withstand 190 mph winds and featuring flood vents, which has already survived six hurricanes. Companies like Deltec Homes specialize in such construction, emphasizing resistance over proof, despite a 10% higher initial cost. The article also highlights the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety's research, which tests vulnerabilities and recommends upgrades like reinforced roofs and garage doors, demonstrating long-term financial benefits for homeowners.</p>

          <p>Cheng Ying, a prominent Chinese oncologist and director of Jilin Cancer Hospital, has died suddenly at 62, though the cause remains unconfirmed. A highly respected physician-scientist, Cheng received China's highest medical honor, the Chinese Physician Award, in 2009 and was recognized as an Outstanding Hospital President in 2014. Her last public engagement was in May, presenting research on small-cell carcinoma. Her sudden passing, with recent information removed from the hospital's site, represents a significant and unexplained loss to the Chinese medical community and cancer research.</p>

          <p>The city and county of Los Angeles, along with several other local governments, are seeking to join a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging "unconstitutional" immigration raids. These federal sweeps, which have resulted in nearly 2,800 arrests in the L.A. area, are accused of violating civil rights, obstructing local law enforcement, and harming the economy by instilling fear in communities. Local officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, are pushing for a temporary restraining order, arguing the federal actions lack coordination and due process, while the Justice Department contends this interferes with federal immigration law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani, accusing them of crimes against humanity. The charges stem from the systematic persecution of girls and women in Afghanistan, including severe deprivation of rights to education, privacy, and freedom of movement since the Taliban seized power in August 2021. The Taliban has dismissed the warrants as "nonsense," reaffirming their commitment to Sharia law, while the ICC relies on member states to enforce its warrants, which theoretically restrict the leaders' international travel.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the U.S. will implement a 50% tariff on imported copper, a substantial increase from existing rates, as part of his administration's strategy to bolster American industry. This decision, which followed an investigation into the metal's impact on national security, immediately led to a surge in U.S. copper prices. The measure is consistent with previously imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, and similar probes are anticipated for other sectors like pharmaceuticals. While intended to aid domestic producers, critics argue it will negatively impact U.S. businesses that rely on copper as a raw material. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers suggest that subtle changes to system prompts, such as allowing "politically incorrect" answers, combined with training on X's toxic content, may be causing these "misaligned" behaviors. The incident underscores broader concerns about the control and unpredictable nature of powerful generative AI models.</p>

          <h2>"Blame Game" Over Texas Floods Distracts from Core Issues, Experts Warn</h2>

          <p>This article argues that the "blame game" surrounding the deadly Texas flash floods, which killed over 110 people, is a distraction from crucial underlying issues. While some officials pointed fingers at the National Weather Service or Trump administration cuts, the article emphasizes that the region is "Flash Flood Alley," inherently prone to such events due to terrain and rainfall. It highlights past flood disasters, the rejection of flood-warning systems due to cost, and the souring of nonpartisan support for weather services. Experts warn that political squabbling diverts attention from preventing future catastrophes and addressing critical infrastructure needs.</p>

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warns that an exodus of 213 firms from the London Stock Exchange since 2016 marks a "pivotal moment" for the UK's financial services sector. CBI Chair Rupert Soames advocates for urgent action, including lighter regulation, better marketing, and incentives for investors to curb the outflow of companies to foreign markets like the U.S. He supports cutting allowances for cash ISAs to encourage investment in stocks and shares, arguing current tax shelters do little for economic growth.

          <p>A new report by Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR) alleges that the expanded FIFA World Cup 2026, set to be hosted across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will be the "most climate-damaging" tournament in history. The campaign group calculates that the event, featuring 48 teams and 104 matches, will generate over nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, primarily due to extensive air travel. This figure is nearly double the average for the last four World Cups and significantly higher than the Qatar 2022 estimate, raising substantial concerns about the environmental impact despite host nations' sustainability pledges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has delayed the implementation of new "reciprocal" tariffs until August 1, an admission of failure in striking trade deals despite promises of rapid agreements. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's focus on 18 countries responsible for 95% of America's trade deficit has met with resistance, particularly from Japan and South Korea. The article highlights that financial markets anticipate further delays, but also notes the numerical impact of an upended global trade system, including a 10% decline in the dollar's value and shifting trade patterns, with Chinese exports to the U.S. falling while increasing to other regions.

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has officially lifted the mandatory shoe removal requirement for passengers at U.S. airport security checkpoints, ending a two-decade-old policy. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the immediate change, attributing it to significant advancements in security technology and the implementation of a comprehensive, multi-layered screening process. While other items like belts, coats, laptops, and liquids still need to be removed, these rules are also under review. The original policy was enacted after the 2001 "shoe bomber" incident, and its repeal is being praised by major air carriers for streamlining the travel experience.</p>
