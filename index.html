          <p>During his address to West Point graduates, Trump touted his administration's purge of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Graham Parsons, a former West Point professor who resigned in protest, criticized Trump's wearing of a Make America Great Again hat during the ceremony, viewing it as a blurring of the presidential office with Trump's personal brand. Parsons, who resigned after 13 years, stated that the administration was censoring arguments and modifying syllabuses to align with its ideological preferences, thus making his position professionally untenable. He said his research agenda was effectively banned and the message to cadets was this is not ok, and sometimes you have to put your career aside to do the right thing. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has been characterized by an unprecedented level of monetization of the presidency, with the Trump family profiting significantly from their time in office. These activities include collecting fees from a new cryptocurrency, brokering overseas real estate deals, and opening an exclusive club in Washington with high membership fees. Qatar's donation of a luxury jet for Trump's use has also drawn scrutiny. While the White House defends Trump's actions, critics argue that he has dismantled ethical boundaries and normalized behavior that would have previously provoked outrage and investigations. </p>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a formal complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) following a disputed refereeing decision during their 2-0 defeat to Manchester United. The incident involved referee Thomas Bramall incorrectly disallowing a goal scored by Morgan Rogers, a decision that the video assistant referee (VAR) could not overturn because play had been stopped prematurely. Villa's director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, expressed dissatisfaction with the appointment of an inexperienced referee for such a crucial match, leading to the complaint being filed.</p>

He stated there are 4.8 million able-bodied Americans on Medicaid who are not working and are taking advantage of the system.

          <p>Federal judges are contemplating creating their own armed security force, shifting responsibility from the Department of Justice, due to increasing concerns that the Trump administration is failing to protect them. The proposal emerged after a meeting where judges voiced worries that Trump might instruct the Marshals Service to withdraw protection from judges ruling against him. This move would place the U.S. Marshals Service under the direct control of the Chief Justice, rather than the Attorney General, a Trump appointee. The concerns stem from Trump's repeated criticism of court rulings against his policies, leading to increased threats against judges. </p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order has effectively allowed President Trump to neutralize independent expertise and authority within the executive branch, sparking controversy. The court's decision, in a case involving members of the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards, blessed some or all of Trump's firings of high-level officials. The court's intervention, cast as temporary and procedural, effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument. This order enables the consolidation of additional power in the presidency and risks assimilating a ‚Äúmove fast and break things‚Äù ethos into constitutional law. </p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's victory, the Democratic Party is grappling with low approval ratings and a sense of cultural rejection. Communities traditionally supportive of Democrats shifted to the right in the 2024 election. The party faces challenges including declining voter registration, a drift of working-class voters to the GOP, and a perception as the party of elites. Democrats are reassessing their messaging and policies to rebuild their base and compete in a shifting political landscape. </p>

          <p>A major power outage struck Nice, France, after an electrical facility was damaged by suspected arson, marking the second such incident in two days in southeastern France. The outage left approximately 45,000 households without electricity, disrupting trams and briefly affecting Nice C√¥te d'Azur Airport. The Nice public prosecutor has launched a criminal investigation for "organized arson." Authorities are investigating whether this incident is related to a previous power outage that disrupted the Cannes Film Festival. </p>

The officer, Leslie O‚ÄôNeal, pulled over college student Ximena Arias-Cristobal for a traffic violation that was later dropped. However, the arrest led to Arias-Cristobal's detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) because she is undocumented.

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly in LNG development. From 2013 to 2024, Japanese institutions invested $93 billion in oil and gas projects, with $56 billion allocated to LNG. This contrasts with $24.5 billion invested in clean energy projects. Japan's LNG investments are deemed a "transitional fuel" for its Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) partners, even though studies show LNG has higher emissions than coal. The report finds Japan is engaging in ‚Äúgreenwashing‚Äù by investing in LNG. </p>
