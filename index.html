          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most of their recent tariffs on each other's imports for 90 days, a move that has spurred a surge in stock prices and signals a potential de-escalation in their trade war. The agreement, reached during high-level trade talks in Geneva, will see the U.S. cutting tariffs on China from 145% to 30%, while China will lower its retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. from 125% to 10%. President Trump has expressed optimism about the deal and indicated he may speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping soon, emphasizing China's agreement to open itself up to American business.

          <p>President Trump has urged drugmakers to lower their prices to match those charged in other high-income countries within a month, threatening steep caps on Medicare earnings if they fail to comply. He stated that the U.S. will no longer subsidize foreign countries' healthcare by paying significantly more for the same drugs. Trump's plan expands on his "most favored nation" idea, aiming to pay the lowest price available worldwide, and would allow Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at this price. Drug industry representatives have opposed the plan, calling it "importing socialized medicine" and claiming it could hurt innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The EPA did not release its annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions report for the first time in nearly 30 years, prompting the Environmental Defense Fund to obtain and publish the data through a Freedom of Information Act request. The report, analyzing data from 1990-2023, reveals that while the U.S. has made progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is not on track to meet its climate goals. The report indicates that carbon dioxide, primarily from burning fossil fuels, remains the largest source of emissions, with the transportation sector being the highest emitter. Concerns are rising that the Trump administration's policies could reverse progress made in reducing emissions.</p>

          <p>President Trump invoked golfer Sam Snead to defend his plan to accept a $400 million plane from Qatar as Air Force One, comparing it to accepting a gimme putt in golf. Despite ethical and logistical concerns, Trump argued he would be "stupid" to refuse a "free jet," likening those who object to golfers who insist on putting even when given the opportunity to pick up their ball. This justification underscores Trump's perspective on ethical concerns surrounding his administration, including his family's deals with Saudi-owned firms and cryptocurrency ventures.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to assess the costs and progress of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, an Amtrak project connecting Baltimore to Washington. The project's estimated cost has risen to $8.5 billion, and the Boring Company claims it can build the tunnel more cheaply and efficiently. This move raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as Musk leads multiple companies regulated by federal agencies while also advising President Trump on government efficiency.

The US team is building the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota, while the Japanese team is constructing Hyper K, an upgraded version of their existing neutrino detector. Both experiments aim to determine if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change differently as they travel, which could explain why matter and antimatter didn't cancel each other out after the Big Bang.</p>
