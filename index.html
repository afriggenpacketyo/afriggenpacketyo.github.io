          <p>A first-time competitor, Matt Cross, has been crowned the overall World Conker Champion in Northamptonshire. The 60th annual event saw increased participation, partly due to a cheating scandal from the previous year which ultimately cleared the accused champion. This year's competition overcame fears of cancellation due to a shortage of quality conkers, with donations arriving from across Europe, including from the royal estate at Windsor Castle.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech firm Wingtech has reported that its control over its Dutch subsidiary, the semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia, has been frozen by a Dutch court. The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs initiated the move, citing "national security" concerns, resulting in the appointment of temporary external management. Wingtech's chairman has been suspended from his roles within Nexperia, and the company's shares are now under third-party management, escalating tech-related tensions between China and the EU.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the New York Jets 13-11 in a game marked by strong defense and offensive struggles. The Jets' offense was particularly ineffective, managing only 82 total net yards and negative passing yards. Despite the poor performance, the Jets had a final opportunity to win, but a fourth-down sack sealed the victory for the Broncos, who improved their record to 4-2.</p>

This escalation in rhetoric has renewed fears of a trade conflict between the two economic powers, causing significant volatility in U.S. financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several women who have experienced miscarriages or stillbirths are speaking out against Meta for its failure to stop showing them targeted baby and pregnancy-related advertisements. Despite their loss, the algorithms on Facebook and Instagram continued to serve them content that was emotionally devastating, turning platforms they used for support into sources of pain. A recent lawsuit has forced Meta to allow at least one user to opt out of such targeting, but critics argue the company's new paid subscription model for an ad-free experience is an unreasonable solution.</p>
