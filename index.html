          <p>Virginia Giuffre, known for accusing Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual assault, has died by suicide at the age of 41. Her family released a statement highlighting her role as a "fierce warrior" against sexual abuse and sex trafficking, noting that the toll of abuse became unbearable. Giuffre had alleged that Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked her to Prince Andrew when she was 17, allegations which Prince Andrew has denied. Giuffre became a prominent campaigner associated with the Me Too movement after making her allegations public.</p>

          <p>FBI agents arrested Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly obstructing immigration agents by guiding an undocumented immigrant through a side door in her courtroom. This arrest marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's conflict with local authorities over immigration deportations. The administration has been demanding that local officials assist federal deportation efforts, threatening investigation or prosecution for non-compliance. This action sends a strong message that the administration intends to take a firmer stance against those who impede federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counterproposal to a Trump administration peace plan, which has been criticized for being too lenient towards Russia, indicating potential compromises on previously non-negotiable issues. The Ukrainian plan suggests no restrictions on the Ukrainian military's size and proposes a U.S.-backed "European security contingent" to guarantee security. While the plan does not explicitly demand the full return of all Russian-seized territory or NATO membership, it signals a willingness to seek common ground. President Zelensky's attendance at Pope Francis's funeral in Rome is uncertain due to ongoing Russian attacks in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A Japanese research team has discovered that a one-minute exposure to a specific sound frequency (100 hertz) may help prevent motion sickness symptoms. The research indicates the sound stimulates the inner ear, improving balance and reducing lightheadedness and nausea. In experiments, 70-80% of volunteers exposed to the sound experienced alleviated symptoms while riding a swing, driving simulator, or car. Researchers hope to implement this method as a preventative measure for motion sickness, particularly relevant with the rise of self-driving vehicle technology.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that Russia and Ukraine are nearing a deal, following talks between his envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. While Trump claims that "most of the major points are agreed to," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky insists on "real pressure on Russia" for an unconditional ceasefire. Reports suggest the US peace proposal involves Ukraine conceding territory to Russia, a condition Zelensky rejects. The US plan also reportedly rules out Ukraine's membership in NATO.</p>

          <p>China is taking a more assertive stance towards Donald Trump's second term, reacting to his tariffs with countermeasures and rallying international support. Unlike Trump's first term, where leader-level diplomacy was seen as essential, there is no apparent prospect of a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping. China's rhetoric has become more fiery, repeatedly attacking American "bullying" and seeking support from its neighbors and long-term US allies. This approach may indicate a hardening of attitudes due to experiences during Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, has revoked a Biden administration-era policy that restricted subpoenas of reporters’ phone records in criminal investigations. The memo says federal employees who leak sensitive information to the media “for the purposes of personal enrichment and undermining our foreign policy, national security, and government effectiveness” are engaging in conduct that could be characterized as “treasonous”. Bondi’s memo states that she has concluded that “it is necessary to rescind Merrick Garland’s policies precluding the Department of Justice from seeking records and compelling testimony from members of the news media in order to identify and punish the source of improper leaks”.</p>
