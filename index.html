          <p>At a rally in Iowa, President Donald Trump celebrated the passage of his 'One Big, Beautiful Bill,' highlighting its historic tax cuts and border security investments. He also previewed plans for the nation's 250th anniversary celebration in 2026, which will include a 'Great American State Fair,' a UFC fight on the White House lawn, and a new National Garden of American Heroes. Additionally, Trump commented on recent military strikes against Iran, framing the legislative and military actions as a highly successful period for his administration and dismissing criticism about the bill's popularity.</p>

          <p>Actress Jane Seymour, at 74, reveals she has maintained the same body size she had at age 17 through consistent, moderate habits rather than extreme diets or workouts. She emphasizes a diet rich in fish, vegetables from her own garden, and mindful eating, typically skipping breakfast and enjoying a substantial lunch. Seymour's fitness routine focuses on Pilates and Gyrotonics to build core strength, using light weights and her own body weight, which she credits for helping her avoid injury. She advocates for listening to one's body and choosing sustainable practices over drastic measures to feel good at any age.</p>

          <h2>Major Federal Bill's Medicaid Cuts Expected to Heavily Impact Rural Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 07:00:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Republican-led spending bill championed by President Trump is set to cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid, sparking fears of a healthcare crisis in rural America. Experts predict these cuts will severely strain states like North Carolina, potentially triggering a 'kill switch' to end its recent Medicaid expansion and leaving over 650,000 people uninsured. The reduction in federal funding threatens the stability of rural hospitals, which often serve as the primary healthcare source for uninsured patients and are already financially vulnerable. Critics call the bill a regressive move that prioritizes tax cuts over essential health services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A first-of-its-kind national study has identified sewage sludge and wastewater treatment plants as major sources of PFAS, or 'forever chemical,' pollution in U.S. rivers. Researchers tested water upstream and downstream from 32 sites, finding significantly higher PFAS levels downstream in 95% of cases, confirming these sites as pollution points. The practice of spreading sludge as agricultural fertilizer, known as 'biosolids,' is particularly concerning as it introduces these toxic chemicals into the food supply and water systems. The findings raise serious questions about current waste management practices and the potential for widespread public health exposure to the harmful compounds.</p>

          <p>A previously lost handwritten letter by Thomas Jefferson from 1783 has been discovered and is being offered for sale. In the letter to Virginia's governor, Jefferson discusses the right of citizens to take up arms against autocratic rulers, referencing revolutionary movements in Europe and drawing parallels to the American colonies' fight for independence. The document, valued at around $90,000, also reveals Jefferson's anxiety over the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the Revolutionary War. This finding provides a significant historical snapshot of a pivotal moment for the new nation and its influence on global democratic ideals.</p>

          <p>In the early 1990s, The Walt Disney Company, led by then-CEO Michael Eisner, planned an ambitious and controversial theme park in Virginia called 'Disney's America.' The park aimed to present a comprehensive and un-whitewashed version of U.S. history, with one executive controversially stating they wanted to make visitors 'feel what it was like to be a slave.' The proposal sparked a significant culture war, drawing opposition from historians, preservationists, and environmentalists concerned about its proximity to the Manassas Civil War battlefield. After intense public debate and political hearings, Disney ultimately abandoned the project in 1994, marking a major public failure for the company.</p>

The civilian was detected near the Military Demarcation Line on Thursday, prompting a 20-hour surveillance and guidance operation by South Korean troops to safely secure him. The mission was complex due to dense vegetation and the high risk of landmines in the area. This type of defection across the land border is rare, as most North Koreans escape through China.

The discovery challenges the traditional view that stone was the dominant material for tools during this period.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that as the United States grapples with internal political turmoil and retreats from the global stage, the rest of the world is being forced to declare its own independence from American leadership. The author contends that the U.S. is systematically dismantling the very pillars of its global power, including its trade networks, alliances, and scientific institutions. For allies like Canada, this shift necessitates a difficult and urgent realignment of security and economic strategies to navigate a post-American world. The article concludes that the world can no longer look to America for solutions and must find them elsewhere.</p>

          <p>China's national medical products regulator has announced official support for the development and standardization of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology for medical use. This initiative is part of a broader push to boost innovation in the biomedical field. The agency will focus on creating standards for new materials, such as flexible electrodes, and will promote research into the safety and efficacy of BCI-based medical devices. This technology holds promise for repairing or restoring functions for individuals with impairments from conditions like stroke, spinal cord injuries, and ALS, as well as potentially restoring sight or hearing.</p>

          <p>As temperatures rise, many people are turning to hydration multiplier powders to stay hydrated, but experts advise caution. While these products can be useful for replenishing electrolytes lost through heavy sweating, especially during strenuous exercise, plain water remains the gold standard for hydration. Doctors recommend checking product labels for high levels of sugar, caffeine, and sodium, which can be problematic for individuals with certain health conditions like diabetes or kidney disease. They are best used as a supplement to, not a replacement for, continuous water intake, and consulting a doctor before use is recommended for those with chronic illnesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues for a renewed defense of liberal democracy, suggesting that many have forgotten its core justifications amidst modern critiques from both the left and right. It posits that the strongest defense lies in the concept of 'value pluralism,' as articulated by philosopher Isaiah Berlin. This idea holds that human values like justice, mercy, liberty, and equality are diverse, often incompatible, and cannot be perfectly harmonized into a single utopian system. Therefore, a liberal democracy, which protects individual freedom to choose between these competing values and allows for collective decision-making, is the most decent and humane form of governance, as it avoids the dangers of totalitarian 'monism.'</p>

Despite his grim prognosis, Mays maintains a refreshingly pragmatic and peaceful attitude toward mortality, a decision supported by his close-knit group of friends, his estranged daughter with whom he has recently reconnected, and a long-time friend in Australia. Mays finds strength not in spirituality or bravery, but in the love and support of his community, believing it is better to live a shorter life with good quality than a longer one filled with miserable treatments.

          <p>A debate is brewing between compost producers and bioplastic manufacturers over whether 'compostable' plastics should be allowed in the organic waste stream. California law requires products labeled 'compostable' to fully break down without leaving toxic residues, but current organic standards exclude synthetic materials. Farmers and composters fear that including bioplastics will contaminate their soil with microplastics and chemicals, making it unsalable. Conversely, manufacturers of bioplastic bags and containers argue their products are a necessary alternative to conventional plastics and that excluding them from compost streams threatens their industry's viability, especially with new state packaging laws.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily banned U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street Group from its markets, accusing it of extensive manipulation of the Nifty 50 index.

SEBI's order cited the firm's 'egregious behaviour' and disregard for a previous advisory as reasons for the ban, stating the move is crucial for protecting market integrity and retail investors.
