            <p>Actress Michelle Trachtenberg, known for her roles in "Gossip Girl" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," passed away in February at the age of 39 due to complications from diabetes, according to the New York City medical examiner's office. The determination was made without an autopsy, relying on toxicology test results. Trachtenberg's family initially objected to an autopsy for religious reasons, and the medical examiner respected their wishes given the absence of any suspicion of foul play. Her career began as a child star in Nickelodeon projects before gaining prominence in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, traveled to El Salvador to visit Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant and alleged MS-13 member who was deported from the U.S. and imprisoned in the "Terrorism Confinement Center." Despite meeting with El Salvador's Vice President, Félix Ulloa, Van Hollen was denied access to Abrego Garcia and was unable to arrange a phone call with him. Van Hollen criticized the situation as unjust, accusing the previous administration of lying about Abrego Garcia's gang affiliations and vowing to continue pressing for his release. Other Democratic representatives have also expressed interest in visiting Abrego Garcia and other imprisoned migrants.</p>

            <p>Harvard political scientist Steven Levitsky, who studies authoritarian regimes, believes his expertise helped convince Harvard to stand up to President Trump. The Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard after the university refused to comply with demands to shut down diversity programs and eliminate perceived ideological biases. Levitsky and a colleague had previously urged Harvard to defend academic freedom against such attacks. Levitsky sees the administration's actions as a classic tactic of authoritarian leaders targeting universities and believes Harvard's resistance is a crucial test for civil society.</p>

            <p>The Tijuana River, plagued by raw sewage and industrial waste from Tijuana, has been ranked as the second most endangered river in the U.S. by American Rivers. Environmental groups are calling for a federal emergency declaration from President Trump to expedite cleanup efforts and address the public health crisis caused by the river's pollution. The pollution affects not only the river itself but also the air due to aerosolized pollutants carried by ocean spray, impacting communities and military personnel. Both the U.S. and Mexican governments are urged to increase funding and cooperation to repair treatment facilities and improve sewage management.</p>

            <p>CBS has won a temporary legal reprieve in its battle with Sony Pictures Television, allowing the network to continue distributing "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy." A California appellate court has paused a lower court's ruling that would have stripped CBS of its distribution duties for the iconic game shows. Sony terminated its distribution deal with CBS, alleging unauthorized licensing deals and insufficient support for the shows due to budget cuts. CBS maintains that Sony's claims are based on dissatisfaction with a decades-old agreement.</p>

            <p>President Trump plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to ease building restrictions in areas inhabited by endangered species, according to a White House official. The administration is considering repealing the definition of "harm," which currently protects species' habitats. Critics argue this would allow for economic development that could eradicate species, while supporters claim the ESA is overly burdensome and has failed to achieve its goals. Environmentalists are concerned about weakening the law, which has been credited with saving 99% of listed species.</p>

            <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on a Chinese refinery, Shandong Shenxing Chemical Co Ltd, and several shipping companies and vessels for allegedly facilitating Iranian oil exports. The Treasury Department designated Shandong Shenxing for purchasing over $1 billion worth of Iranian crude. The sanctioned entities are accused of using ship-to-ship transfers to conceal Iran's petroleum deliveries to China. The move is part of the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign to crack down on Iran's energy-dominated economy.</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a "challenging scenario" of accelerating inflation and a slowing economy. Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are "significantly larger than anticipated" and that their economic effects will include higher inflation and slower growth. The remarks sent stocks tumbling, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping significantly. Powell indicated that the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war with China, including tariffs on soybeans, could indirectly accelerate deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans may lead them to increase purchases from Brazil, incentivizing further deforestation for soy production. Brazil's weaker environmental regulations and enforcement, combined with political shifts that could undermine land protections, raise concerns about increased illegal deforestation. The loss of the Amazon's carbon bank to soy farming could significantly worsen global warming and threaten Indigenous communities.</p>
