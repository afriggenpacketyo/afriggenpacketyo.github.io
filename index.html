          <p>Hamas has announced it will release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. Alexander, a 21-year-old soldier, is the last known living US hostage held in the territory.

The release is intended as a goodwill gesture before President Trump's arrival in the Middle East. Alexander was captured during the October 7, 2023, attack and is believed to be one of the few remaining living hostages.</p>
