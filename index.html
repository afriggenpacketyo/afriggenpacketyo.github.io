        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FIFA has unanimously decided to expand the Women's World Cup from 32 to 48 teams, starting with the 2031 tournament. This expansion will result in a 12-group format and an increase of 40 matches, extending the competition by a week. FIFA President Gianni Infantino stated that the changes aim to provide more nations with opportunities to develop their women's football structures. The UK is considered the frontrunner to host the 2035 edition, potentially giving England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland a chance to compete on home soil, though none have won the trophy since its inception in 1991.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. The judge, William K. Sessions III, expressed concern that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens, as the government's primary evidence appeared to be an essay critical of Israel she co-wrote in a student newspaper. Ozturk testified about experiencing escalating asthma attacks and poor treatment in detention, while her lawyer accused the government of retaliating against her for protected speech. The judge granted her release, allowing her to return home to Somerville and pursue her doctoral studies.</p>

          <p>Affirm's stock price experienced a significant drop after the fintech company released a disappointing revenue forecast, leading investors to question CEO Max Levchin's focus on 0% interest loans. The company projected revenue between $815 million and $845 million for the current quarter, falling short of analyst expectations. Levchin defends his strategy, stating that 0% loans attract new customers and build loyalty, even if it means reduced margins in the short term, and that they are taking market share from credit cards.

          <p>With gold prices soaring, prospective investors may find the high cost per ounce discouraging, but several options exist to benefit from gold's inflation-hedging and portfolio-diversifying properties without paying top dollar. Consider investing in 1-gram gold bars, which require a smaller initial investment and lower insurance and storage costs. Gold ETFs offer fractional ownership of gold traded on stock exchanges, while fractional gold coins provide physical tangibility at a lower entry price point. Regardless of the chosen method, limiting gold investments to 10% or less of the overall portfolio is advised.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, a steady member of the court's liberal wing despite being appointed by a Republican president, has died at the age of 85. Appointed in 1990 by George H.W. Bush, Souter served for nearly 20 years and often sided with the court's liberal members. He stepped down in 2009 and was succeeded by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Souter was remembered for his wisdom, kindness, and dedication to public service, and he continued to hear cases on the 1st Circuit after his retirement.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are nearing a resentencing hearing after decades in prison. The hearing, scheduled for May 13 and 14, follows disagreements between current and former Los Angeles County district attorneys. The brothers hope for parole eligibility through the state's youthful offender law, as they were under 26 at the time of the murders. While they claim sexual assault by their father as a motive, prosecutors argue they killed for inheritance. The judge denied the current DA's request to disregard a previous motion for resentencing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China, suggesting that an 80% tariff "seems right" as U.S. and Chinese negotiators prepare for high-stakes trade talks in Switzerland. This marks a shift in tone amid ongoing trade tensions that have roiled international markets. However, the White House clarified that any tariff reduction would be contingent on concessions from China. Experts warn that even an 80% tariff may be too high to restart business across the Pacific, and economists have cautioned about the rising risk of a recession due to Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the classic 60-40 portfolio is no longer viable for long-term retirement income planning, not due to changes in the bond market, but because of increased human longevity. With people living longer than ever, Edelman suggests that investors need to allocate more of their portfolio to equities, recommending 70% to 80% in stocks to avoid outliving their savings. This shift is necessary to ensure financial security in an era where humans routinely live to 100 and beyond.</p>
