          <p>Nintendo announced that its revenue more than doubled in its first fiscal quarter, primarily driven by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console, which sold 5.82 million units. The company's revenue reached $3.8 billion, significantly exceeding market expectations, although sales from its IP-related business saw a slight decline. Despite this strong performance, Nintendo has maintained its conservative full-year guidance, even as analysts predict sales will surpass targets despite potential impacts from U.S. tariffs.

          <p>Germany has reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the country's Atlantic region, with numbers growing to around 1,600 animals across 209 packs.

This initiative, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase representation from working-class families within Whitehall. Successful interns on the paid, six-to-eight-week program will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate scheme, as part of a broader effort to make the civil service more reflective of the country it serves.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's parliament, dominated by President Nayib Bukele's Nuevas Ideas party, has approved constitutional reforms that permit indefinite presidential reelection and extend the presidential term from five to six years. The move solidifies Bukele's power, allowing him to run for office without term limits, a decision that has drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties and civil society groups. Critics argue the reforms undermine democracy and consolidate an authoritarian regime, placing El Salvador alongside Venezuela and Nicaragua in allowing unlimited reelection.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court is set to issue a landmark ruling that could enable millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-sold car finance deals involving hidden commissions. The decision centers on whether undisclosed commission payments made to car dealers by lenders were unlawful, potentially leading to billions of pounds in payouts similar to the PPI scandal. This ruling could significantly expand the pool of eligible claimants beyond those affected by already-banned discretionary commission arrangements, impacting major lenders who have set aside substantial funds.

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen nearly $200 million in federal research grants to UCLA from agencies including the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health. The White House cited the university's alleged failure to combat antisemitism and its use of race in admissions as reasons for the decision. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk called the move a deeply disappointing penalty that defunds life-saving research and does nothing to address the alleged discrimination.</p>

          <p>A Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam was diverted to Minneapolis after encountering severe turbulence, resulting in 25 people being hospitalized. Passengers described a terrifying experience where the plane shook violently and dropped suddenly, sending items and people airborne. The incident, which is being investigated by the FAA and NTSB, highlights the increasing frequency of clear-air turbulence, which some scientists link to climate change and the warming of the Arctic.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old Oxnard man, Dustin Ronald Alba, has been sentenced to 111 years to life in prison for committing a series of sexual assaults against five women between 2012 and 2020. Prosecutors stated that Alba used dating apps and social media to meet his victims, whom he would then physically overpower and assault. The investigation began after one victim reported an assault in 2020, leading authorities to uncover additional victims through messages on the perpetrator's phone.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's process for handling a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh attributed the increase to presidents using executive orders to bypass congressional gridlock, which naturally leads to more legal challenges requiring urgent court intervention. He asserted that the court has adapted by increasing its written explanations and scheduling emergency arguments, and he emphasized the collegiality among the justices despite differing views.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under President Biden, had her appointment to a distinguished chair position at West Point rescinded. The decision by the Secretary of the Army followed social media posts from a pro-Trump activist criticizing the hire. Easterly, a West Point alumna with a long military service record, described the reversal as a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage" that overshadowed her qualifications and integrity.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling extends their legal status and protection from deportation while the case proceeds, with the next hearing scheduled for November. In her decision, Judge Trina L. Thompson stated the administration's move was likely motivated by racial animus and failed to properly review current conditions in the immigrants' home countries.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the United States' failing healthcare system, characterized by high costs and poor outcomes, is a domestic issue, not the fault of other countries like Australia. The author refutes the idea that countries with price controls on medicine are "freeloading" on U.S. research, noting the decline in U.S. innovation and the success of systems like Australia's Medicare. The article suggests the U.S. could learn from these models rather than engaging in bullying trade tactics. (not investment advice)</p>
