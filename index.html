However, several firms have since upgraded the stock, arguing that the addition of CyberArk's identity security capabilities is a crucial strategic move that enhances the company's long-term growth potential.

A new study projects that without rapid emissions cuts, the global reindeer population could fall by nearly 60% by 2100, with North American herds facing an even steeper decline. This loss poses a significant threat not only to biodiversity but also to the culture and food security of Arctic Indigenous communities.</p>

          <p>Climate scientists are organizing a coordinated response to a recent U.S. Department of Energy report that cast doubt on the scientific consensus regarding the climate crisis. In a broader effort to uphold credible science, the National Academies of Sciences has launched a fast-track review of evidence on greenhouse gas threats. These actions come as the Trump administration is accused of promoting misinformation and deleting key climate data from government websites.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore a portion of the $584 million in federal grant funding it had suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles. The judge ruled that the suspension violated a previous injunction blocking the government from terminating grants at the UC system. The funding freeze is part of the administration's response to pro-Palestinian student protests on university campuses, which it alleges have fostered antisemitism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis piece argues that the Trump administration's federal takeover of the Washington, D.C. police force is a political maneuver based on false pretenses. The author points out that violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, contradicting the administration's narrative of a city overrun by criminals. The move is framed as a tactic to manufacture a crisis, expand executive power, and set a precedent for intervening in other cities.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave plunged 18% after the company reported a larger-than-expected adjusted loss of 27 cents per share for its second quarter. The poor result and light capital expenditure guidance overshadowed a tripling of revenue and an increased full-year forecast. The stock's decline was also amplified by the impending expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could lead to increased selling from insiders. (not investment advice)</p>
