          <p>Germany's incoming Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced plans to implement stricter border checks with additional police officers to combat illegal migration. The new coalition government aims to reduce illegal entries by increasing border control measures and entry denials. Dobrindt emphasized the need for order and consistency in managing migration at both national and European levels. The southwestern state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg also plans to tighten border checks, utilizing surveillance drones along the Swiss border, reflecting a broader effort to address migration concerns within Germany.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell, Leader of the House of Commons, has apologized for describing grooming gangs as a "dog whistle" issue during a heated debate on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions.

Powell clarified that she regards child exploitation with the utmost seriousness and was challenging political point-scoring rather than undermining the issue itself.

He asserted that Russia has sufficient capabilities to bring the 2022 military operation in Ukraine to a logical conclusion, with the outcome Russia requires.

          <p>As the US government seeks a new agreement with Iran over its nuclear program, the Iranian opposition remains cautiously optimistic, though divided on the best path forward. While some, like human rights activist Iraj Mesdaghi, believe neither an agreement nor military action is in the population's best interest, others, such as supporters of Reza Pahlavi, advocate for regime change through foreign intervention. Historian Arash Azizi warns against military invasion, emphasizing that change must come from within. The article highlights the internal rifts and the diverse perspectives within the Iranian opposition regarding the country's future.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have reported successful results from a weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where cloud seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4 percent across 8,000 sq km. The operation generated over 70,000 cubic meters of additional precipitation using just 1kg of silver iodide. The test was conducted by the China Meteorological Administration's key laboratory and detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, highlighting the potential for weather modification technologies to address water scarcity in arid regions.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the initial vote in November was annulled due to irregularities and alleged Russian interference. The original election saw far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round, but the results were overturned by the constitutional court. George Simion, an ally of Georgescu from the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR), is expected to advance to the second round. The decision to annul the election and ban Georgescu was criticized by some US figures and the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the recent panic surrounding ultra-processed baby food pouches and argues that it is another way of making mothers feel guilty. It critiques the notion that mothers are too lazy to cook from scratch, emphasizing the time, labor, and moral judgment involved in intensive mothering. The author suggests that societal pressures and a lack of support for parents, rather than individual choices, are the real issues. She calls for improved paternity leave, workplace creches, and other systemic changes to support good food choices and alleviate the intense pressure on parents.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is no longer considered a wild notion after Reform UK's recent electoral success. The party's growing support reflects public disillusionment with the political system. While Labour aims to prove government can be a force for good, the Conservatives are struggling to appear serious and connect with voters. Reform's challenge is to transition from a protest party to one capable of governing effectively, as its success has shaken the central dynamic in national politics.</p>

The gene therapy works by modifying the patient's own cells to help them create the missing protein needed to fight infection.
