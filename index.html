            <p>China has issued a warning that it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that undermine Beijing's interests, escalating tensions amid the ongoing trade war. This comes as the Trump administration reportedly plans to use tariff negotiations to pressure other nations to limit their dealings with China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce emphasized its willingness to work with all parties to defend international fairness, while criticizing the U.S. for abusing tariffs and engaging in unilateral bullying.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under fire after reports surfaced of a second instance where he shared details of a planned U.S. airstrike in Yemen via the Signal messaging app. This time, the recipients included his wife, brother, and personal attorney, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive military information. Critics, including Senator Tammy Duckworth, are calling for his resignation, while the Department of Defense maintains that no classified information was compromised.

            <p>Dominik Mysterio captured the Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania in a fatal four-way match against Finn Balor, Penta, and Bron Breakker, marking his first main-roster singles title win.

            <p>Season 2 of 'The Last of Us' delves into the consequences of Joel's actions, marked by his brutal death at the hands of Abby, the daughter of a doctor he killed. The series expands on the game's narrative, depicting the violence and grief that consume the characters, particularly Ellie, as she grapples with loss. While the adaptation retains the show's high production value, it shifts its focus from building bonds to exploring how they fracture, resulting in a more punishing and less insightful experience compared to Season 1.</p>

Marriage agencies specializing in such unions have seen a rise in demand, reflecting evolving values and the desire for partnership outside traditional societal norms.

Instead of relying on brute strength, China can capitalize on its inner balance and core strength to overcome the challenges posed by the escalating economic war with the United States.</p>

            <p>Men are less likely than women to seek medical care, often delaying visits until symptoms become severe, due to societal pressures to "tough it out" and concerns about appearing weak. This reluctance affects men's health outcomes, with many self-managing conditions instead of seeking professional help. Factors contributing to this include appointment systems that don't fit working patterns and services that rely on open communication, which doesn't align with how men typically discuss health concerns. Support groups and redesigned services tailored to men's needs can help bridge this gap.</p>

            <p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner exchange with Venezuela, offering to repatriate hundreds of Venezuelans who were deported from the United States in exchange for “political prisoners.” In a post on X, Bukele offered to exchange 252 Venezuelans currently detained in El Salvador’s mega prison for “an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners” he says Venezuela holds, including family members of opposition leaders. CNN has reached out to the Venezuelan government for comment on the proposed exchange.</p>

            <p>India's roads are among the world's deadliest, with over 172,000 fatalities in 2023, due to a combination of human behavior, infrastructure issues, and enforcement gaps. Over-speeding, lack of safety precautions like helmets and seatbelts, overloading, and driving without a valid license are major contributors. Poor road design, substandard construction, inadequate signage, and a chaotic mix of vehicles and pedestrians further exacerbate the problem. Despite efforts to upgrade roads, experts argue that designs often mimic Western models and ignore India's unique traffic needs.</p>
