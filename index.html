        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 20 individuals were arrested in Westminster, London, following a protest supporting Palestine Action. The demonstration occurred shortly after the group was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization under UK law. This new designation makes it a criminal offense to be a member of or show support for the group, with potential penalties of up to 14 years in prison. The protesters held placards with messages like "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action," highlighting the contentious nature of the group's ban and its activism.</p>

          <p>After a 100-year ban due to pollution, Parisians are once again swimming in the Seine River. The reopening follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project linked to the Olympics, which has successfully brought the water quality up to European standards on most days. Designated swimming areas have been established, complete with safety measures like lifeguards and lifebuoys. While many residents and officials, including the mayor, celebrated the historic moment as a "childhood dream," some locals remain skeptical about the water's cleanliness despite official assurances.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab, scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change the public's negative perception of the creatures. Researchers, led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, capture sharks to analyze their stomach contents, which provides insights into the animals' health and the bay's water quality. The sharks are released unharmed after the brief examination. Despite the ecological importance of their work, the scientists note that overcoming the public's fear makes it difficult to secure funding for their research.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an aid organization backed by the US and Israel, reported that two of its American workers were injured in a grenade attack in Khan Younis. The GHF, which blames Hamas for the incident, stated the workers are in stable condition. This attack highlights the dangers of aid distribution in the conflict zone, where the UN notes over 400 Palestinians have been killed trying to collect food since the GHF began operations. The event occurs as Hamas indicates a readiness for ceasefire talks, though it wants the GHF dismantled.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has floated the idea of bankrolling a new political party, suggesting it could focus on a few key congressional seats to become a deciding vote in a narrowly divided legislature. This proposal emerged from his public feud with President Donald Trump over a new spending bill, which Musk vehemently opposed. In a poll on his social media platform, X, a majority of respondents supported his idea of creating an "America Party" to challenge the two-party system. The article notes this follows Musk's previous role leading a government efficiency department under Trump, which ended amid controversy.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a large luxury beach resort, nearly a decade after construction began. The project, which features high-rise hotels and numerous amenities, reflects Kim Jong Un's ambition to boost the nation's sanctioned economy through tourism. However, the country's borders remain largely closed to most foreign visitors, with the exception of small, curated groups from Russia, a new strategic partner. Analysts are skeptical about the resort's economic impact, given that most North Koreans cannot afford it and the infrastructure for mass tourism is lacking.</p>

          <p>An Arizona couple was fined $4,000 by their property management company, Denali Real Estate, for posting negative online reviews about their rental experience, which included black mold. A clause in their lease prohibited negative reviews and imposed a $2,000 penalty per violation. This action appears to be illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA), which protects consumers' right to share honest feedback without retaliation. After a local news outlet investigated, the company stated it would remove the clause, though the tenant's fine remains in dispute.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" to better manage feelings of anger and stress. The concept is based on neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor's finding that it takes 90 seconds for stress hormones to flush from the body. After this brief period, one can consciously choose not to re-engage with the negative thought, preventing a cycle of rumination. Gawdat suggests asking practical questions to assess the situation's truth and whether action can be taken, fostering a more mindful and resilient response to life's upsets.</p>

She argues that actively pursuing hobbies is a secret to finding balance, as it forces individuals to set boundaries around work and other obligations.

          <p>Deaths from heart attacks in the U.S. have plummeted by nearly 90 percent since 1970, thanks to decades of medical and public health progress. This dramatic improvement is attributed to successful anti-smoking campaigns, the development of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and better emergency treatments like CPR and angioplasty. The article notes that while acute heart attack deaths are down, chronic heart disease remains a leading killer, exacerbated by rising rates of obesity and diabetes. Future progress may depend on wider adoption of advanced screening and new drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has questioned why no one at the BBC has been fired over its decision to air a documentary titled "Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone." The program, which was later pulled, faced severe criticism after it was revealed that its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas minister. The BBC apologized for "serious flaws" and is conducting an internal review, the findings of which are expected soon. Nandy expressed exasperation at the time the review is taking and demanded accountability for the editorial decisions made.</p>

          <p>An investigative article details how the Trump Organization has engaged in numerous international business projects, raising questions about conflicts of interest between Donald Trump's presidency and his private empire. The piece highlights new deals in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, and Vietnam, often involving state-linked entities and coinciding with official diplomatic visits or policy decisions. Critics argue these entanglements blur the line between public duty and private gain, a concern magnified by significant foreign government payments to Trump businesses during his first term.</p>

          <p>According to Chinese state-affiliated media, China and the European Union have nearly completed the technical aspects of negotiations to resolve their dispute over electric vehicle (EV) tariffs. The report suggests that a final deal now depends on the "political will" of the EU. The dispute is part of a broader series of trade challenges from the EU against Beijing, which has been investigating Chinese subsidies and other market-distorting practices. Reaching an agreement would be a significant step in de-escalating trade tensions between the two economic powers over the rapidly growing EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team achieved a 21-10 victory against the Waratahs in Sydney, though their performance was described as unconvincing and error-prone. Scottish center Huw Jones scored two tries in the first half, but the understrength Waratahs side fought back to make it a close game. A third try from Alex Mitchell secured the win for the tourists, but their high number of handling errors and lack of discipline were noted as concerns. Despite winning their third consecutive game on the Australian tour, the disjointed play was underwhelming.</p>

          <p>A coalition of residents, environmentalists, and business groups in northern Florida has successfully lobbied for a permanent ban on oil and gas drilling near the ecologically vital Apalachicola River and Bay. The "Kill the Drill" movement formed after the state initially granted an exploratory drilling permit, which evoked memories of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill threat. After public pressure, the state reversed the permit and Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill creating a 10-mile buffer zone, protecting the region's seafood industry from future drilling threats.</p>

In response, brands are revamping their programs to offer more flexible and engaging rewards, hoping the short-term cost of freebies will translate into long-term customer loyalty and sales growth.
