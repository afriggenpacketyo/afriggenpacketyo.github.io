          <p>US stocks experienced a significant rally after President Trump indicated potential reductions in tariffs on Chinese goods. Treasury Secretary Bessent's remarks further fueled optimism, suggesting a possible "big deal" on trade between the two nations.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped by 1,100 points, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also saw substantial increases, signaling a positive shift in investor sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, a former paddleboard firm owner, received a 10-year and six-month prison sentence after four people died during a paddleboarding excursion on the Western Cleddau river in Wales in October 2021. Lloyd, who pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, was deemed unqualified to lead the tour under hazardous conditions. The court heard that the group attempted to navigate a weir with a strong current, resulting in the deaths of Paul O'Dwyer, Andrea Powell, Morgan Rogers, and Nicola Wheatley. The judge criticized Lloyd's "abysmal" approach to safety and said her interest "seemed to be more in an exciting route than safety."</p>

Current driving test wait times are "totally unacceptable", she told parliament's transport committee on Wednesday.

          <p>A federal judge has accused the Trump administration of "bad faith" in the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadorian deported despite a court order against it. The court has given the administration a deadline to provide details supporting claims of privilege, criticizing the administration for ignoring court orders and obstructing the legal process. The Supreme Court previously ordered the administration to facilitate Ábrego García's return to the US. This case highlights ongoing tensions between the executive branch and the courts over judicial orders.</p>

          <p>Several corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S. since the start of President Trump's second term, as new tariffs take effect. Companies like Johnson & Johnson, Apple, and Chobani are committing significant investments to build and expand U.S. factories. While not all companies directly cite tariffs as the sole motivating factor, the White House has promoted these moves as supporting job creation. Economists remain skeptical about the extent to which tariffs alone can spur such strategic pivots, noting other factors like labor and energy costs are also key.</p>

          <p>The pro-natalism movement, gaining influence in the Trump administration, seeks to encourage American women to have more babies, but critics argue its real agenda is to enforce regressive social roles and limit women's opportunities. The movement's proposals, such as fertility awareness classes and "baby bonuses," lack measures to address the urgent needs of American mothers, like paid family leave and affordable childcare. Critics contend that the movement aims to primarily encourage white births and push women out of the public sphere, promoting regressive notions of women's roles as wives and mothers.</p>
