          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is tracking the 19th norovirus outbreak on a cruise ship in the current year, this time aboard Royal Caribbean's Serenade of the Seas. Nearly 100 people, including over 90 passengers and four crew members, reported symptoms of gastrointestinal illness, primarily diarrhea and vomiting. Health experts note that the virus spreads easily in contained environments like cruise ships, emphasizing hand washing with soap and water as a key preventative measure.</p>

The political stalemate continues with neither party showing signs of compromise, while the Trump administration has also sent letters pressuring universities to align with its policy priorities.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests President Donald Trump may be adopting a political playbook similar to Richard Nixon's by pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The goal would be to stimulate the economy and stock market in the short term to secure political advantages, such as in the upcoming midterm elections. However, this strategy carries significant risks, as historical precedent shows that forcing the Fed to let the economy overheat could lead to severe long-term inflation and economic instability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to begin its new term, with its docket featuring several high-stakes cases involving contentious social issues and the policies of President Trump. The justices will hear arguments on state bans on "conversion therapy" for minors, the use of race in congressional redistricting, and challenges to transgender athlete participation in girls' sports. Also under review are Trump's executive actions, including his sweeping tariffs and his authority to fire officials at independent agencies.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. retailers like Walmart and Kroger are increasingly replacing paper price tags with electronic shelf labels, which allow for instantaneous price adjustments from a central system. While companies tout the technology for its efficiency, some lawmakers and consumer advocates worry it could pave the way for "dynamic pricing," where prices for essential goods could surge during periods of high demand. Proponents, however, argue it is more likely to be used for discounting perishable items to reduce food waste. (not investment advice)</p>
