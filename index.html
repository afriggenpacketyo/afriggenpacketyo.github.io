          <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former U.S. Senator Robert Menendez, has been sentenced to four and a half years in prison for her role in a significant bribery scheme. She was convicted on multiple counts for acting as a go-between for her husband and Egyptian officials, facilitating a plot that involved cash, gold bars, and a luxury car. During her sentencing, she expressed remorse and claimed her husband had manipulated her, stating he was not the man she thought he was. The judge emphasized the need for a prison term to deter similar corruption, though her sentence will be delayed for medical reasons.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean nationals have departed the U.S. on a charter flight after being detained in a major ICE raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. The workers were accused of living and working in the country illegally, and their detention created significant diplomatic tension between the U.S. and South Korea, a key economic partner. South Korean officials mounted a significant response to secure the workers' release and voluntary departure. The incident has raised concerns in South Korea about the treatment of its citizens and the potential impact on future investments in the United States.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Patrick Reed has stated his belief that it is unnecessary for American players to be paid for participating in the Ryder Cup. He argued that representing one's country in such an event, much like the Olympics, should be about honor and patriotism rather than financial reward. Reed suggested that if money is involved, it should be directed entirely to charity. He also commented on the strong camaraderie and team unity among European players, identifying it as a distinct advantage they hold over their American counterparts.</p>

          <p>New estimates based on recent inflation data suggest that Social Security beneficiaries could see a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would represent a modest increase from the 2.5% boost in 2025 and would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by approximately $54. However, many retirees remain concerned that such adjustments will not keep pace with rising essential costs, particularly for Medicare premiums, which are also projected to increase significantly next year. The official COLA will be announced by the Social Security Administration in October after final inflation data is analyzed. (not investment advice)</p>

Law enforcement responded within minutes and secured the scene without firing any weapons.

A BBC investigation has cast doubt on Farage's claim that Ferrari could afford the home with funds from her supposedly wealthy family, finding little evidence to support this.

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old right-wing political activist assassinated at a university event in Utah, was a highly influential figure in modern American conservatism. As the founder of Turning Point USA, he built a powerful youth organization and became a close ally of President Donald Trump, known for his polished debating style and effective campus organizing. However, he was also a deeply polarizing figure who promoted conspiracy theories, including false claims about the 2020 election, and frequently made disparaging remarks about minority groups.

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose by 2.9% in August compared to the previous year, marking the fastest pace of inflation since January.

While services inflation has stalled, the rising cost of core commodities is now a primary driver of the overall increase.

          <p>The United Kingdom's ambassador to the U.S., Peter Mandelson, has been dismissed from his post by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The sacking came after newly released documents revealed a deeper relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein than was previously known. According to a government statement, emails showed the extent of their friendship and included a suggestion from Mandelson that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful. This new information was deemed to make his position untenable, leading to his immediate withdrawal from the crucial diplomatic role.</p>

          <p>A parliamentary commission in France has recommended banning social media access for children under the age of 15 and imposing an overnight "digital curfew" for those aged 15 to 18. The inquiry, which focused on the psychological effects of platforms like TikTok, concluded that the app knowingly exposes young users to toxic and addictive content, describing it as a "production line of distress." The commission's 43 recommendations also include banning mobile phones in schools and creating a crime of "digital negligence" for parents who fail to protect their children online.</p>

          <p>England's Football Association has charged Chelsea Football Club with 74 alleged rule breaches related to payments made to agents between 2009 and 2022. The charges stem from financial activities that occurred during the ownership of Roman Abramovich and involve deals for high-profile players like Eden Hazard and Willian. The club's current ownership group discovered and self-reported the potential violations to regulators after their takeover in 2022. While Chelsea faces potential sanctions, including fines or a transfer ban, their cooperation is expected to be a mitigating factor in the final punishment.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is contextualized as the latest event in a disturbing trend of rising political violence in the United States. The article notes a series of recent violent acts that have spanned the political spectrum, including attacks on state lawmakers, the firebombing of a governor's residence, and two assassination attempts on President Trump. Kirk's prominent and often provocative role in conservative media made him a lightning rod, and his public murder underscores the nation's extreme political volatility and the increasing threats faced by public figures.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for a weekend of severe weather, with the Met Office issuing yellow warnings for strong winds and heavy rain across parts of England and Wales. A powerful Atlantic jet stream is expected to fuel a developing area of low pressure, which could intensify to become Storm Amy, the first named storm of the season. Forecasters predict wind gusts of 50-60 mph along coasts and hills, with a risk of localized disruption from falling branches and surface water flooding. The public is advised to stay updated as the storm system develops.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) initiative raises questions about its practical implementation. While Kennedy has claimed significant early accomplishments in his goal to address chronic disease, a newly released strategy document is described as more of a wish list than a concrete plan. The report contains 128 recommendations but lacks clear strategies for achieving them or metrics for measuring success. This highlights the immense challenge of translating the administration's ambitious health goals into tangible, effective policy.</p>

With nearly a third of the U.S. population born after 2001, Spade's firsthand account provides a powerful history lesson, ensuring that the sacrifices and impact of that day are not forgotten by future generations.</p>
