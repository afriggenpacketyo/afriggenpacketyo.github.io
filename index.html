          <p>UK newspaper headlines are dominated by the Conservative party conference, featuring leader Kemi Badenoch's controversial pledge to deport 150,000 illegal migrants annually, a plan praised by The Sunday Express. Concurrently, reports from The Sunday Telegraph and The Observer indicate significant pressure on Badenoch, with some suggesting she has six months to prevent the party's decline. The article also highlights the recent collapse of a Chinese spying case, which the Crown Prosecution Service attributed to an "evidential failure," despite earlier security warnings.</p>

          <p>The article examines why the US lags in global electric vehicle (EV) adoption, despite recent sales growth fueled by now-expired government subsidies. Compared to China and Europe, the US has a smaller EV market share, largely due to policy shifts. President Trump's efforts to remove incentives and impose high tariffs on foreign EVs are significant factors. Automakers anticipate a slowdown, as the average US EV transaction price remains a substantial barrier, indicating a challenging year ahead for the industry.</p>

          <p>Thousands defied a police ban to participate in a Pride march in Pecs, Hungary, protesting Prime Minister Viktor Orban's restrictive LGBTQ+ policies. Orban's Fidesz party passed a law allowing Pride bans, citing child protection, which Amnesty International calls a "chilling effect" on the LGBTQ+ community. Several MEPs joined the 7,000-8,000 demonstrators, who waved rainbow and EU flags, condemning the government as a "dictatorship." This article highlights the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ rights and freedom of assembly in Hungary, with previous Budapest Pride marches also drawing massive defiance.</p>

          <p>The article explains "freshers' flu" as a collection of common respiratory viruses rapidly spreading among university students due to close quarters and diverse pathogens. Immunologists attribute its prevalence to factors like late nights, poor diet, stress, and lack of sleep, which weaken the immune system. While typically not serious, symptoms are exacerbated by new virus exposure and a rundown body. This article advises students to prioritize rest and seek medical help if symptoms persist.</p>
