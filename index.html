          <p>A twin-engine Cessna 414 crashed off the coast of San Diego, resulting in the deaths of all six people on board. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff and was en route back to Phoenix after a flight from Arizona. Searchers discovered a debris field about five miles off the coast of Point Loma, with the water in the area being approximately 200 feet deep. The pilot had reported difficulties maintaining heading and altitude to air traffic controllers before losing radar contact, and a surfer witnessed the plane crashing into the water nose-first at high speed. The incident is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>

          <p>California is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of the state's National Guard to Los Angeles, following protests related to immigration enforcement operations. Governor Gavin Newsom argues that the federal government's action is illegal and immoral, as it commandeers the state's National Guard without his consent. Attorney General Rob Bonta asserts that the federalization of the National Guard deprives the state of resources needed to protect its citizens. The lawsuit claims that the state's governor is the commander-in-chief of the guard and must consent to its federalization, which Newsom has not granted.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni alleged civil extortion and defamation after Lively accused him of sexual harassment and retaliation.

Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete victory, while representatives for Baldoni did not immediately comment.

          <p>The FDA has approved Merck's RSV shot, Enflonsia, for infants, creating competition with Sanofi and AstraZeneca's Beyfortus. This approval provides doctors with another option for preventing respiratory syncytial virus, a major cause of infant hospitalizations and deaths. Merck plans to launch Enflonsia before the upcoming RSV season, with orders beginning in July. While both Enflonsia and Beyfortus are preventative monoclonal antibodies, they target different parts of the virus, and Enflonsia can be administered regardless of an infant's weight. This development will be reviewed by the CDC's vaccine advisors later in June.</p>

The lawsuit challenges the legality of Trump's federalization of the California National Guard, arguing it violates the U.S. Constitution and exceeds his authority. Newsom described Trump's actions as an illegal escalation, while Bonta emphasized the absence of invasion or rebellion warranting such measures.</p>

          <p>Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden are demanding information from Maximus, Inc., regarding how the company might profit from Republican-led cuts to Medicaid. Maximus, a major contractor for states administering government assistance, has been criticized for its track record of service delays and alleged fraud. The senators' letter highlights concerns that Maximus could benefit from increased bureaucracy and red tape in Medicaid, potentially leading to more Americans losing their health insurance. Warren and Wyden argue that Maximus has spent millions lobbying for Medicaid cuts to financially benefit itself.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is splitting into two companies, raising questions about the future of TNT Sports. One company will focus on streaming and studios, while the other will encompass legacy cable networks, TNT Sports, and other assets. CEO David Zaslav indicated that it will be up to the new Global Networks team to decide how to monetize TNT Sports' programming, including licensing it to other businesses. This move could potentially lead to a merger with another entity or a licensing deal with a different media company, as sports have not been a major driver of HBO Max sign-ups.</p>

The judge noted that Brooks's life was "falling apart" due to the disciplinary action and that he had a "simmering sense of grievance" towards Perks.

The Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits the military from being used domestically, but the Insurrection Act provides exceptions, although its broad language has been criticized.</p>
