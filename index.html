          <p>A former Marine Reservist, Benjamin Song, has been accused of terrorism and other charges following an armed ambush at a Texas ICE facility on July 4th. Reports link Song and several other arrested individuals to a shadowy anti-fascist group and transgender activists, with Song allegedly holding combat training sessions for young leftists. Authorities found a cache of weapons during raids, and Song, who became disillusioned with conservative politics, told the Washington Post the incident was initially a protest that escalated. The FBI emphasizes its commitment to investigating violence against law enforcement.</p>

This innovative initiative has provided over 200 violins in five years, fostering a love for music and boosting student confidence.

          <p>As certificate of deposit (CD) rates remain solid, financial experts offer guidance on how much to invest, stressing the importance of individual financial situations. They recommend considering emergency funds, inflation, and liquidity needs, as early withdrawal penalties can hinder financial goals. Exploring alternative low-risk investments like high-yield savings accounts or Treasury bonds is also suggested. Investors should monitor interest rate trends, as a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September could lead to lower CD rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German Foreign Ministry has confirmed that 211 Afghans, approved for resettlement in Germany, were deported from Pakistan back to Afghanistan. These individuals, including human rights defenders and journalists, had fled to Pakistan fearing persecution under the Taliban. Germany is now in contact with Pakistani authorities to facilitate their return to Pakistan, while interim accommodation has been arranged in Afghanistan. This incident occurs amidst Pakistan's ongoing mass deportations of Afghan refugees and Germany's recent pause on resettlement plans due to a tougher stance on migration.</p>

          <p>Newcastle striker Alexander Isak is reportedly not expected to attend Tuesday night's Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) awards gala, despite being nominated for the main award. His absence is linked to ongoing uncertainty surrounding his future at St James' Park, as he seeks a transfer to Liverpool before the deadline. Isak is currently not training with the first team, and attending the ceremony could put him in an awkward position given the controversy. His potential move could significantly impact Liverpool's summer sales figures.</p>

          <p>European leaders have rushed to Washington to meet with President Trump and President Zelenskyy, aiming to prevent Ukraine's 'capitulation' in potential peace talks with Russia. Their primary concern is Trump's shift in strategy, including dropping calls for a ceasefire and not imposing further sanctions on Russia, which they believe favors Moscow. The leaders seek to convince Trump that peace cannot be achieved by Ukraine ceding territory and that security guarantees must extend to broader European stability. They view the current diplomatic moment as one of 'extreme jeopardy' for the continent's security.</p>

The innocent victim was eating ice cream inside a restaurant when a passing motorbike fired six shots. Riley played a 'key role' in the incident, conducting reconnaissance and helping the gunman evade capture. The girl survived with life-changing injuries, and her family expressed profound devastation. The gunman and weapon remain at large, with police offering a reward for information.</p>

          <p>MSNBC will change its name to 'My Source News Opinion World,' or MS Now, and drop the iconic NBCUniversal peacock logo as part of its separation from Comcast. This rebranding aims to distinguish MSNBC from NBC News, with a new independent newsroom and Washington, D.C. bureau being established. While the name changes, the network's commitment to its audience and programming focus will remain. CNBC, also part of the new Versant company, will retain its name but also adopt a new logo without the peacock. The changes are expected before year-end.</p>

          <p>Parents are being warned to stop using Nutrition Ignition Kids Magnesium Glycinate Gummies after tests revealed they contain undeclared melatonin, a prescription-only drug. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found significant levels of melatonin, which can cause drowsiness, headaches, and nausea in children. The product, marketed to support 'calm, focus and digestion,' has been pulled from sale, and its brand website deleted. The discovery was made after concerned mothers noticed their children falling asleep unusually quickly after consuming the gummies.</p>

Democrats stated their return allows them to build a legal record to challenge what they call a 'racist map' in court.

          <p>A major experiment in rural Kenya has revealed that unconditional cash transfers can dramatically reduce infant and child mortality, on par with medical interventions like vaccines. Infants born to families receiving $1,000 were nearly half as likely to die, with deaths of children under five dropping by 45%. The study found cash most effective in reducing deaths during birth and the weeks after, largely by improving access to healthcare facilities and enabling families to afford necessary care. This suggests cash can be a powerful tool in public health, especially where access to care is financially constrained.</p>

She argues that his diplomatic methods oversimplify complex geopolitical conflicts, showing a lack of respect for historical context and strategic patience required for lasting resolutions.

It emphasizes that a credible security guarantee for Ukraine is unlikely without direct US involvement, which Trump seems unwilling to commit to. The only plausible path to peace, the article argues, is to arm Ukraine robustly, creating a battlefield reality that convinces Putin he cannot achieve further gains.</p>
