          <p>A federal jury in Colorado determined that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed Eric Coomer, a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems, after the 2020 presidential election. Coomer sued Lindell after Lindell called him a traitor and accused him of stealing the election on his online platform. Dominion previously settled a defamation lawsuit against Fox News for airing false claims and Newsmax apologized to Coomer for similar allegations. The jury awarded Coomer $2.3 million in damages for the harm to his career and mental health caused by Lindell's false statements. Lindell claimed the trial was to bring awareness to getting rid of electronic voting machines.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City police are investigating two self-described "peacekeepers" following a fatal shooting at a "No Kings Day" protest. The incident occurred when the two men confronted Arturo Roberto Gamboa, who allegedly raised a rifle towards the crowd, leading one of the peacekeepers to open fire, killing an innocent bystander, Arthur Folasa "Afa" Ah Loo, and wounding Gamboa. Police say there was no record of organized security in the event's permit and are working to determine the legality of the peacekeeper's actions. Gamboa, who was dressed in black clothing and a mask, has been booked into jail for investigation of murder, though he did not fire any shots.</p>

Obeng, who is Black, claims he experienced emotional distress after being targeted by the company's dress code, which requires employees to wear company-issued hats and men to be clean-shaven. He alleges that he was unfairly criticized, denied promotion opportunities, and ultimately fired for resisting orders to shave his sideburns, which he considered important to his cultural identity.
