          <p>Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has voiced significant frustration with the Republican party, stating she feels it has lost touch with its "America First" base. While she has no plans to leave the GOP, she criticized its leadership, particularly House Speaker Mike Johnson, for allegedly betraying core conservative principles and reverting to a "neocon" past. Greene acknowledged her increasing isolation within the party as she pursues an unconventional legislative agenda, including bills on cloud-seeding and making English the official U.S. language. Her comments reflect a broader trend of voter dissatisfaction with both major political parties, as independents now constitute nearly half the electorate.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. jobs report for July has intensified concerns about a significant economic slowdown, with nonfarm payrolls growing by only 73,000 and previous months' figures being revised downward. This weak labor market data, traditionally a lagging indicator, suggests the economy may be sputtering more than other metrics show, with some economists now placing recession odds at 50%. While second-quarter GDP growth appeared strong, the first-half average was only 1.2%, and consumer spending has been tepid. The report has fueled debate over whether the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates to stimulate the economy, a move President Trump has advocated for. (not investment advice)</p>

Discovering the sport during her recovery, she excelled, leading her to successfully petition the Los Angeles Chargers to sponsor the first girls' flag football team at her high school. Guitron has since won a high school championship, earned MVP honors, and won a gold medal with the U.S. junior national team.

          <p>A political standoff is escalating in Texas as Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove Democratic state lawmakers from office if they do not return to the statehouse for a special session on redistricting. The Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a new congressional map that could create up to five new GOP seats and help secure their U.S. House majority. Democratic leaders from other states, including New York and Illinois, have offered support to the Texas lawmakers. Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton have suggested the absent Democrats could be arrested and forcibly returned, escalating the high-stakes confrontation.</p>

          <p>Space technology firm Firefly Aerospace has raised the target price range for its initial public offering, now aiming for a valuation of over $6 billion. The company, known for its Alpha rockets and lunar landers, now expects to price its shares between $41 and $43, which could raise nearly $697 million. This increase reflects strong investor interest in the space sector, which has seen renewed activity with companies like Voyager going public. Firefly has secured partnerships with NASA and major defense contractors, and its revenues have grown significantly, although its net losses have also widened as it continues to expand its operations.

          <p>Following a weak July jobs report, market sentiment is growing that the Federal Reserve will be compelled to cut interest rates in September to support a slowing economy. This expectation helped fuel a broad-based market rally, with analysts suggesting a rate cut could boost stocks. Meanwhile, a Morgan Stanley analysis indicates that major tech companies are projected to dramatically increase their capital expenditures on AI infrastructure through 2026. This sustained spending signals strong confidence in AI's long-term profitability and is seen as a positive driver for both tech giants and related industrial sectors that support data center construction.

          <p>Student loan borrowers who remain in the SAVE plan's administrative forbearance will see their debt balances grow as interest resumed on August 1. The Department of Education has recommended that borrowers in the now-defunct SAVE plan switch to an alternative income-driven repayment (IDR) option to avoid accumulating interest and to continue making progress toward loan forgiveness. Experts warn that staying in the forbearance will be costly, with a typical borrower potentially accruing over $200 in interest per month. The best alternative for most borrowers is considered to be the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, which caps monthly payments based on income.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans in the Midwest and Northeast are under air quality alerts as smoke from extensive Canadian wildfires drifts south. Cities like Detroit have registered some of the worst air quality in the world, with the Air Quality Index reaching "unhealthy" levels in numerous areas. The smoke is affecting states from Wisconsin to Maine, with sensitive groups such as children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions advised to take precautions. The haze is expected to persist and potentially worsen over the next few days as the smoke sinks further into the Northeast, impacting more communities.</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old boy and girl have been detained for what a judge described as "the most awful offences against animals" she had ever seen, involving the torture and killing of two kittens. The animals were found mutilated in a wooded area in Ruislip, with ropes attached to them and their bodies cut open. At the scene, police discovered blowtorches and knives. Notes found on the boy's phone detailed his urges to kill a human, stating he had killed cats to reduce these urges. Both teenagers were given detention orders and a lifetime ban on owning animals.</p>

          <p>After a decade of research, scientists have identified the cause of a mysterious disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along the Pacific coast of North America since 2013. A new study reveals that the culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was also found in shellfish and causes the sea stars' arms to fall off before they disintegrate. The epidemic devastated over 20 species, with the sunflower sea star losing 90% of its population, leading to an explosion in sea urchins and the destruction of kelp forests. This discovery offers hope for developing interventions to restore sea star populations and their ecosystems.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month delay on its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States, which were set to take effect this week. This move provides time to implement the trade agreement reached in late July between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The deal aims to de-escalate trade tensions by setting a 15% tariff on most EU goods, though negotiations on key items like car parts are ongoing. An EU spokesperson stated the delay is intended to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic while the details of the agreement are finalized.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, after an incident involving a recreational boat. According to New Jersey State Police, it appears the whale charged at the 21-foot vessel, causing a passenger to be thrown overboard, though no one was injured. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death shortly after the encounter. The whale was found resting on a shallow sandbar, and due to tidal conditions, crews were initially unable to access it. Officials plan to tow the whale to a nearby state park to conduct a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has identified a controversial Florida-run migrant detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a model for a new federal strategy. The plan involves establishing similar state-run facilities near airports in states like Arizona, Nebraska, and Louisiana to detain and deport unauthorized migrants more efficiently. The Florida facility, located in the Everglades, has faced legal challenges over its constitutionality and accusations of inhumane conditions. Noem argued that this model is more cost-effective and sends a strong deterrent message, claiming that fear of detention and removal is encouraging voluntary returns to home countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump's abrupt firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, following a weak jobs report, has drawn sharp criticism from former agency leaders and economic groups. Trump alleged the data was "faked" and "rigged," claims for which he provided no evidence. A group chaired by both Obama- and Trump-appointed former BLS commissioners called the firing meritless and said it undermines the credibility of vital economic statistics. They, along with several Republican senators, have called for a congressional investigation to ensure the nonpartisan integrity of the agency is protected from political interference.</p>

          <p>The 60% rule is a key regulation for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), limiting borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds within the first year. This FHA guideline was designed to prevent seniors from depleting their home equity too quickly, promoting long-term financial stability. However, in an economy with rising costs, this rule can challenge borrowers who need a larger lump sum for immediate needs like paying off debt or funding home renovations. An important exception allows homeowners to exceed the 60% limit if the funds are used to pay off existing mandatory obligations like a primary mortgage. (not investment advice)</p>
