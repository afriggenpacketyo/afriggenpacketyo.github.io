          <p>David Ha, CEO of Sakana AI K.K., is urging the Japanese government to prioritize the development of AI technology for defense applications. He believes that Japan's security environment necessitates a focus on domestic AI development, especially given the increasingly deglobalized world and potential for AI to become a bargaining chip for other countries. Ha noted that Sakana AI sees growth potential in collaborating with the Japanese government on defense-related solutions, particularly in areas like information technology infrastructure and cyber security. The company, known as a unicorn, was recently awarded for its systems predicting pandemics and detecting AI-generated images, showcasing its capabilities in addressing defense innovation needs.</p>

          <p>Facing record-high rice prices, Japanese supermarkets are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with affordable alternatives. Aeon Co. is set to sell California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than domestic rice, following the lead of other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co., which have seen strong demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest in more affordable options due to a poor harvest in 2023. The U.S. Ambassador to Japan hailed the sale of U.S.-grown rice as "historic," emphasizing its importance for American farmers and Japanese consumers concerned about food prices.</p>

          <p>As the UK prepares to ban disposable vapes starting June 1st, many vapers are panic-buying in anticipation of the new regulations. The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and discourage youth vaping, but some former smokers worry about returning to cigarettes due to the convenience and taste preferences associated with disposable vapes. Retailers are reporting a surge in sales as customers stock up, while others express concerns about the metallic taste of rechargeable alternatives. Baroness Claire Fox, a former smoker, argues that the ban is counterproductive, as disposable vapes have been instrumental in helping people quit smoking.</p>

He also emphasized the importance of economic security issues, such as supply chains for strategic goods, in the tariff negotiations.

          <p>Satellite images have revealed the extent of damage to a North Korean naval destroyer following a failed launch ceremony, reportedly causing distress to leader Kim Jong Un. The images show the ship twisted and partially submerged in the port of Chongjin. The launch mishap occurred when a flatcar failed to move, causing the warship to lose balance and sustain damage. Kim Jong Un reportedly blamed military officials for the incident, demanding repairs before the upcoming Working Party meeting. The incident is a setback to North Korea's efforts to showcase its military strength.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to reduce the retail price to 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. This initiative seeks to address mounting criticism over rising rice prices, which have hurt households amid broader inflation. The government intends to commence negotiated contracts with retailers and explore online sales to ensure widespread distribution. The move comes as rice prices in Japanese supermarkets have reached record highs, nearly doubling last year's levels, due to a poor harvest and increased demand from inbound tourism.</p>

Debris from intercepted missiles and drones fell in multiple city districts, causing injuries and fires. Mayor Vitalii Klitschko warned residents of incoming Russian strike drones. The prisoner swap, agreed upon in Istanbul, marked a moment of cooperation amid ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Meteorologists are raising concerns about the impact of cuts to weather balloon sites by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on the accuracy of weather forecasts. The cuts, including sites in Michigan and Wisconsin, have created gaps in data collection, hindering the ability to predict severe weather events like ice storms and tornadoes. Meteorologists emphasize that weather balloons provide irreplaceable data on air pressure and moisture, which cannot be fully compensated for by satellites or radar. Former NWS leaders have warned of potential loss of life due to understaffing and program cuts.</p>
