          <p>The Army is planning a military parade in Washington, D.C., to celebrate its 250th anniversary on June 14, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, with estimated costs ranging from $25 million to $45 million. The parade is expected to feature over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the FAA. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly stated the cost would be shared by the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, emphasizing the parade as a fitting tribute to those who have served. Democrats, like Rep. Steve Cohen, have criticized the plan as a wasteful display of ego, while Trump has defended the cost as "peanuts" compared to the value of celebrating the military's strength.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a comprehensive bill to implement President Trump's agenda, featuring approximately $3.8 trillion in tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy. To offset these tax cuts, the bill proposes significant reductions in health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. Key provisions include extending many of the 2017 tax cuts, introducing new temporary tax cuts campaigned on by Trump (such as not taxing tips or overtime), and providing a bonus deduction for Americans over 65. The bill also aims to cut Medicaid through work requirements and reduce funding to states providing healthcare to undocumented immigrants, while increasing military spending and immigration enforcement, all of which has sparked debate and dissent among Republicans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria took Treasury Department officials by surprise, creating confusion about which measures would be rolled back and at what pace. The decision came after months of lobbying from Syria's transitional government, which argues that sanctions have hindered its ability to pay civil service salaries and rebuild infrastructure. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that relief may come in the form of waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties. Some sanctions date back to 1979, while others were imposed on the former Assad regime for human rights abuses and support for terrorist groups.</p>

          <p>An internal review indicates that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is "not ready" for the upcoming hurricane season, citing staff cuts and a push by President Trump to reduce the agency's role. The review, dated May 12, highlights a need for FEMA to refocus on its core mission, with concerns that hurricane season preparedness has been "derailed" due to staffing and contract changes. The presentation also mentions "culture issues" and challenges coordinating with other federal agencies, suggesting a shift towards states taking on more emergency response duties. Despite these concerns, a DHS official stated that FEMA is "fully activated" in preparation for the hurricane season.</p>

          <p>A photo of seashells arranged to spell "8647" posted on Instagram by former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed it was a "threat" against President Trump. Trump's supporters interpreted the message as an endorsement of violence against the 47th president, with "86" being slang for getting rid of something. Comey removed the post and stated he was unaware of the potential meaning and opposes violence of any kind. The incident ignited a firestorm on the right, with accusations that Comey was calling for Trump's assassination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports, according to preliminary government data. The contraction was more significant than the 0.1% expected by economists, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. This decline is attributed to uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, impacting Japan's export-dependent economy. Despite these concerns, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) seems set to continue raising its policy rate, with some board members saying the bank's inflation target of 2% is likely to be realized.</p>

The sheriff's department confirmed that it has opened an investigation into the allegations made against the 85-year-old singer in a lawsuit filed last Tuesday. Robinson's lawyer, Christopher Frost, stated that they welcome the investigation, confident that it will demonstrate Robinson did nothing wrong and that the lawsuit is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion.

Labour MP Paula Barker expressed concern about planned cuts to disability benefits, warning against moving "further and faster in the wrong direction."

          <p>Small businesses in the U.S. are experiencing financial strain due to President Trump's fluctuating tariffs on Chinese goods, causing uncertainty and impacting profitability. Bobby Djavaheri, owner of Yedi Houseware Appliances, faced a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, significantly increasing his duty tax bills. While the tariff has been reduced to 30% for at least 90 days, the instability has forced him to increase prices and navigate rising shipping costs. Logistics companies are seeing high demand for foreign trade zone facilities and bonded warehouses, allowing businesses to defer tariff payments. Djavaheri believes he cannot count on making a profit this year and is just trying to stay afloat.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on limiting the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions against unconstitutional government actions, particularly concerning President Trump's order to eliminate birthright citizenship. The justices appear ideologically divided, with the outcome potentially hinging on Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Brett M. Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. The Trump administration argues that nationwide injunctions prevent the executive branch from carrying out its constitutional duties, while Justice Elena Kagan countered that the President should be stopped if violating the Constitution. Erwin Chemerinsky argues that federal courts are the only way to check Trump's orders and uphold the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A man was apprehended at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry for attempting to smuggle parrots into California by concealing six birds in his boots, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. The officers noticed "unusual clothing bulges" around his ankles and discovered the undeclared birds. Six additional parrots, including two dead ones, were found in his car. This incident follows other recent attempts to smuggle livestock across the U.S.-Mexico border, highlighting the dangers of smuggling animals, which can carry diseases that threaten native wildlife and agricultural industries.</p>

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that substantial updates to existing vaccines may qualify as "new products," requiring additional clinical evaluation. The FDA has already requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its Covid vaccine. HHS is also considering ending the recommendation of Covid vaccines for children and pregnant women, raising concerns about the future of vaccine infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A pregnant woman in Georgia, declared brain-dead after a medical emergency, has been kept on life support for three months to allow the fetus to grow enough for delivery, a decision the family says the hospital attributed to the state's anti-abortion law. Georgia's "heartbeat law" restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected, generally around six weeks into pregnancy. The family is upset that the law doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support. The situation raises questions about the rights of brain-dead pregnant women versus the rights of the fetus.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his administration is nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, a key objective of his second term, during a business round table in Doha, Qatar. Trump said Iran has "sort of agreed to the terms" but exactly what that deal would look like remains unclear, as both sides are far from a consensus on key issues. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran would never give up its right to civilian nuclear energy, adding that none of its nuclear enrichment facilities will be dismantled. Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy, and Araghchi have held four rounds of negotiations, mediated by Oman.</p>
