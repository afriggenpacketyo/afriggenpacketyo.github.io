          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in federal funding, primarily targeting foreign aid programs like USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote followed a delay caused by heated debates over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, highlighting the contentious political atmosphere surrounding the legislation. The package, which passed largely along party lines, now heads to the president for his expected signature, marking a significant victory for fiscal conservatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent action by India's securities regulator against high-frequency trading firm Jane Street has put a spotlight on the fine line between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation. Regulators accused the firm of a deliberate strategy to manipulate stock indices to profit from options bets, while Jane Street maintains its actions were standard arbitrage. Financial experts explain that the distinction often hinges on intent and whether a trader is actively creating price distortions rather than merely exploiting pre-existing ones.

          <p>Syrian government forces have largely withdrawn from the southern province of Sweida following days of deadly clashes with local Druze militias. The conflict, which had drawn in neighboring Israel to conduct airstrikes in defense of the Druze community, was paused by a ceasefire mediated by the U.S., Turkey, and Arab nations. Despite the truce, the situation remains volatile, with reports of revenge attacks and the displacement of Bedouin communities, highlighting persistent and dangerous sectarian tensions.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street Journal report alleges that Donald Trump sent a crude and lewd birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which was part of a collection gathered by Ghislaine Maxwell. The letter reportedly featured a mock dialogue inside the drawing of a naked woman and a suggestive closing line. President Trump has vehemently denied the story, labeling it as "fake" and malicious, and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the newspaper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch.</p>

          <p>A former senior officer from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency has described China's research into creating biologically enhanced "supersoldiers" as a disturbing reality. The research, reportedly conducted by the People's Liberation Army, explores modifying human physiology and psychology to create more physically and mentally superior individuals for combat. While the extent of China's progress remains unknown, the concept has raised significant ethical and national security concerns among U.S. officials about the future of warfare.</p>

          <p>An Israeli military strike hit the Holy Family Church in Gaza, the only Catholic parish in the Strip, resulting in the deaths of three people and injuring ten others, including the parish priest. The church was providing shelter to hundreds of displaced civilians at the time of the incident. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement expressing deep regret, acknowledging the strike was a mistake caused by "stray ammunition" and promising a transparent investigation.</p>

          <h2>Tensions Between Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Powell Explained</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the ongoing friction between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, focusing on the Fed's dual mandate to control inflation while maximizing employment. Trump's criticism stems from the central bank's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates, which can slow economic growth, clashing with the president's political objectives. The report also touches on the legally untested question of whether a president can fire a Fed chair, a move that could roil financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Border Patrol conducted a series of immigration enforcement raids in Sacramento, with a sector chief recording a video in front of the state capitol to declare there is "no such thing as a sanctuary state." The operation, which resulted in 11 arrests, was immediately blasted by the governor's office as illegal racial profiling and has intensified fear within immigrant communities. The raids appear to be a direct challenge to California's sanctuary policies and a recent federal court order limiting such actions.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has authorized Juul Labs to continue selling its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products in the United States, reversing a ban issued in 2022. The agency concluded that the company's scientific data showed its products could be a less harmful alternative for adult smokers who switch completely from combustible cigarettes. The decision is highly controversial and is expected to draw sharp criticism from public health and anti-tobacco advocates who blame Juul for the teen vaping epidemic.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna stated that his department has "no choice" but to comply with federal judicial warrants that demand the transfer of inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Luna distinguished these criminal warrants from civil immigration detainers, which the department does not honor, in adherence with state sanctuary laws. His remarks were intended to reassure communities fearful of wider cooperation with ICE amid recent high-profile federal immigration raids in the region.</p>

          <p>This analysis scrutinizes President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola has agreed to use "REAL Cane Sugar" instead of high-fructose corn syrup in its soda. The article argues that this move is a political gesture designed to score easy points with his base rather than a meaningful public health victory. Experts point out that cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are metabolically almost identical, meaning the switch offers negligible health benefits and distracts from the real issue of high sugar consumption.</p>

          <p>Dalian Polytechnic University in China has expelled a female student for having a relationship with a foreign man, an act the university claimed "damaged national dignity." The decision, which came after intimate videos were posted online, has triggered a massive public debate on Chinese social media. Many users are condemning the university's action as an extreme overreach, accusing it of misogyny and a dangerous form of nationalism for punishing a student's private life as a matter of national importance.</p>
