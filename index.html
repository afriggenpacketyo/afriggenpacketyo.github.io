          <p>ESPN's Jay Williams drew parallels between Luka Doncic's recent performance decline and the stock market's downturn following President Trump's tariffs announcement. Williams noted Doncic's decreased shooting efficiency since joining the Lakers, linking it to the market's struggles. He highlighted that both Lakers fans and the broader market would benefit from improvements in both Doncic's game and economic stability. Later that night, Doncic scored 35 points, suggesting a potential turnaround. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E</p>

          <p>California has an opportunity to expand funding for climate-smart agricultural practices, which simultaneously reduce emissions and improve climate resilience. Despite the approval of a $10 billion climate bond, current funding for these programs is inadequate to meet farmer demand. Increased investment in strategies like cover cropping and hedgerow planting can provide economic benefits to farmers while also reducing pollution and improving soil health. The author advocates for allocating 15% of the State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to these programs.</p>
