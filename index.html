          <p>A common aviation practice played a role in a fatal plane crash at Reagan National Airport involving an Army Black Hawk helicopter. The crew requested and received permission to use "visual separation," a procedure that allows pilots to navigate around other aircraft independently. Aviation experts have long warned of the risks associated with mishandling visual separation, which can lead to deadly consequences. The incident underscores the importance of strict adherence to safety protocols and the potential dangers of relying solely on visual cues in busy airspace.</p>

The decision, heavily advocated by American Samoan tuna lobbyists, allows commercial fishing within the monument's boundaries, potentially harming threatened species and fragile ecosystems. Experts warn of the potential rise in illegal fishing, bycatch, and the negative impact on shark conservation.

          <p>LGBTQ+ Pride festivals are facing sponsorship challenges as corporations, once vocal supporters, withdraw due to economic concerns and an increasingly hostile climate for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Several Pride organizations are experiencing significant funding deficits, forcing them to modify programming and seek alternative funding sources. While some companies cite economic reasons, others point to anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and executive orders as contributing factors. Some Pride organizations are reevaluating partnerships with sponsors whose values no longer align with their communities, further complicating their financial outlook.</p>

          <p>The US federal government's vast collection of data, combined with technological advancements, is creating conditions for a potential surveillance state. The Trump administration's efforts to eliminate data silos and grant access to sensitive information across agencies raise concerns about abuse. Experts warn that this data, combined with private-sector information, could be used to target individuals and groups based on political affiliation or other traits. The administration's actions are seen as a threat to privacy and freedom, potentially reversing decades of established safeguards.</p>
