          <p>Chery Automobile, a major Chinese car manufacturer, intends to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong during the third quarter of this year, according to Chairman Yin Tongyue. The company aims to leverage Hong Kong as a hub for its global market ventures, emphasizing the city's advantages in manufacturing, research and development, and data management. Chery's IPO is projected to raise approximately US$1.5 billion, with China International Capital, Huatai Securities, and GF Securities acting as joint sponsors for the listing. This move underscores Chery's ambition to establish a stronger international presence and capitalize on Hong Kong's financial infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Japan continues to lag behind other G7 countries in gender equality, ranking 118th out of 148 nations in the 2025 gender gap report by the World Economic Forum. While Japan has shown improvements in women's economic participation, it still scores poorly in political empowerment, reflecting the low representation of women in government and the absence of a female prime minister. The report estimates that it will take 123 years to achieve full gender parity globally, with Japan showing slow progress since 2006. Iceland leads the overall ranking, while New Zealand is the highest-ranked country in the East Asia and Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman has announced criminal charges against several individuals involved in recent immigration protests in the city. The charges range from assault on a peace officer to commercial burglary and vandalism, with potential sentences ranging from three years to life in prison. Hochman emphasized that while peaceful protests are acknowledged, violent acts such as throwing fireworks or cinder blocks will not be tolerated. He also noted that peaceful protests have largely outweighed instances of violence, with thousands participating legitimately. The DA's office aims to prosecute those engaging in criminal activities during the protests.</p>

          <p>Israeli lawmakers rejected a preliminary vote to dissolve the parliament, known as the Knesset, according to a statement released early Thursday. The opposition-submitted bill failed to pass, with a vote of 61-53, falling short of the required majority in the 120-seat parliament. This vote could have initiated a snap election, with polls indicating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition would likely lose.

          <p>The U.S. is prioritizing domestic nuclear energy production to power the growing demands of artificial intelligence, with the first phase of a uranium enrichment facility opening in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This initiative aims to reduce reliance on foreign uranium imports and compete with China's rapid expansion in nuclear power. President Trump signed executive orders to quadruple domestic nuclear energy production by 2050, requiring the construction of at least 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. The move comes as data centers, particularly those supporting AI, are expected to consume a significant portion of U.S. energy in the coming years.</p>

The astronomers described the star as being the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp, with a pure yellow color, and noted that it remained stationary for 10 days. This discovery confirms that the event was a nova rather than a comet or meteor and provides unprecedented details about the star's size and brightness. The findings, reported by researchers from China, Germany, and Chile, help to narrow down the star's possible position.</p>

This pact, aimed at countering China's growing power, involves Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines from the US and sharing cutting-edge technology. The review comes as the US pressures allies to increase military spending, with the UK agreeing to spend 2.5% of GDP on defense by 2028 and 3% by the next parliament. Some analysts suggest the review could lead to a shift in focus from submarines to sharing other long-range weapons technology.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability rating among Republicans has decreased by 16 points since March, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number has dropped from 78% to 62%. Overall, only 30% of voters surveyed hold a favorable opinion of Musk, with a significant divide between Republican and Democratic voters. The decline follows a public falling out between Musk and President Trump, although Musk remains popular among Republicans for his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

          <p>The United States may extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if negotiations continue in good faith, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Japan is one such partner actively negotiating with the Trump administration, with Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump scheduled to meet during a G7 summit in Canada. The administration's priority remains securing trade deals with key partners, including Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

However, day-to-day spending is limited, and even cut in some areas, at a time of volatile politics and widespread restlessness among the electorate. The government is taking a gamble by prioritizing long-term investments over immediate gains, hoping that patience will pay off despite the current political climate.

The 86 million-year-old skeletons belong to the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the iconic T.rex. This discovery sheds light on how tyrannosaurs evolved from small hunters to formidable giants with powerful jaws, allowing them to dominate North America and Asia until the end of the dinosaur era. The new species represents a transitional fossil between earlier ancestors and the mighty tyrannosaurs.</p>
