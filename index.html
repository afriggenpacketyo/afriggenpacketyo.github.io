          <p>Haoxiang Gao, a Chinese national and University of Michigan student, fled the U.S. after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote on campus, leading to state charges and an order to surrender his passport. Despite this order, the FBI reports Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a Chinese passport, and a federal warrant was issued after he missed court hearings. The case is one of a small number of instances of non-citizens voting in federal elections. Optimism is tempered by the potential implications for election integrity. </p>

          <p>Ukrainian forces reportedly destroyed dozens of Russian warplanes in a coordinated drone strike on five military airfields deep within Russia. The operation, dubbed "Spider‚Äôs Web," took 18 months to plan and was overseen by President Zelenskyy, according to Ukraine's security service. Russia acknowledged the attacks, calling them a "terrorist act" and admitting that several aircraft caught fire. While Ukraine claims significant damage, U.S. officials are skeptical of the high numbers reported. The attack occurred before planned peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul, raising questions about the conflict's trajectory.</p>

          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a significant rebound after a standstill during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased demand for cruises has led to record domestic passenger numbers and a boost to local economies that rely on tourism. Japanese shipping giants are investing in cruise ships as a means of generating stable income, particularly as their cargo businesses face challenges due to trade tariffs. New ships with luxury amenities are being launched, and alliances with companies like Oriental Land, operator of Tokyo Disney Resort, are in development to further enhance the cruise experience.</p>

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) supports collaboration where possible but enforces existing laws to protect students. Universities face financial pressures due to declining international student enrollment and rising costs, leading to course cutbacks and job losses, with the government reviewing higher education funding.</p>

The law has drawn criticism from political parties, lobby groups, and former U.S. President Trump, who views it as discriminatory.

          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete, competed in the California track-and-field finals, facing scrutiny and protests. Despite controversy and a Title IX investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Justice, Hernandez won first-place medals in high jump and triple jump, and placed second in the long jump. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) implemented a policy change allowing an additional athlete to receive a medal in events where a transgender athlete qualified. Protests occurred outside the event, with some holding signs and banners, while inside the stadium, the events proceeded without disruption.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump, is refusing and returning her pardon for her role in the January 6 Capitol riot. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and that those involved were guilty. She sought assistance from her Republican senator to formally refuse the pardon, stating that she cannot live with herself knowing she was guilty and accepting a pardon. Her decision contrasts with other January 6 defendants who sought and utilized their pardons, highlighting a divergence in views regarding the events of that day.</p>

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, is campaigning to correct what he believes is a pension "robbery." Williams claims he was unfairly discharged in 1970, missing out on significantly improved pension rules that took effect in 1972. Despite serving 18 years, he receives a lower pension than his brother-in-law, who had a similar service record but was discharged later. The Ministry of Defence maintains that Williams' pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement" based on the rules at the time of his discharge.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer argues that President Trump's unpredictable policies are negatively impacting the stock market, creating a "Trump discount" across various sectors. He cites examples such as Nvidia, retail stocks, and drug companies, where uncertainty surrounding trade, regulations, and healthcare policies are hindering growth. Cramer suggests that the lack of stability and the potential for sudden policy changes are driving investors to seek opportunities elsewhere. He also mentions the administration's stance on certain companies, such as Apple and Google, as contributing factors to the market's unease. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling party's candidate, Kim Moon-soo, initially defended Yoon's actions, turning the election into a referendum on martial law.
