          <p>Negotiators from Iran and the United States are meeting in Rome for a crucial fifth round of talks regarding Iran's nuclear program, mediated by Oman's Foreign Minister.

Iran asserts that no enrichment means no deal, highlighting the strong stances of both sides. These talks occur against a backdrop of heightened tensions and a history of broken agreements, particularly Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear pact, making progress challenging but essential for regional stability.</p>

The Orleans Parish District Attorney has issued subpoenas to the Orleans Parish Sheriff and other staff members as part of an ongoing investigation into the escape, seeking access to communications related to the jailbreak.

Columbia is accused of not properly addressing complaints from Jewish students and failing to enforce its own policies regarding on-campus protests.

          <p>The German economy saw an unexpected 0.4% growth in the first quarter of 2025, compared to the previous quarter, according to the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis). This growth is attributed to a surge in exports ahead of US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Meanwhile, Germany's new government is considering extending the Bundeswehr's involvement in three foreign missions. This economic growth provides a positive outlook amidst global trade tensions and ongoing discussions about international security.</p>

          <p>Trade upheaval resulting from the tariff war ignited by US President Donald Trump last month appears to have cast a long-lasting impact on the mindset of Chinese policy influencers, with thoughts of “preparing for the worst” spreading at a forum in Beijing on Thursday. With exporters rushing to secure US-bound shipments during the 90-day truce period, many ex-official and policy advisers have urged the government to guard against any future barrage of American punches, and to also rally the support of major trading partners and forge stronger relations with Global South nations. Zhang Jun, former Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, called the China-US talks in Geneva a positive development, but he explicitly warned that the tariff war – with Washington’s tariff levies having risen as high as 145 per cent and effectively bringing bilateral trade flow to a halt before the truce – has already inflicted deep and lasting harm.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa turned into a spectacle of humiliation rather than a productive discussion on serious issues. Instead of addressing topics like tariffs or aid cuts, Trump focused on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide, presenting misleading evidence to support his claims. This behavior undermines the potential for cooperation between the two countries and reflects a broader pattern of Trump prioritizing scoring points with his base over engaging in meaningful diplomacy. Despite Trump's actions, Ramaphosa remained composed, highlighting South Africa's upcoming hosting of the G20 summit and implicitly underscoring the shifting global landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to potentially block Harvard from enrolling international students, particularly those from China, is seen as a blow to one of the last admired American institutions. The move could reshape the relationship between the two countries by cutting off a vital source of aspiration and veneration for American universities among Chinese students. While some in China express concern and outrage, others see it as accelerating China's ascent by diverting talent and revenue to Chinese institutions. This action adds to existing worries among Chinese students in the US regarding discrimination, visa issues, and research funding cuts.</p>

The company experienced a 49% year-on-year drop in first-quarter revenue, with the January sanctions being particularly impactful.

Made primarily from zinc with a copper coating, the penny costs more to produce than its face value, prompting the decision to discontinue its minting.

          <p>Princess Aiko, the only child of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, will travel to Laos in November in what will be her first official overseas visit. The Imperial Household Agency said that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Japan and Laos, and the 23-year-old princess will visit the Southeast Asian nation to foster friendship and goodwill. The details of her visit are still under consideration, but the princess will likely meet with Laotian President Thongloun Sisoulith and attend events related to the anniversary, according to the agency.</p>
