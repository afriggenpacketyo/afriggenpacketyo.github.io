          <p>Dominion Energy executives report that the data center boom in Northern Virginia, known as 'Data Center Alley,' shows no signs of slowing, despite concerns about potential economic impacts from tariffs. The utility, a key electricity provider in Loudoun County, works closely with Big Tech companies investing heavily in data centers for artificial intelligence model training. Dominion has 40 gigawatts of data center capacity in various stages of contracting and executives note that data center customers have not paused spending or expressed concerns about economic uncertainty. Executives from Amazon and Nvidia echoed this sentiment at an energy conference, supporting Dominion's full-year operating earnings guidance.</p>

          <p>The 78th Tony Award nominations have been announced, showcasing a season marked by rebounding attendance and rising ticket prices on Broadway. While male actors dominated dramatic leading roles, women led in musical performances, resulting in snubs for stars like Idina Menzel. The new musicals 'Buena Vista Social Club,' 'Death Becomes Her,' and 'Maybe Happy Ending' tied with 10 nominations each, while Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal were notably overlooked for their roles in 'Othello.' The nominations highlight a season celebrating originality, though brand extensions like 'Smash' received fewer nods, and raise questions about diversity in backstage categories.</p>

The judge, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., ruled that the administration's claims about a Venezuelan gang did not constitute an 'invasion' as defined by the act. This decision challenges the White House's attempts to use the 18th-century law for modern immigration policy. The ruling could influence other cases involving the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, though it only directly applies to Venezuelan immigrants in the specified district.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that semaglutide, sold under brand names like Ozempic and Wegovy, may effectively treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a fatty liver condition. The research, involving approximately 800 patients, showed significant improvements in liver health among those receiving semaglutide. Experts note this is significant as there has been no specific FDA-approved treatment for this condition, which affects an estimated 17 million Americans. While promising, longer-term studies are needed to confirm the benefits and monitor potential side effects.</p>

          <p>The fate of California’s auto standards, which allow the state to enforce stricter environmental standards, now rests on a U.S. Senate battle after the House voted to limit California's authority. Republicans in the House voted to prohibit California from banning gas-powered cars by 2035 and from setting emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks. The Environmental Protection Agency has questioned whether that authority amounts to a technical “rule” that allows for the Senate to disapprove of the waiver with a simple majority vote, under the Congressional Review Act.</p>
