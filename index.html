          <p>President Trump has instructed Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to use all available funds to guarantee military service members receive their paychecks by October 15th, despite the ongoing government shutdown. Trump vehemently criticized Democrats, specifically Chuck Schumer, for what he termed a "Radical Left Shutdown," asserting they are holding the nation's military and security "hostage." He insisted that the government must reopen before any negotiations on issues like healthcare can commence. This article highlights the intense political deadlock, Trump's proactive measure for troops, and the Democrats' strategy focused on expiring healthcare tax cuts and Medicaid. The situation underscores deep partisan divisions over federal funding and priorities.</p>

Despite this setback, Allen, headlining the venue for the first time to a 9,000-strong home crowd, conveyed deep emotion and a firm resolve to continue his boxing career, having previously retired five years prior. Makhmudov, entering with an impressive 19 knockouts from 20 wins, proved a challenging adversary, enduring Allen's powerful blows and even two points deductions for holding. The article underscores Allen's fighting spirit and the overwhelming support from his fans in a memorable, if ultimately losing, effort.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to end British Summer Time (BST) on Sunday, October 26th, when clocks will move back by one hour, returning to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual adjustment, often remembered by the phrase "spring forward, fall back," means most people gain an hour but will experience earlier sunsets. The tradition of Daylight Saving Time, first adopted by Germany in 1916 to conserve wartime fuel, has been a long-standing practice in the UK. Ongoing discussions consider making BST permanent, with proponents highlighting potential economic benefits and fewer evening road accidents, while critics raise concerns about extremely dark winter mornings, especially in northern regions like Scotland.</p>

          <p>A helicopter crash in the bustling oceanfront area of Huntington Beach, Southern California, on Saturday afternoon led to the hospitalization of five individuals. The incident, occurring near Pacific Coast Highway and Huntington Street, involved two people from the helicopter and three pedestrians on the ground. Social media captured dramatic footage of the helicopter spinning before it collided with palm trees and the outdoor stairway of a pedestrian bridge. Emergency services quickly responded, closing a section of PCH for the ongoing investigation. The aircraft's tail detached, with the main body lodged between the staircase and trees, as authorities work to determine the cause of this significant accident.</p>

          <p>Marineland, a Canadian aquatic park, is threatening to euthanize 30 beluga whales after federal permits to sell them to a Chinese theme park were denied due to animal welfare concerns. The park, facing severe financial difficulties and a history of documented animal mistreatment, claims it can no longer afford their care. Animal welfare advocates and officials are seeking alternative solutions, though options for rehoming such a large group are limited and a new sanctuary won't be ready soon. Many believe Marineland's euthanasia threat is a tactic to secure government funding or pressure for the sale, as the clock ticks on finding a humane outcome.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic's debut in the Lakers' preseason games is still "to be determined," despite his full participation in Saturday's practice. This uncertainty comes as the team faces the start of the regular season without star player LeBron James, who is out for three to four weeks due to a sciatica nerve issue. Doncic acknowledged James's absence as a "big change" but stressed the team's "next man up" mentality, stating he simply wants to play basketball and contribute to wins. Coach JJ Redick confirmed prior knowledge of James's condition, indicating that game planning and potential lineup adjustments are already underway to adapt to his absence.</p>

          <p>China is currently drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint anticipated to significantly reshape the nation's infrastructure investment strategy. This upcoming plan is expected to prioritize more tech-driven and people-focused projects, moving beyond the extensive, rapid expansion seen in previous decades, which included a 2009 stimulus that contributed to local government debt. Despite these lingering financial burdens, government advisers remain optimistic about the value of continued infrastructure development. This article indicates that the new plan will guide China's economic growth and development over the next five years, emphasizing innovation and sustainability in its approach to large-scale public works.
