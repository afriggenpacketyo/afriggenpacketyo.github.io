          <p>To solve a decades-old double murder case, a cold case detective arranged an undercover meeting with suspect Bryan Patrick Miller at a Chili's restaurant. Posing as a security consultant offering a job, the detective's goal was to surreptitiously collect Miller's DNA from a used water glass. The operation was successful, and eleven days later, forensic analysis confirmed Miller's DNA matched the evidence found on the victims, Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. This crucial breakthrough led directly to the arrest of Miller, who was known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its ban on certain AI chip exports, announcing a new "revenue-sharing" agreement with companies like Nvidia and AMD. Under this controversial deal, the firms can sell specific, less advanced AI chips to China but must share 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. Trade experts express concern that this sets a "dangerous precedent," suggesting that national security-based export controls could be perceived as being for sale. The legality of the arrangement, which critics argue resembles an unconstitutional export tax, is still being reviewed by the Department of Commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

The collection, featuring 48 oil paintings and numerous sketches from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, is curated to emphasize the artist's "Russianness" and his connection to St. Petersburg's Imperial Academy of Arts. This focus on Repin's Russian identity comes as Ukraine, where the artist was born, has also claimed him as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition highlights a cultural dimension of the ongoing geopolitical tensions between the two nations.</p>

This phenomenon is becoming more common due to warming ocean and atmospheric temperatures linked to climate change. Although it has since weakened to a Category 4, Erin is the 11th Category 5 hurricane recorded since 2016, an unusually high number. The storm is expected to avoid a direct landfall but will generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has posted on social media for the first time since her "Good Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle sparked a divided public response. The campaign, which played on the term "great genes," was criticized by some for having racial undertones, while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. Sweeney, who has not publicly commented on the controversy, shared photos from a night out with friends. Reputation experts suggest the firestorm could ultimately boost her career and earning potential by increasing her public profile, regardless of the backlash from some quarters. This is one of two Fox News articles selected.</p>

The driver, however, contacted police claiming masked men had shot at him. Video of the incident shows agents breaking the car's windows before shots are heard. The San Bernardino Police Department responded but cited the California Values Act, which prohibits assisting with federal immigration enforcement, and left the scene.</p>

          <p>A long-standing guideline known as the "85th percentile rule" is being reconsidered by some U.S. states for setting speed limits. This rule suggests that the posted speed limit should match the speed of the 15th-fastest car out of 100, assuming most drivers naturally travel at a safe speed. However, critics argue this creates a feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians. In response to rising road fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors like road use and crash frequency should be considered, prompting a shift toward more context-sensitive policies.</p>

The technique creates what is described as "ionic glassy tissue," which preserves the organ's original shape and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. This process allows for highly accurate and vivid 3D imaging of biological structures. The resulting transparent tissue can also be stored long-term at low temperatures, providing a powerful new tool for biological research.</p>

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, known for his "Zombie Hunter" character, was tried for the 1990s murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. His defense admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused dissociative amnesia. Prosecutors countered this by highlighting Miller's memory of other violent acts and testimony from his ex-wife about his deviant behavior. The judge found him guilty on all counts and sentenced him to death, concluding that while the childhood abuse was proven, it did not absolve him of responsibility for the brutal crimes.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have proposed a design for a hypersonic drone carrier that revives NASA's "scissor wing" concept. The design features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at transonic speeds, it pivots to 45 degrees to mitigate shock waves. For hypersonic flight at Mach 5, the wing aligns parallel with the fuselage, turning the entire aircraft into a "waverider" for high efficiency. This innovative approach aims to solve the aerodynamic compromises inherent in aircraft designed for both low and high-speed flight.</p>

These triggers include a lifetime of repressing one's own needs to be "good," the burnout from perfectionism, having poor boundaries established in childhood, and being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage. Additionally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can act as a catalyst for re-evaluating life priorities.

          <p>A small private plane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego's Sorrento Valley on Saturday afternoon. The aircraft was reportedly en route from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport to Miramar Marine Corps Air Station when it experienced mechanical issues, forcing the pilot to land on the highway. The California Highway Patrol responded to the scene, and fortunately, no injuries were reported from the incident. The landing resulted in a temporary closure of all southbound lanes as authorities investigated and worked to remove the aircraft from the roadway.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Washington D.C. to protest President Trump's recent actions, including the deployment of the National Guard and the attempted federal takeover of the city's police department. Marching from DuPont Circle to the White House, protesters chanted against what they termed an overreach of federal power and a "crime emergency" they believe is exaggerated. The demonstration follows a successful legal challenge by D.C.'s Attorney General that blocked the appointment of a federally controlled "emergency police commissioner." Participants expressed concerns over the lack of checks and balances on presidential authority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a temporary truce in tariff escalations, Chinese sellers on platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu continue to express significant concern over policy uncertainties in the U.S. market. Many merchants, such as those selling portable coffee machines, were forced to halt their U.S. operations earlier in the year when bilateral trade relations soured. While the large U.S. market remains attractive due to high consumer traffic, the unpredictable nature of tariffs creates a challenging environment for business planning. This highlights the direct impact of high-level trade disputes on individual businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that Russia's rejection of a ceasefire complicates the path to peace. President Trump has signaled a desire to move directly to a permanent peace agreement, bypassing a ceasefire, and is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy in Washington. In response, Zelenskyy has outlined Ukraine's requirements for a sustainable peace, including credible security guarantees and the return of abducted children. He expressed concern that without a halt in fighting, Russia will continue its attacks to create more favorable conditions for negotiations.</p>

          <p>A White House official has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. as part of President Trump's public safety initiative "may be armed." While the troops are not currently making arrests, their mission includes protecting federal assets and providing a visible presence to deter crime. This statement marks a potential shift from earlier guidance suggesting that weapons would remain in armories unless specifically needed. The deployment, which includes 800 D.C. Guard members and hundreds more from other states, is a response to what the administration has declared a public safety emergency in the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, driven by the new "Stratus" variant, with the Southwest region reporting the nation's highest positivity rate at 12.5%. This increase coincides with students returning to school and a recent change in CDC guidance, no longer universally recommending updated COVID shots for healthy children. The policy shift, advocated by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been challenged by medical organizations who argue the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. While positivity rates are rising, weekly deaths have so far remained low compared to previous surges.</p>
