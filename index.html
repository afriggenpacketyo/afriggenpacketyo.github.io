The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was apprehended after entering the museum and chanting "Free, free Palestine," indicating a possible motive related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

          <p>Lawyers for Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students, are requesting a trial postponement due to prejudicial publicity from an NBC "Dateline" special. The defense argues the program presented new, potentially nonpublic information, tainting the jury pool and infringing on Kohbergerâ€™s constitutional rights. Concerns also extend to an upcoming book on the case, with the defense claiming promotional material implies further leaks. A forensic expert notes the risk of jurors forming opinions based on potentially untrue information before the trial begins.</p>

The government is also considering mandatory chemical castration for sexual offenders and releasing new data on migration and public sector pay.

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving to revoke California's vehicle emissions waivers, a decision Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." The waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue they have the power to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the move is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims its waivers have led to significantly cleaner vehicles, and the state is prepared to sue if the waivers are revoked.</p>

          <p>Two staff members of the Israeli embassy were killed in a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington D.C. The suspect, identified as a 30-year-old man, was detained by event security after chanting "free, free Palestine." Officials, including President Trump, condemned the killings as an act of antisemitism. The victims, a man and a woman, were leaving an event at the museum when the suspect opened fire.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has started a new gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to ease cost-of-living pressures for consumers. The subsidy will provide a fixed sum to wholesalers, regardless of prices, with the goal of reducing wholesale gasoline prices. The program has been allocated around 1 trillion yen and could last until the end of March 2026. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election.</p>

          <p>A judge ruled that the Trump administration violated a court order by deporting migrants to South Sudan without allowing them to challenge their removal to a country where they could face torture or persecution. The migrants were deported shortly after receiving notice and without an opportunity to assert their claims for protection. The judge ordered the Trump administration to provide each migrant with a reasonable fear interview with legal counsel and at least 72 hours' notice.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues related to bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgment suggests that the yen's weakness against the dollar should no longer be a point of contention in tariff talks. Kato expressed concern about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy and financial markets. Japan has started considering an option to back off from seeking a full removal of the U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with key conservative holdouts to the budget package containing his second-term agenda, before GOP leaders made concessions to fiscal hawks and blue-state Republicans. The House aims to vote on the bill possibly within hours, but faces challenges in unifying the party. The bill includes extending Trump's tax cuts, Medicaid work requirements, and changes to the state and local tax deduction. The legislation has faced criticism for its potential impact on the deficit.</p>

Trump questioned Ramaphosa about the alleged killings, despite statistics not supporting the claim that white people are more vulnerable to violent crime. This confrontation underscores Trump's tendency to frame white people as victims and his efforts to purge anything he deems "woke" from the federal government and American culture.</p>

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining attention as the "sell U.S." narrative strengthens, driven by Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Analysts predict that emerging markets will experience a bull run, fueled by a weaker U.S. dollar, a recovery in China's economy, and attractive valuations. A dented confidence in U.S. assets, marked by a selloff in U.S. Treasurys, equities, and the dollar, has boosted bullishness for emerging markets. However, this is not investment advice.</p>
