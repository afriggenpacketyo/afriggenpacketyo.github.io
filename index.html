          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary on President Trump's 79th birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade is expected to feature over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the FAA. Abrams tanks will also be part of the event, with metal plates laid down to protect the streets from damage. While the White House claims the cost will be shared, the event has drawn criticism from Democrats who view it as a wasteful display of ego.</p>

          <p>The Illinois House has passed legislation mandating more comprehensive background checks for police officers before hiring, spurred by the Sonya Massey killing. This article details how the bill, sponsored by state Rep. Kam Buckner, requires law enforcement agencies to inspect prior employment records of applicants, including conduct and fitness-for-duty examinations. The legislation aims to prevent situations like the hiring of Sean Grayson, who was charged with first-degree murder in Massey's death, despite documented concerns about his conduct at previous police jobs. The bill now heads to Gov. JB Pritzker's desk after unanimous Senate approval.</p>

          <p>Boeing may avoid a guilty plea and prosecution in a criminal case related to the 737 Max crashes, according to a source familiar with the matter. The Justice Department is reportedly considering a deal where Boeing would make concessions, such as paying into a victims fund, without having to plead guilty. This follows a previous agreement where Boeing was to plead guilty to conspiring to defraud the federal government, which has since been under renegotiation. The fraud charge stems from Boeing's alleged misleading of regulators about the flight-control system implicated in the two deadly crashes.</p>

The mansion, completed in 1859, had evolved into a place of reflection and education about its past, where over 150 people were enslaved. The fire led to a "total loss" of the structure, which had been a resort and event venue, though other structures on the grounds were preserved.

          <p>Eleven people in custody at a New Orleans jail, including Derrick Groves, convicted of four killings, escaped early Friday morning, prompting a large-scale search. This Guardian article reports that the inmates purportedly escaped at midnight, but facility guards did not notice until 8:30 a.m. A photo showed a window-sized hole in the wall of a cell with messages like "Fuck OPSO" and "Catch us when you can." Authorities are investigating, and the attorney general said her office would thoroughly review how the breakout occurred once everyone has been captured.</p>

          <p>US prosecutors are considering dropping a criminal charge against Boeing, linked to two crashes involving its bestselling 737 Max aircraft. This BBC article reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) officials said they were considering allowing the company to sign a non-prosecution agreement to settle the case, avoiding a trial over the criminal fraud charge. Lawyers representing families of the crash victims said they were "deeply disappointed" by the new plan. Erin Applebaum, representing 34 families of those killed in the Ethiopian crash, stated Boeing has never stood trial for the 346 lives lost and DOJ is letting the company walk away with no more than a financial penalty.</p>
