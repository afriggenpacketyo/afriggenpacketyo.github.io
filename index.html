          <p>Karen Kneller, the chief executive of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), has resigned from her position after facing significant criticism. Her departure follows the CCRC's admission of "failing" Andrew Malkinson, who was wrongly imprisoned for 17 years despite flawed evidence. The justice select committee had previously criticized the organization for its inability to learn from mistakes under her leadership. The new chair, Dame Vera Baird, acknowledged that confidence in the CCRC is badly damaged and must be restored to ensure faith in the justice system.</p>

          <p>A report has revealed that the fire at an electrical substation that caused a major shutdown at Heathrow Airport was due to a fault first detected in 2018. The investigation found that National Grid, the owner of the substation, was aware of elevated moisture levels but repeatedly deferred necessary maintenance. The power cut led to thousands of cancelled flights, stranded passengers, and cost airlines an estimated Â£80-Â£100 million. Energy regulator Ofgem has now launched an investigation into National Grid's failure to maintain its critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>This article explains the key differences between stablecoins and central bank digital currencies like China's digital yuan, highlighted by South Korea's recent pivot towards stablecoins. The digital yuan is a state-controlled currency intended for domestic retail payments and is not directly exchangeable for foreign currencies. In contrast, stablecoins are privately issued, blockchain-based tokens pegged to assets like the US dollar, with issuers holding reserves to back their value. This distinction in design, purpose, and management is central to the global debate on the future of digital money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The plan for the Athletics to build a new stadium on the Las Vegas Strip is facing significant financial and logistical hurdles, raising doubts about whether it will ever be built. Owner John Fisher is reportedly short on the necessary capital, with rising construction costs potentially pushing the price tag to $2 billion, well above initial estimates. Critics point out that Fisher has not secured the required private funding to unlock public subsidies. The team's temporary relocation to Sacramento has also been poorly received, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the franchise's future in Las Vegas.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat is exacting a significant but often overlooked toll on global health and economies, with developing nations like India being particularly vulnerable.

The economic drag extends globally, costing the US $100 billion annually and threatening growth targets worldwide. Beyond economics, heat contributes to thousands of excess deaths and strains healthcare systems, highlighting the urgent need for adaptive strategies like improved urban design and public health awareness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of barbecue, a staple of American summer holidays, has its origins with the Indigenous TaÃ­no people of the Caribbean. The term itself is derived from the TaÃ­no word "barabicu," which described the wooden frames they used to cook meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers encountered this method in the 15th century and adapted the word into "barbacoa." Over centuries, this cooking style transformed and diversified as it spread through the U.S., influenced by various immigrant cultures and local ingredients to create the distinct regional barbecue styles known today.</p>

          <p>A new version of President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill, passed by the Senate, includes enhanced incentives for the semiconductor industry. The legislation would increase the investment tax credit for chip manufacturers building plants in the U.S. from 25% to 35%. This move aims to further encourage companies like Intel and TSMC to expand advanced manufacturing within the United States, building on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The bill reflects Washington's ongoing strategy to onshore the semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia, using both tax incentives and the threat of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation in India over a sandal design showcased at Milan Men's Fashion Week. Critics noted the design was nearly identical to traditional Kolhapuri chappals, handcrafted footwear from western India dating back to the 12th century. In response to the outcry, a Prada executive acknowledged the inspiration from traditional Indian footwear and stated the design may not reach the market. To prevent future issues, the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce is now seeking to patent the Kolhapuri chappal design internationally.</p>

The report makes 100 recommendations for redress, including potential reparations and a significant overhaul of the education and health systems to address systemic injustices.

          <p>In a surprising start to NBA free agency, longtime Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner has agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will now be free to sign with any team. The decision was influenced by significant injuries on both teams, with Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton also expected to miss the upcoming season with an Achilles injury. Lillard will continue his rehabilitation while deciding on his next destination.</p>

          <p>Ryland Headley, 92, has been sentenced to life in prison for the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in 1967, a crime that remained unsolved for nearly six decades. The case was cracked after a DNA profile from the victim's skirt provided a "billion to one" match to Headley. Police have confirmed that due to his history, which includes prior convictions for sexually assaulting elderly women in the 1970s, he will now be investigated as a suspect in other unsolved homicide and sexual assault cases in Suffolk.</p>
