          <h2>Trump Administration Dismisses Scientists Working on Climate Report</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed nearly 400 scientists involved in writing the National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report summarizing climate change impacts in the United States. This move raises concerns within the scientific community about the report's future accuracy and comprehensiveness, as it relies on the expertise of numerous volunteer scientists. Critics argue that the administration's actions may lead to a report reflecting alternative viewpoints on climate change, potentially undermining the scientific consensus. Despite the concerns, the administration is legally obligated to produce the report by 2027, according to the Global Change Research Act of 1990.</p>

          <p>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, stated that artificial intelligence now writes approximately 30% of the company's code, and that the number is steadily increasing. Nadella discussed this at Meta's LlamaCon AI developer event, where Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested that AI could handle half of Meta's development within the next year. Other tech leaders, including Google's Sundar Pichai and Shopify's Tobi Lutke, have also acknowledged the growing role of AI in software development, with companies like OpenAI exploring AI-driven coding solutions. The trend suggests a significant shift in the software industry, where machines are increasingly assisting and replacing human software developers.</p>

The South Korean tech giant's revenue increased by 10% year-over-year, reaching 79.1 trillion Korean won, while operating profit rose by 1.5%. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and global growth slowdown, Samsung anticipates improved performance in the latter half of the year, assuming these uncertainties diminish.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to disburse $12 million in congressionally approved grant money to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), a news organization providing independent reporting in countries with limited press freedom. The judge criticized the administration's delay tactics and attempts to control the news organization's editorial decisions, which Congress had forbidden. RFE/RL, which reports in nearly 30 languages and reaches 47 million people weekly, was on the brink of collapse due to the withheld funding. The ruling follows a previous order to restore operations at Voice of America, another government-funded news outlet targeted by the administration.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, consisting of 78 articles, to protect and promote the non-state sector amid trade tensions with the US. The law, effective from May 20, aims to foster fair market competition, improve the investment environment, and encourage private firms' participation in scientific and technological innovation. Chinese leaders hope this law will boost morale and ensure growth, particularly as the economy relies more on domestic dynamism. The drafting of the law began in 2024, led by the National Development and Reform Commission, with a draft released for public feedback in October.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have identified $334 million in improper payment requests through a new automated payment system. These requests were flagged due to missing or invalid budget codes, or codes lacking authorization, as announced by DOGE on X. This discovery follows DOGE's earlier finding of a nearly untraceable budget line item responsible for $4.7 trillion in payments due to an optional Treasury Access Symbol (TAS) field, which has now been made mandatory. DOGE continues to focus on rooting out wasteful spending and downsizing the federal government, having already discovered $160 billion in savings.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying tariffs for carmakers, addressing concerns that the levies would negatively impact U.S. manufacturing by increasing production costs and reducing profits. The changes include removing tariffs on steel and aluminum for carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports, and providing tariff relief for a portion of imported components, phased out over two years. While automakers welcomed the relaxation, a 25% tariff on imported vehicles remains, and General Motors has abandoned its profit growth forecast due to the uncertainty created by the trade policies. The administration claims the changes will encourage domestic production, while critics argue the policies will still increase car prices.</p>

Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, is pushing for a settlement, sparking protests within the company, with Bill Owens, the executive producer of ’60 Minutes,’ resigning due to corporate pressure over coverage.</p>

Democrats in the state Assembly had initially watered down the bill, removing the felony charge for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds, leading to criticism about the party's priorities.

          <p>The UK government has made very little progress in preparing for the growing threats posed by rising temperatures, according to its climate watchdog, the Climate Change Committee (CCC). The CCC's report indicates that progress is either too slow, stalled, or heading in the wrong direction, leaving the UK vulnerable to serious economic and health impacts. The report highlights poor preparedness in areas such as health and flooding, and Baroness Brown, chair of the Adaptation Committee at the CCC, stated that the government does not seem to be taking the issue seriously. The government acknowledged that more work is needed and pointed to its investment in flood defenses.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has committed to reviewing its academic offerings and admissions policies following internal reports on antisemitism and anti-Arab prejudice. These reports were commissioned after last spring's pro-Palestinian protests, and Harvard is simultaneously battling the Trump administration over demands to limit campus activism. Harvard President Alan Garber said the university has made "necessary changes and essential progress" but promised further action to ensure the university is a place where ideas are welcomed and contested. The university will review admissions processes, faculty standards, and curriculum to promote intellectual openness and address concerns of bias.</p>

          <p>Rodney Scott, President Trump's nominee to lead Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is accused of orchestrating a "cover-up" related to the 2010 death of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, who died after being beaten and tased by CBP agents. James Wong, a former CBP official, alleges that Scott, then a top Border Patrol official, oversaw a critical incident team that sought to mitigate liability for Border Patrol management. Senator Ron Wyden has called Scott’s handling of the case “deeply troubling” and requested records related to the death and investigation. Scott's nomination is under consideration by the Senate finance committee.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, Canada's new prime minister, achieved a stunning political upset by running on an anti-Trump platform and promising to revive the economy. Now, he must deliver on these promises quickly, as Canada faces the fallout of a trade war with the United States and a period of political instability. Carney needs to form a cabinet, reconvene Parliament, and win parliamentary allies to ensure stability. His experience leading major institutions through upheaval, including the Bank of England through Brexit, was key in convincing many Canadians that he could handle the challenges Canada faces.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs his administration put into place earlier this month, as the car industry grapples with regulatory uncertainty and additional costs due to the levies. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies. Under the order, additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years.</p>
