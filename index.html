          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to begin on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the administration cited Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. as a primary justification for the new levy. This move escalates trade tensions, adding to existing tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos. The White House warned that any retaliatory measures from Ottawa would result in even higher duties, further straining the economic relationship between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tense confrontation occurred in Ventura County, California, as protesters clashed with U.S. Border Patrol agents conducting a raid on a marijuana facility. Federal authorities, who were serving a warrant, deployed tear gas and less-lethal rounds to disperse the crowd. The incident drew sharp criticism from Governor Gavin Newsom, while federal officials reported finding ten unaccompanied migrant juveniles at the site, prompting a child labor investigation. The FBI has also offered a reward for information about a protester who allegedly fired a weapon at law enforcement during the standoff.</p>

          <p>A coalition of allied nations has agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris for a future multinational force intended to stabilize Ukraine after a ceasefire. The decision was made during a meeting in Rome, which notably included a U.S. delegation for the first time, featuring special envoy Keith Kellogg and Senators Graham and Blumenthal. This "reassurance force" aims to provide logistical support, training, and security for Ukraine's skies and the Black Sea to deter future Russian aggression. While no U.S. ground troops are planned, the American presence was hailed as a fundamental sign of Western unity.</p>

          <p>Despite a slump in sales across much of Europe and backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, Tesla is experiencing remarkable success in Norway. The U.S. automaker saw a 54% year-on-year increase in new car sales in June, largely driven by the popularity of its revamped Model Y SUV. Analysts attribute this to the vehicle's competitive pricing and features that appeal to Norwegian consumers, such as large luggage space and all-wheel drive. While a recent survey indicates some Norwegians are hesitant to buy a Tesla for political reasons, the brand's market dominance in the country remains strong.</p>

The article notes that both Starmer and Macron are framing the political choice as one between their complex, steady governance and the "easy answers" offered by their populist rivals.

          <p>China is experiencing a boom in electric heavy truck sales, which are rapidly gaining market share and reducing the country's demand for diesel fuel. Driven by government subsidies and a fast-expanding charging network, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged 175% in the first half of the year. This trend, primarily for short-haul routes in industrial areas, is causing analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts and accelerate predictions for when China's overall oil consumption will peak. The shift is further supported by the lower long-term operating costs of electric trucks compared to their diesel counterparts.</p>

          <p>The White House is standing by its assessment that the "Operation Midnight Hammer" airstrikes "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities, despite a recent New York Times report suggesting some enriched uranium may have survived. The June 21 mission involved B-2 stealth bombers flying from Missouri to strike key nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan with bunker-busting bombs. Following the raid, President Trump declared Iran's nuclear program destroyed. Administration officials have continued to defend the operation's complete success, dismissing reports to the contrary as politically motivated "fake news" from media outlets and leakers with agendas.</p>

          <p>China announced the discovery of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. These discoveries, which include significant deposits of rubidium and gold, are part of a broader strategy to strengthen the nation's resource security. Investment in mineral exploration surged by over 50%, targeting critical elements like tin, tungsten, and copper, which are vital for the aerospace, semiconductor, and green energy sectors. The Ministry of Natural Resources stated it will continue to advance strategic prospecting to ensure a stable supply of essential resources.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of travelers from six Southeast Asian countries reveals that the United States is losing its appeal as a travel destination for many. Nearly 80% of respondents indicated declining interest, citing concerns over potential discrimination, gun violence, and actions by the Trump administration as more significant factors than cost. While travelers from Vietnam and the Philippines showed increased interest, potentially due to strong diaspora connections, a majority of Singaporeans reported being less interested in visiting the U.S. now than six months ago. The findings reflect a broader trend of shifting global perceptions of the U.S.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has indicated she will likely grant a temporary restraining order to stop the Trump administration's practice of conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests. The tentative ruling comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other groups, which argues that federal agents have been unlawfully targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause. The judge questioned the government's lack of specific evidence justifying the arrests and appeared poised to order a halt to the practice and ensure detainees have access to legal counsel. A final ruling is expected soon in the case.</p>

Zelenskyy highlighted the urgent need for more support, particularly interceptor drones, to counter Russia's escalating use of aerial weapons.

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked an executive order from President Trump that aimed to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The judge approved a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, allowing the legal challenge to proceed and temporarily halting the order's implementation. This decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that limited the scope of such injunctions but still allowed them through specific legal channels like class-action suits. The White House criticized the ruling as an unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court and vowed to fight it vigorously.</p>

After being held by ICE for over three months, Khalil filed a complaint alleging false arrest, malicious prosecution, and other wrongdoings. His legal team argues the arrest was retaliatory for his constitutionally protected speech. The administration, which is still seeking his deportation, maintains it acted within its legal authority, claiming Khalil was detained for purported support of Hamas and for posing a risk to U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Kenneth A. Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by a California board after spending 46 years in prison. Bianchi and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., terrorized Los Angeles in the 1970s, murdering at least 12 women. The parole board determined that Bianchi, now 74, will not be eligible for another hearing for 10 years. He is currently serving his sentences in a Washington state penitentiary but is entitled to California parole hearings due to a plea deal he made to testify against his cousin, who died in prison in 2002.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science has made an exceptionally rare discovery: a dinosaur fossil found deep beneath its own parking lot. The hockey-puck-shaped bone fragment was uncovered in a core sample drilled over 750 feet deep during a study for geothermal heating potential. Curators described the find as incredibly unlikely, likening it to a "hole in one from the moon." The vertebra is believed to belong to a small, plant-eating dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period, approximately 67.5 million years ago. The unique fossil is now on display at the museum for public viewing.</p>
