          <h2>Consumer Sentiment Declines Amid Inflation Concerns Following Tariff Announcements</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 10:19:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The University of Michigan survey indicates a drop in consumer sentiment to 50.8 in May, driven by increasing worries that tariffs will cause higher inflation. Year-ahead inflation expectations have risen to 7.3%, while long-term expectations are up to 4.6%. Tariffs were spontaneously mentioned by nearly three-quarters of consumers, indicating uncertainty over trade policy is dominating their economic thinking. The survey was primarily completed before the U.S. and China announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs, and the final consumer sentiment index for May will be closely watched to see if the pause improves sentiment.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has clarified that it is not sending GPU designs to China for modification to comply with export controls, following reports about a potential research and development center in Shanghai. The Financial Times reported that CEO Jensen Huang discussed the center with Shanghai's mayor last month. Since 2022, AI chipmakers like Nvidia have faced restrictions on exporting advanced chips to China due to U.S. military concerns. Huang previously expressed that being shut out of the Chinese market would be a "tremendous loss" for the company.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination in a since-deleted social media post featuring the numbers "8647." Trump stated that Comey knew exactly what the numbers meant, interpreting them as a call for assassination.

          <p>Cassie Ventura returned to the witness stand for her fourth day in the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, continuing her cross-examination. Ventura testified about an alleged violent encounter with Combs at the InterContinental Hotel in 2016. She claimed that Combs became violent prior to the premiere of her movie "The Perfect Match," and that he was intoxicated during the encounter. The defense argues that Combs became violent because of his drug use and not as a means to strong-arm Ventura into sex. Prosecutors have accused the defense of dragging out the cross-examination on purpose.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia has elicited varied responses from Saudi citizens, with some expressing admiration for his "straight shooter" persona and policies, while others remain unimpressed. Many Saudis appreciate Trump's conservative rhetoric and his approach to Middle East policy, including the removal of sanctions on Syria. However, critics like Abdullah Alaoudh condemn Trump for allegedly whitewashing the reputation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Despite differing opinions, Trump's visit has sparked conversations about Saudi Arabia's evolving relationship with the United States and the broader implications for the region.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers have gone on strike, halting train service and disrupting the commutes of over 300,000 daily riders. The strike stems from a dispute over pay raises, with the union stating that workers haven't received a raise in five years. NJ Transit suggests commuters work from home if possible, and Governor Phil Murphy says all options are on the table, even a state of emergency. The agency has implemented a contingency plan with additional bus service, but it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders. The strike has also caused NJ Transit to cancel rail service for a Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are working to get their mega-bill encompassing Trump's legislative agenda back on track after hard-liners signaled they would derail it over concerns about the national debt. Republican Reps. Ralph Norman, Chip Roy and Andrew Clyde are expected to vote against the tax and budget measure. They are also working to strike a consensus on the SALT caps, as moderates oppose the proposed $30,000 cap on those deductions. The vote is yet another test of Speaker Mike Johnson's speakership as he works to placate the hard-liners and unify the factions of his conference.</p>

Kerger argues that PBS provides essential services, such as the backup infrastructure for the emergency alert system, and that it serves as an incubator for new programming and ideas.

Environment Secretary Steve Reed said new measures would stop water companies dumping sewage into rivers while pocketing millions of pounds of bonuses. Ofwat, the regulator, has been able to stop firms using customer money to fund bonuses, but the new rules mean they could not use funds from shareholders or lenders either. Thames Water, which recently agreed a Â£3bn rescue loan, said it was not paying performance-related bonuses but instead "retention payments", which were not covered by the new rules.</p>

The U.S. PIRG Education Fund attributes this to passengers being "ticked off" and recognizing that voicing concerns gets results. Common complaints include cancellations, delays, lost baggage, and refund issues. While airlines are now required to provide automatic refunds for canceled or significantly delayed flights, many passengers still face challenges in obtaining compensation. Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints, while Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaiian Airlines performed best in overall customer satisfaction.</p>
