          <p>Communities across the United States are celebrating Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery.

Celebrations include parades, art shows, educational workshops, and community gatherings. Juneteenth became a U.S. holiday in 2021, and public festivities have grown significantly since then, honoring the origins, evolution, and significance of the holiday.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, officially recognized as a federal holiday in 2021, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. The name combines "June" and "nineteenth," marking the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. While the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, it wasn't until Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, that the news reached the westernmost Confederate state. Celebrations vary across the U.S. and include parades, parties, concerts, and educational events, with many viewing the holiday as a joyful anniversary of independence.</p>

          <p>Savings experts weigh in on whether high-yield savings accounts are worth it in today's economy, noting they offer an opportunity to earn more interest than traditional savings accounts. Despite recent interest rate drops, high-yield savings accounts still provide competitive returns, especially for short-term financial goals and emergency funds. However, they are not a substitute for long-term investing, and consumers should consider alternatives like CDs. Experts recommend comparing rates and understanding the terms before opening an account, viewing it as part of an overall financial strategy rather than the entirety of it (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>More individuals filing for bankruptcy are carrying retail credit card debt, exacerbated by record-high interest rates. Store credit cards typically have higher interest rates due to the perceived risk of cardholders with lower credit scores. Despite banks raising rates in anticipation of capped late fees, these rates remain high even after the fee caps were blocked. This situation makes it harder for consumers to pay off debt, leading to a rise in bankruptcies involving retail credit card debt.

          <p>Retirement experts highlight annuity mistakes seniors should avoid, including not understanding fees, choosing the wrong type of annuity, not designating a beneficiary, and withdrawing excessive funds. Annuities offer steady retirement income and protection against outliving savings, but can be complex. Experts recommend carefully reviewing contracts, understanding fees and penalties, and ensuring the annuity aligns with long-term financial goals. Seniors should consider their income needs, risk tolerance, and death benefit preferences before investing, seeking guidance from a qualified financial planner (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping urged a cease-fire amid Iran-Israel tensions during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, emphasizing it as an "urgent priority." Xi stated that the international community should work to de-escalate the situation and resolve disputes through negotiation rather than force, protecting civilians. He also suggested that major powers should strive to cool down the situation. Putin expressed Moscow's readiness to mediate a possible settlement, reflecting the international community's concern over the escalating conflict.</p>

          <p>The article reflects on the hollowness of Juneteenth as a federal holiday, given the current racial climate in the U.S. The author argues that the holiday, meant to celebrate emancipation, is undermined by recent rollbacks in racial progress, including the elimination of DEI initiatives and threats to civil rights protections. The election of Donald Trump to a second term is seen as a signal of national retreat from racial egalitarianism. The author suggests that Juneteenth's transformation into a national holiday amidst these regressions creates an instance of hypocrisy, marking a day off rather than genuine progress.</p>
