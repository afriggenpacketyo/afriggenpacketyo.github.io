          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has canceled $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine projects, including those from Pfizer and Moderna targeting viruses like influenza. Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, cited concerns that the technology's risks outweigh its benefits for respiratory viruses and claimed the funds would be redirected to "safer, broader vaccine platforms." This decision has drawn sharp criticism from health experts, who argue it undermines preparedness for future pandemics and ignores the proven safety and effectiveness of mRNA technology, which was crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals in California for orchestrating an illegal scheme to ship millions of dollars' worth of advanced AI chips, including Nvidia's controlled H100 GPUs, to China. The individuals allegedly used their company, ALX Solutions, to export the sensitive technology without the required licenses, circumventing U.S. export controls designed to limit China's access to high-end semiconductors. Investigators uncovered communications detailing plans to route shipments through Malaysia to conceal their final destination. This case highlights ongoing U.S. efforts to prevent the illicit transfer of critical technology.</p>

Survivors shared harrowing memories of the 1945 attack, which killed over 200,000 people, and called for the abolition of nuclear arms, connecting their past suffering to current global conflicts.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science reveals that the Great Barrier Reef has suffered its largest-ever annual decline in coral cover, driven by the most widespread and severe bleaching event recorded. The survey, conducted between August 2024 and May 2025, found that heat stress from climate change is the primary cause, overwhelming the reef's ability to recover between catastrophic events. While efforts to cull coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish have shown some local success, experts warn the iconic ecosystem faces a volatile future and may be approaching a critical tipping point.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are formally opposing the Department of Justice's move to unseal grand jury testimony related to her case, arguing it would violate her due process rights while her conviction appeal is pending before the Supreme Court. In a court filing, her lawyers stated that Maxwell, unlike the deceased Jeffrey Epstein, is alive and her legal options remain viable, making the release of untested, secret testimony prejudicial. The filing also notes that Maxwell has not been allowed to review the materials herself, while prosecutors contend much of the information was already made public during trial.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists regarding whether to include specific, measurable consumption targets in the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan. Proponents, such as Chang Xiuze from the Academy of Macroeconomic Research, argue for establishing a "household consumption rate" as a key national indicator to boost domestic demand, noting China's rate was a low 39.6% in 2023. However, other influential thinkers express skepticism, questioning the operational feasibility of setting such metrics as official policy goals, highlighting a key point of contention in shaping China's future economic strategy.

          <p>After more than 50 years, police have identified a young boy found murdered in Virginia in 1972 as four-year-old Carl Matthew Bryant from Pennsylvania. The breakthrough came from advanced DNA testing on a hair sample, which allowed investigators to trace his family to Philadelphia and confirm his identity by exhuming his mother's remains. Despite this progress, what happened to Carl and his infant brother, James, who also disappeared and whose body was never found, remains a mystery.

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, the rookie quarterback and son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, is slated to start for the Cleveland Browns in their first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. Despite being listed as the fourth-string quarterback on the initial depth chart, injuries to other quarterbacks on the roster have created an opportunity for him. Sanders, who was drafted in the fifth round after a prolific college career, will have a chance to prove himself in a game setting. The team recently signed another quarterback, Tyler Huntley, who may split playing time with Sanders.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the 2023 Titan submersible implosion has concluded that the tragedy, which killed five people, was preventable and resulted from the company's negligence and a "toxic" safety culture. The 300-page report found that OceanGate and its CEO, Stockton Rush, used "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory oversight and ignored repeated warnings about the vessel's flawed design, which used cheaper carbon fiber instead of steel. Investigators stated that Rush, who died in the implosion, would likely have faced criminal charges for negligence had he survived the catastrophic incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public health officials in Southern California are reporting an increase in cases of flea-borne typhus, a disease spread to humans through the feces of infected fleas. Los Angeles and Orange counties, particularly the city of Long Beach, have seen a spike in cases this year, which typically peak in late summer and fall. The disease is carried by fleas that live on animals like rats, opossums, and stray cats, and symptoms include fever, headache, and a rash. Officials are advising residents to use flea control on pets, secure trash, and avoid contact with stray animals to prevent infection.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has decided not to pursue the death penalty against three high-profile accused Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero is accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of a DEA agent, while Zambada is charged with running a major faction of the Sinaloa cartel. The decision is notable given the Trump administration's support for capital punishment for drug traffickers. Mexico, which has abolished capital punishment, typically requires assurances that its extradited citizens will not face execution, a factor that may have influenced the decision.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of data from the Ukrainian Air Force reveals that Russia has more than doubled its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine since January 2025. Despite President Trump's calls for a ceasefire, the frequency of aerial bombardments has reached the highest levels of the war, peaking in early July. This escalation coincides with reports of Russia significantly increasing its domestic production of missiles and drones. The analysis highlights the intensification of the conflict, even as the U.S. administration has pursued diplomatic talks and twice temporarily paused military aid to Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research based on 20 years of data from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park shows that female mountain gorillas intentionally seek out familiar females when they move to a new social group. Scientists found that even after years of separation, a dispersing female will gravitate toward others she grew up with or had a recent social connection with. This behavior highlights the crucial importance of female-female relationships in gorilla society, as having an ally helps a newcomer navigate the social hierarchy and potential aggression from resident females. The findings provide new insight into the evolutionary roots of social decision-making.</p>

          <p>Despite significant advances in technology that have made short-term forecasts over 90% accurate, public perception of weather forecasting often remains skeptical. Meteorologists face the challenge of communicating vast amounts of complex data, which is subject to "Chaos Theory," where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. The future of forecasting lies in AI, which can process historical data to predict weather further in advance, and in providing more impact-based predictions. However, experts note that communicating uncertainty and predicting unprecedented climate events will remain key challenges for human forecasters.</p>
