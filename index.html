        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has imposed sanctions on former Philippine senator Francis Tolentino, a key architect of Manila's legal claims in the South China Sea. Beijing accused Tolentino of "egregious conduct" and has barred him from entering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. The sanctions are a response to his role in authoring the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, which asserts the country's claims in the disputed waters and has been strongly opposed by Beijing. Tolentino also led a Senate investigation into alleged Chinese espionage activities within the Philippines, further straining diplomatic relations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 22:42:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded in June, contrasting with official data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, driven primarily by a rebound in export orders as businesses may be front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariff hikes. This divergence is explained by the different sample sizes and focus areas of the two surveys, with the Caixin survey covering smaller, export-oriented firms. While the data suggests some resilience, economists note that momentum could soften as front-loading tapers off. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant housing bills aimed at accelerating construction by reducing environmental review standards. The legislation, which faced opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions, exempts most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Newsom compelled the passage of one key bill by tying it to the state budget, a move seen as a demonstration of his political strength. Experts believe these reforms to CEQA could be the most substantial in its 55-year history, potentially unblocking numerous housing projects stalled by regulations.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has agreed to rescind a planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies after facing pressure from President Donald Trump. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Carney "caved" to Trump, who had threatened to raise tariffs and had called off trade talks over the issue. The proposed 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, generating an estimated C$5.9 billion over five years. Canadian officials confirmed the tax was dropped as part of a broader negotiation, and trade talks between the two countries have since resumed.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some California National Guard troops from their controversial deployment in Los Angeles to assist with wildfire preparations. The request involves moving 200 of the 4,000 troops, who were deployed by the Trump administration to handle protests, to help as the state anticipates an early and active fire season. This deployment has been a point of contention between President Trump and Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued it was illegal and depleted firefighting resources. The potential shift in duties comes as state officials warned the Guard's firefighting force was at reduced capacity.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has delayed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man charged with human smuggling, after his lawyers raised concerns about his potential deportation. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year despite having a legal status protecting him, and was later returned to the U.S. to face the charges. Although a judge had initially granted him pretrial release, his lawyers requested a delay, citing conflicting statements from the Trump administration about whether he would be deported again.

The child, Kennedy Beaver, has Noonan syndrome and relies on the state's Community Alternatives Program for Children (CAP/C) to cover over $4,000 a month in medical costs. State officials warn that federal funding reductions could put programs like CAP/C at risk, potentially affecting up to 600,000 people in North Carolina.

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify Compound Produced During Exercise That Slows Aging</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 21:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a key messenger that prevents inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding helps explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The study suggests that it may be possible to develop anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise by targeting this pathway.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident in the Los Angeles River resulted in the death of one adult and a dog after a group of four people and the animal fell into the water. The event occurred near Anaheim Street in Long Beach, where three individuals, including a 4-year-old child, were rescued by the fire department. One adult and the child were transported to a trauma center for treatment. It remains unclear what caused the group to fall into the river, but officials noted they were found near a low head dam, a structure known to create dangerous rotational currents.</p>

LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, averaged 6.9 points and shot 42.3% from three-point range last season with Memphis and Sacramento, and is expected to help fill the void left by Finney-Smith's departure.</p>

This decline has led to recent outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.

          <p>The U.S. renewable energy industry is facing a potential tax increase of up to $7 billion under the latest version of President Trump's domestic spending bill. The Senate GOP draft includes a new tax on wind and solar projects that source components from China and also abruptly phases out key tax credits for projects entering service after 2027. Trade groups warn these measures could jeopardize hundreds of thousands of construction jobs and threaten about $450 billion worth of infrastructure investment. The proposed changes have been called punitive and could significantly alter the economics of clean energy development in the country. (not investment advice)</p>
