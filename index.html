          <p>Progressive groups are planning over 1,500 'No Kings Day' events across the United States to protest the Trump administration and counter a military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the U.S. Army's 250th birthday. Indivisible and other organizing groups initiated the protests in early May, but interest surged following President Trump's response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles. Organizers emphasize nonviolent assembly and de-escalation tactics. They aim to highlight that power in a democracy flows from the people, not a single leader, and the protests will occur in various locations to avoid confrontations in D.C.</p>

          <p>Following days of demonstrations in Los Angeles against federal immigration raids, protests have expanded to multiple cities across the United States, including Boston, Houston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. The unrest was triggered by the arrest of unauthorized immigrants in areas with significant Latino populations, prompting President Trump to deploy troops to Los Angeles. Various cities have experienced different levels of engagement, ranging from peaceful demonstrations to violent clashes with law enforcement. Mayors and governors are responding with varying degrees of support for the protesters and condemnation of violence.</p>

          <p>An appellate court has ruled that the wide-reaching tariffs imposed by President Trump can remain in place until at least the end of July, granting the administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked the tariffs pending appeal. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously ruled that many of Trump's tariffs are illegal, including tariffs on U.S. trading partners and on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. The appellate court will hear oral arguments on the case on July 31. The tariffs were justified using a 1977 law allowing the president to regulate imports during emergency situations.

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a strong rebound in 2025, with registrations climbing by 20% from January to April compared to the previous year. The recovery is attributed to corporate sales driven by EU emissions mandates and attractive leasing deals. However, consumer skepticism, charging infrastructure gaps, and competition from Chinese brands remain challenges. Tesla's sales have declined, while Chinese automakers like BYD are gaining market share. The rollback of emissions targets could slow the EV transition.</p>

          <p>Two years after the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, the landscape in southern Ukraine is returning to its natural state, with lush vegetation and diverse wildlife flourishing in the former reservoir basin. The Dnipro River has reformed vast floodplains, resembling the area before the dam's construction in the 1950s. Ecologists have identified numerous species of birds, mammals, and insects, as well as ancient bones and pottery fragments. However, the future of this ecosystem is uncertain as Ukraine considers rebuilding the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, which could destroy the newly formed landscape.</p>

Alabama's FORTIFIED Roof standard has led to over 50,000 roofs being strengthened, with homeowners qualifying for discounts of 20% to 35% off the wind portion of their insurance. California also offers discounts, but they are generally lower than those in the Gulf States. The article emphasizes the importance of retrofitting homes to withstand extreme weather and for insurance companies to account for these improvements.</p>

          <h2>Seattle Balances Tree Preservation and Housing Density</h2>

          <p>Seattle is grappling with balancing the need for more housing and preserving trees that mitigate the impacts of climate change. A new state law mandates increased housing density, but not more trees, creating a tension between development and tree preservation. One solution is building density with trees, as seen in the Bryant Heights development, which saved over 30 trees while adding 86 housing units. Seattle has also updated its tree protection ordinance to keep trees on private property from being cut down during development. The city aims to reach 30% canopy coverage by 2037.</p>
