          <p>A former Meta employee, Attaullah Baig, has filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging "systemic cybersecurity failures" within WhatsApp, which he claims compromised user privacy. Baig, WhatsApp's former head of security, asserts that Meta retaliated against him after he notified company leaders, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, about these issues. His suit, filed in California, details how about 1,500 WhatsApp engineers allegedly had unrestricted access to user data without audit trails. Meta has publicly disputed Baig's claims, stating he was dismissed for poor performance and that his allegations are distorted. The article highlights the ongoing legal battle and the serious implications for user data security and corporate accountability.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, a contest has begun to elect the next deputy leader of the Labour Party, a position directly chosen by party members. The tight timetable requires candidates to secure backing from at least 80 MPs and either 5% of local parties or three affiliated groups by the end of the week, with a winner announced on October 25. This vacancy coincides with a government reshuffle perceived by some as a shift to the Right, leading to jitters among Labour's Left wing. The party leadership aims for a swift, quiet contest, fearing public infighting could damage its image.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy orchestrated a stunning fourth-quarter comeback in his first NFL start, leading his team to a 27-24 victory over the Chicago Bears. After a challenging first three quarters, McCarthy ignited the offense, scoring 21 points in the final period, including a touchdown pass to Justin Jefferson and a decisive 14-yard rushing touchdown. This win marks a significant debut for the young quarterback, who missed the previous season due to injury, and provides an optimistic start for the Vikings' 2025 NFL campaign.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court is set to deliver its verdict on the prison term of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who recently returned to Bangkok from Dubai. Thaksin, who was in exile for 15 years, had his initial eight-year sentence commuted to one year by the king, but public outrage arose after he spent most of it in hospital detention. The court will determine if his sentence was served properly, amid tight security and gatherings of his supporters. This ruling comes as his political dynasty faces challenges, including his daughter's recent removal from the prime minister post.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson stated the city received no prior notice regarding the Department of Homeland Security's "Operation Midway Blitz," a ramped-up immigration enforcement effort in Chicago. DHS announced the operation targets "criminal illegal aliens," linking it to the death of Katie Abraham, who was killed by an undocumented driver. Mayor Johnson criticized the operation as "militarized immigration enforcement without due process," citing ICE's history of human rights abuses. This action comes amidst federal-local tensions over immigration policy, with Illinois Governor Pritzker also accusing the Trump administration of politicizing public safety.</p>

The long delivery windows of aircraft also allow for significant orders without immediate financial strain.

Many mothers, like Mackenzie Bruegge, find that childcare expenses negate their earnings, forcing them to choose between work and family.

          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts recommend investors focus on three key stock market areas for potential growth through the end of 2025 amidst market uncertainties. They suggest considering alternative asset management stocks, which they believe are undervalued and poised to benefit from capital market activity and deregulation. Companies with high floating-rate debt are also highlighted, as anticipated interest rate cuts could alleviate balance sheet pressures and improve profitability. Lastly, Goldman is bullish on gold mining stocks, projecting a 14% rise in gold prices through 2026 due to strong central bank and ETF demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older has significantly increased by 46% between 2021 and 2023, driven by its legalization in many states and a diminishing stigma. Seniors like Gayle Crawley and Don Searles use it for medicinal issues such as chronic pain and PTSD, finding it a "good solution." However, medical professionals like UC San Francisco professor Matt Springer warn of potential health risks, particularly for the cardiovascular system, regardless of ingestion method. Research indicates a link between cannabis use and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke, fueling an ongoing debate about its safety for older adults.</p>

Muncy, who was hitting .258 with 17 homers and 64 RBIs before his injury, aims to contribute without overdoing it.

This initiative addresses the challenge of long shipping times to Dalian, which previously threatened fruit freshness.

This incident follows previous Israeli interceptions of aid ships, as Israel maintains a naval blockade on Gaza since 2007 to prevent weapons reaching Hamas.

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Assembly Bill 519, which bans online pet dealer websites and brokers from selling dogs to consumers, aiming to curb the influx from out-of-state puppy mills. This bill, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature, closes a loophole in a 2019 law that banned pet store sales of commercially bred dogs. The legislation also voids contracts with non-refundable deposits and requires full disclosure of breeder and medical information. Supported by the Attorney General and animal welfare groups, this measure seeks to protect consumers from deceptive practices and prevent the sale of sick or poorly bred pets.</p>

          <p>This year's updated Covid-19 vaccines have received FDA approval for adults 65 and older and younger individuals with specific high-risk medical conditions. While federal officials state all adults can get vaccinated after consulting a doctor, the narrower approval may limit access for some previously eligible individuals. The list of high-risk conditions is extensive, covering an estimated 100-200 million Americans. However, state-level pharmacy regulations and the absence of CDC recommendations for pregnant women and children create varying access challenges.

Nuno, who guided Forest to their highest Premier League finish since 1995 and secured European qualification, had recently expressed fears for his job. Internal tensions reportedly stemmed from disagreements over transfer business and the club's recruitment strategy. Despite his on-field success, the breakdown in communication and a perceived lack of unity at the club ultimately led to his dismissal, with a replacement, potentially Ange Postecoglou, expected imminently.</p>

Roger Wright of Biffa, a leading waste firm, states they are seeing more vapes and related fires than ever, despite the ban. Vape firms have introduced cheap reusable models that are often treated as disposables, further complicating disposal. The industry argues that increased improper disposal is due to black market trade. Vapes, containing lithium batteries, pose fire hazards when crushed, costing the UK waste industry an estimated billion pounds annually.</p>
