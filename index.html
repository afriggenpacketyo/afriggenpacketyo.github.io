          <p>SpaceX's attempt to gain greater control over a highway and public beach access near its Starbase launch facility in Boca Chica, Texas, has been rejected by Texas lawmakers. The decision comes as residents vote on incorporating Starbase as a city. SpaceX has faced legal complaints and protests due to frequent road and beach closures for test flights, impacting local residents and endangered species habitats. The company was previously fined by the EPA for water pollution and CEO Elon Musk has faced criticism for his handling of environmental concerns, including gutting the EPA and FAA under Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has temporarily suspended Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan after she was arrested by the FBI. Dugan faces federal criminal charges for allegedly obstructing a proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent arrest. The court order emphasizes the need to uphold public confidence in the judiciary during the criminal proceedings. The charges stem from Dugan's alleged actions to help an undocumented immigrant evade law enforcement, leading to her suspension from official duties while the case is pending.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have won the Canadian federal election but may need to form a minority government, potentially requiring deals with other parties to pass legislation. Carney's priorities include navigating relations with the US under President Donald Trump, focusing on securing Canada's economy amid tariff pressures, and introducing tax cuts for lower and middle-class Canadians. The new government will also need to prepare for the upcoming G7 summit hosted in Alberta, where trade and economic policies will likely be key discussion points. The Conservative Party is expected to form the Official Opposition.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan family seeking asylum in the United States has been separated, with the mother deported to Venezuela, the father sent to a prison in El Salvador, and their two-year-old daughter remaining in foster care in the U.S. The Trump administration alleges the parents are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, but has not provided substantial evidence. The family's relatives claim the authorities deemed their tattoos suspicious, leading to the family's detention and the child's placement in foster care. Critics argue that the administration's actions echo the controversial family separation policies of Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>Approximately 300,000 homes are at risk of losing heating or hot water when old Radio Teleswitching System (RTS) electricity meters are switched off on June 30. Energy companies face challenges in replacing all RTS meters with smart meters before the deadline. Distrust of smart meters and logistical issues, especially in rural areas, complicate the replacement program. If a smart meter cannot be fitted, energy suppliers are required to install a suitable meter without disrupting service, according to energy regulator Ofgem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying auto tariffs, removing some levies that carmakers argued would harm U.S. manufacturing. The changes exempt carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports from additional levies on steel, aluminum, and certain imports from Canada and Mexico. Automakers can also qualify for tariff relief on a portion of imported components, which will be phased out over two years. Despite these concessions, the new administration's policies will still increase car prices and create uncertainty for automakers and suppliers, analysts predict.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old doctor from Bristol, Ellie Irwin, had her eyesight saved by a metagenomics test after suffering from a persistent eye inflammation for five years. Standard tests failed to identify the cause, but metagenomics identified a rare bacterial infection of leptospirosis, which she contracted while swimming in the Amazon River in 2018. Antibiotics were then used to treat the infection. The metagenomics technology uses genomic sequencing to identify all bacteria, fungi, or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens, offering a significant advancement over traditional diagnostic methods.</p>

He dismissed concerns about higher costs and stock market volatility, stating that great times are ahead and that the Chinese were ripping off the United States. Economists, however, largely disagree, suggesting that American consumers will likely pay higher prices due to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Measles cases in Texas have risen to 663, contributing to one of the worst outbreaks in the U.S. since the disease was declared eradicated. Gaines County is the epicenter, with a high number of cases and hospitalizations. The outbreak is fueled by declining vaccination rates and misinformation, causing concern among health officials. Other states, including New Mexico, also report active outbreaks, highlighting the need for increased vaccination efforts to prevent the disease's spread.</p>

Phthalates, present in food packaging, shampoos, and toys, are endocrine disruptors that can interfere with hormones and have been associated with metabolic risk factors like obesity and Type 2 diabetes, which can cause cardiovascular disease. Experts caution that the study relies on statistical modeling and assumptions, calling for more research to fully understand the relationship between phthalates and heart health.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has softened some automotive tariffs, aiming to reduce the overall tariff burden on vehicle imports. While the 25% tariffs on imported vehicles remain, the new measures prevent tariffs from stacking on top of one another. Automakers assembling vehicles in the U.S. can qualify for partial reimbursements on parts-related levies for two years. Trump stated the changes were intended to help automakers during the transition, though uncertainty remains about the implementation and overall impact.</p>
