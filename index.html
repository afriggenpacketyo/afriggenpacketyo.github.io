            <p>Airlines are shifting their focus towards wealthier leisure travelers to maintain revenue as economic concerns and weaker demand impact bookings, particularly in domestic coach travel. Delta and Frontier have adjusted their growth plans, reducing capacity on off-peak domestic routes, while remaining optimistic about international routes and premium seating. The airline industry is betting that affluent travelers will continue to prioritize comfort and luxury despite global market turmoil. United Airlines is also investing heavily in high-end refurbishments and destinations to cater to this demographic. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Netflix miniseries 'Adolescence' explores the potential dangers of unchecked phone and social media use on teenagers, raising concerns for parents about monitoring their children's online activities. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist, argues for delaying smartphone access until high school and social media until age 16 to mitigate cyberbullying and addiction. He emphasizes that constant online access, facilitated by smartphones, intensifies bullying and drama, impacting mental health and learning. Haidt suggests that schools should implement truly phone-free policies to create a healthier environment for students.</p>

Trump proposed this during a meeting with El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, who has been accepting deported individuals from the US. Legal experts argue that there is no provision under US law that allows the government to deport its own citizens, deeming the proposal illegal and unconstitutional.

            <p>Monoclonal antibodies, initially developed for asthma, show promise as a potential universal allergy cure by targeting the underlying pathways of allergic reactions. Omalizumab (Xolair) has proven effective in treating seasonal allergies in preliminary trials, and research is underway to expand its use to food and insect allergies. Unlike antihistamines, monoclonal antibodies can prevent allergic reactions at the source, providing months of relief with a single injection. Clinical trials are ongoing, and the FDA recently approved a generic version of omalizumab, potentially making this treatment more accessible.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to terminate a Biden-era program that granted legal status to migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti. The ruling prevents the shutdown of the program, which has allowed over 500,000 people to legally enter and work in the US. The Trump administration had argued the plan exacerbated immigration issues, granting protections to a large population without a clear path to durable status. This is the latest legal setback for the Trump team amid efforts to roll back other immigration protections.</p>

King, a self-described nervous flyer, prepared for the flight by learning meditation techniques and undergoing astronaut training. The crew went through the entire mission and after the first day of practice, King felt more prepared, saying, "I'm hoping that it will be second nature to me by Monday." The total time of the spaceflight from liftoff to landing was approximately 10 minutes and 21 seconds.</p>

The bear, an adult female with a yearling cub, charged at close range, leaving the man uninjured. Wildlife officials stated that no action would be taken regarding the cub. Grizzly bear populations are becoming more dense and widespread in the state, increasing the chances of human-grizzly interactions. Officials advise taking precautions such as traveling in groups and carrying bear spray to avoid conflicts.</p>

            <p>Two Belgian teenagers were charged in Kenya with wildlife piracy after being found with thousands of ants packed in test tubes. This case highlights a shift in trafficking trends, from larger species to lesser-known but ecologically critical species. The Kenya Wildlife Service stated that the four men were involved in trafficking the ants to markets in Europe and Asia, and that the species included messor cephalotes, a distinctive, large and red-colored harvester ant native to East Africa. The illegal export of the ants undermines Kenya’s sovereign rights over its biodiversity.</p>

The council's director of city operations stated that collections would focus first on "the poorest parts" of the city "affected the most" by the ongoing bin strike. Striking workers held a rally on Tuesday morning, a day after Unite union members rejected the city council's latest pay offer. More negotiations between the two sides are expected to take place on Wednesday.</p>

It also points to a shift in social climate, where civil rights violations don’t inspire the same amount of outrage as they once did.

            <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) has reduced its forecast for global oil demand growth due to the "substantial risks" posed by President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. The agency cited concerns that the measures could stoke inflation, slow economic growth, and intensify trade disputes. Falling oil market prices triggered by Trump’s trade tariffs were likely to upend his own election promise to expand the country’s oil and gas industry by urging producers to “drill, baby, drill”.</p>
