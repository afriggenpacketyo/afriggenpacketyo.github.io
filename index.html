          <p>Japan celebrated a poignant return to global sporting events by securing its first medal at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, with Hayato Katsuki earning a bronze in the 35km race walk. Athletes battled grueling conditions, as temperatures reached 30C with over 90% humidity, causing several competitors, including another Japanese athlete, to collapse after finishing. This championship provides a crucial opportunity for Japan to engage with the public, contrasting with the spectator-less 2020 Olympics. Organizers have proactively adjusted race start times for events like marathons due to an anticipated heatwave, prioritizing athlete safety. The strong local support and sold-out sessions underscore the nation's enthusiasm for the competition.</p>

          <p>Line dancing is experiencing a dramatic resurgence, evolving from a niche activity associated with older generations to a popular social media trend. Influenced by the return of country-pop to mainstream charts and viral TikTok dances, the activity now attracts a diverse demographic, including many teenagers and young adults. Instructors note a significant shift in perceptions, with routines expanding beyond traditional country music to include various genres. This renewed popularity is also driven by its appeal as a low-impact exercise and a vibrant community builder, offering an accessible way to make friends and stay active.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Solnit's article argues that the sexual exploitation of underage girls, exemplified by Jeffrey Epstein's activities, was alarmingly normalized in mainstream and counterculture before feminism. She cites numerous examples from the 1970s and 80s, including films, rock star 'groupie' culture, and legal leniency towards perpetrators, to illustrate a societal acceptance of such abuses. Solnit contends that the feminist movement was crucial in exposing, denormalizing, and challenging these pervasive patriarchal attitudes, establishing consent as active and conscious, and recognizing the vast power differential between adults and children. The Epstein birthday album is presented as a late relic of this deeply misogynistic era.</p>

          <p>Pre-order sales for Apple’s new iPhone 17 series have shattered previous records in China, demonstrating robust demand despite reported delays for the iPhone Air model. On JD.com, one of China's largest online retailers, first-minute sales surpassed the entire first-day volume of last year’s iPhone 16 series, with the standard 256GB iPhone 17 being the most popular. Overwhelming demand led to difficulties accessing Apple's website and rapid booking of in-store pickup slots in major cities. Customers in some regions now face waiting periods extending to mid-October, highlighting the immense consumer interest in the new devices.</p>

          <p>Bavaria's state minister, Hubert Aiwanger, affirmed the German state's openness to Chinese investment, despite ongoing economic tensions between the European Union and China.

His comments reflect a distinct stance from some EU-level concerns regarding China's economic influence. This position highlights Bavaria's historical and ongoing economic ties with China, which date back decades, and its desire to maintain a welcoming environment for Chinese companies.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are aggressively expanding into the European market, showcasing their latest models and technologies at Germany's IAA Mobility conference. Companies like Xpeng and GAC are setting ambitious sales targets and planning to introduce more affordable EVs, aiming to capitalize on what they perceive as a lag in EV development by traditional European automakers. Despite facing potential EU tariffs, Chinese brands are differentiating themselves with advanced tech features and competitive pricing. European legacy brands are responding with new EV releases and tech, but analysts suggest they need to accelerate their innovation and production scale to keep pace with the rapidly advancing Chinese competition.</p>

The disease, spread by the 'kissing bug' through its feces, can lead to serious chronic complications like heart failure or organ enlargement years after initial infection.

However, the Dodgers' offense struggled to provide support against Giants pitcher Justin Verlander and subsequent relievers, managing only one run on a solo home run. This loss marked a return to their lackluster second-half form, raising concerns about their hitting as the playoffs approach, even as the Giants continued their surprising surge into the playoff picture.</p>

          <h2>Starmer Defended Mandelson Despite Officials' Awareness of Epstein Emails</h2>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer initially defended Lord Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US, despite it emerging that officials at No 10 and the Foreign Office were aware of supportive emails between Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein. The BBC understands that a media inquiry detailing the messages was sent to the Foreign Office, which was then passed to No 10. Mandelson was later sacked after the full emails, which expressed support for Epstein during his legal troubles, were published, revealing a 'materially different' depth of relationship than previously known. Starmer now faces growing pressure over his handling of the appointment and the vetting process.</p>

          <p>Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a leader of the Belarusian opposition, stated that dozens of political prisoners released by Belarus as part of a US-brokered deal were forcibly deported to Lithuania, not truly freed. The release of 52 prisoners was part of an agreement with the United States to lift sanctions on Belarus' national airline, following meetings between a White House envoy and President Lukashenko. While some ex-prisoners thanked former US President Trump, others expressed a desire to remain in Belarus, with many nearing the end of their sentences. Tsikhanouskaya urged Western governments to demand that Lukashenko allow political prisoners to stay in their home country.</p>

          <h2>Missouri Lawmakers Pass GOP Redistricting Plan to Potentially Add Republican House Seat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Missouri lawmakers have passed a Republican-backed plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, which Governor Mike Kehoe is set to sign into law. The new map aims to create seven GOP-leaning House districts and one Democratic-leaning seat, shifting from the current 6-2 split and potentially adding another Republican to Congress. This move, lauded by former President Trump, is part of a nationwide redistricting effort by Republicans to maintain their slim House majority. Opponents, including the ACLU, have filed a legal challenge, arguing the plan is unconstitutional, rushed, and racially gerrymandered, particularly by splitting the Kansas City area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health study has found a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease in women who have experienced stalking or obtained restraining orders. Analyzing data from over 66,000 American nurses, researchers found a 41% increased risk for those stalked and a 70% increase for those with restraining orders, even after accounting for other health factors. This article highlights how such experiences of violence, affecting nearly one in three women, can profoundly impact physical health. Researchers hope these findings will prompt doctors to include questions about stalking and protective orders in future heart health screenings.</p>

          <p>As astronomical autumn begins on September 22nd, the darkening nights will offer several celestial spectacles for stargazers. Highlights include Saturn reaching 'opposition' on September 21st, making it appear at its brightest and largest, visible to the naked eye as a non-twinkling star in Pisces, though a telescope is needed to see its rings. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will be active from October 2nd to November 7th, peaking around October 22nd. Ideal viewing conditions are expected for the Orionids due to the new moon, promising fast-moving meteors with long streaks of light.</p>

          <p>Three elderly Austrian nuns, aged 82 to 88, have defiantly returned to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in the Alps after being placed in a Catholic care home against their will. Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita, the last remaining nuns, regained access with the help of former students and a locksmith. Church authorities, who dissolved their community and deemed the convent rooms unusable for proper care, have expressed displeasure, calling their return 'completely incomprehensible.' Despite initial lack of electricity and water, supporters are assisting the nuns, who are determined to live out their lives in their beloved home.</p>
