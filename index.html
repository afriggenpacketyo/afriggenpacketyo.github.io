        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is appealing a court decision that overturned a massive financial penalty against former President Donald Trump. The appeal, filed with the state's highest court, seeks to reinstate the punishment originally imposed by a trial judge. The lower appellate court had voided the fine, citing the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against "excessive fines," although it upheld the underlying ruling that Trump and his company had committed business fraud by inflating asset values for financial gain. The attorney general's office will detail its arguments for reversal in future court filings.</p>

          <p>A new bill, the "You Earn It, You Keep It Act," has been introduced in the Senate to permanently eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. The proposed legislation aims to provide financial relief to seniors by also adjusting the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000, significantly higher than the current cap. This contrasts with a temporary senior deduction recently passed, which offers more limited relief. Proponents argue the bill would extend the solvency of Social Security's trust funds for an additional 24 years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, repeatedly refused to disclose the source of a "tip" that led him to accuse Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. During a media interview, Pulte deflected questions about the origin of the information, which has been criticized as a potential "political weaponization" of his agency. He argued the focus should be on the alleged crime rather than the investigation's sources. The allegations have prompted President Trump to move to fire Cook, who has denied the claims and is suing to block her dismissal.</p>

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling has opened the possibility for American businesses to receive tens of billions of dollars in refunds for tariffs paid on foreign goods. The court found that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping country-based tariffs. However, the administration is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, creating ongoing uncertainty for businesses regarding pricing and potential reimbursement. If the ruling is upheld, the government would need to establish a process for refunding the collected levies, which could be complex. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Danish energy company Orsted has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following an abrupt order to halt construction on its Revolution Wind project. The offshore wind farm, located off the coast of New England, is 80% complete and was expected to power over 350,000 homes. Orsted's lawsuit claims the stop-work order is arbitrary and unlawful, suggesting it is a pretext for the president's known hostility towards wind power. The company argues that billions of dollars in investments and future revenue are at risk due to the administration's sudden action against the fully permitted project.</p>

          <p>The contentious immigration case of Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia has resulted in the firing, suspension, or resignation of several career Justice Department officials. These departures are seen as clearing potential internal opposition to the Trump administration's stringent deportation policies. The case has become a focal point, with officials being removed after testifying that Abrego Garcia's initial deportation was an "administrative error." The situation has reportedly eroded trust between the judiciary and the DOJ, with some judges accusing the department of acting in bad faith and willfully defying court orders.</p>

He is accused of using the vouchers to purchase luxury personal items and fostering a "toxic culture" within the organization. The allegations have raised concerns among volunteers about potential damage to the reputation and financial stability of one of Europe's largest pride events. Joell-Deshields has disputed the suspension's authority, stating that he remains in his role while the organization addresses internal governance matters.</p>

          <p>The president of Northwestern University, Michael H. Schill, has announced his resignation after three years in the role. His departure follows a period of significant turmoil, including steep federal research funding cuts of nearly $800 million initiated by the Trump administration. These cuts forced the university to announce the elimination of approximately 425 jobs. Schill also faced heavy criticism from conservatives over the university's handling of campus protests related to the war in Gaza. In his resignation message, he cited the extraordinary challenges faced by the institution as a reason for new leadership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), has proposed the idea of "differential fee levels" for universities based on the quality of their teaching. This could mean that institutions with higher teaching standards might be allowed to charge different tuition fees than those with lower rankings. Currently, most universities charge a uniform fee, but this suggestion could incentivize improvements in educational quality. The proposal comes as many universities face financial deficits, and any final decision on fee structures would be made by the government, which is expected to release its plans this autumn.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma dropped nearly 20% to their lowest point since its initial public offering, following its first earnings report as a public company. While the quarterly results were largely in line with expectations, with revenue growing 41% year-over-year, the stock's high volatility continued. The company's forecast for the third quarter, though representing strong growth, did not assuage market concerns. After a massive surge on its first day of trading, the stock has since lost more than half its value, reflecting the challenges facing newly public tech companies. (not investment advice)</p>

He suggested that such a program could play an "important part" in making it more difficult for individuals to work in the UK without permission. Starmer noted that public perception of digital identity has likely evolved since the contentious debate over physical ID cards two decades ago. The proposal is being explored as a way to create a more consistent approach for employers to verify a person's right to work.</p>

Federal agents took iPhones, USB drives, a computer, and binders containing documents as part of an investigation into the handling of classified materials. The search warrant was based on "evidence of a crime," though Bolton has not been charged. The raid is viewed by some as part of a broader trend of the administration using federal agencies to target political critics, raising concerns about the weaponization of the FBI.</p>

The move, which aligns with the national administration's skepticism towards vaccines, has drawn sharp criticism from medical organizations and public health experts.

          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of mass shooters performing for an online audience of peers, where they seek to become part of a morbid legacy of violence. It argues that the incoherent messages and symbols often left by perpetrators, like those in a recent Minneapolis shooting, are not meant to convey a clear ideology but to troll observers and impress a niche online community. These "mass-shooter-creation machines" exist in forums where killers are praised and their tactics are studied. The author suggests that focusing on individual motives is misguided and that the problem is a social one driven by networked communities.</p>
