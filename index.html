          <p>The Japanese government has started releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, making it available to consumers at reduced prices. Major retailers like Ito-Yokado and Iris Ohyama have begun selling the rice for 2,160 yen ($15) per 5-kilogram bag, leading to high demand and quick sell-outs in some locations. This initiative aims to alleviate the impact of soaring rice prices on households, with 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 harvests being offered through these contracts. Consumers have expressed relief at the cheaper prices, though some have been disappointed by limited availability.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempts to impose sweeping tariffs are facing significant legal and economic challenges, with a court blocking his signature trade policy and markets reacting negatively. Despite Trump's initial claims that "tariffs are easy," his administration has encountered numerous obstacles, including delays, exemptions, and market panic. The court ruling, which challenges the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as justification for the tariffs, has added another layer of uncertainty. While the administration appeals, the legal spats and market resistance highlight the complexities and potential consequences of Trump's economic agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a member of the Manson "family" serving a life sentence for her involvement in the 1969 Los Angeles murders, has been recommended for parole by a California prisons panel. The board found that Krenwinkel, now 77, poses a low risk of reoffending due to her age and behavior in prison. This recommendation is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, who previously reversed a similar decision in 2022. Krenwinkel was convicted of first-degree murder for participating in the killings of seven people, including actress Sharon Tate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax bill, which includes a tax on remittances, is expected to significantly impact Africans who send money home. Remittances are a vital source of income for many African economies, often outweighing aid and foreign direct investment. The proposed tax could reduce the amount of money migrants send home, affecting household expenses, education, and medical care. While some believe migrants will find ways to avoid the tax, the policy is criticized for potentially harming low-income families and undermining financial stability in certain African countries.
