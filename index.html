          <p>The Trump administration is set to revoke the "AI diffusion rule," effectively ending restrictions on U.S. chip exports, a move celebrated by Nvidia. The rule, proposed by the Biden administration, categorized countries into tiers with varying restrictions on AI chip shipments. Nvidia's CEO expressed enthusiasm, stating the decision offers America a unique chance to spearhead the next industrial revolution, generate well-paying jobs, enhance U.S. infrastructure, and reduce the trade deficit. Nvidia shares rose following the announcement, reflecting investor optimism regarding the change in AI policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First Minister John Swinney has declared his opposition to a bill legalizing assisted dying in Scotland, citing concerns about its impact on patient-clinician relationships and the potential pressure on vulnerable individuals. Swinney, influenced by his faith and his wife's terminal condition, believes the bill could lead some to feel like a burden and prematurely end their lives. The legislation, proposed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, would allow terminally ill, mentally fit patients to request medical assistance to end their lives. While Swinney's opposition may sway undecided MSPs, the Scottish government will allow a free vote on the matter. The stage one vote will be held on May 13.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his nomination of Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the U.S. Surgeon General. Means, replacing Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, is a proponent of Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, emphasizing the influence of food and lifestyle on health. She co-founded Levels, a health app, and co-authored "Good Energy," advocating for addressing the root causes of health issues. While Means supports vaccine safety and has expressed concerns about the vaccine schedule, her nomination has faced skepticism from some in Kennedy's anti-vaccine base. Her brother, Calley Means, now advises Kennedy, backing state bills promoting his agenda.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to announce a comprehensive trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first since a temporary tariff pause. The agreement aims to strengthen the relationship between the two nations. While Trump touted the deal as comprehensive, 10 Downing Street indicated that negotiations were still in progress. Trump had previously imposed a 10% tariff on the UK as part of a broader "reciprocal" import duty plan, which he later paused after facing market backlash. The announcement is expected to occur remotely with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer participating.</p>

The article argues that Xi Jinping has used the trade war to his political advantage, portraying China as a resolute defender of the nation. Trump's goals remain unclear, while China seeks the removal of U.S. tariffs and protection of its economic policies.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States is expected to provide some economic relief but is unlikely to significantly boost the British economy, which remains vulnerable to global economic uncertainty. While the deal is expected to ease the impact of recent U.S. tariff increases and support sectors like the auto industry, its overall impact is limited by the skew towards services in trade flows. The agreement is likely to improve consumer and business sentiment, but economists caution that larger gains would require closer ties with the European Union.

          <p>Russia is set to celebrate the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat with a large military parade in Moscow, using the event to bolster support for the war in Ukraine. However, despite the Kremlin's confident display, Russia faces challenges on the battlefield, economic struggles, and potential shifts in President Trump's stance. While Putin remains determined, Trump has threatened to punish buyers of Russian oil and is sending advanced weapons to Ukraine. Despite these challenges, several world leaders are expected to attend the parade, highlighting the Kremlin's claim that Western sanctions have failed to isolate Russia.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has cut UK interest rates for the fourth time in a year, reducing them to 4.25% from 4.5% due to a slowdown in inflation. Governor Andrew Bailey cited inflation as the reason for the cut but cautioned about the unpredictability of the global economy, particularly U.S. tariffs. The bank considered a larger cut but decided against it due to concerns about the global trade war. Future rate cuts are expected to be gradual. The decision comes as a tariff deal between the UK and US is set to be announced.</p>

          <p>A 47-year-old man from Florida sustained minor injuries after being gored by a bison in Yellowstone National Park. The incident occurred in the Lake Village area, where bison are commonly found.

Bison have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. This is the first bison-related injury in the park in 2025.</p>

          <p>Amidst growing skepticism and political pressure, the New York Times explains the science behind mRNA vaccines. mRNA, or messenger RNA, carries information from DNA to build proteins in our cells, and mRNA vaccines use this process to trigger an immune response. While mRNA vaccines have proven effective against diseases like COVID-19 and RSV, they are now facing backlash, with some lawmakers seeking to ban them and the government cutting funding. Scientists emphasize that mRNA vaccines cannot alter DNA and have demonstrated safety, offering hope for treating various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders.</p>
