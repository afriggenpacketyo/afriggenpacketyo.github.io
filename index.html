          <p>A 27-year-old woman, Monia Spadaro, was shot and wounded at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, after crashing into a gate early Thursday morning. Law enforcement officials are investigating whether Spadaro was intoxicated during the incident, noting a prior conviction for driving while intoxicated in 2021. The CIA confirmed the security incident, closing the main gate and advising employees to seek alternative routes. The shooting occurred hours after a separate incident in D.C. where two Israeli Embassy staff members were fatally shot, though there is no evidence linking the two events. The headquarters building has seen violence before, including a 1993 shooting that killed two CIA employees.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a 4-4 deadlock ruling in the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond case, preventing Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself, leading to the even split and upholding the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision that such schools would violate the state and U.S. constitutions. This outcome means the existing regime guaranteeing public schools remain secular continues, though proponents of religious charter schools may attempt to create one again in the future. The court's action leaves in place lower court rulings that said the arrangement would have violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>A small Cessna 550 jet crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego early Thursday morning, resulting in multiple fatalities among those on board and destroying several homes. The crash occurred in Murphy Canyon near the Tierrasanta neighborhood, causing multiple homes to catch fire and forcing residents to evacuate. While there were no serious injuries reported among people on the ground, the neighborhood is described as a "gigantic debris field" with jet fuel spread throughout. The plane had been attempting to land at the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, and the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist detained in Louisiana, met his month-old son for the first time before an immigration court hearing. The Trump administration is seeking to deport Khalil, arguing his presence spreads antisemitism, a claim his lawyers dispute, citing his explicit condemnations of antisemitism. His lawyers argue his detention is retaliation for pro-Palestinian speech and that his arrest was warrantless. The immigration court will consider arguments that Khalil faces danger if deported, likely to Syria or Algeria. Separately, a federal district judge in New Jersey is considering whether Khalil can be released on bail.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, but it faces a complicated path through the Senate. The bill's steep cuts to the social safety net to fund tax cuts have drawn vehement opposition from Democrats, while some Republican senators have already indicated they will require significant changes before voting for it. The final version of the bill included amendments designed to appease various factions within the House GOP conference, such as a timeline for imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients and a fourfold increase in the cap on deductions that federal income tax filers can claim for state and local taxes. On Wall Street, investors were not enthusiastic about the tax cut package. (not investment advice)</p>

Ohtani, recovering from injury, is slated to potentially face hitters in a simulated game, but the team prioritizes his offensive contributions and doesn't want to jeopardize his hitting performance with unnecessary risks on the mound. The Dodgers face a challenging stretch of games against teams with winning records, making Ohtani's bat crucial.

          <h2>California Revises Plastic Recycling Rules, Easing Industry Burdens</h2>

          <p>California waste officials have proposed revised regulations for implementing SB 54, the state's landmark plastic waste law, after Governor Newsom rejected the initial proposal. The new draft regulations clarify producer obligations but also include broad exemptions for single-use plastics under FDA and USDA jurisdiction. Critics argue that these exemptions and the allowance of chemical recycling undermine the law's purpose of reducing plastic waste. Environmental groups and lawmakers express concerns that the revised regulations favor industry interests and may weaken the law's effectiveness. A public workshop is scheduled to discuss the draft regulations.</p>

          <p>New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, a mayoral candidate, plans to deliver a campaign speech at Elmhurst Hospital, connecting her father's death from Covid-19 to mismanagement by former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Adams will argue that her father was failed by the state government due to slow distribution of PPE and other resources to Black and brown communities. Cuomo's campaign has rejected these claims, and allies describe her as a common-sense candidate who can compete with Cuomo for Black voters. Adams has qualified for public matching funds and is seeking to siphon Black primary voters away from Cuomo.</p>

          <p>The government in England has offered most teachers and doctors a 4% pay rise, accepting recommendations from pay review bodies. This award is higher than the previously budgeted 2.8%, with the remainder to be funded from existing budgets. Education unions have welcomed the decision but warn of potential cuts to school budgets. Health unions, however, reacted negatively to a smaller 3.6% rise offered to other NHS staff, including nurses and midwives. The British Medical Association plans to ballot resident doctors over possible strike action, and the Royal College of Nursing called the disparity in pay rises "grotesque."</p>

A South African court ruled claims of white genocide were unfounded. While murders of farmers are a problem in South Africa, there is no indication that these murders are race-driven.

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000 from the current $10,000 limit, with a phase-out over $500,000. The provision, if enacted, would go into effect in 2025, with annual increases of 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap.

          <p>A pause on the steepest tariffs on Chinese goods has led to a boost in stalled orders from Asia, but risks of retail shortages remain, according to a CNBC survey and interviews with logistics executives and retailers. The survey indicates that many importers have not resumed full holiday orders, and some retailers abandoned freight due to high tariffs. Consumers can expect lower inventory and potentially higher prices. While some orders have been un-paused, experts do not expect a sustained container surge. Recession risks are still high amid the ongoing trade war uncertainty, with many respondents anticipating an economic downturn.</p>
