            <p>A Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Sumy resulted in the deaths of over 20 people and injuries to more than 80, including children, on Palm Sunday. Two ballistic missiles struck the city center, where people were gathered to celebrate the holiday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as an act of "filthy scum" and called for a global response, emphasizing that talks alone cannot stop such atrocities. The strike occurred amidst ongoing tensions, with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of violating a U.S.-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Ecuador is holding a crucial runoff election between President Daniel Noboa, a conservative, and Luisa González, a leftist. Security concerns are paramount as Ecuador grapples with Latin America's highest murder rate, driven by turf wars between drug gangs, with some experts suggesting that negotiating with criminal gangs could lead to government co-option and a narco-state. Noboa has declared an internal armed conflict, partnering with Erik Prince to combat narcoterrorism, while González advocates for a softer approach focused on integrating gangs into civil society. The outcome will significantly impact Ecuador's approach to crime and international relations.</p>

            <p>Attacks on camps in Sudan's Darfur region, housing hundreds of thousands displaced by civil war, have resulted in the deaths of over 100 civilians, including children and aid workers. The UN has condemned the attacks, allegedly carried out by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), as an unacceptable escalation. Residents of Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps, already facing famine-like conditions, described dire situations with limited access to medicine and closed routes. The attacks coincide with the second anniversary of the conflict between the RSF and the army, exacerbating the world's largest humanitarian crisis.</p>

            <p>The US government quietly exempted smartphones from tariffs on goods entering the country from China, marking a potential retreat from escalating trade war rhetoric. This decision avoids a significant price increase on iPhones, most of which are manufactured in China. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has strong relationships with both President Trump and President Xi Jinping, could potentially play a key role in brokering peace in the US-China trade conflict. However, existing tariffs on goods related to fentanyl production remain in place, potentially impacting trade relations.</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is set for a retrial after a judge's misstep during the initial suit opened the door for another legal challenge. The case stems from a 2017 Times editorial that allegedly linked Palin to a 2011 shooting in Arizona. Despite a previous loss, Palin has another opportunity to argue her case, although the bar for proving defamation against public figures remains high. The media landscape has shifted since the first trial, with several media companies settling defamation claims.</p>

            <p>Comedian Stewart Lee uses Sam Peckinpah's "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" as a lens to view current political events, particularly the Trump administration. He argues that the film's themes of freedom under attack from big business and the choice between doing the right thing and bending to tyranny resonate with today's political landscape. Lee also touches on the rise of bullies in politics and comedy, and the challenges of creating satire in a world that increasingly mirrors the absurd.</p>

            <p>The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, requiring proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration, is sparking debate over its potential impact on married women, particularly those who have changed their last names. Opponents argue that the bill could disenfranchise millions of voters, as many women's birth certificates no longer match their current names. Supporters assert that the bill allows states to determine additional required documents to address discrepancies. Legal experts worry that the ambiguity in the bill could lead to varying policies across states.</p>

            <p>China's science fiction industry is experiencing a boom, driven by popular works like Liu Cixin's "The Three-Body Problem" and government support for "quality" growth. The industry generated nearly $15 billion in revenue in 2024, a significant increase compared to five years earlier. This growth is fueled by a growing interest in sci-fi among younger generations and a desire to explore visionary narratives that challenge perceptions of the future.</p>

            <p>President Trump's attacks on law firms representing causes he opposes are creating a climate of fear that could deter firms from taking on pro bono cases challenging his administration's policies. Civil rights organizations report that some firms have declined to assist them due to political considerations. This pullback on pro bono work could lead to fewer challenges to potentially unconstitutional actions by the government, undermining the legal system.</p>
