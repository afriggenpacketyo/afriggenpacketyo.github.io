          <p>A shooting occurred at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, resulting in one person injured and the death of the suspect. According to Chief Ryan Strong, the suspect, a 31-year-old man, arrived at the church and began firing a long gun and handgun. A parishioner struck the suspect with a vehicle, and two staff members returned fire, killing him. One staff member, a security guard, was shot in the leg and is being treated at a hospital; the FBI is assisting with the investigation as authorities work to determine the motive behind the shooting. Optimism cannot be reflected in the fact that people survived the shooting.</p>

          <p>China's UN ambassador, Fu Cong, has criticized the United States and Israel for escalating tensions with Iran, following a US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. Fu Cong called for de-escalation, adherence to international law, and prioritization of civilian safety, stating that Washington's actions have violated Iranian sovereignty and harmed the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. While other Security Council members broadly agreed on the need to end the conflict, divisions quickly emerged along geopolitical lines, with China and Russia defending Iran and the US and its allies defending Israel. The international community is urged to make concrete efforts to cool down the situation and restore peace and stability.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement that the U.S. had attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordo, world leaders have reacted with concern and calls for de-escalation. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran reserves all options in responding to the attack, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's decision. China condemned the U.S. attack, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of a dangerous escalation, and the European Union urged all sides to return to negotiations.

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining attention as Japan faces its first period without giant pandas in over half a century. Foreign affairs experts suggest that China may loan new pandas to Japan during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader to stabilize relations amidst escalating tensions with the United States. The panda has historically served as a symbol of friendship between the two countries, and a new loan could signal improved relations, especially after China's ban on Japanese seafood imports. However, China's upcoming anniversary of its victory against Japanese aggression may present diplomatic challenges.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee judge ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a point of contention in immigration policies. However, it is anticipated that ICE will take Abrego Garcia into custody, potentially leading to his deportation before he can stand trial on human smuggling charges. A hearing is scheduled to discuss the conditions of Abrego Garcia's release, but the judge acknowledged that the decision is largely academic due to ICE's likely involvement. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges, which his attorneys describe as an attempt to justify the initial deportation error.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert suggests that parents can foster cooperation by avoiding threats, bribes, and harsh consequences. Instead, using language that respects a child's autonomy while setting boundaries can be more effective. The expert recommends replacing phrases like "Because I said so" with explanations, and shifting from threats to giving children agency over their behavior. This approach aims to create a safe and respectful environment where children feel heard and understood, leading to better self-regulation and emotional resilience.</p>

          <p>Experts are raising concerns that a culture of online surveillance is contributing to cyberstalking among children, with some as young as 10 and 11 being reported to police for suspected offenses. Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips emphasizes the need to educate young people about healthy relationships in the digital age, as constant monitoring online becomes normalized. Charities note that sharing locations and checking online activity are often seen as signs of care, but can set precedents for concerning behaviors. The Suzy Lamplugh Trust calls for more research and funding to address cyberstalking among under-16s, as anonymity online can both protect and expose individuals to exploitation.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights activist recently released from ICE detention, reaffirmed his commitment to Palestinian freedom at a New York rally. Khalil, who was detained for over 100 days, criticized Columbia University for its attempts to suppress pro-Palestine protests and accused the university of funding the killing in Gaza. Despite facing potential threats, Khalil plans to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and opposing the Trump administration's policies. He was seized by ICE agents in front of his pregnant wife and missed the birth of his first child, underscoring the personal toll of his activism.</p>

          <p>Following America's attacks on Iran, the UK government has emphasized that while it was informed in advance, it did not participate in the operation. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly called for de-escalation, and questions have been raised within the government about the legality of involvement. With Washington acting independently, the UK avoided a difficult decision on whether to authorize the use of its military base on Diego Garcia for U.S. warplanes. The situation may evolve depending on Iran's response, potentially requiring further trade-offs.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, seen as a prelude to July's House of Councillors race.

The LDP secured only 22 seats, falling below its previous record-low, while the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito party also won significant numbers of seats.

Iran's foreign minister has warned that the Islamic Republic reserves all options to defend its sovereignty after the U.S. bombed three nuclear sites, and the Iranian parliament has backed closing the strait.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country being electric.

Chinese EV makers like BYD are now leading the global market, and the country has built the world's largest public charging network. While Western countries view China's approach as unfair business practice, Chinese EV executives argue that all companies have access to the same resources, fostering competition and innovation.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is proposing to establish a clinic offering ketamine as a treatment for severe depression, potentially as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is primarily an anesthetic, it has shown promise in treating treatment-resistant depression, though it is not yet licensed for routine use. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release updated information on ketamine later this year, and experts emphasize the importance of controlled clinical settings and lower doses compared to recreational use.</p>
