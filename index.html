          <p>The U.S. private sector added only 54,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' forecasts and marking a substantial slowdown from the previous month's revised gain. This data, released by ADP, signals potential trouble in the labor market, with particular weakness in trade, transportation, utilities, education, and health services. Conversely, the leisure and hospitality industry saw a notable increase of 50,000 jobs. Wage growth remained steady, but overall labor market concerns are mounting, with attention now turning to the upcoming official government jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oil giant ConocoPhillips plans to lay off 20% to 25% of its global workforce, impacting between 2,600 and 3,250 employees and contractors, primarily before the end of 2025. This move is part of the company's broader strategy to cut costs and improve efficiency, following efforts that identified over $1 billion in reductions. Despite beating Wall Street expectations in its second-quarter earnings, the company's profits were down year-over-year, and its shares fell 4.3% on the news. CEO Ryan Lance reportedly cited the need for fewer roles due to rising costs in an internal video message to staff. (not investment advice)</p>

The company forecast third-quarter revenue growth of about 33% and full-year revenue exceeding $1.02 billion. CEO Dylan Field noted that the success of Dev Mode last year is dampening current growth rates, and Figma continues to integrate AI features like Figma Make and Figma Sites, though it has not yet fully charged for these products.

CBS News data analysis highlights the odds of winning, frequently drawn numbers, and the significant impact of state taxes on prize payouts. Winners in states like California, Florida, and Texas, which do not tax lottery prizes, could take home considerably more after federal taxes than those in states with high income taxes such as New York. The analysis offers a detailed breakdown for potential winners considering annuity versus lump-sum options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful magnitude-6.0 earthquake, followed by a magnitude-5.2 aftershock, has killed over 2,200 people and injured nearly 4,000 in Afghanistan, primarily in Kunar province. Rescuers face immense challenges reaching survivors due to rockfalls, landslides, and blocked roads, with the window for finding people alive rapidly closing. Aid agencies are calling for more support as the disaster exacerbates an already severe humanitarian crisis, compounded by decades of conflict and reduced foreign aid since the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The World Health Organization and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies highlight the vast and growing needs of over 1.3 million affected individuals. </p>

          <p>New Orleans Democrats have strongly opposed President Donald Trump's suggestion to deploy National Guard troops to the city to combat crime, with City Council President Helena Moreno calling it "scare tactics and politicizing public safety." Trump stated he was considering sending the Guard to New Orleans or Chicago to "straighten out" crime in about two weeks, a sentiment echoed by Louisiana's Republican Governor Jeff Landry. However, local officials and U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, a Democrat, emphasized significant crime reductions already achieved through federal and state partnerships, arguing that militarization is not the solution and that federal funding for police training and root causes of crime would be more effective. </p>

          <p>During a military parade in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin were reportedly overheard discussing the possibility of achieving immortality and extended lifespans through repeated organ transplants and biotechnology. While their exchange seemed lighthearted, the BBC article delves into the scientific reality, noting that organ transplants significantly save lives and advancements are extending their functional duration. However, experts emphasize the substantial risks of multiple surgeries, lifelong immunosuppressants, and the body's diminishing resilience with age, suggesting that current research aims to treat illness rather than achieve indefinite life extension. The discussion highlights ongoing efforts in xenotransplantation and growing organs from stem cells, but scientists caution against the notion of living to 150 years through such means. </p>

          <p>U.S. job cuts in the first eight months of this year have already surpassed the total for 2024, increasing by 66% to approximately 892,000, a level not seen since 2020. The significant rise is attributed to the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, economic uncertainty, and the growing impact of artificial intelligence. California and the tech industry have been particularly affected, alongside pharmaceuticals, finance, nonprofits, and retail. Employers are increasingly citing economic and market factors, including tariffs and inflation, as drivers for layoffs, with AI directly causing over 10,000 cuts this year.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is slated to testify before the Senate Finance Committee, facing questions expected to focus on his vaccine policies and recent upheaval at the CDC. This follows the ousting of CDC Director Susan Monarez and the resignation of four top CDC officials, reportedly after Monarez refused to endorse Kennedy's vaccine policy changes. The FDA recently narrowed COVID-19 vaccine access, a move public health officials fear will complicate vaccine availability for younger, healthy individuals. Kennedy is expected to promote his "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, aiming to restore "gold-standard science" and trust in public health. </p>

This creates a dangerous precedent, normalizing distrust in the system and making it easier to challenge other vaccines.
