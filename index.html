          <p>Bill Owens, the executive producer of CBS's '60 Minutes', has resigned after 37 years with CBS News, citing concerns over corporate interference and compromised independence. Owens implied that his departure was influenced by President Trump's lawsuit against CBS over an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, and the pending sale of Paramount to Skydance Media, led by a Trump-friendly billionaire. Owens stated he could no longer make independent decisions for the show, and CBS News chief Wendy McMahon expressed support for Owens's principles.

These creators, some of whom are lawyers, provide detailed commentary on cases like the Justin Baldoni-Blake Lively dispute, attracting large followings. The appeal lies in the transparency and accessibility of raw information, contrasting with traditional media. However, the article notes that this trend can also fuel misogyny and conspiracy theories, particularly in comment sections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ABC News reports that experts are concerned that the Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers could negatively impact the economy. The resumption of collections, paused during the COVID-19 pandemic, will affect roughly 5 million borrowers starting in May. Experts suggest that garnishing wages will reduce consumer spending and potentially damage borrowers' credit scores. While some argue it provides clarity after years of uncertainty, the timing is unfortunate given the risk of a recession.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that Bitcoin has surpassed $90,000 for the first time since March, driven by investors seeking an alternative to turbulent stock markets and a weakening dollar. The cryptocurrency's recent gains coincide with a sell-off in U.S. equities and increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. U.S. ETFs tracking Bitcoin saw significant inflows, indicating renewed investor interest. Analysts note Bitcoin's decoupling from traditional risk assets and its potential to break above resistance levels, but caution that light trading volumes may limit further gains without a catalyst like Fed easing or tariff deals.

          <p>CNBC reports that the White House has defended Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth after reports that he discussed sensitive military information on a Signal chat with family and friends. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump "strongly behind" Hegseth, dismissing the reports as a "smear campaign." Hegseth blamed "leakers" for the revelations, claiming that the shared information was unclassified and for media coordination. This follows earlier reports about Hegseth discussing military strikes on Signal.</p>
