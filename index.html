          <p>A new Netflix documentary, "America’s Team: the Gambler and his Cowboys," is earning acclaim for its raw and gritty portrayal of the Dallas Cowboys' dynasty in the 1990s. The series delves into the team's on-field success and off-field controversies, featuring candid interviews with key figures like Michael Irvin, Jerry Jones, and Jimmy Johnson, who discuss everything from drug use to their infamous feud. Unlike many polished sports documentaries, this series is noted for its unflinching look at the glory and grubbiness of a celebrated era. The article praises the filmmakers for asking tough questions and revealing deeper truths about the players' complex lives.</p>

          <p>Margin buying on mainland China's stock exchanges has surged to a record US$320 billion, surpassing a previous peak set just before a market crash. This increase in leveraged trading is seen by some analysts as a sign of improving market sentiment and liquidity, primarily driven by retail traders and quantitative hedge funds. However, the rapid rise in the value of shares bought with borrowed money is also raising concerns about potential market overheating. Regulators have been prompted to issue warnings about investment risks as certain tech stocks have more than doubled in value within a month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A devastating landslide has obliterated the village of Tarasin in Sudan's Darfur region, with an estimated 1,000 residents killed and only a single person surviving. The disaster, triggered by days of heavy rainfall, has compounded the humanitarian crisis in the area, which is already suffering from a brutal civil war that has made it largely inaccessible to aid organizations. A rebel group controlling the mountainous region has issued an urgent appeal to the United Nations and international groups for assistance in recovery efforts. The event stands as one of the deadliest natural disasters in the nation's recent history.</p>

According to the Royal Bahamas Police Force, the man was found unresponsive with visible injuries, and medical personnel pronounced him dead at the scene. This incident follows a series of jet ski accidents involving U.S. citizens in the region, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a security alert earlier this year advising against their rental and use.

          <p>China is preparing for a grand military parade in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, an event designed to showcase President Xi Jinping's power. The parade will feature new military hardware and host world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

Separately, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson strongly opposed any deployment of federal troops or National Guard to the city, vowing to defend democracy against what he termed militarized force. The article also notes Trump's call for pharmaceutical companies to provide more data justifying the success of their COVID-19 vaccines amid ongoing debates.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens for £18.1 million, choosing him over the more experienced Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa. This decision aligns with the club's 'Project 150' strategy, which aims to build a title-contending team by its 150th anniversary in 2028. While Martinez is a proven Premier League talent, United's data analysis highlighted Lammens' exceptional potential in key metrics like shot-stopping and distribution for his age group. The move is seen as a long-term investment, prioritizing a player who will be entering his prime by 2028 over an immediate, older solution.</p>

          <p>The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, were visible across large parts of the United Kingdom, from northern Scotland down to Norfolk and Kent. This rare and widespread sighting was caused by a strong solar storm resulting from a coronal mass ejection on the Sun's surface. The increased solar energy interacting with gases in Earth's atmosphere created the vibrant purple, green, and red colors. While auroras are not uncommon in northern UK regions, it requires a more powerful solar event for them to be seen so far south.

The long-standing issue is rooted in deep-seated social problems like poverty, unemployment, and alienation, which have disproportionately affected the country's most deprived areas.

The escalating trade tensions coincide with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attendance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, where he met with leaders from Russia and China.

Despite state-backed, low-interest construction loans, only about 5,100 homes have been built or started, as builders have been hesitant to participate.

          <p>Legendary coach Bill Belichick's first game as head coach for the North Carolina Tar Heels resulted in a lopsided 48-14 home loss to the TCU Horned Frogs. Despite an initial touchdown drive that energized the home crowd at Kenan Stadium, UNC was quickly overwhelmed. TCU scored 41 unanswered points, dominating on both offense and defense, including a pick-six and a fumble recovery for a touchdown. The game highlighted the significant challenges Belichick faces in transitioning to the college level, as his team was thoroughly outplayed in a highly anticipated season opener that was expected to mark a new era for the program.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat and the longest-serving member of the U.S. House from New York, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. Citing the "necessity for generational change in the party," the 78-year-old congressman stated his belief that a younger successor might be better equipped to confront the political challenges posed by Donald Trump. First elected in 1992, Nadler had a prominent career, including chairing the House Judiciary Committee and serving as an impeachment manager during Trump's first impeachment. His decision opens up a key seat in a district he has represented for over three decades.</p>

          <p>A team at the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre has developed a potential solution for washing clothes in space: a compact, detergent-free washing machine. The 12kg device uses a combination of ultrasonic mist and ozone to clean and sterilize clothes, requiring only 400ml of water per cycle. This innovative approach addresses the significant challenge of managing laundry on long-duration space missions, where water is a scarce and precious resource. The technology aims to improve astronaut hygiene and comfort by allowing clothes to be cleaned and reused, a capability currently unavailable on the International Space Station.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Jersey health officials have confirmed that ticks capable of transmitting Lyme disease have been detected in all 21 of the state's counties. This widespread presence raises public health concerns as the pests are expanding from traditional wooded areas into suburban and urban environments, increasing the risk of exposure for residents. The spread is attributed to a warming climate, which creates more favorable conditions for ticks to survive and breed. Officials are urging the public to take preventive measures, such as using repellents and checking for ticks after being outdoors, to combat the most common vector-borne illness in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New restrictions on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), part of a law signed by President Trump, are now taking effect, resulting in what some call the largest cut to the program in its history. An estimated 2.4 million fewer Americans will receive benefits, and families could see their monthly support reduced significantly. While this will impact low-income households, large discount grocers like Walmart may benefit as consumers seek to stretch their dollars further. However, independent and smaller grocery stores, particularly those in low-income areas, are bracing for a substantial decrease in sales and potential negative ripple effects on their operations.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing legislation that will give the justice secretary the power to veto new sentencing guidelines proposed by the independent Sentencing Council for England and Wales. Under the new rules, both the justice secretary and the lady chief justice must approve any guidelines before they are issued. This change follows a public dispute over proposed guidance that would have required courts to consider the backgrounds of offenders from certain minority groups. The government stated the reform ensures greater democratic oversight of sentencing policy while maintaining judicial independence in individual cases.</p>

          <p>World number one and defending US Open champion Jannik Sinner delivered a commanding performance to defeat Alexander Bublik 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 and advance to the quarter-finals. The match, which lasted only one hour and 21 minutes, was one of the quickest in this year's men's singles tournament. Bublik, who had previously beaten Sinner, was unable to find his rhythm, struggling with his serve and making numerous errors. Sinner's relentless and precise play led Bublik to jokingly label him an "AI" player. Sinner will now face fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti in the next round.</p>
