Thousands gathered at the Citywest Hotel in Saggart, leading to a confrontation with riot police. Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan condemned the violence, promising a forceful response and vowing to bring those responsible to justice. Other officials described the violence as unacceptable and not representative of the country, emphasizing the need for caution regarding emerging divisions.</p>

          <p>Arizona's Attorney General Kris Mayes has filed a lawsuit against the House of Representatives due to Speaker Mike Johnson's delay in swearing in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva. Grijalva's vote is needed on a petition to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Mayes argues that Johnson is disenfranchising Arizona voters. Johnson claims the delay is due to scheduling, while Democrats believe it's a tactic to avoid the Epstein vote. The congresswoman says she cannot perform her duties until she is sworn in, as the House has not been in session since late September.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is facing a lawsuit from the state of Arizona over the delayed swearing-in of Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva. Arizona's Attorney General, Kris Mayes, argues that Johnson is depriving Arizona's 7th congressional district of representation. Johnson defends the delay by stating that the House was not in session when Grijalva was elected, and he cites a similar situation with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Grijalva's swearing-in is key to a measure aimed at releasing Epstein documents, but Johnson has signaled he would not block the measure if it came to the House floor.</p>

          <p>A study by 22 public service media organizations, including DW and the BBC, found that AI assistants misrepresent news content 45% of the time. The study evaluated ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini, and Perplexity AI on accuracy, sourcing, and context. The results showed systemic issues across languages and territories, raising concerns about public trust. The study calls for action from governments and AI companies to enforce laws on information integrity and ensure AI tools do not compromise the integrity of news.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, President Donald Trump's approach to his counterpart, Xi Jinping, may act as a stabilizing force in the relationship. While US officials have criticized China's trade practices, Trump has avoided directly antagonizing Xi or challenging Beijing's core interests. Analysts suggest that Trump's control over his administration, including China hawks, makes leader-to-leader diplomacy crucial in shaping ties. Tensions are expected to persist due to structural competition, but Trump's direct involvement could prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly seeking $230 million from the Justice Department as a settlement for investigations he faced during the Biden administration and his first term. The settlement would need approval from top DOJ officials who previously served as Trump's defense attorneys or represented his allies. The claims stem from investigations into his campaign's ties to Russia and accusations of malicious prosecution by then-special counsel Jack Smith. Trump acknowledged the unusual nature of the situation, stating that he might donate any settlement money to charity.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has canceled planned face-to-face talks with Vladimir Putin regarding the war in Ukraine, citing a lack of progress. A key sticking point was Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line. The decision to shelve the meeting follows increasing clarity on the differences between US and Russian proposals for peace. Trump had previously embraced a ceasefire proposal to freeze the conflict, but Russia insists on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from eastern regions, which is unacceptable to Kyiv and its European partners.</p>

          <p>Arizona's attorney general is suing House Speaker Mike Johnson for refusing to swear in Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat elected in a special election. Grijalva's swearing-in has been delayed, preventing her from representing her district and accessing congressional resources. The attorney general argues that Johnson is depriving Arizona's 7th district of representation. Grijalva believes the delay is due to her intention to release Epstein files, which could sway a vote in the House. Johnson has denied these claims and blamed the government shutdown.</p>

The new map would likely result in an 11-3 partisan split, replacing a Democratic congressman with a Republican. The state's Democratic governor does not have veto power over redistricting legislation. Critics argue that the map is an example of partisan gerrymandering. The US supreme court is considering a challenge to the Voting Rights Act that could effectively end protections from gerrymandering for Black voters.</p>

          <p>Netflix reported a 17% jump in third-quarter revenue, driven by the success of the animated film, 'KPop Demon Hunters'. The company reported net income of $2.5 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago, but below analyst projections. The success of 'KPop Demon Hunters' led to a licensing deal with toy makers Hasbro and Mattel. Netflix is using generative AI to improve recommendations and content discovery. Some investors remain skeptical about the future of subscription streaming services.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified that he never saw signs of drug use from teammate Tyler Skaggs before his death. Skaggs died of an overdose on a team trip in 2019. Trout said that he had seen Kay acting "wired" and sweating and "the first thing that came to mind was drugs." The testimony came at a trial for a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Skaggs' family, who contend the Angels made reckless decisions that gave Kay access to MLB players.</p>

          <h2>The Problem of Software Obsolescence in Modern Cars</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Modern cars, especially electric vehicles, are increasingly reliant on software, receiving over-the-air updates to fix bugs and add new features. This makes cars similar to smartphones, but with different lifespans. While phones are often replaced every few years, cars last much longer, raising concerns about software obsolescence. Automakers may eventually stop providing updates for older cars, leading to features becoming buggy or unusable. The worst-case scenario is the bankruptcy of a car company, leaving no one to provide software support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several SUVs are expected to experience significant price drops in late 2025 due to factors such as inventory clearance and increased market competition. The Jaguar F-Pace may see price drops due to dealerships clearing inventory and Jaguar's transition to an all-electric lineup. The Mercedes-Benz GLA is losing market appeal due to a shift toward electric vehicles. The Range Rover Sports may see price drops due to increased competition and potential updates in the latest model. The BMW iX electric SUV has seen notable depreciation due to stiff competition among electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>
