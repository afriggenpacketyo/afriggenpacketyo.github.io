            <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for its handling of the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador. Despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return, the administration is arguing that it has no obligation to work with El Salvador to bring him back. El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, has stated that he will not return Abrego Garcia, who is being held in a mega-prison. Critics argue that the administration is defying the Supreme Court and failing to protect the rights of an individual.</p>

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a Washington, D.C., courtroom, defending his company against FTC allegations of monopolistic practices. The FTC argues that Meta's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market and is seeking to force Meta to divest those platforms. Zuckerberg defended the acquisitions, arguing that Meta has invested in and grown the apps substantially. The trial is expected to last several weeks and could significantly impact Meta's business empire.</p>

            <p>President Trump is nearing a direct challenge to a Supreme Court order, effectively daring the justices to defend the law. The case involves Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man wrongfully deported to El Salvador. Despite the Supreme Court ordering the administration to "facilitate" his return, the White House is claiming it has no power to do anything. The situation is raising concerns about the administration's willingness to abide by court rulings.</p>

            <p>Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) is shutting down domestic trading operations in China and laying off staff as part of a global cost-cutting initiative. The move is aimed at helping ADM remain agile in a challenging environment. The company's earnings have been impacted by slumping crop prices, reduced consumer demand, and weak crop processing margins. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China are also creating headwinds for ADM.</p>
