        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 deadlock due to Justice Amy Coney Barrett's recusal, upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision to block the state from establishing the nation's first religious charter school funded by taxpayer dollars. The ruling leaves in place the lower court's judgment that taxpayer-funded religious schools violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment. This decision avoids setting a nationwide precedent, meaning the issue may be revisited in future cases from other states. Advocates for public and independent charter schools are relieved, fearing that a ruling in favor of the Catholic school would disrupt education systems nationwide.</p>

          <p>The UK has signed an agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while leasing back a key military base on Diego Garcia for £101 million annually. Prime Minister Starmer stated the deal is essential for maintaining the base in the long term and secures protections against malign influences. The agreement, facing legal challenges and opposition criticism over cost and concerns about Mauritius' ties to China, includes provisions for the resettlement of Chagossians on the islands, excluding Diego Garcia.

However, the bill also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially diminishing the benefit of the higher SALT cap.

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a sharp decline following the House Republicans' passage of a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits. Residential solar installers like Sunrun saw significant losses, as the bill ends tax credits for lease arrangements. Analysts describe the bill as a "worse than feared" scenario for clean energy, impacting the rooftop solar industry and sales of inverters. While manufacturing tax credits remain largely untouched, the bill's impact on demand for solar projects has led to widespread concern among investors.</p>

          <p>A recent pause on the steepest tariffs on Chinese goods has led importers to increase orders from Asia, but not enough to prevent potential retail shortages in the coming months, according to a CNBC Supply Chain Survey. While the tariff reduction has provided some relief, import taxes remain too high for some companies to complete full orders. Logistics executives anticipate lower inventory across retail sectors and in parts supply chains for American factories, resulting in fewer product selections and likely higher prices for consumers. Retailers are being cautious about discussing price increases.</p>

          <p>The spring housing market continues to face challenges due to high interest rates and low consumer confidence, with April home sales dropping to the slowest pace since 2009. Sales of previously owned homes fell 0.5% from March, and were down 2% from April of last year. Inventory jumped 9% month to month, leading to a slight cooling of prices, though the median price of an existing home sold in April was still the highest on record for that month. Rising cancellation rates indicate increasing caution among buyers.</p>

          <p>With gold prices at historic highs, seniors considering investing face a tricky decision. While gold offers portfolio protection and diversification, it doesn't generate income like dividends or interest. Experts advise that seniors should consider gold if their goal is to protect their portfolio rather than aggressively growing its value, and that a small allocation of 4% to 9% is typically appropriate. Alternatives like fractional gold investing and Gold ETFs can provide exposure without the high cost of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>
