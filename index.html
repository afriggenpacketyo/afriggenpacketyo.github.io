            <p>Nationwide protests against the Trump administration are shifting focus towards community support and action. The 50501 Movement is organizing a "day of action" with hundreds of local protests, teach-ins, and mutual aid efforts aimed at strengthening communities against perceived assaults on democracy. Resistance is being redefined to encompass community-focused events, such as food drives supporting those affected by wildfires and rising prices due to tariffs. The 50501 movement estimates that it will see close to 1,000 events nationwide this weekend.</p>

            <p>With egg prices remaining high, people are exploring alternative food items to color for Easter. Potatoes, marshmallows, onions, and peanut butter eggs are emerging as inventive substitutes for traditional eggs. Potatoes and onions can be dyed similarly to hard-boiled eggs using natural food dyes. Marshmallows offer a simple blank canvas for coloring and designing, while a viral recipe for peanut butter eggs provides a sweet and colorful alternative. This offers a more budget-friendly and creative way to celebrate the holiday.</p>

            <p>America's immigration policy should re-embrace international students, as they contribute to universities, businesses, and cultural exchange. Congress should pass free speech protections for visa holders and protect against abuses, such as indefinite imprisonment without trial. Improving worker pipelines, especially for skilled workers through the H-1B visa program, is also essential. This involves expanding the number of visas and easing work restrictions for spouses, ultimately balancing welcoming immigrants with border security.</p>

Nasal sprays, antihistamines, and nasal rinsing are effective treatments, but proper usage is crucial, including aiming nasal sprays towards the ear and avoiding snorting.</p>

Smaller chocolate businesses face an unstable environment, struggling to maintain consumer demand amid rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China is stepping into a weapons supply breach in parts of Africa’s Sahel as authorities in the region cut ties with former colonial power France and Russia struggles to replace its depleted stocks. Buyers include Burkina Faso, which took delivery of 116 infantry carriers and six assault vehicles from China in 2024 alone. This shift is driven by the need to diversify security partners and the decline of French influence, while Russia's arms supply has been slowed by the war in Ukraine.</p>

            <p>President Trump's campaign against undocumented immigrants embodies cruelty and persecution, contrasting with the Christian message of love and charity during Easter. Trump is attempting to deny birthright citizenship, rescind legal status for migrants, and place thousands on the Social Security Administration's list of dead people. The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongly deported to El Salvador, exemplifies this cruelty. These actions and policies are seen as a rejection of Christian values and a descent into tyranny.</p>

            <p>Manchester, England, was the world's first modern industrial city, inspiring the theories of Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx. Engels described the abysmal conditions of Manchester's urban working class in his 1845 book, The Condition of the Working Class in England. The city's rapid industrialization and wealth gap fueled resentment and demands for better conditions. Today, Manchester's People's History Museum showcases the global struggle for workers' rights, linking international workers' movements from the 19th century to the present day.</p>

His attorneys and wife have characterized Abrego Garcia as a responsible father and a caring family man whose life in America was abruptly shattered. The Trump administration claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the criminal gang MS-13. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote Thursday that, regardless, he is still entitled to due process.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ordered a pause in the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members being held under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The act, previously used only in wartime, allows the detention and deportation of citizens from 'enemy' nations without usual processes. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenged the deportations, arguing that the detainees were not given a chance to contest their case in court. The Supreme Court initially ruled that the law could be used but deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump has made mass deportations a priority, leading to controversial removals and a surge in immigration arrests. The administration is using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport immigrants identified as criminals, regardless of status. A legal dispute surrounds Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadorian citizen mistakenly deported, whom the government alleges is an MS-13 member. The Supreme Court ruled the Alien Enemies Act could be used with a court hearing, but the ACLU intervened, reporting migrants being deported without due process.</p>

            <p>The US bond market is experiencing unusual volatility, signaling investors' waning confidence in the economy due to trade tariffs. The rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs is leading investors to demand higher returns for buying government bonds, impacting borrowing rates for mortgages, credit cards, and car loans. Small businesses are particularly vulnerable to these changes, potentially halting economic growth and leading to job losses. (not investment advice)</p>
