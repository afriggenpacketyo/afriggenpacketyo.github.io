          <p>DoorDash CEO Tony Xu is aggressively pursuing acquisitions to consolidate the food delivery industry, recently acquiring Deliveroo and SevenRooms. Despite slim net profits more than four years after its IPO, DoorDash's stock has surged this year. Xu's strategy involves using cash and debt to expand DoorDash's global presence and product offerings. The company emphasizes a customer-first approach, with Xu himself actively involved in customer service and even taking advice from his daughter. DoorDash views acquisitions as opportunities to bring value to customers and empower local economies, though analysts caution about potential integration challenges.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity, ranking first in Europe for overweight and obese individuals, with experts attributing the trend to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. A large percentage of children primarily consume bread and pasta, leading to nutritional deficiencies, and the consumption of cheap, processed foods contributes to the problem. Toxic chemicals in food production, such as pesticides, also pose a risk. While the Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, critics argue that it stigmatizes overweight individuals and overlooks economic struggles, as healthy foods are often expensive and inaccessible for low-income households.</p>

The review is expected to conclude that the UK faces a new era of threat from Russia and other countries, including China. As part of the review, the government announced it would spend Â£1.5bn on new defence factories, creating 1,800 jobs across the UK, and support the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons.

Trump's trade policies and hostility towards China are seen as provocative, potentially pushing Xi Jinping to take action. The analyst suggests that Trump's policies are driven by self-interest and fear, leading Beijing to believe that the US would not defend Taiwan. Amid policy confusion and rising tensions, Taiwan remains a vulnerable target, and Xi may see an opportunity to assert China's regional hegemony.</p>

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Despite the potential impact on its medal prospects, Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the restriction due to increasing injuries among younger children. While World Skate mandated a minimum age of 12 for other international tournaments, Japanese organizers kept recent domestic competitions open to younger participants. The International Olympic Committee started tightening age restrictions to protect child athletes after a doping scandal at the 2022 Winter Games.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to the Penal Code, emphasizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons. Imprisonment is no longer divided into categories with and without labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory. The revised law aims to allocate more time for rehabilitative guidance and education to reduce recidivism. The new system includes 24 programs tailored to an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, such as curricula for elderly inmates and addiction recovery programs.</p>

          <p>Women in South Korea, who played a key role in the protests leading to the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk Yeol, say they feel invisible again as the country prepares to elect a new president. The two main candidates have been largely silent about equality for women, a polarising subject that helped Yoon into power in 2022. A third candidate, popular among young men for his anti-feminist stance, symbolises a new fight for many young South Korean women. These women worry that their voices are being erased and that little has improved despite their efforts.</p>
