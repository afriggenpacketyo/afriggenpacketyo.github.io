          <p>Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche plans to invest $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, creating over 12,000 jobs. This decision comes amid growing concerns about potential tariffs on pharma goods imposed by the White House. The investment will focus on R&D sites, including a new AI research center in Massachusetts, and expanding manufacturing facilities across multiple states. Additionally, Roche will build a new manufacturing center to support its next-generation weight loss medicines, with plans to export more medicines from the U.S. than it imports. </p>

          <p>A new ceasefire plan has been proposed by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to end the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza. The plan suggests a truce lasting five to seven years, the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, an end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. This proposal comes after a previous ceasefire collapsed, with both sides blaming each other. Hamas has signaled a willingness to hand over governance of Gaza to a Palestinian entity, though Netanyahu has ruled out any role for the PA in the future governance of Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump is currently engaged in a nine-front battle, targeting elite institutions he has long resented. These battles range from attacking top private universities like Harvard to suing media outlets like CBS and NBC. He is also clashing with the Federal Reserve, challenging court rulings, and investigating former aides. This approach is characterized by a willingness to use Truth Social as a weapon and pressure members of his own party to align with his agenda, marking a more aggressive and less restrained approach compared to his previous term. </p>

          <p>The introduction of ATMs in Tuvalu, a cash-based society, highlights the increasing encroachment of technology into areas that replace human interaction. The author argues that while technology offers convenience, it has led to a decline in human contact, resulting in a more miserable society. Automated checkouts, AI chatbots, and bank apps are cited as examples of this trend, potentially harming the mental health of younger generations and leaving elderly shoppers isolated. Some retailers are starting to address this by introducing slower checkouts for customers who prefer human interaction. </p>

          <p>The military regime in Burkina Faso claims to have thwarted a coup attempt, alleging that the plot was masterminded in neighboring Ivory Coast. The government states that the plan was to culminate in an assault on the presidency on April 16, 2025, by soldiers recruited by the nation's enemies. Interim President Ibrahim Traore has often accused Ivory Coast of harboring his opponents. Since taking power in 2022, the junta has increasingly cracked down on dissent, with kidnappings and extrajudicial arrests becoming more common. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department plans to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam.

The tariffs vary by company and country, with some Cambodian exporters facing the highest duties.

          <p>China's CATL, the world's largest supplier of EV batteries, has announced its second-generation Shenxing battery, claiming a new global record for superfast charging technology. The company states that the battery can add 520 km (323 miles) of driving range in just five minutes of charging time. This claim appears to surpass that of Chinese EV giant BYD, which previously claimed to add about 400 km in range in approximately 5 minutes. If proven feasible on a larger scale, this technology could alleviate consumer concerns about electric vehicle range and convenience.</p>

The settlement requires Walgreens to improve compliance with rules around dispensing controlled substances and maintain a compliance program.
