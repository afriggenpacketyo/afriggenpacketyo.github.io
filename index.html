          <p>Bryan Kohberger faced emotional victim impact statements during his sentencing for the murders of four University of Idaho students. Family members of the victims, including Kaylee Goncalves's sister and Madison Mogen's father, delivered powerful rebukes, calling Kohberger a "pathetic loser" and questioning him about the crime. The statements conveyed profound grief and anger, with one family member asserting that had the victims not been attacked in their sleep, they would have fiercely defended themselves. The courtroom was filled with raw emotion as the families shared their pain and memories.</p>

          <p>With a September 30 government funding deadline approaching, Democratic and Republican leaders are accusing each other of pushing the country toward a shutdown. Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, met to unify their strategy, arguing that Republicans are making a bipartisan process difficult by pushing partisan bills. Conversely, Republicans like Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson contend that Democrats are obstructing the process. The political maneuvering highlights the deep divisions in Congress as they struggle to pass the necessary appropriations bills and avoid a government closure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in the U.S. that will allow women and non-binary drivers and riders to preferentially match with each other. The feature, called "Women+ Connect," aims to increase comfort and safety on the platform by giving users more choice and control over their rides. The tool will be tested in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, following similar successful pilots in other countries. The initiative is Uber's latest effort to address longstanding safety concerns and sexual assault incidents that have been associated with ride-hailing services.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new action plan to ensure U.S. dominance in the global artificial intelligence race by removing regulatory hurdles for developers. The strategy involves eliminating rules related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and climate change that are seen as hindering innovation. The plan will also streamline permitting for data centers and semiconductor plants and use federal financing to promote American AI abroad. This approach contrasts with the Biden administration's focus on managing AI risks, with the Trump White House arguing for less regulation to foster growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A photo of President Trump's briefing card during his meeting with a Japanese delegation has revealed hand-written alterations to the details of the new trade agreement. The card showed a base tariff rate of 10%, which was different from the 15% rate announced by the President. Additionally, an investment figure was crossed out and changed from $400 billion to $500 billion, a number that was again different from the $550 billion Trump later announced. The discrepancies and last-minute edits have caused some confusion on Wall Street about the precise terms of the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a Marks & Spencer advertisement, ruling that it irresponsibly featured a model who appeared "unhealthily thin." The regulator cited the model's pose and clothing, including large pointed shoes that emphasized the slenderness of her legs, as contributing to the unhealthy portrayal. M&S defended its choice, stating the model was selected for her health and well-being and that the pose was meant to convey confidence, not slimness. The ASA has ordered the retailer not to use the ad again and to ensure future imagery avoids such portrayals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising interest rates and tighter lending standards, many homeowners are finding it harder to qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Financial experts advise that if an application is denied, the first step is to ask the lender for the specific reasons, which often relate to a high debt-to-income ratio, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score. To improve approval odds, homeowners should focus on reducing debt and boosting their credit score before reapplying. Experts also suggest exploring alternatives like fixed-rate home equity loans, cash-out refinances, or personal loans if a HELOC remains out of reach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two former traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor interest rate, have had their convictions quashed by the UK Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled that their trials were unfair due to misdirections to the jury, rendering the convictions "unsafe." The traders had long argued they were scapegoats for normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. This ruling represents a major vindication and could lead to other traders convicted in the UK also seeking to have their convictions overturned.</p>

This move is the latest in a series of retreats by Amazon from the Chinese market and reflects a wider trend of American corporations reducing their operational footprint in China due to aggressive tariff policies and Beijing's push for technological self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. fell by 2.7% in June, a drop attributed to persistently high mortgage rates that hovered around 7%. According to the National Association of Realtors, sales activity remains stuck at cyclical lows. Despite the slowdown in sales, the median home price hit a record high of $435,300, marking the 24th consecutive month of annual price increases. This price growth is driven by a chronic undersupply of housing, which continues to challenge first-time buyers and keep the market tilted in favor of sellers. (not investment advice)</p>
