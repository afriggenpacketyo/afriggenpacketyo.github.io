          <p>Recent armed clashes between India and Pakistan have turned into a testing ground for competing military technologies, notably Chinese hardware versus Western and Russian systems. Pakistan's military arsenal, bolstered by defense cooperation with China, features advanced air and missile systems, drones, and multirole fighters. This contrasts with India’s diversified mix of Russian, Western, and domestically adapted platforms. The significant price differential between Chinese and Western military systems may reshape global defense procurement, even if Chinese technology demonstrates slightly less capability at a much lower cost.</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's diagnosis of 'aggressive' prostate cancer, this article explains the disease's prognosis, signs, symptoms and treatment options. Prostate cancer cases have been on the rise in recent years, increasing 3% annually since 2014, and Biden is one of the more than 300,000 men to be diagnosed this year. Common treatment options include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiopharmaceutical treatments. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 55 to 69 years should have the option to undergo periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening to monitor for prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms and the discovery of a nodule on his prostate. The cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9, indicating a high-grade illness, but is reportedly hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options with his physicians, marking another chapter in the health challenges faced by the Biden family.</p>

          <p>Israel has announced it will allow a "basic amount of food" to enter Gaza after a 10-week blockade, citing the operational need to expand fighting against Hamas and to prevent a famine crisis. This decision comes as the Israeli military begins "extensive ground operations" throughout Gaza, issuing evacuation orders for several areas. Strikes have targeted sites including a hospital in northern Gaza, with the IDF aiming to free hostages and defeat Hamas. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas continue ceasefire talks in Qatar, but disagreements persist over the terms of hostage release and a permanent ceasefire.</p>

Despite diplomatic efforts, Russian assaults across the eastern front are increasing, setting the stage for large-scale offensive operations.

          <p>The Supreme Court appears uncertain about resolving Trump v CASA, a case that could redefine American citizenship and judicial power. At issue is the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, which has historically granted automatic citizenship to almost everyone born in America. Former President Trump issued an executive order claiming the clause was never meant to apply to children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa-holders. The court's decision could have significant implications for immigration policy and the rights of individuals born in the United States.</p>
