          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, is facing criticism for stating that he does not need to buy rice because he receives ample amounts from supporters, amid rising rice prices affecting households. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has urged Eto to retract the remarks but has allowed him to remain in his position. The government has been criticized for its delayed response to rising rice prices, which have roughly doubled due to a poor harvest.</p>
