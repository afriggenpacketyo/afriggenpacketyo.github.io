          <p>A 29-year-old man has been charged with 37 counts of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon after allegedly driving his car into a crowd outside a Hollywood nightclub. The incident occurred after the suspect was removed from the venue, leading him to intentionally target pedestrians on the sidewalk. Eight of the 37 victims sustained serious injuries, though officials noted it was a "miracle" no one was killed. The suspect, who has a history of violence, was also shot by a bystander during the chaos.</p>

          <p>The death of Phillip Reeder, a 53-year-old man who died during a police encounter in Alabama, has been officially ruled a homicide by the county coroner. The autopsy report cites restraint during an altercation and hypertensive heart disease associated with cocaine use as the causes of death. Reeder's family alleges that an officer kneeled on his neck while he pleaded that he couldn't breathe, drawing comparisons to the George Floyd case. The police department disputes this account, stating no knee was used on his neck and no excessive force was applied.</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company has announced it will raise prices on its candy products by a "low double-digit" percentage due to the unprecedented cost of cocoa. The price hike reflects a global cocoa shortage driven by unfavorable weather conditions and disease in major producing countries like Ghana and the Ivory Coast. In response, Hershey plans to focus more on products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of a broader strategy to become a "snacking powerhouse." The move aims to mitigate financial pressures from ingredient inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The author points to the firing of figures like Admiral Lisa Franchetti and the reassignment of Vice Admiral Yvette Davids from the Naval Academy as part of a concerning pattern. The piece argues these actions, championed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, reflect a desire to reverse progress on gender integration in the armed forces. It suggests the moves send a "chilling message" that women are not welcome in the military's highest ranks.</p>

          <p>A panel of federal judges in New Jersey has declined to permanently appoint Alina Habba, a personal lawyer to Donald Trump, as the state's U.S. Attorney, effectively ending her interim tenure. The decision followed opposition from New Jersey's Democratic senators, who criticized her for politicizing the office and pursuing "frivolous" prosecutions. The judges appointed career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace as her replacement, though the Justice Department under AG Pam Bondi quickly removed Grace in response. Habba's appointment had been controversial due to her lack of prosecutorial experience and her close ties to the president.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on profits from home sales, a move supporters claim would "unleash" the housing market. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in gains, a threshold unchanged since 1997. Proponents, like the National Association of Realtors, argue the current tax locks older homeowners into their properties, constraining housing inventory. Critics contend that eliminating the tax would primarily benefit wealthy homeowners and could further fuel housing affordability issues by attracting more investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following England's one-day international series defeat to India, legendary former bowler Katherine Sciver-Brunt has questioned the current team's mindset. She suggested that some players look "lazy" and timid on the field, noting a lack of the passionate, "front-footed" attitude she embodied during her career. Sciver-Brunt's comments point to issues with fielding and a potential fear of failure among the squad. In response, current captain Nat Sciver-Brunt (her wife) and coach Charlotte Edwards defended the team's commitment and professionalism, highlighting that outward appearances don't always reflect internal drive.</p>

          <p>John-Michael Hakeem Gibson, the Atlanta rapper known as Cash Out, has been sentenced to life in prison plus 70 years following his conviction on RICO, sex trafficking, and pimping charges. Prosecutors argued that Gibson, along with his mother and cousin who also received lengthy sentences, ran a "house of horrors" where they forced women into sex work. The artist, known for his 2014 platinum hit "Cashin' Out," was arrested in 2019. The prosecution used evidence from multiple phones to demonstrate the force and coercion involved in the criminal enterprise.</p>

The piece suggests that as Trump's usual methods of controlling the narrative fail, his online behavior has become more extreme and disconnected from reality. It frames the posts not as a sign of strength, but as a defensive lashing out from a president feeling powerless.</p>
