        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a significant restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC), reducing its staff and reassigning roles. This move comes weeks after Marco Rubio replaced Mike Waltz as national security adviser, with Andy Baker, Vice President JD Vance‚Äôs national security advisor, taking a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser. The downsizing aligns with President Trump's preference for a top-down approach to foreign policy decision-making, though some experts worry about the impact of fewer staff members on the NSC's ability to control the bureaucracy. The changes follow previous staff firings amid loyalty concerns.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Global Change Biology indicates that the prevalence of hummingbird feeders has influenced the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbird beaks in the western United States. The beaks have become longer and more slender, facilitating nectar consumption from feeders, and male beaks have grown pointier for fighting off competition. This adaptation has also enabled the hummingbirds to expand their range northward into cooler climates. Researchers analyzed museum specimens and newspaper archives to correlate feeder mentions with bird counts, demonstrating the rapid pace of evolution in response to human activities.</p>

          <p>Investigators are examining whether technical glitches at a San Diego airport and foggy conditions may have contributed to a fatal plane crash that killed all six people aboard. The airport experienced two separate issues: the Automated Surface Observing Station, which provides weather data to pilots, was inoperative due to a power surge, and one of the runways had an issue with its lighting system. The pilot of the downed plane was aiming for the runway with the lighting issue but did not report any problems to air control. The Cessna 550 struck high-tension power lines before crashing into a residential neighborhood, injuring eight people on the ground.</p>

The price of the meme coin plunged 16% hours after the dinner, which was attended by crypto influencers and industry executives. An attendee noted the food was subpar, and Trump made a brief appearance without engaging with most guests. The event has drawn criticism, particularly due to the presence of Justin Sun, who is facing SEC fraud charges.

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially due in the spring, with a spokesperson stating it will be released "later this year." The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures, including potentially scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a move advocated by some Labour MPs. While some criticize the delay, others suggest it allows for a more substantive strategy to be developed. The government has highlighted existing measures to address child poverty, such as expanding free breakfast clubs and increasing the national minimum wage.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour dates, including all scheduled concerts up to early July 2026, after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition, which affects hearing, vision, and balance, has been exacerbated by recent performances, according to the statement. Joel, 76, has been advised by his doctor to refrain from performing as he undergoes physical therapy. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds. NPH is a brain condition involving fluid buildup, treatable with surgery, and more likely to occur in older people.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. The decision comes after Harvard sued the administration, alleging the ban violated the First Amendment, Due Process Clause, and Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration claimed Harvard lost its ability to use the Student and Exchange Visitor Program due to non-compliance with requests for information on student visa holders. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, stated the university did respond to the Department's requests as required by law.</p>
