          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the Trump administration has finalized a trade deal, but its implementation is contingent on approval from the unnamed country's prime minister and parliament. Lutnick specified that these negotiations exclude China, which falls under the purview of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This announcement follows President Trump's tariff hikes a month prior, many of which were temporarily paused, except for those on China, which have significantly increased. The uncertainty surrounding these tariffs has contributed to market volatility and declining business and consumer confidence, although stocks have recently shown signs of recovery.</p>

          <p>NYU Langone Health faced scrutiny after airing a Super Bowl commercial featuring its doctors, prompting a North Carolina congressman to question the hospital's use of federal funds. Representative Greg Murphy initially sent a stern letter to NYU Langone's CEO, expressing concern over the cost of the advertisement. However, Murphy's stance shifted dramatically after a private jet, linked to the hospital's billionaire benefactor Kenneth G. Langone, landed in his hometown. Following a conversation with the hospital's CEO, Murphy praised NYU Langone's patient outcomes and metrics, leaving many puzzled by the sudden change of heart.</p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) is currently reviewing its transgender policy following protests and concerns over the inclusion of transgender women in women's football. The updated policy allows biological males to participate if they meet reduced testosterone levels and pass a match observation to assess safety and fair competition. A new process gives the FA discretion over eligibility, managed case-by-case. The FA says there are 20 transgender women registered to play amateur football in England, with none in the professional game, while a group of MPs has urged the FA to change its rules to protect women and girls in football.</p>

          <p>UPS is planning to eliminate 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting initiative linked to a reduction in package volume from Amazon, its largest customer. The layoffs will affect slightly over 4% of UPS's workforce. The company will also close 73 buildings by the end of June 2025, with potential for additional closures. UPS expects to save $3.5 billion this year through this consolidation plan. UPS said it chose to reduce package volume from Amazon to focus on revenue quality and increase domestic operating margin and profitability.</p>

Refinancing could be beneficial for homeowners with home equity loan rates above 8%, especially with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon.
