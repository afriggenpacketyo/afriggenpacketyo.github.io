            <h2>African Nations Brace for Potential End of AGOA Trade Deal Under Trump</h2>

            <p>With the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) set to expire in September 2025, African nations are assessing the potential impact of a non-renewal under a Trump administration. AGOA has provided duty-free access to the US market for over 1,800 products, boosting exports and jobs in participating countries. Economists warn that its discontinuation could lead to job losses, higher commodity prices, and increased business costs, urging African nations to strengthen intra-African trade through initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to mitigate potential economic fallout. Trump's previous imposition of tariffs on some AGOA member countries adds to the uncertainty surrounding the trade agreement's future.</p>

            <p>Amid escalating trade tensions, China has announced sanctions against US Congress members, officials, and NGO heads who have acted negatively on Hong Kong-related issues. This action follows the US imposing sanctions on Chinese officials in Hong Kong, which China views as interference in its internal affairs. The Chinese Foreign Ministry condemned the US sanctions as a violation of international law and norms, vowing reciprocal countermeasures for any further actions taken by the US regarding Hong Kong. This move signifies a further deterioration in US-China relations, adding another layer of complexity to the existing trade disputes.</p>

            <p>Following an attack by Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi on prison officers, the Prison Officers' Association (POA) is demanding the immediate provision of electric stun guns to staff in high-security UK jails. The POA emphasizes the need for tactical options beyond batons and incapacitant spray when facing life-threatening situations, advocating for specially trained staff to deploy tasers. This demand comes amid criticism that current protective equipment is inadequate and renewed calls for 'Supermax'-style rules for the most dangerous inmates. The Ministry of Justice has launched a full, independent review into the incident, which has sparked concerns among survivors and families of the Manchester Arena bombing victims.</p>

            <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for reportedly sharing sensitive details about a March attack on Yemen's Houthis in a second Signal group chat, this time including his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. This follows a previous incident where Hegseth shared operational information in a Signal chat that mistakenly included a journalist, leading to investigations into Trump's top security officials. The information shared reportedly included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets, raising concerns about potential security breaches and prompting criticism from Democrats who are calling for Hegseth's removal from office. The Pentagon dismisses the reports and accuses the media of targeting Trump's agenda.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines has been returned to Boeing's US production hub due to the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Trump's recent increase of tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% has made it financially unfeasible for Chinese airlines to take delivery of the jet, which has a market value of around $55 million. This incident underscores the growing trade tensions between the US and China and the potential disruption to global supply chains and aircraft deliveries. Beijing is reportedly considering ways to support airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs.</p>

China's first-quarter GDP rose 5.4% year on year, while retail sales and industrial output numbers for March also beat expectations. The PBOC's decision aligns with expectations and reflects a cautious approach to monetary policy amid external pressures and domestic economic resilience.

This warning comes after reports that the US plans to pressure nations to curb trade with China to avoid new tariffs. China's Commerce Ministry insists that appeasement will not bring peace and compromise will not be respected, emphasizing that any deal at the expense of China's interests will face reciprocal countermeasures. This development highlights the intensifying trade tensions between the US and China and the challenges countries face in balancing their relationships with both economic powers.</p>

Despite crackdowns, syndicates have shifted operations to more remote and vulnerable areas, exploiting jurisdictions with weak governance and high corruption rates.

            <p>Gatwick Airport has retained its position as the UK's worst airport for flight delays, with departures averaging more than 23 minutes behind schedule in 2024, attributed to ongoing air traffic control (ATC) disruption. Stansted and Manchester Airports followed with average delays of over 20 minutes. Belfast City Airport recorded the best punctuality. Gatwick cites ATC restrictions in Europe as a contributing factor and has implemented plans to improve on-time performance in 2025. Passengers affected by ATC issues are not entitled to compensation due to "extraordinary circumstances."</p>

This requires strong leadership from Germany, France, and Poland, and a willingness to create coalitions of willing states to achieve these objectives.
