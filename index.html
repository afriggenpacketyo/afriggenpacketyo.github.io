          <p>Executives from major corporations like Target, Goldman Sachs, and Pepsi have voiced concerns about the uncertainty caused by President Trump's shifting tariff policies. These companies have expressed worries about potential losses due to the lack of clarity and the impact on their hiring and investment plans. Experts suggest that this uncertainty could hinder economic momentum and potentially lead the U.S. into a downturn. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defends the administration's approach as "strategic uncertainty" to gain leverage in trade negotiations. (not investment advice) Optimism for the economy remains to be seen given the current trade environment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has sparked concern in Europe, especially within the European Union. The U.K. has been granted a temporary reprieve with a 25% tariff, while other European steel exporters face a 50% levy. The EU is considering countermeasures in response, stating the tariffs undermine ongoing trade deal negotiations with the U.S. Industry experts warn that the tariffs could harm the U.K.'s steel industry despite the temporary exemption.

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to fire the head of the National Portrait Gallery, citing partisan reasons and disagreement with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. However, the National Portrait Gallery is part of the Smithsonian Institution, which is independent of the federal government, creating a conflict of authority. The power to remove the director lies with the secretary of the Smithsonian, who is accountable to the institution's Board of Regents. This situation highlights the limits of presidential power and the independence of cultural institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A legal debate is unfolding regarding the legality of President Trump's tariffs, sparking a broader discussion about the separation of powers within the U.S. government. Two federal courts have ruled that Trump lacks the authority to impose the tariffs, but the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has paused enforcement of those decisions. The core issue is whether a 50-year-old statute, the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, grants the president the power to set tariffs. This legal battle is being compared to the "steel seizure" case of 1952, which established limits on presidential power even in emergencies.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed budget package proposes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit (CTC) that could exclude millions of children from receiving the benefit. The bill would require both parents to have Social Security numbers to claim the CTC, impacting children with mixed-status parents or undocumented parents. Critics argue that this policy would disproportionately affect children in immigrant families, denying them a tax credit that has been shown to reduce poverty. While the bill proposes increasing the CTC to $2,500 for three years, the restriction on eligibility raises concerns about equity and fairness.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to double steel and aluminum tariffs is causing concern among U.S. manufacturers who rely on these materials. While the tariffs are intended to protect domestic steel producers, they are likely to increase costs for companies that use steel, potentially leading to job losses and higher prices for consumers. Some manufacturers express worries about their ability to compete with global competitors who have access to cheaper steel. Economists warn that the tariffs could slow economic growth and negatively impact various industries, from auto parts to canned goods.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) projects that China's economic growth will slow to 4.3% next year due to ongoing trade disputes. The report cites "substantial barriers to trade" and "diminishing confidence" as factors putting downward pressure on global economic growth. The OECD expects Chinese exports to be negatively impacted by newly imposed tariffs, with imports also declining as production becomes more localized. The report suggests that private companies, including foreign ones, will be disproportionately affected by the tariffs.
