        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's has downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over rising government debt and a widening budget deficit. The agency criticized U.S. politicians for failing to address the country's fiscal challenges, anticipating continued large deficits due to increasing entitlement spending. While some investors expect a contained market impact, the downgrade may lead to higher yields on treasuries as investors demand greater compensation for risk. The White House has criticized the move, while some investors maintain that the U.S. dollar's status as the global reserve currency mitigates default risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the evolving role of college chaplains in meeting the spiritual needs of students, particularly as fewer young people identify with established religions. Chaplains are increasingly offering counseling, support for basic needs, and inclusive spiritual practices to foster a sense of belonging, meaning, and purpose. They address a range of student concerns, from faith and relationships to housing insecurity and mental health, while also collaborating with mental health professionals to provide comprehensive care. This adaptation reflects a broader trend of universities prioritizing student wellness and recognizing the importance of spiritual development.</p>

          <p>A new CDC study indicates a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, attributed to the widespread availability of vaccines during pregnancy and monoclonal antibody treatments. Hospitalizations decreased by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a drop of up to 71%. Emergency physicians have also observed that young children requiring emergency care for RSV often need lower levels of intervention. The study suggests that these preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young infants from severe illness.</p>

          <p>This Atlantic article discusses how Donald Trump's actions reflect a disregard for the anti-corruption principles that the Founding Fathers sought to enshrine in the Constitution. The article argues that Trump's ventures, such as accepting gifts from foreign states and profiting from his position, are examples of what the Founders feared: a president profiting from public office. The author contends that the emoluments clauses of the Constitution, which aim to restrict conflicts of interest, are being undermined by Trump's behavior and the lack of effective congressional oversight.</p>
