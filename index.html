          <p>A United Nations Development Programme report indicates that global development progress slowed in 2024, reversing gains made after the COVID-19 pandemic. The report notes stalled life expectancy and income growth, along with rising conflicts, as contributing factors. UNDP chief Achim Steiner warned that aid reductions, particularly by the United States under President Donald Trump, would worsen the situation. The report also addresses artificial intelligence, cautioning that unequal access could deepen existing divides between wealthier and poorer nations. The Human Development Index ranked Iceland and Norway at the top, with Germany and Sweden in fifth place.</p>

While prices have increased, experts suggest Temu and Shein can still offer competitive prices due to agile supply chains and the ability to operate on thin margins.

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge after the fashion retailer reported a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales and reaffirmed its full-year guidance. While revenues fell by 2% due to weak demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, the results exceeded analysts' forecasts. The company is closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and global trade tensions, which CEO Daniel Grieder noted had already impacted first-quarter demand. Despite the uncertainty, Hugo Boss maintained its outlook for full-year sales to be in line with last year's figures.</p>

          <p>Jon Voight has reportedly provided President Donald Trump with a roadmap to aid the Hollywood film industry, focusing on federal tax incentives, tax code changes, and co-production treaties. This follows Trump's announcement of a potential 100% tariff on foreign-made films, citing a "National Security threat." The proposal aims to boost film production in the U.S. and address job losses due to productions moving overseas. While the White House has downplayed the severity of the tariffs, the administration is exploring various options to safeguard the country's national and economic security while making Hollywood great again.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit from GOP-led states that aims to restrict telehealth access to the abortion medication mifepristone. Justice Department attorneys argue that the states lack legal standing to sue. The lawsuit challenges the FDA's actions in 2016, when it first loosened restrictions on mifepristone, claiming it undermines state abortion laws. The case is being considered by a Trump-appointed judge in Texas who previously ruled in favor of halting approval for the drug.</p>
