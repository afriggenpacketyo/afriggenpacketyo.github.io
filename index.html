          <p>The European Commission has proposed a seven-year budget of €2 trillion, which includes a significant fivefold increase in defense and space funding to €131 billion. This proposal, part of a new European Competitiveness Fund, aims to bolster investment and address current geopolitical realities. The budget also allocates approximately 35% to climate and biodiversity initiatives. The plan must still gain approval from the European Parliament and member states, where it may undergo further modifications before being finalized.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 11:08:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump reportedly asked a group of House Republicans if he should fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with those present indicating approval. The legality of such a move is untested, as federal law permits removal only "for cause," and it could trigger significant financial market instability. Trump has publicly expressed extreme dissatisfaction with Powell's handling of interest rates, which he believes are not being cut quickly enough. This development escalates the pressure on the Federal Reserve's traditional independence from political influence.</p>

          <p>A major review has concluded that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism program missed a significant opportunity to intervene with Axel Rudakubana, who later murdered three children in Southport. Teachers had referred him three times due to his obsession with violence, but his case was closed each time because he lacked a clear terrorist ideology. The review, led by Lord David Anderson KC, recommends that the program must focus on individuals fascinated with extreme violence, even without an identifiable ideological motive, to prevent future attacks.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has launched an investigation into Mars, the manufacturer of M&Ms and Skittles, for alleged deceptive practices regarding its use of artificial food dyes. The investigation asserts that the company has not fulfilled its 2016 pledge to remove these dyes from its U.S. products, even though it has done so in Europe. Paxton's office claims these dyes are linked to negative health outcomes and that Mars falsely represented them as safe, constituting a violation of Texas consumer protection laws.</p>

          <p>The U.S. decision to ease export restrictions on certain advanced AI chips from companies like Nvidia and AMD is being viewed by experts as a positive signal for bilateral trade relations with China. This move allows for the review of license applications to resume sales of specific chips to the Chinese market. Analysts suggest this development represents a significant win for Beijing and indicates that high-level negotiations are steering the complex relationship in a more constructive direction, potentially resetting the tone of the ongoing tech and trade standoff.</p>

The government has warned Khan's two sons, who live in the UK, that they will be "dealt with accordingly" if they travel to Pakistan and break the law by participating. Khan's ex-wife, Jemima Goldsmith, accused the government of a "personal vendetta" and threatening to arrest the sons if they visit. The situation highlights the deep political divisions and potential for unrest in the country.</p>

          <h2>UK Review Recommends Renaming Physician Associates to 'Physician Assistants' for Clarity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) be renamed "physician assistants" to avoid confusing patients and more accurately reflect their supportive role. The review, prompted by safety concerns after the deaths of patients treated by PAs, also suggests they wear standardized clothing and see new patients only in limited circumstances. The government has accepted all recommendations, aiming to provide clarity on qualifications and roles, though the union representing PAs has warned the changes could lengthen patient waiting lists.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Brookings Institution has identified California's major metropolitan areas as leaders in readiness for artificial intelligence. The San Francisco and San José regions were dubbed "superstars," placing them in a class of their own due to their concentration of tech headquarters, research labs, and venture capital. The Los Angeles metro area was also ranked in the top tier of "star hubs." The analysis highlights California's dominant position in the AI economy, even as other tech centers across the country emerge.</p>
