          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered an 11-4 defeat against the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series, leading to discussions about whether a week-long layoff affected their performance. Pitchers, including Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan, struggled after an extended break, with some suggesting that being 'too fresh' can impact velocity and movement. Manager Dave Roberts dismissed the layoff as a factor, but historical data shows teams sweeping their LCS often lose the World Series. This article explores the team's perspective on their readiness and the challenges of re-entering a demanding routine.</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei is confronting significant political challenges as the country prepares for parliamentary elections. Despite a massive drop in inflation, his radical austerity policies have led to widespread economic hardship for the middle and lower classes, with many businesses closing. A former party member, Marcela Pagano, criticized Milei for ignoring vulnerable groups and protecting alleged corruption. The article notes that Milei's popularity has waned, and the upcoming vote is predicted to be a close race against the resurgent Peronists, potentially influenced by recent corruption scandals.</p>
