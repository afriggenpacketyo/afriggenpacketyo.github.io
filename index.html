          <p>Mumbai, India's entertainment hub, is experiencing increasing restrictions on free speech, with artists and comedians facing attacks and censorship. A recent incident involved a comedian being targeted for political satire, leading to venue closures and police questioning. The release of a film was also delayed due to objections from certain groups. Critics argue that these attacks have become state-sponsored since the ruling BJP came to power, impacting India's standing in free speech indices. Lawyers are now offering affordable legal services to independent creators due to the rising legal risks.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are causing concern among retailers as they plan for upcoming holiday sales events like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday. Small businesses are reviewing inventories and discount plans due to the tariff economics, potentially leading to less product availability and fewer discounts for consumers. Some companies have already halted production and are raising prices, while retailers are trying to mitigate the impact by sharing the tariff burden. The next 30 days are critical for trade deals to alleviate the tariff pressures and ensure sufficient inventory for the holiday season.</p>

          <p>The FTSE 100 in London is on track for record-breaking gains, driven by the UK's perceived safe-haven status amid global market volatility caused by U.S. tariffs. The index has risen significantly, attracting investors seeking refuge in defensive stocks with high dividend yields. Analysts suggest that the FTSE 100's upward momentum could continue if defensive stocks remain favored and the Bank of England cuts interest rates. However, geopolitical tensions and a stronger pound could pose risks to further gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron plans to slow the pace of its share buybacks due to declining crude prices, which have been impacted by Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ production plans. The oil major will repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its own stock in the second quarter, lower than the $3.9 billion in the first quarter, but is maintaining its overall repurchase guidance for the year. The company's net income declined more than 30% year-over-year, but adjusted earnings per share met Wall Street estimates.</p>

          <p>Trade tensions between the United States and China continue as both countries disagree on whether negotiations are even taking place. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with its own tariffs and export restrictions.

The standoff centers on the U.S. demand for a ‚Äúfair deal‚Äù and China‚Äôs insistence on the removal of aggressive trade measures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that his administration will revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, citing it's what they deserve. The decision escalates his previous threats against the Ivy League school and potentially expands an ongoing legal battle. Trump has sought to extract concessions from the institutions by threatening to withhold federal research grants unless the schools make massive changes, many of which give the administration more oversight of its operations. The college filed a lawsuit soon after, calling the government's flex of power "unprecedented and improper."</p>
