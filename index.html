        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has criticized Reuters for what it deems a sympathetic portrayal of suspected Tren de Aragua gang members who signaled for help at a Texas detention center. DHS asserts that the previous administration was responsible for releasing these gang members into American communities. The article details the background of Tren de Aragua, a violent international criminal group with ties to Venezuelan dictator NicolÃ¡s Maduro. The article identifies two confirmed members of the gang and their immigration history, contrasting Reuters' depiction of them as desperate individuals fearing deportation.</p>

          <p>Cambodia continues to grapple with the deadly legacy of landmines from past conflicts, particularly the Vietnam War era, with millions of unexploded ordnance still scattered across the countryside.

The article recounts the story of Poy, a victim who lost his arm and eyesight due to a landmine explosion as a child, highlighting the devastating impact these explosives have on individuals and communities.

          <p>Santa Cruz, California, has implemented a new soda tax of 2 cents per ounce on sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban on such taxes. The tax applies to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and a certain calorie count. This move positions Santa Cruz as the first city to introduce a new soda tax since the ban was enacted in 2018. Proponents of the tax framed it as a stand against the American Beverage Association, while opponents argue it burdens working families already facing high prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to ending the war in Ukraine has seen a shift in focus from Ukrainian President Zelensky to Russian President Putin, according to this article. Initially skeptical of U.S. support for Ukraine, Trump accelerated diplomacy with Putin, even drafting a peace plan that offered major concessions to Moscow. However, recent developments, including an economic deal with Ukraine and a friendly meeting between Trump and Zelensky, suggest a change in the administration's approach. Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Putin's demands in negotiations, potentially leading to a more challenging stance towards the Russian leader.</p>

          <p>Richard Gerald Jordan, Mississippi's longest-serving death row inmate, is scheduled to be executed on June 25 after being sentenced to death in 1976 for kidnapping and killing a woman. Jordan, 78, has filed multiple appeals, with the most recent being denied in October. The Mississippi Supreme Court ruling comes on the same day another execution was scheduled in Florida. Mississippi law allows death sentences to be carried out using lethal injection, nitrogen gas, electrocution, or firing squad.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border unlawfully has remained at historically low levels in April, following three months of President Trump's immigration crackdown. Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions, a slight increase from March but still among the lowest tallies in decades. The Trump administration attributes the decline to its policies, including restricting asylum, deploying troops to the border, and dismantling Biden-era programs. Democrats have criticized these policies as inhumane, while some analysts suggest they contribute to migrants rethinking their plans to cross the border.</p>

These Chinese online retail giants have relied on the "de minimis" exemption to ship low-value items directly to the US without duties or import taxes. Trump's executive order said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids, as many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages.</p>
