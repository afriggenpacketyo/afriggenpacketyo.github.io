          <p>President Trump concluded his three-nation Middle East tour, marked by opulent receptions and significant business deals with Gulf states. A notable development was Trump's engagement with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing previous U.S. policy. The trip also saw announcements of multibillion-dollar agreements for U.S. companies, although details remained sparse. Trump also addressed nuclear negotiations with Iran, suggesting a willingness to abandon maximalist positions, and made an unusual reference to the suffering in Gaza, signaling a potential shift in his approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday due to pay raise disputes, leading to a complete shutdown of NJ Transit rail service and Metro-North's west of Hudson service. The strike is expected to severely affect over 300,000 daily commuters, prompting NJ Transit to suggest remote work and Governor Phil Murphy to consider all options, including a state of emergency. The agency has implemented a contingency plan with enhanced bus service on 19 routes, but this can only accommodate a fraction of the daily train riders. Commuters are advised to explore alternative options like Amtrak, PATH, SEPTA, light rail, or ferry service.</p>

          <p>With economic uncertainty affecting seniors and retirees, annuities can provide guaranteed monthly payouts in exchange for a lump-sum investment. A $50,000 annuity's monthly payments vary based on age, gender, and contract structure, but can supplement Social Security and other income. Depending on factors such as age, an annuity could yield from about $285 to $425 a month. This can help alleviate financial anxieties and provide a buffer against longevity risk, though it lacks the flexibility of other investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Mexican government is opposing a provision in President Trump's tax bill that would impose a 5% excise tax on remittances sent by non-U.S. citizens to their home countries. Mexican officials argue that the tax would disproportionately affect low-income migrants and could drive them to use unregulated channels, complicating financial oversight. They also contend that the tax amounts to double taxation, as migrants already pay taxes in the U.S. The provisions in the bill have become an international flashpoint.</p>

The bill, which extends tax cuts while increasing military and border security spending, is being challenged for not cutting enough federal spending and for limiting the state and local tax (SALT) deduction.

          <p>The U.S. is seeing a surge in early Social Security claims, with an additional 276,000 people filing this fiscal year, a 13% increase from last year. Program experts attribute this rise to anxiety surrounding the Trump administration's changes to the Social Security Administration and broader economic uncertainty. This has led some retirees to claim benefits earlier than planned, despite the potential for reduced lifetime payments. The trend underscores the impact of policy changes and economic fears on individuals' retirement decisions.</p>

However, acting quickly is important as rates are likely to decline. While such a CD is not necessarily a high-yield investment, it is a reasonably safe and stable one. (not investment advice)</p>
