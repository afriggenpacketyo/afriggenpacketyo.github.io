          <h2>President Trump Issues New Shortened Deadline for Russia-Ukraine Peace Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 09:19:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced a significantly shortened ultimatum, giving Russia just 10 to 12 days to agree to a peace deal with Ukraine or face severe secondary tariffs on its trade partners. This new deadline, reduced from his initial 50-day window, reflects Trump's growing disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin's continued military actions despite previous discussions. Trump cited instances of renewed aggression, such as rocket launches into Kyiv resulting in civilian casualties, as a basis for his frustration and the urgent need for progress. The intensified pressure seeks to compel Moscow towards a swift resolution and de-escalation of the ongoing conflict, highlighting the administration's impatience with the lack of diplomatic headway.</p>

          <p>Renowned investor Mark Cuban shared insights from his first business venture, a powdered milk sales operation launched at age 24 with less than $20, which failed within a month. Despite the setback, Cuban learned a crucial lesson: success requires only being right once, regardless of prior failures. He advises aspiring entrepreneurs lacking capital to prioritize "sweat equity" by offering services that align with their skills and market demand. Cuban also highlighted artificial intelligence as a key area, suggesting one could learn prompt engineering with free AI chatbots and then teach small businesses to enhance profitability. This approach emphasizes resourcefulness and adaptability in starting a venture.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 09:11:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has set a cautious tone for the ongoing third round of trade talks with China in Sweden, indicating that no "enormous breakthrough" is expected. Greer views China's participation as a positive sign, but stated the primary focus would be on monitoring and implementing existing agreements. A key point of discussion is the potential extension of the current 90-day tariff pause, which is set to expire on August 12. Despite the measured expectations, Greer affirmed the U.S. desire to move forward constructively, reiterating President Trump's willingness to maintain tariffs if favorable deals are not achieved.</p>

While current interest rates are higher than in previous years, the article advises that borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable options, particularly if the Federal Reserve's rate hikes stabilize. Key strategies include improving credit scores, comparing offers from multiple lenders, and carefully assessing loan terms and fees to optimize long-term costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have reached an agreement for an "immediate and unconditional" ceasefire, effective midnight July 28, aimed at ending the deadly border clashes that have claimed at least 35 lives and displaced over 260,000 people. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim facilitated the crucial talks, with both Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai expressing commitment to de-escalation and peace. The resolution was significantly influenced by direct pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who had warned of potential repercussions on trade deals if the conflict persisted.

          <p>Chinese startup Z.ai (formerly Zhipu) has launched its new GLM-4.5 AI model, claiming it is even cheaper to use than DeepSeek and built on innovative "agentic" AI principles. This means the model automatically breaks down complex tasks into sub-tasks for improved accuracy. The open-source model is half the size of DeepSeek's and requires only eight Nvidia H20 chips, customized for China's export controls. Z.ai aims to challenge U.S. AI leaders like OpenAI by offering cost-effective and efficient solutions, demonstrating continued progress in China's AI sector despite U.S. restrictions. The company, backed by major investors, is reportedly planning an IPO.</p>

          <p>Robert Reich's opinion piece critically examines the challenge of maintaining moral lives in a contemporary world characterized by the unconstrained power of "bullies." He illustrates this pervasive issue with examples spanning international conflicts, such as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, to domestic concerns like harsh immigration policies, widening economic disparities, and the proliferation of social bigotry. Reich contends that these abuses erode societal norms and can ultimately foster violence and tyranny. He advocates for a collective, organized "moral resistance" to ensure accountability for the powerful, safeguard vulnerable populations, and uphold fundamental principles of justice and civility, asserting this struggle transcends partisan divides.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) are aiming to leverage newfound momentum following the failure of unprecedented recall votes targeting KMT lawmakers. Despite accusations of obstructing key legislation and compromising national security, none of the 24 KMT legislators facing recall lost their seats. This outcome is widely interpreted as a significant political setback for President William Lai Ching-te and a pivotal moment for the informal "Blue-White alliance" between the two opposition parties. Analysts suggest that the failed recalls have not only re-energized the opposition but also deepened their coordination, providing a substantial boost as they look towards the 2026 local government elections and the 2028 presidential race.</p>

While one provider reported an astounding 1,800% increase in UK daily sign-ups, cybersecurity experts caution that many free VPN services, which currently populate the top download charts, pose substantial security and privacy risks, including potential data harvesting.

          <p>UnitedHealth Group is under intense investor pressure as its stock price has significantly declined following a sharp plunge in profits from its flagship Medicare program and Optum Health physician practices. This financial downturn prompted the abrupt resignation of its former CEO, leading to the reinstatement of ex-CEO Stephen Hemsley, who is now tasked with restoring investor confidence and providing updated 2025 earnings guidance. Compounding these challenges, the company is also facing criminal and civil Department of Justice investigations into its Medicare billing practices, particularly concerning new reimbursement standards. Analysts suggest that while the DOJ probes are serious, a settlement is more likely than a complete removal from Medicare, indicating ongoing regulatory challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

While emotional attunement isn't inherently negative, constant hurt feelings can disrupt healthy relationships. The article provides practical strategies for managing this, including challenging worst-case assumptions, evaluating the long-term significance of perceived offenses, and communicating feelings assertively.
