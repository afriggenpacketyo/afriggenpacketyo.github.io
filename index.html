          <p>A group of Quakers is marching over 300 miles from New York City to Washington, D.C., to protest the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants. The march is rooted in a long history of Quaker activism, advocating for peace, justice, and religious freedom. The protesters seek to show solidarity with migrants targeted by the administration, carrying a copy of the Flushing Remonstrance, a 17th-century document calling for religious freedom, as a reminder to uphold the principle that all are welcome. The marchers believe that the administration is acting in bad faith with the spirit of pluralism and respect for human dignity.</p>

          <p>Koyo Kouoh, a leading figure in the art world and a champion for African creatives, has died at the age of 57. Kouoh was slated to be the first African woman to lead the Venice Biennale next year and directed one of Africa's largest contemporary art museums. Throughout her career, she expressed a disinterest in profit and rather a dedication to helping migrant women as a social worker before immersing herself in the art world. She challenged the idea that death would bring an end to her endeavors, believing in parallel lives and realities.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The government aims to encourage firms to hire British nationals or extend visas for overseas workers already in the country. This initiative is expected to reduce lower-skilled visas by up to 50,000 over the next year. The government will also introduce new training commitments to help unemployed individuals re-enter the UK labor market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the United States and China have made "great progress" in high-level trade discussions held in Geneva. These talks, the first face-to-face meeting between senior officials since the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods, aimed to de-escalate trade tensions. The discussions covered numerous issues in a constructive manner, according to Trump. The United States has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed reservations about cutting the consumption tax to combat inflation, citing concerns over reduced state revenue. Senior officials in his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have also been hesitant about a consumption tax cut, as the government prepares an economic package before the House of Councillors election this summer. The consumption tax is currently at 8 percent for food and beverages and 10 percent for other items.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump continues to criticize the US media, but some news organizations have appeared to bend to his will, with billionaire owners interfering to avoid upsetting Trump. Examples include Jeff Bezos ordering an overhaul to the Washington Post's editorial pages and the Los Angeles Times dropping its endorsement of Kamala Harris. The article suggests that economic interests are driving some media owners to appease Trump.</p>

By building family life around friends, they get the support of an extended family but through chosen connections. The friends share child-care responsibilities and create a close-knit environment for their children to grow up in, which promotes a sense of community and support.</p>
