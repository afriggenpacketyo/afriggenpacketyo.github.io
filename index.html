            <p>A shooting at Florida State University near the Student Union resulted in at least six injuries, with one person in critical condition. Law enforcement responded to the scene, and a suspect is now in custody, though the search for additional shooters continues. Students were initially advised to shelter in place, and the incident prompted a large police presence and campus evacuation. President Trump has been briefed on the situation, and investigations are underway by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the FBI to determine the full extent of the violence.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports could significantly impact the cost and availability of everyday electronics in the U.S. Items like toasters, hair curlers, and alarm clocks, which are almost entirely imported from China, may face shortages and price hikes. While some electronics like smartphones have exemptions, new tariffs targeting products with semiconductors could further complicate the situation. The existing manufacturing ecosystem in China makes it difficult to shift production elsewhere, potentially leading to inflation and fewer consumer choices.</p>

            <p>A large blind taste test conducted by NECTAR found that while animal meat generally received higher scores, some plant-based meat products were rated equal to or better than their animal counterparts. Impossible Foods' unbreaded chicken fillet performed particularly well. Behavioral scientists suggest that preconceived expectations and social norms influence how people perceive food, potentially explaining why plant-based meat is not more popular despite taste parity. The study highlights the need for plant-based meat companies to improve product quality and address cultural barriers to wider adoption.</p>

            <p>A woman identified her missing husband's belongings at a suspected Mexican drug cartel training camp, raising fears of forced recruitment. The discovery of remains at the ranch in Jalisco highlights the cartels' tactics. The Jalisco New Generation Cartel allegedly lured recruits with fake job ads, training them at the Izaguirre Ranch. Disappearances have surged in Mexico since the war on drug trafficking began in 2006.</p>

            <p>Intel could experience significant revenue pressure in China due to Beijing's new tariff measures targeting U.S.-made goods. China accounted for 29% of Intel's revenue in 2024, making the company particularly vulnerable. Tariffs of up to 125% are being imposed on U.S. products, but chips manufactured in Taiwan are being exempted. This could accelerate Intel's market share loss in China, as its chips produced in U.S.-based fabs are subject to higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Growth was primarily driven by millennial and Gen Z cardholders, while Gen X and Baby Boomer cardholders showed more caution. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An essay compares American and French literature focusing on working lives, noting a contrast in perspectives. American novels often satirize white-collar office jobs, while French literature frequently portrays blue-collar labor from working-class perspectives. Claire Baglin's "On the Clock" is highlighted as a recent example, detailing the realities of fast-food work. The essay suggests that cultural differences, such as the American emphasis on rugged individualism, may contribute to these varying approaches.</p>
