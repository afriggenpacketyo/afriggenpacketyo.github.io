          <p>A popular tourist funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, derailed and crashed, resulting in 15 deaths and 18 injuries, with five individuals in serious condition. The incident, involving the historic Elevador da Glória streetcar, is being treated as an accident and is considered the worst in the city's recent memory. Authorities have not yet determined the cause of the crash, which saw the streetcar careen down a steep hill, but the operating company stated that scheduled maintenance had been performed. The city has declared three days of mourning for the victims.</p>

This call for his removal comes amid significant turmoil within the agency, including high-profile resignations and layoffs.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grant funding for Harvard University was illegal. The court found that the administration's action was retaliatory, stemming from the university's refusal to comply with demands that violated First Amendment rights, such as altering its diversity programs. Judge Allison Burroughs stated the administration's sudden focus on antisemitism as a pretext for the freeze was arbitrary and pretextual, as most of the conditions imposed were related to ideological and pedagogical concerns. The ruling immediately vacates the funding freeze.</p>

          <p>Houston Astros pitcher Framber Valdez faced accusations of intentionally throwing a pitch at his own catcher, Cesar Salazar, during a game against the New York Yankees. The incident occurred immediately after Valdez gave up a grand slam to Trent Grisham, which followed a moment of apparent miscommunication between the pitcher and catcher. Valdez later denied any intent, attributing the 93-mph pitch that struck Salazar's chest protector to a "crossed up" signal and stating he apologized. Salazar supported this explanation, claiming he had pressed the wrong button for the pitch call.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. military strike that killed 11 people on a speedboat in the Caribbean, top officials have affirmed that such operations will continue. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that destroying cartel vessels is a more effective deterrent than previous interdiction efforts. The targeted boat was allegedly affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist group. President Trump defended the lethal action as a necessary message to drug smugglers, while Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth confirmed that military operations against narco-terrorists will persist.</p>

Experts note a growing financial gulf between the Premier League and other European leagues, as well as within the league itself. A concerning trend is the sale of homegrown academy players by mid-tier clubs to meet PSR requirements, as these sales count as pure profit. This dynamic is seen as polarizing the league and potentially weakening the connection between clubs and their local communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reform UK's national leader, Nigel Farage, has stated he will speak with Mick Barton, the leader of the Reform-run Nottinghamshire County Council, about a decision to ban contact with a local newspaper. The ban was initiated after a disagreement over a story the Nottingham Post published regarding local government reorganization. The move, which included journalists funded by the BBC's Local Democracy Reporting Service, has been criticized as an attack on press freedom and scrutiny. Farage, positioning himself as a "peacemaker," suggested he would seek a solution to the dispute at the upcoming party conference.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department has issued a preliminary list of 68 jobs that will qualify for President Trump's "no tax on tips" deduction, which is set to be in effect from 2025 through 2028. The provision, part of a larger tax bill, allows eligible workers in industries like hospitality and personal services to deduct up to $25,000 in tip income annually. The list is expected to be finalized after a public comment period. The deduction is designed to reduce taxable income for many service workers, though it does not affect state taxes or payroll levies for Social Security and Medicare. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A painting stolen by the Nazis 80 years ago has been recovered by authorities in Argentina after it was discovered in a surprising way. The artwork, a portrait by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was spotted hanging on a wall in a photograph for an online real estate listing in the city of Mar del Plata. The home belonged to the daughter of a former high-ranking Nazi official who moved to Argentina after World War II. After an initial raid failed to locate the painting, authorities placed the occupants under house arrest, leading to the eventual recovery of the long-lost piece.</p>

          <p>Speaking publicly for the first time since his car crash, Rudy Giuliani revealed a surprising twist about the events preceding the collision. Giuliani and his spokesperson said they pulled over on a New Hampshire interstate to help a woman they believed was a domestic violence victim, but police later indicated to them that she was actually the assailant and a man was the victim. Shortly after leaving this scene, their vehicle was struck from behind by another car, leaving the 81-year-old Giuliani with fractured vertebrae. The investigation into the crash is ongoing, and police do not believe the driver was connected to the domestic incident.</p>

          <p>A new cryptocurrency venture co-founded by President Trump and his sons, World Liberty Financial, has launched its token for public trading, creating a new avenue for potential conflicts of interest. The launch resulted in a paper windfall of approximately $5 billion for the Trump family, highlighting the extent to which the presidency is intertwined with their personal business interests. Ethics experts and critics argue that the publicly traded token, "$WLFI," could allow individuals or even foreign actors to curry favor by directly contributing to the president's wealth. The White House has consistently denied any conflicts of interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk anticipates receiving U.S. approval for its daily obesity pill by the end of this year, with a planned market launch in early 2026. The drug is an oral version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in its highly successful injectable weight-loss drugs, Wegovy and Ozempic. In trials, the pill demonstrated significant weight loss of up to 16.6%, comparable to the injectable version, which could give it an edge over competitors. The development of an effective pill is seen as a major step in making obesity treatments more accessible and potentially more affordable for a wider patient population.</p>

          <p>Newsmax has sued Fox News, accusing the dominant conservative media outlet of engaging in anticompetitive behavior to maintain a monopoly in the right-leaning news market. The lawsuit alleges that Fox uses its market power to coerce pay-TV distributors into restrictive agreements that marginalize or exclude competitors like Newsmax. According to the complaint, these tactics include imposing financial penalties and leveraging its high carriage fees to suppress rivals. Fox News dismissed the lawsuit as an excuse for Newsmax's own "competitive failures," setting the stage for a major legal battle between the two conservative media companies.</p>

Mullaney died in June 1944 when his ship, the USS Glennon, struck a mine off the coast of France two days after D-Day and subsequently sank under German artillery fire. His remains were recovered from the wreckage by salvagers in 1957 but could not be identified at the time and were interred in Belgium as an unknown. Modern forensic techniques, including DNA analysis, finally confirmed his identity, allowing for his return home to Pennsylvania for burial.</p>

The projected average spend per person is $1,552, covering gifts, travel, and entertainment, as shoppers feel the pressure from inflation and economic uncertainty. Gen Z is expected to reduce their budgets the most, by 23%, reflecting challenges in the job market and rising costs.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties. The court found that the current situation does not legally constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," which is the required condition for invoking the wartime statute. The administration had argued that mass illegal migration encouraged by another country met this standard, an argument the court rejected. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, blocking the use of this specific law for these deportations, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy.</p>
