          <p>Satellite imagery reveals that Russia is expanding its military infrastructure near the Finnish border, a new NATO member, including building new warehouses, renovating fighter jet shelters, and developing a helicopter base. While Finnish officials do not perceive an immediate threat, they anticipate a significant increase in Russian troop levels in the coming years, particularly if the Ukraine war de-escalates. This buildup reflects Moscow's concerns about NATO expansion and its strategic interest in the Arctic region. The New York Times article emphasizes that these moves are viewed as a long-term expansion rather than an imminent threat.</p>

          <p>Tyrese Haliburton, an NBA star, shared his struggles with anxiety and self-doubt after an injury and poor performance, revealing the pressures athletes face. A study of Bundesliga players found that many experience depression and anxiety, especially during the season's demanding periods. Female players reported higher depression scores than male players, possibly due to lower levels of professionalism and support in women's football. The article emphasizes that mental health disorders affect athletes at rates comparable to the general population, and team sports may have a preventive effect.</p>

          <p>An Iraqi couple is set to face trial in Germany, accused of being members of the "Islamic State" militant group and enslaving two Yazidi girls. The couple allegedly purchased a 5-year-old girl as a dowry for the wife and later acquired a 12-year-old girl, both of whom endured forced labor, sexual assault, humiliation, and torture. German prosecutors argue that the couple's actions were part of IS's systematic sexual assault of Yazidi women and girls, designed to dismantle the group's continuity and identity.
