        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has kept its one-year and five-year loan prime rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. This decision comes despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate reduction. The move aligns with economists' expectations, as Chinese authorities are holding off on major stimulus measures amid a stock market rally, even as recent economic data points to a slowdown. Key indicators like retail sales and industrial output showed fatigue, and consumer prices fell, indicating sluggish domestic demand.</p>

Mitchell's performance, including 17 points in the first half, was pivotal for the team's offense.

          <p>China's GJ-11 'Sharp Sword' uncrewed aerial vehicle, identified by the number 21 on its fuselage, is emerging as a crucial asset in intelligent warfare. Recent observations of its folding wings suggest a new variant, possibly the naval GJ-21, designed for deployment on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. This adaptation aligns with images seen on the emblem of China's first Type 076 amphibious landing ship, informally known as a 'drone carrier.' The article suggests the GJ-11 could be the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning about the return of a significant "warm blob" in the Pacific Ocean, characterized by unusually high sea surface temperatures south of Alaska. This marine heatwave, the fourth-largest since 1982, spans a vast region and has historically led to devastating impacts on marine life, including harmful algae blooms and collapses in fish and seabird populations. Experts link such events to human-driven climate change, noting their increasing intensity and frequency.

          <p>Former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg criticized what he called the "endless knee-bending" and "cringey" relationship between UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg urged the Prime Minister to uphold British values rather than solely courting the unpredictable US president. He argued that the UK's approach stems from a "miscalculation" about balancing relations with the US and the EU. Clegg also condemned Elon Musk's recent controversial comments regarding UK protesters.</p>
