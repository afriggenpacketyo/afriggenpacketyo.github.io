          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit his MLB-leading 20th home run, marking his third in as many games, during the Los Angeles Dodgers' 9-5 victory over the Cleveland Guardians. Ohtani reached this milestone in his 53rd game, the fastest in his major league career, with a two-run homer in the fourth inning. Max Muncy and Michael Conforto also contributed with home runs, bolstering the Dodgers' offense, while Dustin May secured the win after pitching five innings. Despite some defensive miscues and missed opportunities, the Dodgers clinched the series win against the Guardians.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket experienced an uncontrolled reentry after mission control lost contact with the upper stage during its ninth uncrewed test flight. The rocket, intended for interplanetary travel, launched from Starbase in Texas but suffered a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and likely disintegrate over the Indian Ocean. Despite the failure, SpaceX emphasized that the test flight provided valuable data to improve Starship's reliability. The company acknowledged a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" and noted similarities to issues encountered in previous tests. This test will help improve Starship's reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty finding employment, contributing to a significant rise in the national unemployment rate. Unemployed recent graduates account for 12% of the increase in unemployment since mid-2023, despite making up only 5% of the labor force. The unemployment rate among recent college graduates is nearing 6%, surpassing the national average. This trend is attributed to a mismatch between the supply of graduates and waning demand in previously strong sectors, particularly technology, and economic uncertainty is slowing hiring.</p>

          <p>A federal judge will allow prosecutors to downgrade charges against L.A. County Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was convicted of using excessive force against an unarmed woman, to a misdemeanor. The decision follows controversy over U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli's attempt to offer Kirk a plea deal after his felony conviction. The case led to multiple federal prosecutors resigning in protest. Kirk was convicted of depriving Jacey Houseton of her rights after he pepper-sprayed and assaulted her during a 2023 incident. While Kirk could still face jail time, the reduced charge avoids a felony conviction.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, addressing ride comfort issues that could make the experience "extremely unpleasant." Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) found that minor track imperfections and electromagnetic resonance can cause violent vibrations at high speeds. They developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, improving ride comfort. The study used supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests to analyze and mitigate the effects of track irregularities on passenger experience.</p>

The spacecraft spun and disintegrated over the Indian Ocean, though the vehicle could successfully reach orbit. The company said it re-entered Earth's atmosphere at an angle that is not ideal for its heat shield. This test is part of SpaceX's iterative approach to engineering and despite the issues, SpaceX deemed the mission a success due to the data collected. The company will continue to evaluate the data, make adjustments to the spacecraft, and build upon its previous successes and lessons learned from failures.</p>

The pardon aligns with Trump's pattern of using his clemency power to settle grievances over what he calls the political weaponization of the justice system.</p>

Musk, who previously led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), believes the bill undermines the work of the DOGE team. The legislation, championed by President Trump, would extend the 2017 tax cuts and increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
