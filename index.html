          <p>President Trump announced the immediate commutation of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos' 87-month prison sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. Santos, who began serving his term in July after pleading guilty to charges that led to his expulsion from Congress, was accused of fabricating his biography and misusing campaign funds. Trump justified the commutation by claiming Santos was "horribly mistreated" in prison, including long stretches in solitary confinement, and had made a personal appeal for a chance to rebuild his life. This executive action significantly shortens Santos's incarceration, drawing criticism from some who believe his confessed crimes warranted a longer sentence, though it does not erase his criminal record.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks, including their parts, and 10% tariffs on all imported buses, such as school and city buses. This policy aims to protect U.S. companies from foreign competition and strongly incentivize domestic manufacturing by discouraging the use of only foreign materials. The administration plans to provide credits to vehicle manufacturers who import some parts for U.S. assembly, thereby offsetting tariff liabilities and ensuring they remain cost-competitive. This strategic move is intended to boost American labor, expand vehicle production within the United States, and reduce reliance on foreign-made components, ultimately strengthening the domestic automotive sector.</p>

          <h2>Regional Banks Face Scrutiny Over Hidden Risks from Bad Loans</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent disclosures of significant loan wipeouts by regional banks, including Zions and Western Alliance, have sparked renewed investor concern over hidden risks in the financial sector. These losses, linked to alleged fraud by a commercial real estate firm, recall the churn of the 2023 banking crisis. Investors are now scrutinizing loans made to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs), a rapidly growing and less-regulated category of lending that has seen substantial growth since 2012. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of potential contagion, highlighting the vulnerability of banks to these high-loss-rate, fast-materializing risks, prompting calls for investors to avoid companies with high NDFI loan exposure.

          <h2>Stephen A. Smith Questions LeBron James' Interactions with Critics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN host Stephen A. Smith suggested that LeBron James' interactions with critics might be influenced by race, referencing a past confrontation between them. Smith appeared to address an incident where James confronted him at a Lakers' game in March, following Smith's televised criticisms of James' son, Bronny. Smith argued he had done nothing wrong professionally, stating that painting him as someone who would attack a child due to dislike was "low." James, however, countered that criticism of on-court performance is acceptable, but personal attacks cross a line, emphasizing his role as a father and protector of his household and players.</p>

          <p>Family members are desperately searching for 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard, last seen in August, after her prolonged absence was reported to authorities by the Lompoc Unified School District. Melodee's mother, Ashlee Buzzard, has refused to cooperate with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office investigation into her daughter's whereabouts. Relatives express grave concerns, citing the mother's long history of mental illness and her refusal to allow family visits for years, noting they haven't seen Melodee in over four years. The most recent photo available of Melodee is two years old, adding urgency to the efforts to locate the missing girl and understand what happened to her.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced it has handed over all Israeli hostage remains it could recover from Gaza, stating extensive efforts and special equipment are needed to find the remaining bodies amidst widespread destruction. This comes after the Red Cross received more coffins for identification, bringing the total handed over to at least eight since the peace deal began. The return of all 28 deceased hostages was a cornerstone of the Gaza peace plan, with at least 20 still unaccounted for, prompting Israeli fury and accusations of agreement violation. U.S. advisers acknowledge the immense destruction in Gaza makes recovery difficult, with the U.S. even sharing Israeli intelligence to assist the search.</p>

          <p>President Trump confirmed that Venezuelan officials offered the U.S. significant stakes in their oil, gold, and natural resources to de-escalate U.S. actions. Trump asserted that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro made these extensive offers because "he doesn't want to f*** around with the United States." These comments followed Trump's recent authorization of covert CIA operations in Venezuela and deadly U.S. strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels off its coast, which have killed dozens. The U.S. continues to increase pressure on Venezuela, accusing Maduro of leading a drug cartel and deploying military assets to the region.</p>

Trump, who recently spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and plans a Budapest meeting, expressed reservations about supplying Tomahawks, prioritizing U.S. defense needs.

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is set to peak next week, offering an impressive celestial display visible until November 7th, with optimal viewing between midnight and dawn. Known for their brightness and speed, these meteors originate from debris left by Halley's Comet as Earth passes through its trail, burning up in our atmosphere. The radiant point for the shower is the constellation of Orion, which rises in the east after midnight. Observers can expect around 15 meteors per hour during the peak, some appearing brighter than Venus, providing a spectacular naked-eye show for those in dark locations.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, under the Trump administration, has prematurely terminated a consent order that prohibited Citibank from discriminating against Armenian American customers. The original order, from 2023, stemmed from accusations that Citibank applied stricter criteria or blocked credit card applications from individuals with Armenian surnames in Glendale, with some employees allegedly referring to them as "Armenian bad guys." The CFPB stated Citibank had paid required penalties and taken steps to prevent future violations, waiving non-compliance allegations.

          <p>India's traditional Diwali gold rush is seeing a shift this year as soaring prices, topping $1,440 for 10g, influence consumer behavior. While demand for gold remains strong due to its auspicious significance during Dhanteras, buyers are opting for lighter jewelry or smaller gold quantities, with jewellers innovating designs to counter stagnant budgets. A notable trend is the increasing preference for gold as an investment rather than purely for adornment, reflected in rising bullion market data and record inflows into ETFs and digital gold. India's central bank is also significantly boosting its gold reserves to diversify holdings and provide stability during geopolitical stress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. is experiencing a significant turnaround in its fentanyl crisis, with fatal overdoses falling by 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This progress is largely attributed to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, particularly in states like North Carolina, where overdoses are down 35%. Innovative programs like law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) are diverting substance users from crime to recovery, offering support for addiction, housing, and employment. Medication-assisted treatments like methadone and widespread availability of Naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug, are also playing crucial roles, along with a generational shift away from opioids among younger people.</p>

This "warm blob," roughly ten times the size of the Mediterranean, has climate scientists struggling to fully explain its persistence, though climate change makes such marine heatwaves more likely. Possible contributing factors include weaker winds and a reduction in Sun-reflecting aerosols from cleaner shipping fuels and reduced air pollution in China.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council publicly rebuked its city attorney, Hydee Feldstein Soto, directing her to withdraw a request to lift a federal judge’s order banning the LAPD from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons. The ban was prompted by lawsuits from journalists and protesters alleging excessive force during Trump administration protests, with video evidence suggesting officers violated guidelines. Council members emphasized that journalism is under attack and condemned undermining protections for those exercising First Amendment rights. Feldstein Soto's legal team subsequently withdrew the request, though the city is still appealing the injunction, highlighting ongoing tensions over police tactics and press freedom.</p>

          <p>A mysterious phrase, "six, seven," accompanied by a juggling hand motion, has become a widespread viral trend among kids and teens, disrupting classrooms and baffling adults. Originating from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," the artist himself admits he never assigned it a specific meaning, calling it "something positive and fun." The phrase's longevity is partly attributed to teachers getting upset, as children enjoy having a secret code that adults cannot easily ban or avoid due to the numbers' ubiquity. Experts suggest this seemingly nonsensical trend might be this generation's way of expressing fun and lightening up amidst global pressures.</p>

Prosecutors claim Bolton used a group chat to transmit over 1,000 pages of sensitive material during his White House tenure, contemporaneously documenting high-level deliberations. While Bolton argues political retribution and that his edited manuscript was suitable for publication, prosecutors assert the case is "righteous," citing evidence that some information may have fallen into the hands of a foreign adversary after his email was hacked.

          <p>Authorities in Orange County have arrested Jacob Daniel Rodriguez, 45, the man dubbed "Postal Malone" for his resemblance to the singer Post Malone, who is suspected of a string of package thefts. Rodriguez was booked into Orange County Jail following an investigation by the Irvine Police Department. Last month, police had posted photos of the suspect, captured on camera stealing more than five packages from an apartment community on Spectrum Center Drive, noting his distinctive facial and hand tattoos. The arrest comes after a public appeal for information, with police playfully referencing Post Malone's song titles in their announcement, signaling a resolution to the local crime spree.</p>

Facing intensifying backlash, Benioff stated he listened closely to San Franciscans and local officials, concluding that the National Guard is not needed for city safety. His initial remarks, made with "an abundance of caution" for a company conference, had drawn criticism for advocating domestic troop deployment for law enforcement, a move widely banned by federal law. This apology marks a shift from his previous support for liberal policies, as city leaders tout declining crime rates and reject federal intervention, asserting local control over safety.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals exciting results for the Galleri blood test, showing its potential to speed up diagnosis for over 50 types of cancer, three-quarters of which lack existing screening programs. In a North American trial of 25,000 adults, the test identified cancer in 62% of positive cases, with over half detected at an early, more treatable stage. The test, which detects fragments of cancerous DNA circulating in the blood, correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of negative results. While these impressive findings suggest a major role in earlier diagnosis, scientists await further evidence from ongoing randomized trials to confirm its impact on reducing overall cancer deaths.</p>
