          <p>The White House has retracted the nomination of Jared Isaacman as the next NASA administrator, just before the Senate confirmation vote. A White House spokesperson stated that the new leader of NASA should be fully aligned with President Trump's "America First" agenda, emphasizing the goal of planting the American flag on Mars. Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur with ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX, previously testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, where he expressed his commitment to prioritizing American astronauts on Mars and clarified that a lunar landing would precede a Mars mission. No specific reason was given for the withdrawal of his nomination. Optimism around the space program is in a state of relative stability.</p>

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), an ambitious reforestation effort, faces scrutiny due to satellite data and field reports suggesting limited forest restoration. The NGP aimed to replant millions of native trees, sequester carbon, and support wildlife, but struggles with resource plundering and the replacement of community forests with invasive species plantations. An analysis of satellite images indicates deforestation on NGP land, with native trees cleared to grow cash crops. The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) struggles to address these issues, and independent audits suggest poor site selection, limited community support, and weak sustainability planning persist.

          <p>Valerie Mahaffey, an Emmy-award winning actor known for her roles on Northern Exposure, Desperate Housewives and Young Sheldon, died on Friday at the age of 71.

Michelle Pfeiffer, who played opposite Mahaffey in French Exit, posted on social media: “One of our brightest stars was stolen from us yesterday. Such a remarkable talent and human.” The news is relatively stable given the actress was 71 years old.</p>
