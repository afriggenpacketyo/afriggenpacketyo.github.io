          <p>Koyo Kouoh, a prominent figure in the global art world and the curator slated to be the first African woman to oversee the Venice Biennale, has died at the age of 57 in Basel, Switzerland. Her death, caused by recently diagnosed cancer, was announced by the biennale's organizers, just days before she was scheduled to announce the theme and title of the upcoming event. Kouoh was known for her work as the executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, one of Africa’s largest contemporary art museums, where she championed artists of color and built a global reputation. The art world mourns the loss of a visionary leader and advocate for diverse voices.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The government intends to shift the focus to hiring British nationals and extending visas for overseas workers already in the country. The threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, and the list of exceptions for temporary shortage visas will be narrowed. This move is expected to reduce lower-skilled visas by up to 50,000 over the next year, with new training commitments aimed at getting unemployed individuals back into the UK labor market.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the Trump administration's approach to freedom of choice, highlighting a divergence between expanding consumer options and restricting political ones. While the administration promotes deregulation to increase consumer choices, it simultaneously limits options in the political sphere, such as restricting the expression of certain ideologies in classrooms. The article suggests that this reflects a new form of authoritarianism that values consumer choice over other forms of freedom, such as the right to determine political representatives or express diverse ideas.</p>

The article notes that Musk's actions, such as criticizing Trump's policies on Social Security and tariffs, ultimately made him a political liability.

Russia's Putin rejected the cease-fire proposal, instead proposing direct talks in Istanbul, while the Kremlin demanded that Western governments stop supplying arms to Ukraine.

          <p>President Putin's offer of direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul may be an attempt to divide the US and Europe, following European leaders' ultimatum for a ceasefire. Putin slammed European powers for using ultimatums and proposed direct talks with Ukraine without an immediate ceasefire. While the US administration hailed the potential for progress, the lack of commitment to an immediate ceasefire raises skepticism about Russia's true intentions and may be a strategic move to maintain a good relationship with the US administration.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for their second day of high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trump’s trade war. The talks have major implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. Mr. Trump has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax. Economists warn that the trade dispute will slow global growth and fuel inflation, potentially tipping the United States into a recession.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is launching an unprecedented smear campaign against Ukraine to dissuade citizens from supporting its EU accession. Pro-government media platforms are disseminating clips portraying Ukraine as a hub for drug trafficking and organized crime, with Brussels depicted as the puppet master. The campaign is viewed as an attempt to discredit political opponent Peter Magyar, who is gaining popularity, and to appeal to far-right voters nostalgic for a greater Hungary. Orban's stance also aligns with his pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian foreign policy, serving as a declaration of loyalty to Putin and Trump.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump continues to criticize the US media as “fake news,” despite evidence suggesting that some news organizations have been bending to his will.

Examples include Jeff Bezos ordering an overhaul of the Washington Post’s editorial pages and the Los Angeles Times dropping its endorsement of Kamala Harris. Despite these actions, Trump continues to attack journalists and threaten investigations into media outlets.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's use of Chinese-made weapons has shown strength against India's Western and Russian arms in the recent Kashmir conflict, though analysts caution against drawing definitive conclusions about overall superiority. Tensions escalated after India conducted military strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a terrorist attack. India reportedly deployed French-made Rafale jets, while Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian fighter aircraft, including three Rafales. The conflict has raised questions about the effectiveness of different weapons systems in modern combat.</p>

          <p>After losing their home in a fire, a couple decided not to rebuild in Pacific Palisades, citing concerns about the political climate in Trump's America. The family, with German passports, chose to relocate to Spain, feeling the country is becoming increasingly frightening and at odds with their values. The decision was influenced by the difficulties of rebuilding in an environment of rising costs and potential labor shortages. While acknowledging the privilege of their choice, the couple expressed a desire to return to the United States when they feel more optimistic about its future.</p>

          <p>A university-level researcher shares insights on doomsday prepping, arguing it's an American institution rooted in self-sufficiency and frontier spirit. FEMA data indicates about half of Americans engage in some preparedness for adverse events. The researcher contrasts media portrayals with the reality that prepping is a response to inadequate state responses to disasters, leading individuals to take responsibility through consumption choices. The ultra-wealthy's conspicuous consumption in prepping, like buying islands, contrasts with the middle class's shelf-stable food and home fallout shelters, all reflecting a desire for self-reliance in a nation where government support is often lacking.</p>

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of a developing trade agreement with the Trump administration. The agreement, which aims to provide certainty to the £40bn UK aerospace sector, follows relief offered to the car and steel industries. The deal is also important for the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners, and US-based repair and maintenance facilities require a regular flow of parts. The terms would bring car tariffs down from 27.5% to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles a year and steel tariffs to zero.</p>
