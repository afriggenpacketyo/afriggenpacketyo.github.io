          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, has introduced a new pricing model that allows it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders, bypassing credit bureaus. This move, aimed at eliminating unnecessary mark-ups, caused the company's stock to surge over 20%, its largest single-day increase since November. In contrast, shares for major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax fell significantly as investors anticipated a diminished role for them in the mortgage industry. The change is seen by some as a constructive action to make credit markets more competitive and beneficial for consumers.</p>

          <p>CBS Miami's entertainment reporter, Lisa Petrillo, has publicly shared her private 10-month battle with breast cancer to encourage others during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. She discovered a lump during a self-exam, which led to an early-stage diagnosis after she insisted doctors examine the area during a routine appointment. Petrillo underwent a lumpectomy and radiation, keeping her diagnosis private while continuing to work. Now in recovery, she hopes her story of persistence and early detection will help others facing a similar situation, emphasizing the importance of self-advocacy in healthcare.</p>

          <p>Israeli naval forces intercepted a large flotilla of nearly 50 boats attempting to break the blockade and deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, detaining dozens of activists, including climate campaigner Greta Thunberg and several European lawmakers. The interception, which occurred in international waters, has drawn widespread international condemnation from countries like Turkey, Colombia, and Malaysia. Israel stated the activists were being safely transferred for deportation, calling the flotilla a provocation. The incident has reignited debate over the legality of Israel's 18-year maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip and the right to provide humanitarian aid.</p>

Emana suffered a uterine rupture during labor, and Perry's quick actions to alert doctors led to an emergency C-section that saved both mother and child. For years, Emana searched for the nurse, only remembering her face until an old photograph helped her identify Perry. The reunion was deeply emotional for both women, providing closure and a powerful reminder of the life-changing impact of compassionate nursing care.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has extended into its second day with no resolution in sight, as Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked over a short-term funding bill. Democrats are insisting on provisions to protect healthcare subsidies, while Republicans are attempting to secure support for a clean stopgap measure. The Trump administration has escalated the situation by threatening mass layoffs of federal workers, with officials suggesting thousands could be fired within days.

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty marked by rising inflation and potential interest rate cuts, a six-month certificate of deposit (CD) presents a stable option for savers. This article calculates the potential interest earnings on various deposit amounts, showing that a $10,000 deposit in a 6-month CD with a 4.30% rate could yield approximately $212. Unlike high-yield savings accounts with variable rates, CDs offer a fixed return, providing predictability and security. This strategy allows savers to protect their principal and earn guaranteed interest while maintaining flexibility for reinvestment when the CD matures in the spring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. immigration judge in Baltimore has denied the asylum application of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national whose case has become a focal point in the debate over immigration policy. Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and children, was previously deported in March before being returned to the U.S. in June following a Supreme Court ruling, only to face new charges of human smuggling. His lawyers argued he could not be deported to El Salvador due to gang-related dangers. He now has 30 days to appeal the judge's latest decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed a free-floating 'rogue planet,' named Cha 1107-7626, consuming gas and dust from its surrounding disc at a record-breaking rate of six billion tons per second. This object, located 620 light-years away, is five to ten times the mass of Jupiter and is exhibiting behaviors previously seen only in stars, such as intense magnetic activity driving its growth. The discovery blurs the line between how planets and stars form, suggesting that some planetary-mass objects may develop through processes similar to star formation.

This statement follows his administration's actions to freeze $18 billion in infrastructure funding for New York City and cancel $8 billion for climate-related projects in Democratic-leaning states. The White House has also warned that mass firings of federal workers could begin within days, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggesting the number could be in the thousands.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. The average HELOC rate has recently fallen below 8%, a significant drop from nearly 10% a year ago, making it a competitive option for homeowners needing financing. This article calculates that a $70,000 HELOC with a 15-year repayment term would now cost approximately $664 per month, about $33 less than it would have last fall.

          <p>The unemployment rate for Black women has risen to 6.7%, a concerning trend that experts attribute to several key factors. One major contributor is the corporate retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which has led to layoffs in related roles often held by Black women. Additionally, cutbacks in small businesses and layoffs within the federal government, where Black women are disproportionately represented, have exacerbated the problem. This has prompted calls for the Federal Reserve to analyze the data and develop a plan to address what some are calling a crisis.</p>

He argued that the artifact was the property of the American people and should not be given away.

          <p>The emergence of 'Tilly Norwood,' a computer-generated actor, has triggered significant anxiety and backlash within the Hollywood community over the use of artificial intelligence. Created by AI talent studio Xicoia, the digital persona is portrayed as an aspiring actor and is reportedly set to be signed by a talent agency. SAG-AFTRA condemned the creation, stating it was trained on the work of countless real performers without their permission or compensation, thereby threatening actor livelihoods. The controversy highlights the ongoing deep-seated fears in the entertainment industry about AI replacing human artists and devaluing their craft.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean Combs, who has been in custody for a year, is scheduled for sentencing after a federal trial ended in a split verdict. He was convicted on two counts of transportation for prostitution but acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeer charges. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of over a decade, citing a history of violence, while his defense has requested a sentence of 14 months, which could lead to his release soon due to time served. The trial featured graphic testimony from multiple accusers, including singer Cassie Ventura, who detailed years of alleged abuse.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, reporting 497,099 units delivered. The figures were released just as a significant federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers in the U.S. expired. The delivery numbers slightly exceeded analyst expectations, though production saw a minor decline compared to the same period last year. The sales increase in the U.S. was partially driven by a rush to purchase vehicles before the tax credit ended, which helped offset a sales slump in Europe attributed to increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League is nearing a decision on whether to replace its current profit and sustainability rules (PSR), according to chief executive Richard Masters. The existing regulations, which limit club losses to £105 million over three years, have been criticized for stifling investment. An alternative being considered is a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's model, which would cap spending on squad-related costs at 85% of a club's total revenue. This change aims to align with European standards while still allowing for investment, with a final decision expected at a meeting in November.</p>

          <p>For the eighth year in a row, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world according to the World Happiness Report. Experts suggest this consistent ranking is not about daily joy but rather a deep sense of contentment derived from a well-functioning society. Key factors include strong social support systems, universal access to services like advanced public libraries, high trust in government, and a close connection to nature. Finns themselves often express skepticism about the title, but their societal structure fosters a stable and secure environment that contributes to a high quality of life.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch mistakenly claimed that Northern Ireland voted to leave the European Union during a BBC interview. In the 2016 referendum, Northern Ireland actually voted 56% to 44% to remain in the EU. When corrected, Badenoch acknowledged her error, clarifying that while England and Wales voted to leave, Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain. The gaffe occurred as she was defending her party's record on Brexit and its impact on the union, particularly regarding the controversial post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>A two-month campaign of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting Russian oil refineries has led to a significant fuel crisis within Russia, causing wholesale gasoline prices to surge by 50%. At least 16 of Russia's 38 refineries have been hit, idling nearly 40% of the country's primary processing capacity and creating deficits at the pump, with occupied Crimea being hit hardest. The attacks are designed to disrupt Russia's economy and bring the consequences of the war home to ordinary citizens. The situation may worsen as the U.S. has reportedly agreed to provide intelligence to aid future strikes.</p>

          <p>Baroness Anne Longfield, the former children's commissioner for England, has told the UK Covid Inquiry that the government should issue a formal apology to children for 'avoidable mistakes' made during the pandemic. She testified that children were consistently overlooked, with pubs and shops reopening before schools, and described the planning for school closures as chaotic. Longfield argued that the 2021 school closures could have been prevented with better preparation. The inquiry also heard that the pandemic caused a 'systemic shock' to children's mental health, with a sharp and sustained rise in mental health conditions.</p>

          <p>Disney's brand favorability has fallen to multi-year lows among both Republicans and Democrats following the controversy surrounding late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. The company faced backlash first for Kimmel's comments about a slain conservative activist and then for its decision to temporarily pull his show off the air, a move seen by many as capitulating to political pressure. According to an analysis by Jefferies using Morning Consult data, the incident alienated both sides of the political spectrum, causing a sharp decline in sentiment for the Disney brand and its streaming service, Disney+.</p>
