          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense due to years of physical and sexual assault. Judge Michael Jesic cited the brothers' efforts to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated, but emphasized that he was not suggesting their release, leaving their fate in the hands of the parole board and Governor Gavin Newsom. The resentencing followed testimony from family members who believe the brothers have changed, with Erik and Lyle apologizing for their actions and expressing remorse.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are working through the night to advance President Trump's legislative agenda, facing strong opposition from Democrats who accuse them of cutting vital welfare programs like Medicaid. The Energy & Commerce Committee and Ways & Means Committee meetings are expected to last upwards of 20 hours each, with Democrats preparing a barrage of attacks against GOP lawmakers. Tensions arose over Medicaid cuts, with Republicans contending they only seek to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. Meanwhile, a heated exchange occurred at the Ways & Means Committee over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, highlighting divisions even within the Republican party, as some representatives threatened to vote against the bill if the cap remains unchanged.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed pitcher Roki Sasaki on the injured list due to right shoulder impingement, further depleting the team's pitching staff. Sasaki reported arm soreness after his recent start, where he pitched on five days of rest for the first time in his major league career. His fastball velocity has decreased since joining the Dodgers, averaging 96 mph. The team is evaluating what is normal for Sasaki as he adjusts to the major league schedule, and is trying to determine the source of the arm soreness.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents, making them eligible for parole. Judge Michael Jesic gave the brothers a new sentence of 50 years to life, requiring them to argue for their release before the state's parole board. The brothers acknowledged killing their parents but claimed they acted in self-defense after years of abuse. The brothers delivered an emotional statement to the court, detailing the killings and apologizing for their actions, and expressed their hopes to work with sexual assault victims and help those incarcerated if they were to be released.</p>

          <p>Three general practitioners (GPs) share their perspectives on the assisted dying bill being debated in Parliament, highlighting the diverse opinions within the medical community. Dr. Abdul Farooq opposes assisted dying due to his religious beliefs, stating that life is a gift from God and that he would never cross the 'red line' of being involved in ending a life. Dr. Susi Caesar supports assisted dying based on her father's experience with a terminal illness and her belief in patient choice. Dr. Gurpreet Khaira is conflicted, acknowledging the importance of choice but also worrying about vulnerable patients being coerced into assisted dying.</p>

          <p>The future of British television is being debated as US streaming giants gain dominance, with some suggesting mergers among UK broadcasters to compete. Many fear the potential loss of public service broadcasting within a decade or two without a clear survival strategy. Some argue for a single gateway or app for all public service content, possibly under BBC iPlayer, while others emphasize the importance of distinctiveness and competition. The shift to digital-only video on demand by 2035 poses a challenge to British-originated and British-focused TV, with concerns over financial competition and the need to safeguard trusted news and cultural content.</p>

This holistic approach, similar to that of Shelter KC, focuses on building trust and addressing core issues like addiction and mental health. The goal is to move beyond simply providing affordable housing to creating a supportive system that fosters healthy relationships and long-term stability.</p>

The book relies heavily on anonymous sources, revealing the reluctance of Democrats to publicly address Biden's waning abilities. It describes Biden forgetting names of longtime aides and allies, as well as appearing frail in meetings. The book portrays Biden's inner circle as spending more time sticking their collective head in the sand about the president‚Äôs diminishing abilities than it does scheming to hide evidence of his shortcomings.</p>
