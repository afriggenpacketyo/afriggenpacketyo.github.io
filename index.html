          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow it to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan immigrants. This action challenges a lower court's ruling that blocked the administration from removing protections for Venezuelans, citing procedural violations and racial bias. The administration argues that the law creating TPS prevents judicial review of executive decisions regarding the program. The article outlines the legal battle over TPS and its potential impact on hundreds of thousands of immigrants.</p>
