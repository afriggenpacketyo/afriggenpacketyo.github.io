          <p>Nicola Packer, 45, was found not guilty of unlawfully administering a poison to induce a miscarriage. The trial at Isleworth Crown Court revealed that she took abortion medicine at home during the second coronavirus lockdown in November 2020, around 26 weeks into her pregnancy, and later took the dead baby to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. The legal limit for at-home abortion medication is 10 weeks, and the general abortion limit in England, Scotland, and Wales is 24 weeks, except in certain circumstances. The jury's decision comes amid ongoing debates about abortion laws and access to reproductive healthcare.</p>

          <p>The Rwandan government intervened to repatriate ten citizens who were trafficked to Myanmar and Laos after being lured by job scams. These Rwandans reached out to a social media influencer, Richard Kwizera, for help, who then tagged the government on his platforms. Government spokesperson Yolande Makolo confirmed the repatriation efforts, with ongoing work to bring home five more stranded individuals. The government has expressed concern over illegal recruitments and human trafficking, highlighting the vulnerabilities of young people seeking opportunities abroad. This incident underscores the broader issue of human trafficking and forced labor involving Rwandans in various parts of the world.</p>

          <p>Armed Israeli security forces closed three schools run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in East Jerusalem, sending hundreds of Palestinian students home. UNRWA's Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini condemned the action, accusing Israeli authorities of denying children their basic right to education and disregarding international law. The closure order prohibits operating educational institutions or employing staff and forbids accommodating students. This action follows an earlier Israeli ban on UNRWA, with Israel alleging the agency is infiltrated by Hamas, a claim UNRWA denies.</p>

          <p>A Harvard-trained career expert emphasizes that the ability to execute is an 'underrated' trait crucial for success, noting that many bright and ambitious students often undervalue this skill. Execution involves being conscientious, reliable, and decisive in getting things done efficiently and effectively. The expert argues that while visionary ideas and leadership skills are important, the capacity to consistently deliver results is what CEOs and organizations truly value. This perspective challenges the common perception that leadership solely relies on generating innovative ideas, highlighting the significance of operational excellence.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining interest rates at the May 7 meeting, labeling him a "fool" for acting "too late" in cutting rates. This criticism follows a series of similar attacks on Powell for keeping rates steady this year. Powell has emphasized the Fed's independence, stating that insulating it from political influence is crucial for making decisions based on economic data. Trump inaccurately claimed there is "virtually NO INFLATION," despite inflation rising 2.4% annually in March, exceeding the Fed's 2% target.</p>

          <p>A Michigan jury deadlocked in the trial of Christopher Schurr, a former Grand Rapids police officer, who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya during a traffic stop in April 2022. Judge Christina Mims declared a mistrial after jurors deliberated for four days without reaching a verdict. Schurr testified that he feared for his life when he shot Lyoya, who had grabbed his stun gun during the encounter. Lyoya's death sparked protests and heightened racial tensions, with the central question being whether Schurr's use of deadly force was justified given Michigan law allowing such force if there is a reasonable belief of preventing grave bodily harm or death.</p>

          <p>Grandparents are playing a larger and more enduring role in kidsâ€™ lives, offering numerous benefits such as improved educational and mental health outcomes. Demographic shifts, including falling birth rates and longer life expectancy, mean that kids are spending more years with their grandparents. Additionally, grandparents are increasingly stepping in to fill gaps in the child care system, although this role can also create financial and emotional strain. Experts emphasize the importance of policies that support grandparents in spending time with their grandkids by choice, rather than necessity, to ensure healthy intergenerational relationships.</p>

          <p>Relations between India and Pakistan have deteriorated following a series of attacks in Kashmir, a disputed territory between the two countries. The conflict has impacted cricket, a major cultural touchpoint, with the teams not facing each other outside of global events. India has blocked social media accounts of Pakistani cricket stars, and the closure of Pakistan's airspace has affected the IPL (Indian Premier League). The next likely meeting between the men's teams is at the Twenty20 World Cup in 2026, with the ICC ruling that games should be held at neutral venues until at least 2027.</p>

The implementation of this federally compliant identification comes after over 20 years of delays. Despite the new requirement, many airports reported normal operations with manageable wait times. The TSA has additional staff available to assist travelers and explain acceptable forms of identification. Travelers without a Real ID can still apply and use alternative forms of identification such as a passport.

The worsening financial position is primarily due to a decline in international student numbers, particularly following visa changes. Universities UK (UUK) described the report as "deeply sobering," noting that government intervention is also needed to address the challenges.</p>

The potential tariffs could significantly affect Boeing and other U.S. exports, including chemicals, electrical equipment, and certain food products. Brussels has also initiated consultations with member states regarding potential legal action against the U.S. over the blanket 20% reciprocal tariffs announced by Trump. The move comes as Trump appears to have reached a trade agreement with the UK and softened his stance on China.</p>

          <p>Experts say that using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt can be a wise move, but it depends on the individual's financial situation and goals. Paying off high-interest credit card debt can provide an immediate and higher return compared to long-term market returns. However, if balances are low or on a 0% promotional rate, the money might be better used for savings or investments. It's important to address the root cause of the debt and implement sound financial habits to prevent future debt problems.</p>

The article highlights that Trumpâ€™s negotiating position will be the weaker one. Already in recent months, U.S. policy has appeared to vacillate, its strategy and goals uncertain, while Chinese leader Xi Jinping has held fast, presented an image of strength, and kept his larger geopolitical goals in focus.</p>
