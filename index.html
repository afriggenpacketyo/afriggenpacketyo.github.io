          <p>Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, the sole survivor of the Air India plane crash, was seated in 11A near an emergency exit. After the plane crash-landed into a building, Ramesh found himself alive and was able to unfasten his seatbelt and escape through a broken door with a burnt hand. Aviation experts note that while seat 11A was safest in this particular crash, seat configurations and crash factors vary, making it impossible to predict survivability based on seat location. Ramesh was taken to a hospital with multiple injuries but is out of danger, while the cause of the crash remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>The second trial of Karen Read, accused of killing her Boston police officer boyfriend, is nearing its conclusion as the jury prepares to deliberate. Prosecutors allege Read struck John O'Keefe with her car and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense argues O'Keefe was attacked by a dog and others before being left outside. Read's first trial ended in a mistrial after the jury couldn't reach a verdict on all charges, and her lawyers' appeals for no retrial were denied. Key moments in the retrial included the absence of a former state police officer who was a key witness in the first trial and a mistrial motion denied after prosecutors admitted to a mistake over O'Keefe's sweater.</p>

          <p>Amazon is reorganizing its health-care business into six new units after a series of executive departures, aiming to simplify its structure and accelerate innovation. The company has been trying to establish itself in the U.S. health-care market for a decade, with both successes and setbacks including the closure of Amazon Care in 2022. The reorganization involves tapping longtime Amazon leaders and elevating One Medical executives to oversee the divisions. Amazon Health Services will now focus on clinical care delivery, operations, strategic growth, store tech and marketing, compliance, and pharmacy services, with the goal of improving the fragmented patient experience.</p>

He said the attack "created a state of chaos in Iran" but Israel needs to assume "there will be an attack against us." Netanyahu informed the Americans in advance and targeted Iran's nuclear facilities because "if Iran has nuclear weapons, we won't be able to be here, so that's the first target." He said he gave his military the directive to attack Iran after former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in Lebanon in September 2024.</p>

The full panel declined to hear Trump's arguments, leaving the Supreme Court as his last option for relief. Trump challenged evidence introduced during the civil lawsuit, including the Access Hollywood tape. Two Trump-appointed judges dissented, arguing the tape was irrelevant and functioned as inadmissible "propensity evidence."</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is struggling to craft a consistent message regarding Israel's attacks on Iran as Republicans diverge over the situation. While initially reacting coolly, Trump later issued a somber message to Iranian leadership, followed by mixed comments to American media outlets. Experts suggest Israel's actions demonstrate a willingness to defy American preferences, but Trump's varied responses indicate that traditional rules may not apply. As Iran assesses the damage and focuses on diplomatic efforts, the prospects for peace appear increasingly uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers can lower credit card interest rates without opening new accounts by directly asking card issuers for a lower rate, especially with a good payment history. Enrolling in a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency can lead to lower rates across multiple cards, though accounts may need to be closed. Temporary hardship programs offered by card companies can provide reduced APRs or deferred payments during financial difficulties. An improved credit score and mentioning competitive offers can also strengthen a request for a rate reduction.</p>

          <p>Oil prices surged and stocks declined following Israel's attack on Iran, heightening concerns about a broader conflict in the Middle East. Crude oil prices experienced their largest increase since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, pushing the U.S. benchmark close to $73 a barrel. Investors were unsettled by the attacks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling nearly 500 points. The market's reaction reflects heightened geopolitical uncertainty and potential economic fallout from the escalating conflict.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles residents have expressed support for the immigrant community and resistance to the Trump administration's immigration policies amid increased ICE raids and military presence. Protests have erupted in response to federal agents targeting workplaces and schools, met with a heavy-handed response from the president. While some residents support the administration's actions, many feel the situation is reminiscent of dystopian movies, with armored vehicles and masked personnel on city streets. Residents describe the raids as cruel and chaotic, while others see them as a necessary step to protect citizens and resources.</p>

          <p>Israel's "Operation Rising Lion," a large-scale attack on Iran, is unprecedented, targeting nuclear sites, air defenses, and military bases. The attack, which included assistance from Mossad operatives, has left Iran reeling and potentially marks only the first wave. Israel's motivation stems from suspicions that Iran is secretly working towards developing nuclear weapons, a claim Iran denies. The timing of the attack is considered crucial, with Israel aiming to set back Iran's nuclear program and potentially weaken its leadership.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's appointment of Ariel Abergel to oversee the nation's 250th birthday celebration as executive director of America250 has raised concerns about politicization. The congressionally authorized festivities, intended to be nonpartisan, are now viewed by some as a potential celebration of Trump himself. Abergel's operation has helped fundraise for Trump's events, and top donors have been promised VIP experiences. Critics argue that Trump is hijacking the mission of America250 for his own personal gain.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily restored Donald Trump's control of California's national guard after a judge ruled his use of the guard to suppress protests in Los Angeles was illegal. The decision paused a temporary restraining order against Trump, with an emergency hearing scheduled for June 17. The legal battle stems from Trump's move to federalize the California national guard over Governor Newsom's objections, leading to a lawsuit by the state. The ruling also involved a sitting US senator being manhandled by federal agents.</p>
