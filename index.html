          <p>A Department of Justice lawyer, Erez Reuveni, alleges that Emil Bove, a Trump nominee for a federal appeals court judge, instructed DOJ attorneys to disregard court orders preventing the deportation of immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. Reuveni's lawyers claim Bove stressed the urgency of deportations regardless of legal obstacles, which Reuveni reported to a judge. Reuveni, who was subsequently fired for refusing to file briefs with misrepresentations and for truthfully reporting an erroneous deportation, faced threats and disparagement for upholding his duties. Senator Dick Durbin has criticized Bove for abusing his position, citing instances such as firing January 6 prosecutors and dismissing charges against Eric Adams. The tone of this article is critical and raises concerns about the nominee's respect for the rule of law.</p>

The ruling is considered a significant victory for AI companies navigating legal challenges related to the use of copyrighted material in training large language models.

Comer stated that this is the first of many interviews with individuals involved in the autopen matter, while Rep. Wesley Bell, D-Mo., described the meeting as a waste of time.

          <p>A hepatitis A outbreak has infected thousands of travelers across Austria, Czechia, Hungary, and Slovakia, with over 2,000 cases reported between January and May 2025. Slovakia has the highest number of cases, followed by Czechia, which also reported six deaths. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommends investigating transmission methods and implementing targeted vaccination programs to address the outbreak. Hepatitis A spreads through contaminated food or water and close contact, with the homeless, drug users, and those with limited healthcare access being most affected. This situation highlights the importance of vaccination and sanitation, particularly for vulnerable populations and travelers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed frustration with both Israel and Iran, accusing them of violating the ceasefire agreement he announced the previous night. Trump stated that both countries "don't know what the f--- they're doing," and that Israel had dropped a significant number of bombs shortly after the deal was made. Despite the violations, Trump affirmed his belief that Iran is still committed to peace and spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to emphasize the need to sustain the ceasefire. The agreement involved two 12-hour ceasefire periods, with the intention of officially ending the war after 24 hours.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended a NATO summit in the Netherlands shortly after announcing a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, though he later stated both nations had violated it. The summit aimed to secure commitments from NATO allies to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP, a goal already agreed upon before Trump's arrival. Secretary General Mark Rutte praised Trump's actions in Iran and the new defense spending levels. Russia's war on Ukraine remains a significant concern for NATO members, with ongoing discussions about designating Russia as the primary threat to the alliance.</p>

          <p>A court in Nantes ruled that the French government is partially responsible for the 2016 death of Jean-Rene Auffray, a jogger who died after inhaling toxic hydrogen sulfide from rotting algae on a Brittany beach. The court cited the state's negligence in implementing regulations to protect waters from agricultural pollution, which is the primary cause of green algae proliferation. Auffray's family sued the government, initially losing the case in 2022, but the recent ruling found the state 60% responsible.

The Latino Climate and Health Dashboard reveals that Latino communities disproportionately suffer from extreme heat and air pollution compared to non-Latino white neighborhoods. Latino neighborhoods experience 23 more extreme-heat days per year, often lacking adequate infrastructure and cooling systems. Fears stemming from recent ICE raids are preventing individuals from seeking essential medical care, exacerbating existing health disparities.

The combination of high temperatures and humidity poses a significant risk, particularly for vulnerable populations lacking access to air conditioning.

He shared a significant opening partnership with Zak Crawley, but dismissals of Duckett and Harry Brook briefly shifted momentum. Joe Root and Jamie Smith provided stability to secure the win, completing the chase with 14 overs to spare.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that tariff uncertainty stemming from President Trump's policies warrants a cautious approach to cutting interest rates. Powell acknowledged that the Fed expects tariff inflation to become more apparent, but the extent to which it will affect consumers remains uncertain. Despite calls for faster rate cuts, the Fed has maintained its current stance, citing low employment, growing wages, and decent economic growth. Powell emphasized that the Fed is monitoring the combined effects of Trump's policies on taxes, immigration, and regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold 100,000 shares of the company's stock, worth approximately $15 million, marking the first sale under his plan to sell up to 600,000 shares by the end of 2025. Huang still retains ownership of over 800 million Nvidia shares, contributing to his net worth of approximately $126 billion. The sales occur amid significant growth for Nvidia, driven by high demand for its AI chips, which have fueled an 800% increase in stock value since December 2022.

          <h2>Insurers Hesitant to Cover US, Israeli, and UK-Linked Vessels in Middle East</h2>

          <p>The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has prompted many insurance underwriters to avoid offering coverage to vessels with perceived U.S., Israeli, or U.K. links, regardless of the price. Insurance rates for vessels still receiving coverage have increased significantly, reflecting the heightened risk in the region. Concerns include potential vessel blockages by Iran and the role of China, a major customer of Iranian oil. The situation remains volatile, with underwriters closely monitoring political developments and adjusting their risk assessments accordingly. (not investment advice)</p>
