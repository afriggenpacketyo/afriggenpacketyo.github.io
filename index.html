          <p>Inspired by the US New Deal, China is implementing large-scale work-relief programs to boost domestic consumption.  These programs, historically used in rural areas, are now being expanded to address unemployment among migrant workers.  The aim is to raise household incomes and stimulate demand, addressing economic challenges beyond the countryside. This strategy reflects a shift towards consumption-led growth and aims to mitigate the impact of a slowing real estate market and reduced infrastructure projects.</p>

          <p>Economists predict that the revenue generated by President Trump's tariffs will likely be significantly lower than the White House's projections.  The actual revenue could be less than half of the estimated $600 billion annually.  This discrepancy stems from several factors, including reduced consumer demand, potential economic slowdowns, and retaliatory tariffs from other countries.  The lower-than-expected revenue could have significant implications for the US economy, national debt, and legislative negotiations.</p>
