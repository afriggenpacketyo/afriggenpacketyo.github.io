          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, with sales growing 13% year-over-year to $167.7 billion, driven by strong performance in its advertising and online stores units. However, the company's shares declined in extended trading after it provided a cautious operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter, raising investor concerns about the high costs of its significant investments in artificial intelligence. Despite the guidance, Amazon's cloud computing division, AWS, saw an 18% revenue increase, though this growth rate trails behind competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.

          <p>Apple announced third-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst predictions for both profit and revenue, marking the company's most significant quarterly revenue growth since December 2021. The strong performance was fueled by a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, particularly the popular iPhone 16 model, and a nearly 15% rise in Mac revenue. While the services division continued its steady growth, sales for the iPad and wearables declined, though overall positive results were bolstered by a 4% sales increase in the crucial China market.

          <p>The White House has announced the construction of a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has long advocated for to host large formal events and state dinners. The estimated $200 million cost will be covered by President Trump and other anonymous private donors, with construction slated to begin in September. The new facility, to be located in a modernized East Wing, is designed to seat approximately 650 guests, eliminating the need for the large tents currently used for major functions on the White House grounds.</p>

          <p>Several prominent universities, including Columbia and Brown, have agreed to major policy changes and financial settlements to resolve allegations of civil rights violations from the Trump administration, which had withheld federal funding. These agreements involve cutting DEI programs, reviewing curricula, and tightening rules on student protests, leading free speech advocates to warn of a dangerous precedent that compromises academic freedom. Critics fear these deals create a blueprint for political coercion, forcing other, less-resourced institutions to yield to similar pressures and fundamentally reshaping higher education.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, significantly drawing down the force deployed by the Trump administration two months ago to address protests related to immigration policies. California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, praised the withdrawal, having previously argued that local law enforcement should manage the protests and that the deployment was unnecessary. Approximately 250 troops will remain to protect federal property, while the administration maintains the deployment was vital for maintaining order amid what it termed "rampant lawlessness."</p>

          <p>A mysterious illness has caused the deaths of seven dogs and hospitalized eleven more in the Venice Canals neighborhood of Los Angeles, leaving residents and veterinarians searching for answers. The affected dogs, all previously healthy, experienced a sudden onset of symptoms including seizures, lethargy, and nausea before their rapid decline. While official investigations are ongoing, neighbors have speculated about causes ranging from contaminated water to poison, with one veterinarian suggesting that a toxic cyanobacteria in the canals' algae could be the culprit behind the tragic events.</p>

          <p>The opening day of the fifth Test between England and India at The Oval was characterized by erratic bowling, rain delays, and moments of brilliance, concluding with India at 204-6. England's bowlers, particularly Josh Tongue, were inconsistent, mixing unplayable deliveries with wayward ones, which prevented either side from gaining full control of the match. Despite favorable bowling conditions, England couldn't fully capitalize, while India's batters struggled to build momentum, leaving the critical series-deciding match finely balanced heading into the second day's play.</p>

          <p>CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell is set to release a new book titled "We the Women," which uncovers the stories of forgotten female pioneers from the American Revolution to the present day. O'Donnell explained that the project was inspired by the lack of female figures in her own history education and aims to highlight women who were true revolutionaries. The book, scheduled for release in February 2026, will feature figures like Mary Katharine Goddard, the printer of the Declaration of Independence, and Emily Warren Roebling, who was instrumental in building the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

          <p>A significant staffing purge at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a federal agency that distributes over $12 billion annually, is jeopardizing numerous local health initiatives. Since February, the agency has lost about a quarter of its workforce, including grant managers and auditors, leading to concerns about its ability to oversee funding for community health centers, addiction treatment, and rural hospitals. The cuts, part of a broader Trump administration plan, have already led to the cancellation of at least one scholarship program for disadvantaged health students, raising alarms among public health advocates.</p>

          <p>With high interest rates, many homeowners are tapping into their home equity, but an article from CBS News outlines several costly mistakes to avoid. These include opting for a variable-rate HELOC when predictable payments are needed, as rates could rise, and borrowing more than is necessary, which increases interest costs and financial risk. The article also cautions homeowners to be wary of hidden fees and closing costs, advising them to compare the full APR between different loan offers to understand the true cost of borrowing before making a decision.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced it will impose sanctions, including visa denials, on officials from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The move is seen as a response to recent international efforts to recognize a Palestinian state and actions to pursue claims against Israel in international courts. Palestinian leaders described the sanctions as "revenge" and punishment against the victim, while Israel welcomed the U.S. action, stating it exposes the "moral distortion" of countries supporting Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's increasing use of its emergency docket, stating that it is a necessary response to presidents using executive orders to bypass Congress. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh noted that as administrations push the limits of their power, more legal challenges inevitably require the court's temporary intervention. He acknowledged criticism over a lack of explanation in these orders but said the court has improved its process, sometimes scheduling emergency oral arguments to ensure it gets the right answer.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court intensely questioned the Trump administration's legal authority to impose broad tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners using an emergency powers law. During arguments, judges probed whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which has never before been used for this purpose, grants the president the power to set tariffs, a role constitutionally vested in Congress. The case, brought by states and small businesses, is a major test of the president's economic agenda, with the court's decision likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a rare public forum, three federal judges detailed the escalating threats and harassment they have faced in recent months, which they link to political attacks from the White House and its allies. The judges described receiving credible death threats, being targeted with "pizza doxxing," and having their families intimidated after issuing rulings that countered the Trump administration's policies. They warned that this inflammatory rhetoric from political leaders emboldens bad actors and undermines the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.</p>
