          <p>Salesforce shares dropped over 5% after the company issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast for the upcoming fiscal third quarter. Despite beating analyst estimates for the second quarter with a 10% revenue increase to $10.24 billion, the guidance of $10.24 to $10.29 billion fell short of expectations. The company is facing challenges in its marketing and commerce product sales, and concerns persist on Wall Street that the broader AI boom has not lifted Salesforce as it has other tech giants, potentially threatening the software-as-a-service sector.

          <p>The Office for Students (OfS), England's higher education regulator, has proposed the idea of "differential fee levels" for universities based on their teaching quality. This could mean that institutions with higher teaching standards, as ranked by the regulator's framework, might be allowed to charge different tuition fees than those with lower rankings. The suggestion comes amid significant financial strain on the university sector, with many institutions facing deficits, and sparks a debate over how to fund higher education and incentivize quality.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma dropped nearly 20% to their lowest price since its July initial public offering. The decline followed the company's first earnings report as a public entity, where second-quarter results were largely in line with expectations but failed to excite investors. For the third quarter, Figma projected revenue between $263 million and $265 million, which, while above analyst consensus, represents a slowing growth rate that has concerned the market after the stock's initial 250% surge on its first day of trading.

          <p>A Louisiana judge denied a request for bond reduction for Stanley Burkhardt, a 74-year-old former New Orleans police detective and convicted child molester. Prosecutors argued against his release, labeling him the "worst kind of offender" with a history of violating parole conditions, including his recent arrest for secretly using the internet to access photos of children. Burkhardt has been imprisoned six times for sex crimes since 1987, and the judge's decision keeps his bond at $100,000, ensuring he remains in custody pending the outcome of his parole violation case.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed that the UK government is considering a digital ID program as a potential tool to address illegal immigration and employment. Starmer suggested that such a system could play an "important part" in reducing incentives for unauthorized entry into the country, noting that public perception has evolved since previous debates over physical ID cards. Officials are reportedly examining how a digital ID could streamline identity verification for employers, reduce the use of fraudulent documents, and better target enforcement activities.</p>

          <h2>A Look Back at the History of Puns and Punsters in The Atlantic's Archives</h2>

          <p>This article explores the long and often contentious history of puns within the pages of The Atlantic, dating back to co-founder Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. in 1857. Despite frequent denunciations of the pun as a low form of humor, the magazine's archives are filled with examples of wordplay from various authors over the decades. The piece humorously tracks the changing attitudes toward puns, from their high favor in the 19th century to their modern status as "wise-cracks," while celebrating the timelessness of a well-executed (or groan-inducing) pun.</p>

          <h2>Polling Reveals Shifting American Attitudes on Childhood Vaccine Mandates</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a majority of Americans still support requiring childhood vaccinations for school attendance, public opinion has shifted significantly over the past few decades, largely along partisan lines. Recent polls show that Republicans are now much less likely than Democrats to believe childhood vaccinations are important and are more likely to oppose government mandates. This growing divide coincides with a rise in misinformation, although surveys suggest that for many opponents, the issue is more about parental rights and personal freedom than specific safety concerns about the vaccines themselves.</p>

          <p>This article examines the crucial decision of when to claim Social Security benefits to maximize retirement income. While claiming as early as age 62 is an option, it results in a permanently reduced monthly payment, whereas waiting until age 70 can significantly increase the benefit amount by about 8% for each year delayed past full retirement age. The best choice depends on individual circumstances, including health, other income sources, and immediate financial needs. The article suggests strategies like using other retirement accounts or creating bond ladders to bridge the income gap and allow benefits to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

European farmers are concerned about unfair competition from agricultural imports like beef, while environmental groups warn that the deal could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon. To fast-track ratification, the Commission has structured the deal to require approval at the EU level rather than from individual national parliaments, a move critics argue bypasses democratic scrutiny on a controversial agreement.</p>
