          <p>Despite much of the world moving past the coronavirus pandemic, many Japanese hospitals continue to enforce strict visitation policies, causing distress for families wanting to see their loved ones. A group of physicians and social workers is now advocating for these restrictions to be lifted or significantly reduced, arguing they infringe on human rights. They cite the lack of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of visitation restrictions in preventing infection spread, and the importance of family visits for hospitalized patients' well-being. The health ministry has recommended considering visitation opportunities while maintaining infection control, but the final decision is left to individual hospitals, leading to inconsistent policies across the country.</p>

          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, was arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist. The victim, who arrived in New York on May 6th, was reportedly lured to Woeltz's home under the pretense of retrieving Bitcoin he had previously been forced to send the suspect. According to prosecutors, the victim was tied up and subjected to torture for several weeks, including being shocked with electric wires and having his leg cut with a saw, and forced to smoke crack cocaine. The victim escaped and alerted authorities, who found evidence including photos of a firearm pointed at the victim's head.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Scientific Reports indicates that a dog owner's work-related stress and rumination can negatively impact their dog's well-being. Researchers found that dog owners who frequently dwell on work problems at home are more likely to have dogs exhibiting stress-related behaviors such as whining, pacing, and restlessness. This "crossover" effect suggests that dogs are sensitive to their owners' moods and can pick up on stress through subtle cues, or that owners focused on work may be less attentive to their dog's needs. The study emphasizes the importance of employed dog owners separating work from home life to protect their pet's well-being.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning proved decisive as the New York Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-2. After Dodgers pitcher Tony Gonsolin loaded the bases with two walks, Soto capitalized with a hit that sent Citi Field into a frenzy. Gonsolin, making an important start for the Dodgers after their bullpen was taxed in a previous extra-inning game, struggled with command in the fourth, ultimately leading to Soto's game-changing hit. Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively, lasting nearly eight innings, striking out seven, and inducing three double plays.</p>

          <p>A woman in the UK, Lucy Connolly, was sentenced to 31 months in jail for inciting racial hatred after posting a racist tweet in response to a false rumor. The tweet called for setting fire to hotels housing asylum seekers, which led to a debate over free speech and the proportionality of the sentence. Supporters argue that the sentence is excessive and infringes on free speech, while critics contend that it is a necessary consequence for inciting violence. The case has also raised concerns about police overreach in monitoring online activity and the limits of free speech online.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is implementing new restrictions on journalists covering the Pentagon, limiting access to many areas unless accompanied by a government escort. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth cited the need to protect national security as the reason for the changes, which ban reporters from areas including the offices of Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Pentagon Press Association has expressed deep concern, calling the move a direct attack on the freedom of the press, while the National Press Club is urging the Pentagon to reverse course.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap if the party gains power. This commitment comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces pressure from Labour MPs to address both policies, highlighting divisions within the Labour party. Reform UK plans to fund these policies by cutting net zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The move is seen as an attempt to outflank Labour on key social issues.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, leading to visitor complaints and concerns about potential health issues. The small flies have been found on walls and pillars, forcing people to avoid swallowing them. While the midges do not bite, dead ones can cause allergic reactions if inhaled, leading officials to advise mask-wearing for those with asthma. The expo organizer is taking action by spraying insecticide, treating areas with a growth inhibitor, and installing insect repellent lights.</p>

          <p>New York City's beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, a number that falls short of full staffing but is higher than last year's initial count.

Despite the shortage, beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, and city officials are hopeful that staffing will increase as summer progresses. The city is also making efforts to recruit and train new lifeguards by partnering with public schools and offering practice sessions.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author, journalist, and activist, died at 90. Her book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape" challenged conventional perceptions of sexual assault, reframing it as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. The book contributed to societal shifts, including the establishment of rape-crisis centers and legal reforms. Despite facing criticism, Brownmiller remained a prominent voice in discussions about sexual violence and female empowerment, though her views on contemporary issues sometimes sparked controversy.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his summer concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. The condition, caused by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, is treatable but often underdiagnosed, and doctors hope Joel's announcement will raise awareness. Symptoms include problems with walking, cognitive issues, and urinary incontinence, which can be mistaken for normal signs of aging. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt to drain excess fluid, and early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve a patient's quality of life.</p>
