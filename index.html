          <p>For the first time, Taiwan will participate in Japan's annual memorial ceremonies for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The city of Nagasaki reversed an earlier decision and accepted Taiwan's request to attend the August 9th event, a move that is being closely watched by Beijing. Last year, Nagasaki controversially excluded Israel from the ceremony due to its actions in Gaza. This year's invitation was extended to all countries with diplomatic missions in Japan, a category Taiwan does not officially fall into, but the city accommodated the island's expressed desire to attend.</p>

          <p>A Scottish paramedic has been sentenced to ten years and six months in prison for secretly administering an abortion drug to his pregnant girlfriend, causing her to have a miscarriage. Stephen Doohan, 33, who was married at the time of the relationship, injected the woman with the drug under the guise of consensual sexual activity after learning she was pregnant with his child. The judge described the crime as a planned and manipulative act that caused the victim immense pain and loss. Doohan pleaded guilty to assault, sexual assault, and causing an abortion.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks' official social media account took a jab at the Indiana Fever following a close win, referencing recent controversial comments made by Fever player Sophie Cunningham. The post listed Los Angeles as another city Indiana has "beef with," alluding to Cunningham's remarks questioning the appeal of new WNBA expansion cities like Detroit and Cleveland. Cunningham had previously clarified her comments, stating she was referring to the off-court lifestyle and not speaking down on the cities themselves. The social media post added another layer to the on-court rivalry between the two teams.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis, supported by insights from prominent economists and investors, examines the escalating U.S. national deficit and its potential to spark a major crisis. The report highlights three primary areas of risk: market instability, economic strain, and weakened international relations. Experts like Ray Dalio warn of a high probability of market trauma, while others point to the long-term dangers of inflation and a reduced government capacity for emergencies. The Penn Wharton Budget Model suggests the U.S. has less than two decades to correct its fiscal path before even drastic measures may be insufficient. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A critical analysis in The Atlantic argues that the nationwide Medicaid work requirement included in the president's new domestic legislation is a deceptive and harmful policy. The article contends that the rule is not about preventing fraud, as most eligible adults already work, but is rather a "work-reporting" requirement designed to create bureaucratic hurdles. This red tape is predicted to cause millions to lose health coverage due to administrative complexities, not a refusal to work. The piece concludes that the policy will ultimately burden taxpayers with high overhead costs while failing to improve the labor market.</p>

          <p>Recent polling in Germany indicates a continued decline in support for the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), which would receive only 13% of the vote if an election were held now. Conversely, the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has gained ground, polling at 30%. The far-right AfD remains strong at 23%. The poll also reveals shifts in public perception, with more Germans trusting the CDU/CSU to secure peace in Europe over the historically peace-focused SPD.

The article suggests that while it is easy to rally against the food industry, the multifaceted nature of America's sleep problem lacks a clear enemy to organize against.

          <p>The development of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline in Uganda is causing profound disruption for thousands of local residents, displacing them from ancestral lands and fracturing families. The project, led by French energy giant Total, promises economic benefits but has severed spiritual connections to burial grounds and created social strife, with compensation money sometimes leading to family breakdowns. Residents also face environmental and health challenges from construction, such as damaged water sources and constant noise. The article highlights the hidden social costs of large-scale energy projects, which often leave communities feeling powerless and undervalued.</p>

          <p>Tropical Depression Chantal, after making landfall in the Carolinas, brought heavy rainfall that caused significant flash flooding across North Carolina, prompting numerous water rescues. The storm system led to a state of emergency declaration in Orange County and voluntary evacuation notices near the Lake Michael dam due to fears of its failure. Although downgraded from a tropical storm, Chantal continues to move northeast, with flood watches posted for several mid-Atlantic states. The Haw River in North Carolina crested at near-record levels, highlighting the severity of the rainfall and its widespread impact on local infrastructure.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Wiaan Mulder, captaining the team for the first time, chose to declare his team's innings while he was personally on a score of 367 not out. This decision meant he passed up the chance to break Brian Lara's iconic Test cricket record of 400 runs in a single innings, falling just 33 runs short. Mulder's declaration came during the second Test against Zimbabwe, prioritizing the team's strategic position over his individual shot at history. His score still stands as the fifth-highest individual innings in Test history and the best ever by a South African player.</p>

          <p>Russia launched another massive aerial assault on Ukraine, firing over 100 drones at civilian areas overnight, resulting in at least 10 deaths and dozens of injuries. The attacks come as Russia intensifies its strikes and attempts to break through Ukrainian lines. In a related development, the Kremlin dismissed its transport minister following a weekend of severe travel chaos, where hundreds of flights were grounded at major Russian airports due to the threat of Ukrainian drone attacks.

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet at the White House, presenting a united front after recent joint strikes against Iran. However, the meeting is shadowed by the ongoing war in Gaza and whether a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal can be finalized. While both leaders have expressed optimism, a key sticking point remains whether a deal for a 60-day pause and hostage release will lead to a permanent end to the war. The discussions are seen as critical for Mr. Trump's broader vision for Middle East peace, including normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.</p>

Currently, leave is only legally mandated for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. The move, praised by campaigners like Myleene Klass, is seen as a significant step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement and destigmatizing the experience for families.</p>

According to analysts from China International Capital Corporation, attempts to solve the problem by cutting supply have failed.
