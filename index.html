          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle, the second major hurricane of the Atlantic season, is forecast to weaken as it crosses the Atlantic but could still impact the United Kingdom. Current weather models are in disagreement, but there is a possibility it will bring a wet and windy end to an already rainy September for the UK. The potential storm follows a period of above-average rainfall in England and Wales, though a high-pressure system is expected to bring drier weather during the week. The final path of the storm's remnants remains uncertain as it approaches Europe over the weekend.</p>

          <p>An animal handler, Ryan Easley, was killed by a large tiger during a show at the Growler Pines Tiger Preserve in Oklahoma. The attack occurred inside a cage in front of onlookers, including Easley's wife and daughter. The preserve, which has canceled all tours, stated the incident is a tragic reminder of the unpredictability of wild animals, while animal rights groups like PETA highlighted the inherent dangers of using such animals in performances. The tiger involved was reportedly one of two obtained in 2012 from the zoo formerly operated by "Tiger King" Joe Exotic.</p>

          <p>A White House proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications is causing significant concern among U.S. startups and venture capitalists. Founders argue the high cost would make it prohibitive for early-stage companies to hire essential foreign talent in skilled fields like engineering, disproportionately harming their ability to scale and compete with larger corporations. Immigration experts and VCs warn this could stifle innovation, reduce venture capital investment in the U.S., and potentially reverse the "brain drain" by pushing skilled workers toward more welcoming markets.

          <p>Comedian Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to his late-night show after being suspended by Disney for comments made about the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The suspension, which followed threats from the FCC chairman to revoke ABC's broadcast license, sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, drawing criticism from First Amendment advocates and support from hundreds of celebrities. While Disney stated the decision to reinstate the show came after "thoughtful conversations," major affiliate groups like Sinclair have announced they will not air the program's return, replacing it with news programming.</p>

          <p>Denmark's Prime Minister has described the drone incident that shut down Copenhagen's Kastrup airport for several hours as "the most severe attack on Danish infrastructure so far." The incursion, involving multiple large drones, impacted around 20,000 passengers and is being treated as a potential act of sabotage designed to create unrest and test the country's response. While the perpetrators are unknown, officials have not ruled out Russian involvement, linking the event to recent airspace violations in other NATO-aligned European countries.

          <p>Lawyers for Sean "Diddy" Combs are requesting a sentence of no more than 14 months, which would result in his immediate release, following his conviction on two prostitution-related charges. In a submission to a federal judge, the defense detailed his harsh prison conditions, including being under constant suicide watch and facing threats from other inmates, arguing he has been punished enough. They contend his career and reputation have been destroyed, and that a jury's acquittal on more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges should be a key factor in the sentencing. Prosecutors are expected to recommend a substantially longer prison term.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has forecast that the United Kingdom will experience the highest inflation rate among G7 advanced economies in 2025. The OECD raised its UK inflation forecast to 3.5%, citing factors like higher food costs, while slightly increasing the growth forecast to 1.4%. However, UK economic growth is expected to slow to 1% next year due to a tighter fiscal stance and increased trade costs. The report comes as the government prepares for a budget that may include tax increases or spending cuts to manage borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's President Xi Jinping became the first national leader to attend the anniversary celebration of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, arriving in Urumqi for its 70th anniversary. This high-profile visit underscores Beijing's focus on ethnic unity and the integration of minority groups under Xi's concept of a unified "Chinese nation community." The move comes as Beijing continues to emphasize national identity over individual ethnic identities and warns against foreign extremist ideologies. Observers anticipate the visit may signal increased pressure on the region, which is home to at least 10 million predominantly Muslim Uygurs.</p>

Research suggests that many men are socialized to suppress emotions and rely solely on a romantic partner for emotional intimacy, leaving them unmoored when single. This emotional bottling can also hinder their ability to form deep platonic friendships, further isolating them. Experts suggest that for men to find greater fulfillment, they must move beyond rigid masculine ideals, embrace vulnerability, and build diverse social support networks beyond the pursuit of a single romantic relationship.</p>

Government ministers are meeting with JLR and its suppliers to discuss support measures, as politicians and unions warn of potentially disastrous consequences if parts of the supply chain collapse.

The 2023 survey found that 64% of respondents support new apartments on streets with primarily single-family homes, and 59% are in favor of more apartments in their local area. This widespread support was consistent across most City Council districts. The article argues that city leaders, including Mayor Karen Bass, should use this data to pursue more aggressive housing policies and stop catering to a vocal minority that does not represent the broader public consensus.</p>

The departure of respected journalists over the years is presented as evidence of this trend, where live broadcast rights and viral content take precedence over in-depth reporting.

This phenomenon, often associated with social media influencers, can also be a way to feminize traditionally masculine names.

Nearly 40% of eighth-graders now score below basic levels on the Nation’s Report Card, erasing years of progress for many student groups. The report identifies causes including the pandemic, weakened academic expectations, a shortage of qualified teachers, and ideological battles over teaching methods.

          <p>The iconic Britpop band Pulp has made a triumphant return with "More," their first studio album in 24 years, which debuted at No. 1 in the U.K. Frontman Jarvis Cocker reflects on the band's long journey from obscurity in the 1980s to fame in the '90s and their eventual hiatus after 2001. The new album was recorded in just three weeks, a stark contrast to the lengthy production of their previous efforts, which Cocker attributes to a relaxed environment and the readiness of the material. The band is currently on a North American tour, including two shows at the Hollywood Bowl.</p>

          <p>In a televised interview, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed her relationship with California Governor Gavin Newsom, particularly an anecdote from her new book where he failed to return her call when she sought his presidential campaign support. Harris downplayed any tension, stating Newsom has a "great sense of humor." She also voiced strong support for Proposition 50, a controversial California ballot measure championed by Newsom that would redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats. Harris framed the measure as a necessary tactic to "fight fire with fire" against Republican-led redistricting efforts in other states.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill requiring data centers to report their water usage, a move driven by the boom in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. These facilities, which are often located in arid western states, can consume vast amounts of water for cooling their servers. The legislation, now awaiting the governor's signature, would mandate that both new and existing data centers disclose their projected and actual annual water consumption. This aims to help local communities plan for water scarcity and prevent a single industry from placing excessive strain on a vital resource, especially as droughts and high temperatures become more common.</p>

At 81, he is one of the world's longest-serving leaders, with a tenure praised by supporters for bringing stability and economic growth but condemned by critics for democratic backsliding and corruption. While the nation has seen diversification in its agriculture sector and anticipates an oil boom, concerns persist over human rights abuses, suppression of political opposition, and a lack of press freedom. Critics argue that rising electoral violence and harassment of dissenters continue to undermine the country's democratic processes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A novel process called phytomining is being developed to extract valuable metals like nickel from the ground using hyperaccumulating plants. These unique species naturally absorb high concentrations of metals from the soil and store them in their leaves and stems. After harvesting and incinerating the plants, the resulting "bio-ore" can be processed to yield pure metals, offering a climate-friendly alternative to conventional mining. While the method is currently being trialed in places like Albania for nickel, its scalability remains a challenge. Experts believe it is unlikely to replace industrial mining but could empower smaller communities to clean contaminated land while generating income.</p>
