          <p>During a WNBA playoff game between the Indiana Fever and the Atlanta Dream, player Sophie Cunningham was involved in a verbal exchange with an Atlanta police officer at center court. The confrontation occurred during an injury timeout with just over four minutes remaining in the game. Cunningham, who is sidelined with an injury alongside teammate Caitlin Clark, later posted a photo of the encounter on social media with a caption celebrating her "aura." Despite the absence of its stars, the Fever won the game and the series, advancing to the next round of the playoffs.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Ryan Routh, the individual accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year. Routh, who is representing himself, allegedly conducted surveillance for a month before hiding in bushes with a military-grade rifle, coming within yards of the former president before being spotted by the Secret Service. The prosecution's final witness detailed how receipts were used to track Routh's movements. Routh faces five criminal charges, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, and plans to call three witnesses for his defense.</p>

          <p>Alexander Acosta, the former U.S. attorney who negotiated Jeffrey Epstein's widely criticized 2008 plea deal, defended his actions during a six-hour testimony before the House Oversight Committee. Democrats on the committee described Acosta as unremorseful and evasive, while he maintained that a potential loss in federal court could have been perceived as a green light for Epstein to continue his crimes. The non-prosecution agreement allowed Epstein to plead guilty to lesser state charges and granted immunity to his associates, a decision that has drawn scrutiny for its leniency and for not informing the numerous victims.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military executed a third "lethal kinetic strike" on a vessel suspected of trafficking narcotics in international waters, resulting in the deaths of three individuals described as "narcoterrorists." This action is part of a broader administration strategy to target drug cartels, some of which have been designated as terrorist organizations. The strikes have drawn criticism from some Democratic lawmakers who argue they lack legal justification and represent a constitutional overreach. The White House has maintained that the actions are within the president's authority as commander in chief to protect U.S. national security interests.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, which would involve a sale to a group of American investors, including Oracle. However, Chinese state media presented a more ambiguous stance, stating that Beijing welcomes negotiations, with the ownership of TikTok's powerful algorithm remaining a key point of contention. The deal aims to address U.S. national security concerns over the app's data collection practices and its ties to the Chinese government. Trump noted that a formal signing process is still required to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old Sikh woman who has lived in California for over three decades, has caused shock and mobilized community support. Kaur, who had been reporting to immigration authorities for 13 years after her asylum appeals were denied, was detained by ICE during a routine check-in. Her family and lawyer state that her deportation has been stalled for years because she lacks the necessary travel documents from India. This case highlights the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement policies, which critics argue are targeting long-term residents without criminal records who have followed legal processes.</p>

          <p>A short-term government funding bill passed by the Republican-led House failed to advance in the Senate, leaving no clear path to avoid a shutdown before the October 1 deadline. The House GOP's bill, which would fund the government until November 21, was blocked by Senate Democrats who oppose the lack of negotiation on their priorities, such as healthcare funding. With both chambers now in recess, the stalemate intensifies pressure to find a bipartisan solution. President Trump acknowledged the possibility of a shutdown, stating the country could be "closed for a period of time" if an agreement is not reached.</p>

The departure, which President Trump publicly called for, raises concerns about prosecutorial independence and the politicization of the Justice Department, leaving a key office without confirmed leadership.

This shift moves away from a broad, universal recommendation for the vaccine and could create confusion and decrease uptake, as it places a greater burden on patients to initiate the process.

          <p>Sculptor Martin Jennings has been selected to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II for her national memorial, which will be located in London's St James's Park. Jennings, known for his depictions of King Charles III and the Queen Mother, stated his intention to capture the "grandeur and dignity" of Britain's longest-reigning monarch. The final design for the statue and the surrounding memorial, which will also feature a tribute to Prince Philip, is set to be revealed in 2026. The project will involve re-landscaping a section of the park and requires approval from the King and the prime minister.</p>

          <p>Russia has revived Intervision, a Soviet-era song contest, as its alternative to Eurovision, from which it was banned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The event, a brainchild of Vladimir Putin, features 23 participating countries, primarily from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, reflecting Russia's current political and economic alliances. The Kremlin-backed contest aims to promote traditional cultural values and project an image of international cooperation. Critics, particularly in Ukraine, view the event as a propaganda tool designed to whitewash Russia's aggressive foreign policy and divert global attention from the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy, promoting his new film "Steve," has reflected on his long-running role as Tommy Shelby in "Peaky Blinders," emphasizing that he is nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed. Murphy described playing the character for nearly a quarter of his life as a defining privilege, allowing him to grow older with the role in a way that is rare for actors. He also confirmed that a "Peaky Blinders" film is forthcoming from Netflix but kept plot details confidential. His new film, "Steve," follows his character's efforts to manage a reform school for troubled boys in the 1990s.</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement agents used tear gas and pepper balls to disperse approximately 100 demonstrators outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Chicago. Protesters, including two Democratic congressional candidates, had gathered to oppose the administration's "Operation Midway Blitz" immigration crackdown and were attempting to block government vehicles. The clashes resulted in at least three arrests and were described by participants as a "violent abuse of power." The demonstration follows the fatal shooting of a man by an immigration officer in the Chicago area the previous week, further heightening tensions over federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>UCLA has released new, formalized rules for campus protests, many of which align with demands from the Trump administration to crack down on demonstrations. The guidelines, which come as the university faces a potential loss of federal research funding, ban unauthorized overnight encampments and demonstrations in certain areas like Royce Quad, the site of a major pro-Palestinian protest in 2024. However, the rules also expand some free speech zones and do not incorporate all federal demands, such as screening foreign students for "anti-Western" views. University officials state the policies aim to balance free speech with campus safety in a content-neutral manner.</p>

          <p>Estonia has formally requested an urgent Article 4 consultation with its NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes over the Gulf of Finland. The Estonian government condemned the act as a "brazen" and "dangerous provocation," prompting NATO to immediately scramble jets from Italy, Finland, and Sweden to intercept the aircraft. This marks the second time in a week a NATO member has invoked Article 4, which triggers formal consultations within the alliance. The incident significantly raises tensions along NATO's eastern flank amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>
