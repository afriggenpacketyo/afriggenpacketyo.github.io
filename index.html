          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University student with permanent US residency, was detained by ICE in mid-April after attending a citizenship interview.  His lawyers argued the arrest was retaliation for his pro-Palestinian advocacy.  A Vermont judge ordered his release on bail, pending a court ruling on a habeas petition, with the judge rejecting a government request to delay the release. Mahdawi expressed his relief and continued commitment to peace and anti-war activism.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are impacting even his preferred mode of transportation: golf carts.  While Club Car and E-Z-Go assemble carts in the US, they source components globally, highlighting the complexities of 'Made in America' claims.  The US imported 99% of its fully assembled golf carts from China in 2024, and potential tariffs on these imports could force domestic manufacturers to raise prices or reduce profit margins, illustrating the broader impact of Trump's trade war.</p>
