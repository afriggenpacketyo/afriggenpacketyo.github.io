          <p>The article discusses the potential delay in the availability of updated COVID-19 and flu vaccines this fall due to new clinical testing requirements. The Department of Health and Human Services announced that substantial updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation, potentially impacting the rollout of these shots. Experts express concerns that these new limits could undermine the vaccine infrastructure, while others question the necessity of annual booster shots for younger, healthy individuals. The debate continues regarding the risk-based strategy for vaccine recommendations, particularly for children under 12, and the CDC's role in data collection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An internal review reveals that FEMA is "not ready" for the upcoming hurricane season due to staff cuts and a push to shift emergency response duties to the states. The review cites culture issues, staffing shortages, and challenges in coordinating with other federal agencies as contributing factors. The agency's new acting leader, David Richardson, has expressed support for shrinking FEMA and increasing cost-sharing with states. The article notes that FEMA has faced turbulence in recent months, including layoffs and criticisms from President Trump regarding its handling of prior natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, a larger drop than economists had anticipated, marking the first quarterly contraction in a year. This news arrives amidst ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., and the Bank of Japan recently cautioned that the country's economy is likely to moderate due to global trade policies. While the central bank seems poised to continue raising its policy rate, some board members have warned that the economic outlook remains uncertain. Despite growth concerns, inflation in Japan has exceeded the BOJ's 2% target for three consecutive years, reaching 3.6% in April.</p>

          <p>A committee of MPs is calling for a year-long delay to proposed changes to farm inheritance tax, warning that the changes were made without adequate consultation or assessment. The government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m at a rate of 20% starting in April 2026, which has led to protests from farmers across the UK. The committee's report suggests that delaying the implementation would give farmers more time to seek professional advice, while the NFU president says the policy remains fundamentally unfit and must be changed. The committee also criticizes the government's closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive.</p>

          <p>DannyLux, a singer-songwriter, released his new album, “Leyenda,” composed of 19 tracks that capture his signature melancholy. The album's title comes from the fact that the original songs were stolen from his engineer's car. This incident motivated DannyLux to write entirely new songs, resulting in the creation of a short film to illustrate an alternate reality if he didn't pursue his passions. The album bends the rules of traditional regional music with psychedelic pop fusions, and wah-wah pedals, as DannyLux offers a softer side to Mexican regional music.</p>
