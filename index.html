          <p>The United States military is intensifying its development of AI-driven air combat systems by testing the integration of crewed fighter jets with uncrewed XQ-58A Valkyrie drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in F-16 and F-15E jets successfully controlled multiple drones, demonstrating advancements in the "loyal wingman" concept. This strategic push aims to maintain air supremacy as China rapidly develops similar collaborative combat aircraft capabilities. The tests represent a critical step in deploying semi-autonomous systems to enhance the effectiveness and safety of military pilots in potential future conflicts.</p>

          <p>A growing number of single individuals, particularly among Gen Z, are utilizing artificial intelligence to navigate the complexities of online dating. According to a study by Match.com and The Kinsey Institute, one in four singles now use AI tools to help craft compelling messages, refine their profiles, and analyze conversations. Apps like Rizz and Keepler offer AI-driven advice, acting as a virtual 'wingman' to boost confidence and improve communication. While some users find these tools helpful for breaking the ice, experts caution against over-reliance, stressing that AI should supplement, not substitute, genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>Philanthropist Bill Gates has condemned the Trump administration's decision to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), warning of its severe humanitarian consequences. Following the agency's absorption into the State Department, reports have emerged of critical shortages in HIV medication for children and other essential medical supplies in Africa. Gates described the cuts as a "huge mistake" that has already led to preventable deaths and disrupted vital health programs. He emphasized that it is not too late for the administration to reverse its course and reinstate the crucial international aid funding.</p>

Lula indicated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will utilize a reciprocity law, escalating the risk of a trade war between the two major economies.

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, which alleges the company uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit young users. The state's attorney general argues that TikTok is intentionally designed to maximize engagement among children and teens, putting them at risk. The court ruled that the state's claims about the app's dangerous features were specific enough to move forward, distinguishing them from protected user-generated content. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions targeting the design and safety policies of major tech platforms.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure was marked by significant events, including leading the police response to the 7/7 London bombings. However, his career was also defined by controversy, particularly the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, whom officers mistook for a suicide bomber. Despite being cleared of personal wrongdoing, the incident led to sustained pressure, and he ultimately resigned after losing the confidence of then-mayor Boris Johnson. He is remembered as an influential and dedicated public servant.</p>

After the match, Djokovic acknowledged that age and physical wear are becoming significant factors in his performance against younger, sharper opponents. The result sets up a highly anticipated final between Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, a rematch of their epic five-set French Open final from last month.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions against journalists covering protests. The ruling comes after a lawsuit filed by press rights organizations, which argued that LAPD officers were deliberately targeting and injuring reporters during recent demonstrations against federal immigration policies. The judge's order bars police from using such weapons on journalists who are not posing an imminent threat and forbids officers from interfering with their right to gather information. The decision is being hailed as a significant victory for press freedom.</p>

The court ruled that the Secretary of Defense had the authority to withdraw from the agreement, a move made after it was initially approved.

The conflict arises from John Textor's 43% stake in Palace and his ownership of French club Lyon, which also qualified for the same competition. Because Lyon finished higher in its domestic league, it receives precedence, and Palace is relegated to the less prestigious Conference League. Palace argues Textor does not have decisive influence and missed a key deadline to alter its ownership structure, a step Nottingham Forest took to resolve a similar conflict.</p>
