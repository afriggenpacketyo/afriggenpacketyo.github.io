          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos intends to sell up to 25 million shares of Amazon stock over the next year, valued at approximately $4.8 billion. This decision follows Amazon's recent first-quarter earnings report, which exceeded expectations despite a cautious forecast for operating income amid concerns about President Trump's new tariffs. Bezos's previous stock sale occurred last year, when he offloaded about $13.5 billion worth of shares. Since stepping down as CEO, Bezos has focused on his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his climate and biodiversity fund, using Amazon share sales to fund these ventures. </p>

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 seeks to cut 22% of non-defense discretionary spending while increasing defense spending to over $1 trillion. The proposal would slash non-defense discretionary spending by $163 billion from current levels, resulting in the lowest level since 2017. The budget aims to reduce bureaucracy and prioritize American interests, with significant cuts to foreign aid. Spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid remains untouched, although they continue to be major drivers of the federal deficit. </p>

Some MPs feel the government isn't appearing "Labour enough," leading voters to question its purpose. A defeated Labour councillor described the party as one that "just isn't Labour enough" due to a combination of policies. </p>

The fund will invest in projects for extracting fossil fuels, oil, and gas, as well as related infrastructure and recycling, with the first 10 years of profits reinvested in Ukraine.

The White House calls the current system "dysfunctional" and aims to focus federal subsidies on the elderly and disabled by imposing a two-year cap on rental assistance for able-bodied adults. Advocates warn that these cuts could lead to a significant increase in homelessness. The plan also includes a 12% reduction in HUD funding for homelessness and proposes a shift in how homelessness funding is allocated, bypassing local nonprofits and giving money directly to states. </p>

          <p>A major oil spill off Louisiana's Gulf Coast is raising alarms as DOGE job cuts may threaten response efforts, contaminating marshlands and threatening wildlife habitats and fisheries. The leak, originating from a "well blowout," could potentially reach a major spill threshold of over 100,000 gallons. The Coast Guard has collected over 30,000 gallons of an "oily watery mixture" and deployed containment booms. Concerns are growing due to recent layoffs at NOAA, including personnel from the Emergency Response Division, which is crucial for addressing oil spills. </p>

          <p>President Trump is attempting to secure Americaâ€™s supply of minerals through efforts like streamlining permitting for mineral production and investing in U.S. mining companies. However, his administration is simultaneously undermining policies that would create demand for these minerals, such as clean-tech manufacturing incentives. This creates a paradox, as the country is smoothing the path for mineral production while diminishing its primary destinations. Syrah Resources, a graphite supplier, exemplifies this issue, as it faces challenges due to the Trump administration's policies despite initially benefiting from policies like the Inflation Reduction Act under the Biden administration. </p>

The study identified two powerful antibodies from Mr. Freide's blood that, when combined with a drug, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species.
