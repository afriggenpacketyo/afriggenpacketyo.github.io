            <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is currently projected to be lower than recent years, potentially around 2.2% to 2.3%. This is due to current inflation data, but this could change if President Trump's proposed tariffs are implemented. Economists expect tariffs to raise consumer prices, which may lead to a higher COLA for 2026. The Social Security Administration determines the annual COLA based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is considering overhauling the $1.6 trillion federal student loan system, which could impact repayment plans and loan forgiveness eligibility. Experts predict that the SAVE plan, introduced by former President Biden, is unlikely to survive legal challenges under the new administration. Changes may also include an end to loan forgiveness under other income-driven repayment plans and narrowed eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). These changes aim to cut unnecessary red tape and streamline federal student aid programs.</p>

            <p>A bipartisan duo of House lawmakers is introducing the Securing America’s Federal Equipment (SAFE) Supply Chains Act, aiming to prevent the U.S. government from purchasing technology made in China.

The bill would require federal agencies to purchase technology only from original equipment manufacturers or authorized resellers. This bill seeks to address concerns about Chinese aggression in artificial intelligence and cyberattacks, aligning with Trump's stance on reducing U.S. dependency on China.</p>

            <p>China's National Film Administration announced it will reduce the number of American films allowed to be shown in China due to escalating tariff tensions. This decision follows President Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese imports. Chinese officials stated that the U.S.'s abuse of tariffs will reduce domestic audiences' favorability towards American films. China, the world's second-largest film market, has been a crucial audience for Hollywood blockbusters.</p>

            <p>The "vibecession" is deepening, with financial security slipping further out of reach for Americans across all income levels, according to a CNBC|SurveyMonkey poll. Nearly half of Americans are more stressed than a year ago, citing inflation, high interest rates, and potential layoffs. Even six-figure earners are feeling the squeeze, with discretionary spending declining as more income is used to cover basic necessities. While some remain optimistic about their financial situation, many are concerned about the impact of future economic decline and tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Keir Starmer has admitted he has still not spoken to Donald Trump since the US president brought in trade tariffs, with government sources saying the UK was not given any advance warning of this week’s changes to US tariffs. Starmer defended his decision not to retaliate with tariffs, saying a trade war is in nobody’s interest. The UK is pressing for a reduction in tariffs through a trade deal and will also pursue other avenues for economic growth and agreements with other partners.</p>

            <p>A Senate committee heard from experts on setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. There is general consensus that the system needs to be changed, but disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time. An alternative has been discussed to pick daylight saving time, but letting states opt out. Some studies link the annual transition to daylight saving time to increased strokes, heart attacks and teen sleep deprivation.</p>

            <p>The threat of tariffs has created a gold rush on America's auto lots as manufacturers are offering big discounts and some buyers are racing to shop before prices rise. However, it's a boom driven by anxiety, with some warning signs for the economy. Some shoppers are delaying plans to buy a vehicle because they're worried about their jobs being at risk, or they are trying to build savings in case of a recession. Tariffs on new cars will increase demand for used cars, while tariffs on parts will push up the cost to repair them. (not investment advice)</p>

The average MLB salary hasn't kept pace with the league's increase in revenue, suggesting that a salary cap/revenue-sharing system could be beneficial for both teams and players.
