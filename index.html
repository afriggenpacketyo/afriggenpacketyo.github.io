          <p>Erika Kirk, widow of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, delivered an emotional address following his assassination at a Utah university, transforming her grief into a "battle cry" for his cause. She vowed to continue his political activism through Turning Point USA, asserting that the movement he built would not die and promising to ensure his name is never forgotten. Kirk expressed gratitude to President Trump, Vice President Vance, and first responders, while also sharing a poignant moment about explaining her husband's death to their young daughter, highlighting her unwavering faith. Her powerful speech underscored a commitment to preserving his legacy and expanding the organization's influence across the nation.</p>

          <p>A Mexican congressional staffer resigned after making controversial comments on television regarding Charlie Kirk's assassination, following pressure from the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State. Christopher Landau warned that "foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome" and threatened visa revocations. The staffer, Salvador Ramírez, facetiously suggested Kirk "was given a spoonful of his own chocolate" for promoting weapons, leading to a public apology from the Milenio news network and Ramírez's eventual resignation. This incident is part of a trend of individuals losing jobs globally for comments deemed offensive by American conservatives.</p>

          <p>Authorities have apprehended Tyler Robinson, 22, in connection with the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, marking a significant development in the investigation. Robinson, who is not a student, was identified and turned in with the assistance of his own family and faces charges including aggravated murder and obstruction of justice. Investigators recovered a high-powered rifle used in the shooting, noting unusual inscriptions on bullet casings such as "Hey fascist! CATCH!". While the official motive remains undisclosed, the article highlights President Trump's assertion that the killing stemmed from "radical left political violence," underscoring the political tensions surrounding the incident and the extensive manhunt that preceded the arrest.</p>

Dowdy pleaded guilty to multiple offenses, including two counts of second-degree manslaughter, assault-related charges, and driving under the influence of intoxicants. The collision occurred when Dowdy's pickup truck crossed the center line, striking a bus carrying ten members of the Umpqua Community College softball team, resulting in the deaths of head coach Jami Strinz and freshman Kiley Jones. The sentencing also includes three years of post-prison supervision and a lifetime revocation of his driver's license.</p>

The influx of new refugees from Myanmar's civil war further strained resources. The Thai government's decision aims to enable self-sufficiency and economic participation for refugees, potentially setting a regional benchmark for rights-based solutions, and also addressing a sharp decline in Thailand's migrant labor force.</p>

This demand marks a significant departure from current policies, with the EU having already banned maritime Russian oil but continuing some fossil fuel imports.

          <p>Following Charlie Kirk's assassination, a panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" engaged in a critical discussion about the online reactions and the broader discourse surrounding modern American political violence. Peter Baker of The New York Times observed a recurring pattern of regret and calls to "pull it back" after such events, yet expressed skepticism about whether these sentiments would lead to lasting societal change. The analysis explored how acts of political violence frequently trigger temporary condemnations and pleas for unity, but often fail to fundamentally alter the underlying divisive rhetoric. This pattern suggests a cycle where political violence exposes deep rifts without necessarily leading to enduring reconciliation or a transformation of the political landscape.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Fox News that the National Guard would be deployed to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of his crime crackdown in Democrat-led cities. Memphis Mayor Paul Young expressed his displeasure, stating he was not consulted and does not believe the National Guard is the solution to reducing crime, despite the city's high violent crime rates. This move escalates Trump's use of troops, following a recent deployment in Washington D.C., and raises concerns among legal experts about using military against civilians. Young emphasized the need for financial resources and police support rather than military intervention.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Brian Kilmeade generated significant controversy by suggesting "involuntary lethal injection" or "just kill 'em" for homeless individuals with mental health issues who refuse help. The comment, made during a discussion about a fatal stabbing involving a schizophrenic suspect, drew sharp criticism, including from California Governor Gavin Newsom. While co-hosts debated the need for mandatory intervention for the homeless, Kilmeade's extreme remark went viral, highlighting the harsh and often dehumanizing discourse surrounding the mental health and homelessness crisis in the United States.</p>

          <p>Nepal's major political parties are demanding the reinstatement of the parliament, which President Ram Chandra Poudel dissolved following deadly anti-corruption protests. The parties, including Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, and Maoist Centre, argue Poudel acted unconstitutionally by dissolving the House of Representatives upon the recommendation of interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki. Karki's appointment was a key demand of the "Gen Z" protest movement, which saw over 50 deaths. The political crisis highlights deep discontent with Nepal's elite, with parties insisting that addressing protesters' demands and holding new elections should occur through a democratically elected institution.</p>

Surveillance video shows agents attempting to apprehend Villegas-Gonzalez, who allegedly resisted and dragged an officer.

While praised by some as a proactive step in AI governance, critics argue it could stifle innovation or is overly narrow in its focus on extreme, unproven harms.
