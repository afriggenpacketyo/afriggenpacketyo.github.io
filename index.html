          <p>China has enacted a new private sector law aimed at curbing "profit-driven" enforcement that unfairly targets non-state businesses. The law seeks to address long-standing concerns about cross-regional enforcement and reinforces accountability for officials responsible for non-compliance. Analysts believe the law's key focus is regulating administrative acts and limiting administrative powers, with clear accountability mechanisms providing the law with "teeth." This legislation underscores Beijing's commitment to supporting the private sector amid economic pressures.</p>
