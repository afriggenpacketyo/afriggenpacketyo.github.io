          <p>A hiker who fell 30 feet down a waterfall in Butte County, California, was rescued by a helicopter after sustaining serious injuries. The rescue team, responding to an incident near Feather River Canyon and Camp Creek Falls, determined that the hiker could not be reached by ambulance in a timely manner, prompting the decision to use a helicopter. The injured man was harnessed to a 150-foot rope and flown to a landing zone before being transferred to Enloe FlightCare for medical attention.

He emphasized the potential for building a pipeline to export natural gas from Alaska to East Asian allies, enhancing America's geopolitical advantage. Wright also noted America's transformation from the largest importer of oil to a net exporter, contrasting it with China's position as the largest importer.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed reinstating an “asset test” for low-income and disabled Medi-Cal applicants, potentially affecting millions who rely on the program. The proposal aims to tackle rising costs by limiting eligibility to those with assets totaling less than $2,000, including the value of a person’s primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund. Disability and health advocates are criticizing the plan, arguing that it would force older adults and people with disabilities into extreme poverty. The state estimates that reinstating the test would save millions of dollars annually, but critics argue that the long-term costs could increase as people lose access to care and their conditions worsen.</p>

The National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan advises consumers to thoroughly vet business operators and avoid buying from websites that sell rice at unrealistically low prices. The average price of rice at supermarkets has risen to a record high due to a poor harvest, prompting the government to release rice stockpiles to curb prices.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to inflation and higher prices, despite ongoing convention traffic. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported a drop in visitors in March and April compared to the previous year, with hotel occupancy also slipping. Tourists are facing higher prices for coffee and other amenities, contributing to the perception that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation. The city is also dealing with heavy traffic due to construction and road closures, impacting the overall tourist experience.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-Israeli backed Gaza aid plan, operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has faced chaotic scenes and criticism. The GHF, aiming to bypass the UN as the main aid supplier, has been tasked with feeding hungry Gazans amid an Israeli blockade. The UN has stated that more than two million people are at risk of starvation. Reports indicate disorganization, lack of communication, and instances of violence at distribution sites, with concerns raised about the location of sites and the presence of armed security. Other aid organizations, like the World Food Programme (WFP), have also faced challenges, including warehouse looting.</p>

          <p>An Oval Office event billed as a press conference featured "soft" questions for Elon Musk during his White House send-off. The questions lacked probing inquiries about Musk's influence and actions during his time in the Trump administration.

One reporter asked about Musk's alleged drug use, but it was easily dismissed by attributing the story to the New York Times.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while decreasing reliance on China. He also said that $14bn would be invested into the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel. However, the impacts of Trump's tariffs have largely led to global economic chaos, upending global trade and markets.</p>
