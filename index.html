        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Singapore have made a significant stride in robotics by industrializing the production of remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, capable of assembly in just 68 seconds. This advancement, detailed in Nature Communications, has also refined the insects' maneuverability, increasing their turning radius to over 80 degrees, confirmed through extensive testing. This "insect robot factory" aims to create a cost-effective and rapidly deployable force for critical disaster relief and search missions, especially in hazardous or confined spaces where human intervention is challenging. The innovation promises to enhance future humanitarian efforts by providing a novel tool for locating survivors and assessing damage in catastrophic scenarios.</p>

          <p>Korean Air announced a substantial $36 billion deal to acquire 103 Boeing aircraft, encompassing 787, 777, and 737 passenger and cargo jets, aimed at modernizing its fleet and maintaining competitiveness amid its merger with Asiana Airlines. This significant agreement emerged shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with US President Donald Trump, who has been advocating for increased trade with American companies and had imposed tariffs on South Korea. The purchase, which also includes a $13.7 billion deal with GE Aerospace, is projected to support around 135,000 jobs in the United States, underscoring its economic impact. This article details how this move is part of a broader trend where countries negotiating trade agreements with the Trump administration have made large Boeing orders, despite the aviation giant's recent crises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cleveland Browns made a surprising move by trading veteran quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick. This decision deviates from earlier reports that the Browns might carry four quarterbacks on their 53-man roster. The Raiders, facing a need for a backup due to Aidan O’Connell’s wrist injury, acquired Pickett for his 25 starts and NFL experience. This article explains how the trade leaves the backup role behind Browns' starter Joe Flacco contested between rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders, with the final roster decisions due by Tuesday's deadline. Pickett's hamstring injury during training camp had previously hampered his competition for a spot in Cleveland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced the immediate removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of false statements on mortgage applications as "sufficient cause." This unprecedented move escalates Trump's ongoing conflict with the US central bank over interest rates and is expected to face legal challenges, as Fed governors typically serve 14-year terms and can only be fired "for cause." Senator Elizabeth Warren condemned the action as an "authoritarian power grab" that violates the Federal Reserve Act. Cook, the first Black woman in the role, stated she is gathering accurate information to address the four-year-old allegations, which were first publicly raised by a Trump ally.

These devices are now strictly permitted only in carry-on bags, ensuring that passengers or flight attendants can swiftly address any overheating or fire incidents within the cabin. This regulation aims to prevent potential hazards in the inaccessible cargo hold, where fires could escalate unnoticed. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has documented 644 verified incidents of lithium batteries causing smoke, fire, or extreme heat since 2006, highlighting the serious safety implications for air travel and the importance of adhering to these guidelines.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has labeled illegal immigration a "scourge" affecting the UK on an "historic and unprecedented" scale, as he outlined his party's stringent plans to tackle small boat crossings. His proposals include detaining and deporting illegal arrivals, banning them from claiming asylum, and significant legal changes such as leaving the European Court of Human Rights and repealing the Human Rights Act. Farage emphasized putting the UK first, while Labour dismissed the plans as lacking substance and the Tories accused Reform of recycling ideas.

This article emphasizes dynamic posture and listening to one's body over rigid adherence to traditional advice.
