            <p>Tragically, two individuals lost their lives in Moore, Oklahoma, after their vehicles were swept away by floodwaters resulting from heavy rainfall. Emergency responders recovered the bodies of an adult female and a 12-year-old child. This occurred as over 30 million Americans faced severe weather alerts during the Easter weekend, with several states already experiencing tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds. The incident highlights the dangers of flash flooding and the importance of heeding weather warnings, especially during severe weather events. Optimism is low due to the loss of life and widespread weather threats.</p>

            <h2>Experts Warn of Potential Heart Health Risks Linked to Tongue-Scraping</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 05:00:16 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>While tongue-scraping has gained popularity as a dental hygiene practice, experts are cautioning about potential risks to heart health. The concern stems from the possibility of "macroscopic cuts" on the tongue, which could introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of endocarditis, a heart valve infection. Doctors advise that gentle, infrequent tongue-scraping is preferable, as overdoing it can lower nitric oxide levels and potentially elevate blood pressure. It is important to maintain regular dental visits and prioritize brushing and flossing as the primary means of ensuring good oral hygiene.</p>

            <p>China is deviating from its usual non-interference policy in African conflicts by wading into the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda. Beijing has directly asked Kigali to end its backing of the M23 rebel group and withdraw Rwandan troops from the DRC, even voting in favor of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Rwanda's role. This measured shift is attributed to China's need to protect its significant mining interests and maintain relationships with both countries, indicating a strategic adjustment to safeguard its economic and diplomatic goals in the region.</p>

            <p>DHL Express has temporarily suspended deliveries to the US for shipments valued over $800 due to increased customs red tape following the implementation of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. This change has led to significant delays and a surge in formal customs clearances. The company will continue delivering packages under $800, but the White House plans to close a loophole allowing low-value packages from China and Hong Kong to enter the US without duties, impacting companies like Shein and Temu. These measures are aimed at addressing illicit substances and deceptive shipping practices, particularly related to synthetic opioids.</p>

            <p>In Guinea, a private drug rehabilitation clinic, SAJED-Guin√©e, is working without pay to combat a growing drug epidemic, particularly the use of 'kush,' a deadly mix of cannabis, fentanyl, and other substances. The clinic receives numerous distress calls weekly and struggles with limited resources, only able to accommodate a small number of patients at a time. Factors such as poverty, porous borders, and a lack of awareness contribute to the crisis, which is exacerbated by cross-border trafficking syndicates. Despite the challenges, the clinic staff remain dedicated to helping young people overcome addiction and rebuild their lives.</p>

            <p>The snail slime beauty industry, valued at billions, is facing ethical concerns regarding the treatment of snails. While the industry assures consumers that snails are treated humanely, some methods of slime extraction, such as acidic solutions or electrical stimulation, can be harmful. Animal welfare organizations like PETA argue that snails can feel stress, pain, and fear, urging consumers to consider the ethical implications of using snail-based products. The article questions the normalization of industrialized snail labor for uncertain beauty benefits, highlighting the need for greater transparency and ethical practices within the industry.</p>
