            <p>China's consumer prices have declined for the second consecutive month, signaling rising deflationary pressures, while producer price deflation has deepened, exacerbating challenges for Chinese exporters amid the escalating trade war with the U.S. The consumer price index slid 0.1% year-on-year in March, while producer prices fell 2.5%, marking the largest contraction since November 2024. Economists suggest a divergence between consumer and producer prices, with core consumer prices showing signs of recovery, while producer prices are expected to deteriorate further. This economic data arrives as the U.S. increases tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, prompting retaliatory measures from China, signaling a challenging period for the global economy.

            <p>The intensifying tariff war between the U.S. and China is expected to negatively impact China's economic development, with many Chinese citizens anticipating economic hardship. However, the new tariffs, raised to 125%, have ignited ire across China, with many voicing support for Beijing's decision to retaliate. Chinese citizens surveyed express frustration and concern, but also defiance, emphasizing the need for China to stand firm against U.S. pressure. Despite the risks, there is a sense of resolve among the Chinese public to weather the economic storm and support their government's stance.</p>

Both couples had to spend long periods apart due to work commitments, with Tommy working as a lighthouse keeper and Violet working night shifts in local hospitals.

            <p>Former England striker Eni Aluko hopes that a judgment finding Joey Barton's social media posts defamatory will encourage people to think twice about what they say online. Aluko, targeted by Barton, stated she should not have to fear attacks on her race and gender when appearing on TV. The High Court ruled Barton's comments, suggesting Aluko's late father was financially corrupt and accusing her of "playing the race card," were defamatory. Aluko emphasizes the need for accountability and change in the culture towards women in broadcasting.</p>

The article also examines the state of local authority finances and the national impact of local votes. With council tax bills rising, voters will be assessing whether they are getting value for money, making these elections a barometer of the government's performance.</p>

            <p>Germany is set to inaugurate a new government led by Friedrich Merz, facing immediate challenges including an out-of-control United States, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and increasing Chinese influence. The country's economy is already stuttering and faces the impact of US tariffs. An opinion poll puts the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in the lead for the first time, compounding the challenges. The new coalition, a compromise between the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, will focus on immigration controls, tax reduction, and support for Ukraine.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump accidentally called his former National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, and proceeded to berate him after realizing who was on the line. The call occurred shortly after Trump had criticized McMaster on social media for his skepticism about Trump's overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump intended to speak with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. The White House declined to comment, but a spokesperson dismissed McMaster's book as filled with lies.</p>

            <p>An alleged top leader of the MS-13 gang, Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, is asking a judge to delay the dismissal of his criminal case, despite the Justice Department seeking to end the case in favor of deportation. Villatoro Santos fears immediate deportation to El Salvador's CECOT prison without due process. He was arrested in Virginia on March 27, with Attorney General Pam Bondi present. The government filed a motion to dismiss the case without providing detailed explanation, leading to the unusual circumstance of the defendant opposing the dismissal.</p>
