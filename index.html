          <p>European officials expressed optimism about reaching a trade agreement with the U.S. President Donald Trump, but cautioned against the significant economic repercussions for both regions should a deal fail and tariffs be implemented.

The IMF has also warned that Trump's proposed trade tariffs pose major headwinds for the U.S. and global economies, forecasting reduced growth in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>
