          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with organizations like the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology to study seaweed behavior at significant depths and assess environmental impacts. This initiative seeks to enhance carbon capture efforts, addressing the declining absorption capacity of forests and contributing to Japan's goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. </p>

          <p>This article discusses the impact of President Trump's sweeping changes to federal agencies working on climate change. It notes his executive orders lifted regulations on fossil fuels, slashed budgets, and shifted directives of key government agencies, especially concerning research, pollution regulation, and disaster response. While these changes are intended to create jobs and boost the economy, the article questions what everyday Americans are trading away in the process. The article encourages readers to share their thoughts on how research is being impacted by the new administration. </p>

The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment that would remove parental responsibility from convicted child molesters, but only if they have abused their own children. The family argues that this amendment is insufficient, as it does not protect children from child molesters who have not abused their own children. The government said it would continue work to make the law "as strong as it needs to be". </p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, the acclaimed Russian ballet choreographer and former artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, has died at the age of 98. He is remembered as one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century, leading the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995. Grigorovich's productions of works such as *The Stone Flower*, *Ivan the Terrible*, and *Romeo and Juliet* redefined Soviet ballet, revitalizing male dance and demanding exceptional strength and artistry. His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 led to the first-ever dancers' strike at the theatre. </p>

          <p>Honda Motor Co. announced a 30% reduction in its electric vehicle technology investment plan through fiscal 2030, lowering it to 7 trillion yen ($48 billion) from the initially planned 10 trillion yen.
