          <p>A Wisconsin judge, Hannah Dugan, was arrested and charged with obstruction and concealing an individual to avoid arrest after allegedly trying to help an undocumented immigrant evade ICE agents in her courtroom. Dugan reportedly became visibly angry upon learning of the agents' presence and allegedly ushered the immigrant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, towards a side door. Flores-Ruiz, who had previously been deported, was apprehended after a brief foot chase. Dugan faces a maximum of six years in prison if convicted; this incident follows a similar case involving a judge in Massachusetts who faced obstruction charges for aiding an undocumented immigrant. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would not reduce tariffs on China unless they offer something 'substantial' in return, specifying that he wants China to be more open to U.S. businesses and products. Trump expressed a desire for an 'open China' where the U.S. can sell its goods, reminiscent of a previous deal that China allegedly backed out of. These remarks were made during a press gaggle on Air Force One, underscoring the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and Trump's hardline stance in negotiations.

          <p>A New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters believe President Trump is overreaching with his efforts to expand executive power, expressing significant doubts about key aspects of his agenda.

Voters also express waning confidence in Trump's handling of critical issues like the economy and immigration, despite broad support for deportations, with his approval rating at 42%, which is historically low for a president at this stage.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that creatine, a common weightlifting supplement, may be effective in treating depression, with a new study from India indicating it could be helpful even without antidepressants. The study involved 100 participants who received either creatine or a placebo alongside talk therapy, with the creatine group showing greater improvement in depression symptoms. Creatine's potential benefits for brain function, particularly in energy metabolism, have led to investigations into its use in treating psychiatric disorders. While researchers emphasize the preliminary nature of these findings, the affordability and accessibility of creatine make it a promising area for further exploration in mental health treatment.</p>

          <p>A debate has emerged among Democrats regarding whether their opposition to President Trump's deportation policies is inadvertently benefiting him politically. The discussion centers on the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant deported to El Salvador despite a court order, with some Democrats arguing that focusing on such cases elevates immigration as an issue, playing into Trump's strengths. Others argue that Democrats have a moral responsibility to defend due process, regardless of political ramifications, and that their focus should ultimately shift to Trump's economic policies. The issue highlights the tension between moral imperatives and strategic political messaging within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has stated that the UK's trade relationship with the EU is arguably 'more important' than its relationship with the US, despite her current focus on talks with the US. She highlighted the importance of rebuilding trading relationships with European neighbors while in Washington for meetings with US officials. Reeves indicated that the government is working 'flat out' to secure a trade deal with the US, aiming for 'free and fair' trade. This comes as the UK prepares for a summit with the EU in May to 'reset' the relationship between the two.</p>
