        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla reported a significant drop in first-quarter revenue and earnings, with automotive revenue plunging 20%. The company cited factory updates for the Model Y and lower average selling prices as contributing factors. CEO Elon Musk's increased involvement in President Trump's administration, specifically with the government downsizing program, has drawn criticism and is believed to be impacting the company's performance. Tesla refrained from promising growth this year, and the stock initially saw little change before popping almost 5% after President Trump said he has no plans to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the FDA announced plans to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the American food supply by the end of next year. The agencies aim to work with food companies to transition to natural alternatives, citing concerns about potential links between synthetic dyes and health conditions like ADHD. While the plan relies on industry cooperation, some organizations have questioned the proposed timeline and potential supply disruptions. This initiative follows previous efforts to ban Red No. 3 and reflects growing pressure to remove artificial additives from food products.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing Powell's handling of interest rates. Trump reiterated his desire for lower interest rates but acknowledged that it wouldn't be the end if Powell didn't comply. This statement comes after Trump's social media posts suggesting Powell's termination, sparking speculation about the Fed's leadership. The administration is reportedly studying its legal right to fire Powell, though Powell has stated he will not step down if asked.</p>

          <p>Six leading policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry have jointly lobbied the Trump administration against imposing 25% tariffs on auto parts. In a letter to administration officials, the groups warned that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production, as many suppliers are already facing financial distress. The letter highlights the industry's significant contribution to the U.S. economy and its support for millions of jobs. This rare unified message underscores the industry's deep concerns about the potential negative impact of the tariffs on the automotive supply chain.</p>

Amazon disputes the claims, arguing that the complaint is based on a baseless legal theory. This case faces challenges with the labor board now under the control of the Trump administration, which has already rescinded worker-friendly guidelines.</p>
