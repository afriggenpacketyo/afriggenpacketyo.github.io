          <h2>Italy Grapples with Worsening Demographic Crisis as Birth Rate Plummets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 01:01:19 EDT</div>

          <p>Italy is facing a severe demographic decline, with its birth rate hitting an all-time low and its population shrinking by nearly 1.9 million in a decade. Small towns like Fregona are at risk of disappearing as essential services like schools close due to a lack of children. Despite government incentives like cash bonuses, many Italians find the support insufficient to address the high costs and lack of accessible childcare, hindering decisions to start families. The crisis is prompting some companies to create their own solutions, like workplace creches, while highlighting a growing dependence on immigration to sustain the economy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has identified Deputies Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn as the three officers killed in a tragic explosion at a training facility. The blast, one of the deadliest internal incidents in the department's history, occurred at an East Los Angeles County site where the deputies, all members of the Arson Explosives Detail, were working. With a combined 74 years of service, the men were remembered as heroes dedicated to public safety. An investigation is underway to determine the cause, including whether it is connected to explosives seized a day earlier.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Pitcher Tyler Glasnow Shows Promising Performance Despite Team's Loss to Brewers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:39:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Dodgers' 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong and encouraging performance, signaling a potential return to form after a season plagued by injuries. He pitched six innings and allowed only one run, showcasing increased fastball velocity and effective control, a significant step forward for the high-profile acquisition. Despite his solid outing, the Dodgers' offense was shut out, and a relief pitcher gave up a crucial home run. Glasnow's dependability is seen as vital for the team's championship aspirations, making his recent progress a positive development.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China, focusing on countering the nation's "economic coercion." Morrison's testimony is notable given his government's call for an investigation into COVID-19's origins, which led to significant Chinese tariffs on Australian goods. His appearance comes as his successor, Anthony Albanese, concludes a visit to China, signaling a recent warming of diplomatic relations. U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, a vocal critic of China's economic practices, will also testify before the panel.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Chemotherapy May Inadvertently Promote Cancer Metastasis</h2>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, may paradoxically accelerate the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings help explain why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis in areas like the lungs even after successful initial treatment. The research team identified a mechanism for this "dormancy awakening" of cancer cells. They also discovered that combining specific drugs with chemotherapy could inhibit this effect in mice, leading to a new clinical trial for breast cancer patients.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Afghans whose personal information was exposed in a massive data breach are not expected to receive compensation from the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD). The leak involved a spreadsheet with details of over 19,000 people who had applied for relocation, many of whom now fear retaliation from the Taliban. The MoD stated it would "robustly defend" against legal claims, citing an independent review that concluded it was "highly unlikely" individuals would be targeted solely for being on the list. This decision has drawn criticism, as the breach compromised the safety of many who had worked with British forces.</p>

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are under an amber weather warning as severe thunderstorms are expected to bring torrential rain and dangerous flash floods over the weekend. The Met Office predicts that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, creating a high risk of property flooding, transport disruptions, and power outages. The severe weather follows a recent heatwave that left the ground parched and unable to absorb water, exacerbating the flood risk. The warning covers London, the south coast, and Cambridge, with yellow warnings in place for other parts of England and Scotland.</p>

Originally slated for a 1.65 billion yuan investment, only a fraction was spent, leaving multiple buildings derelict.

          <p>Scientists with the Chinese army have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could significantly increase the power of electromagnetic weapons, addressing a key limitation of the navy's current model. The existing naval railgun, a global first, is hampered by its inability to fire projectiles heavy enough for major combat scenarios. The proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns, which would nearly double the force and allow for firing much heavier shells at hypersonic speeds. This innovation aims to advance the military application of railgun technology, which has been stalled by power constraints.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War, has brought to life a vision that helped him survive: a beautiful carousel. During the war, a small music box from his sister inspired daydreams of a carousel in a peaceful mountain meadow, an image that provided a crucial mental escape. After battling PTSD for years, Harrison began building that carousel in 1986, hand-carving the animals over 26 years. Now, the "Carousel of Happiness" in Nederland, Colorado, has delighted over a million visitors and provided its creator with profound healing and a new mission to spread joy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, a landmark piece of legislation that creates the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bill, which passed with bipartisan support, allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills. Supporters hail the law as a revolutionary step for financial technology that will strengthen the dollar and modernize the financial system. The signing ceremony was attended by crypto industry executives, who have heavily supported pro-crypto candidates and view the law as a massive validation for the industry.

          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenized assets. The rise of stablecoins presents significant challenges, particularly for anti-money-laundering efforts and customer verification, due to their borderless and pseudonymous nature. This warning comes as the stablecoin market experiences a surge, amplified by the Trump administration's embrace of digital currencies. The call for new regulations highlights the urgency for global financial authorities to address the disruptive potential of these new technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

The backlash from his base, which had been angered by the administration's initial refusal to release more Epstein files, cooled significantly after Trump filed a major lawsuit against the newspaper. Furthermore, the president's subsequent order to his Attorney General to seek the release of Epstein-related grand jury testimony was framed as a major victory by influential MAGA voices.

          <p>The White House physician has diagnosed President Trump with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. The condition, described as "benign and common" in people over 70, occurs when veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool in the legs. According to medical experts, CVI affects about one in three U.S. adults and can cause aching, heaviness, and swelling. Treatment often involves lifestyle changes like exercise and compression stockings. The president's doctor has assured that the condition is mild and that Trump remains in "excellent health."</p>

The request was filed a day after a Wall Street Journal story detailed an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, which the president has denied and is now suing over.
