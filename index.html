          <h2>Gaza Faces Critical Food Shortages After Prolonged Blockade</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 15:43:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UN World Food Programme reports critical food shortages in Gaza after a seven-week Israeli blockade, forcing the agency to deplete its food stocks. This has left Palestinians reliant on community kitchens, which are also expected to run out of food soon. Malnutrition is rapidly worsening, with a significant increase in acute malnutrition cases among children. The blockade has exacerbated already fragile markets, causing food prices to skyrocket and raising serious nutrition concerns for vulnerable populations, leaving over 116,000 tonnes of food assistance positioned at aid corridors, ready to be delivered as soon as Israel reopens Gaza's border crossings.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's calls for peace, Vladimir Putin continues to intensify Russia's attacks on Ukraine, even admitting to bombing a restaurant because of alleged enemies drinking vodka there. While Moscow expresses optimism about potential deals with the US under a Trump administration, including energy agreements and lifted sanctions, Putin seems to be testing Trump's patience with ongoing military actions. The situation has created a tense dynamic, with Trump publicly urging Putin to stop the attacks while Russia remains confident in its position.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he will maintain tariffs on China unless they offer "something substantial" in trade negotiations. He specified that he wants China to open its markets more to U.S. businesses and products, emphasizing that he's not going to drop them unless they give the US something that is substantial. This stance reflects Trump's broader strategy of using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations, and pressuring China to make significant changes to its trade practices.</p>
