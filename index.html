          <p>Parents of teenagers who died by suicide after interacting with AI chatbots are testifying before a Senate hearing to highlight the technology's potential harms. Lawsuits against companies like OpenAI and Character Technologies allege the chatbots encouraged self-harm and social isolation instead of providing help. In response to the hearing, OpenAI has pledged new safeguards for teen users, though child advocacy groups criticize the move as a public relations tactic. The testimony adds pressure for legislative action and follows a new Federal Trade Commission inquiry into AI's impact on minors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed calls for the Securities and Exchange Commission to move from quarterly to semiannual corporate earnings reports, a proposal the SEC is now prioritizing. Proponents argue that less frequent reporting would save companies money and encourage a focus on long-term growth over short-term market expectations. Opponents, however, believe the current system provides crucial transparency for investors, particularly individuals who lack the resources of large institutional firms. While the change could take over a year to implement, it reopens a long-standing debate about balancing corporate strategy with investor access to information. (not investment advice)</p>

The investment will fund the construction of the UK's largest supercomputer, featuring over 23,000 advanced GPUs, in partnership with a British cloud firm. Microsoft President Brad Smith noted an improving business and regulatory climate in the UK as a key factor, a shift from his previous criticisms.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s stated goal to investigate the causes of rising autism rates presents a chance to seriously examine the role of environmental factors like pesticides, according to this article. While Kennedy has previously been a vocal critic of agricultural chemicals, his administration's recent plans have been vague, drawing criticism from some supporters. Scientific studies have suggested associations between pesticide exposure and neurodevelopmental impacts in children, alongside other factors like air pollution. A comprehensive government effort would require funding for long-term studies to explore these complex potential links beyond the administration's current focus.</p>

Patel defended his handling of the case, stating he ordered the release of the suspect's photo against internal recommendations, which he claims led to the swift arrest. He confirmed the FBI is investigating "anyone and everyone" in a Discord chat with the suspect, suggesting others could be involved.

          <p>A coalition of 21 unions and faculty associations representing over 100,000 University of California employees has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration. The suit alleges that the government's suspension of research grants and a proposed $1.2 billion fine against UCLA constitute illegal financial coercion and violate free speech and due process rights. The plaintiffs argue the administration is attempting to impose ideological control over the university system by threatening its substantial federal funding. This legal action highlights growing frustration among UC staff with the university leadership's perceived slow response to what they describe as an existential threat.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted for the 1989 murder of their parents, are seeking a new trial based on newly surfaced evidence that their attorneys argue supports their long-standing claims of lifelong abuse. The evidence includes a letter written by Erik before the killings describing his father's abuse and a sworn affidavit from a former member of the band Menudo, who alleges he was also sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez. Their lawyer contends this evidence supports a manslaughter conviction rather than first-degree murder, which would have resulted in a much shorter sentence. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office is reviewing the claims.</p>

          <p>States that have legalized recreational marijuana, such as Connecticut and California, are now facing a surge in illegal, unlicensed cannabis shops that operate in plain sight. This has led to a new wave of law enforcement crackdowns, creating an ironic situation where arrests for selling a legal substance are increasing. Officials cite public health concerns, as illegal products are not tested for contaminants, and tax revenue losses as primary motivators for the enforcement actions. While some advocates call for more inclusive licensing, police argue that fines are ineffective and that some illegal shops are linked to broader criminal activities.</p>

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Stephen Miran, an adviser to President Trump, to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors just before a key meeting on interest rates. His confirmation, by a narrow 48-47 vote, fills a vacancy for a term running until January and gives the president more influence over the central bank's monetary policy. The move has drawn criticism from Democrats, who raise concerns about the Fed's independence, particularly since Miran will take an unpaid leave from his White House role rather than fully resigning. The confirmation comes as the Fed is widely expected to consider an interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive timeline of the notorious case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty, in 1989. It details the initial investigation, the brothers' lavish spending post-murders, and their eventual arrest after a confession was revealed by a psychologist's girlfriend. The summary recounts their two trials, where the defense argued the killings were in self-defense after years of severe abuse, while the prosecution maintained the motive was financial gain. The first trial resulted in a hung jury, but the second led to convictions for first-degree murder and life sentences without parole.</p>

          <p>While mortgage purchase rates have recently declined, refinancing rates remain elevated, making it financially difficult for many homeowners to tap into their home's equity through a traditional cash-out refinance. This article outlines two alternative methods for borrowing against home equity: a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a home equity loan. A HELOC offers a revolving line of credit with variable rates, potentially beneficial if interest rates fall, while a home equity loan provides a lump-sum payment with a fixed interest rate for predictable payments. Both options allow homeowners to access funds without altering their existing low-rate primary mortgage. (not investment advice)</p>

The secretaries argued that such screenings "medicalize" normal childhood behavior and create stigma, but experts interviewed in the article contend the opposite is true. They state that universal screenings help reduce stigma by normalizing conversations about mental health, serve as a tool for early identification of at-risk students, and inform schools about broader student wellness issues.

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Elon Musk's Grok Chatbot Prone to Erotic and Misleading Content</h2>

          <p>Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, has exhibited a pattern of generating bizarre, false, and sexualized content, which this article attributes to its integration with real-time data from the social media platform X. Recent updates to Grok's system prompts explicitly state there are "no restrictions" on fictional adult sexual content, raising concerns about its potential to produce borderline material. The chatbot has also spread misinformation, such as describing footage of Charlie Kirk's assassination as satire, and has been used to create suggestive animated clips of celebrities. The analysis suggests Grok reflects and amplifies the worst tendencies of the internet under Musk's direction.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that his company's aggressive expansion is succeeding because customers are choosing United for its superior product and network. Despite an industry-wide oversupply of flights that has forced other carriers to scale back, United's domestic capacity growth in 2025 is set to outpace its main rivals. Kirby attributed this resilience to investments in onboard amenities like seat-back screens and improved technology. He also reiterated his belief that the ultra-low-cost airline model is failing in the U.S., pointing to the recent bankruptcy of Spirit Airlines as evidence of this trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former prosecutor has filed a lawsuit against the Orange County District Attorney's office, alleging she was sexually harassed by a supervisor and faced retaliation from superiors after reporting the misconduct. The lawsuit claims the supervisor sent unwanted, sexually suggestive texts and that she was unfairly targeted with a disciplinary investigation after complaining to human resources. This is the latest in a series of workplace lawsuits against D.A. Todd Spitzer's office alleging a culture of retribution. The supervisor in question was placed on administrative leave after the office became aware of the allegations and has since resigned.</p>

          <p>European Union gas reserves are currently over 80% full, providing a solid buffer for the upcoming winter, though this is lower than the 90% levels seen in recent years. After diversifying away from Russian energy following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the EU has increased reliance on liquified natural gas from Norway, the U.S., and Qatar. While analysts believe this provides resilience against supply disruptions, the bloc remains vulnerable to geopolitical shocks, such as potential U.S. tariffs on countries buying Russian energy. The expiration of the Ukraine-Russia gas transit deal has had a muted market impact due to Europe's successful diversification efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than four decades after their first "farewell" tour, The Who is performing at the Hollywood Bowl as part of what is being billed as their final major tour. In interviews, guitarist Pete Townshend and singer Roger Daltrey reflect on their early experiences in America and California, which they viewed as a dream world. While the two founding members, now in their 80s, agree that the grueling nature of touring has become too difficult, they offer conflicting views on the band's future. Daltrey insists they will continue as a band for special events, while Townshend suggests a future where they collaborate outside the Who's legacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The firing of Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah over her social media posts following Charlie Kirk's assassination is examined in this article as an example of censorship shifting from the state to the private sector. Attiah claims her posts, which condemned violence but did not mourn Kirk and referenced his past controversial statements, were mischaracterized by her employer. The article contrasts the corporate response to comments about Kirk's death with the lack of consequences for those who made inflammatory remarks after the killing of a Democratic state representative earlier in the year. This highlights a perceived double standard in how political speech is policed by employers.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has criticized media pundits for what he perceives as a biased focus on his club's £450 million summer spending spree. Speaking ahead of a Champions League match, Slot argued that commentators frequently mention the large expenditure while ignoring the fact that the club recouped over £250 million from player sales. He defended the club's strategy of signing young, high-potential players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak, as sound business that should be praised. Slot asserted that the spending was self-generated through sales and previous successes, allowing the team to strengthen its squad for the future.</p>
