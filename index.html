            <p>Shares of LVMH experienced a significant drop after reporting a decline in first-quarter sales, causing it to temporarily lose its position as the world's largest luxury firm to Herm√®s. The sales decline, particularly in wines, spirits, and fashion divisions, was attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and tariff uncertainty. Analysts have expressed concerns about the luxury sector's outlook amid economic uncertainty and potential impacts from tariffs, leading to lowered target prices for LVMH stock. The company is considering repricing goods to offset inflation and currency swings. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Global markets exhibited a mixed performance as investors reacted to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies. While markets in Asia and Europe generally rose, buoyed by the temporary exemption of consumer electronics from tariffs and the European Commission's pause on countermeasures, Chinese markets showed less enthusiasm due to existing tariffs. Dow futures indicated a slight increase, reflecting cautious optimism in the U.S. market. European markets also responded positively to the tariff pause, with Germany's DAX and Britain's FTSE 100 experiencing gains.</p>

            <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of weakening as job vacancies have fallen to a near four-year low, indicating a decline in demand for workers. Average pay continues to rise, but increases in employer National Insurance Contributions and National Minimum Wage hikes are expected to impact salaries. While the unemployment rate remains stable, the number of workers on payrolls has decreased. The Office for National Statistics has cautioned that the jobs figures should be treated with caution because of low response rates to its employment survey, on which the figures are based.</p>

            <p>An inquest into the death of former Arsenal and Everton striker Kevin Campbell concluded that he died of natural causes, but noted "missed opportunities" in his care. The scrutiny over Campbell's death highlights broader concerns about declining standards of care within the financially troubled NHS. Experts point to budget cuts and a postcode lottery, where healthcare access varies significantly across England. The government has responded by outlining plans to overhaul the NHS and prioritize patient safety, while the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust has expressed condolences and committed to ongoing improvements.</p>

            <p>A long-standing trade dispute has resurfaced regarding European distaste for American chicken, often referred to as "chlorinated chicken." While the U.S. has largely moved away from chlorine rinses in poultry processing, the EU prohibits any chemical treatment, viewing it as a mask for inadequate hygiene. European regulators believe that disinfecting poultry with chemicals is a way to mask subpar food safety in the U.S. industry, and prefer a 'farm to fork' approach to food safety. Despite the debate, research indicates that neither region's approach is entirely effective at eliminating the risk of infection from Salmonella and Campylobacter.</p>

            <p>A bipartisan group of senators has criticized the White House's decision to end a federal contract providing legal aid to unaccompanied migrant children. The senators argue that terminating legal representation puts children at risk of trafficking and exploitation, jeopardizing fair legal processes. Concerns have been raised that ending the funding violates the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. While a federal judge temporarily ordered the restoration of funding, the long-term protections for these vulnerable children remain uncertain.</p>

            <p>A new study suggests that long-term transcendental meditation may reduce stress and slow down aging.

The study also found that meditators had more adaptive reserve, contributing to overall health and longevity, but researchers noted the lack of a placebo control group as a limitation.</p>

            <p>The UK government has intervened to secure supplies of raw materials for British Steel, preventing the shutdown of its blast furnaces. The government seized control of the business following a breakdown in talks with its Chinese owner, Jingye, amid concerns about the company's plans. The move aims to maintain the UK's capability to produce virgin steel, which is essential for major construction projects. The government is seeking a private sector partner for the future of the Scunthorpe plant, while Beijing has criticized the UK's actions as politicizing trade cooperation.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced a sell-off as investors fled the safe haven, adding to market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariffs. The 10-year Treasury yield soared to its highest level since February. The outflow has raised questions about who has been selling and why, with China and Japan's life insurers being speculated as potential sellers. Concerns about policy flip-flopping and the desire to reduce exposure to U.S. debt could be driving the sell-off. (not investment advice)</p>
