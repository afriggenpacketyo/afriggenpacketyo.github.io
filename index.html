          <p>A large-scale manhunt is ongoing for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old Army veteran, who is suspected of killing four people in a bar shooting in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities have located the Ford F-150 pickup truck he allegedly used to flee but have not yet apprehended him. Brown, who is considered armed and dangerous, was last seen in the Stumptown area west of Anaconda. Law enforcement has urged local residents to remain vigilant and report any sightings to 911 immediately, as the search continues in the nearby mountains.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old Jacksonville woman, Zoe Allison, was arrested in Putnam County, Florida, and charged with multiple offenses including DUI and possession of fentanyl and methamphetamine. Deputies initiated a traffic stop after observing her vehicle swerving erratically and braking suddenly. During the stop, a K-9 unit discovered the narcotics, and one deputy was briefly hospitalized after feeling ill from exposure to the fentanyl but has since recovered. Allison appeared impaired, failed a field sobriety test, and was subsequently booked into the Putnam County Jail.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, has launched an investigation into Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe follows allegations, notably from Senator Tom Cotton, that Smith engaged in illegal political activity by attempting to rush the trials of former President Trump to interfere with the 2024 election. Smith, who was appointed to investigate Trump's handling of classified documents and efforts to subvert the 2020 election, resigned in January after the cases were closed following Trump's reelection.</p>

          <p>Decades after the "Son of Sam" terrorized New York City, survivors Robert Violante and Carl Denaro share their stories of the attacks that permanently altered their lives. Violante was shot on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz, who died from her injuries, leaving him blind and ending his burgeoning modeling career. Denaro was shot months earlier, suffering a severe head wound that required a metal plate and derailed his plans to join the Air Force. Both men expressed relief at David Berkowitz's capture but continue to live with the physical and emotional scars of the attacks.</p>

          <p>Protests and counter-protests regarding the use of hotels to house asylum seekers have resulted in fifteen arrests across England. Clashes occurred in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, where anti-migrant groups demonstrated against the policy. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process to reduce the number of people housed in hotels, a system the government aims to phase out by 2029. The demonstrations highlight ongoing social and political tensions surrounding the UK's immigration and asylum policies.</p>

          <p>Shayna Glassman, whose father was the downstairs neighbor of David Berkowitz, has formed an unlikely connection with the "Son of Sam" serial killer, visiting him in prison despite her family's disapproval.

          <p>Following a 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their opening Scottish Premiership match, Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly criticized his players' performance, citing a "mentality problem" and excessive ego. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and that some players needed to "drop their ego," suggesting the issues were not tactical but psychological. The pointed comments, made after just one league game, have drawn attention from pundits, who noted the manager's extreme frustration so early in the season and expressed concern over the team's direction.</p>

          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has climbed to €3,248, a sum that is increasingly unaffordable for many retirees and is straining the country's long-term care insurance system. With an aging population and rising wages for care workers, the financial gap has become unsustainable, leading to calls for urgent reform. Currently, residents must use their income and savings to cover costs, and nearly one-third rely on welfare payments.

          <p>The UK's parliamentary standards commissioner has opened an investigation into Stourbridge MP Cat Eccles for failing to declare a sponsored trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories within the required 28-day period. The trip, which took place in May and was valued at £2,600, was sponsored by Labour Friends of Israel but was not registered until July. A spokesperson for the MP attributed the delay to an administrative error, stating there was no attempt to conceal the visit. The investigation will determine if parliamentary rules on declaring interests were breached.</p>

          <p>The Tea app, a platform where women anonymously share information about men in their dating pool, has experienced a major data breach, exposing the personal data of its users. The leak included sensitive information such as driver's licenses, direct messages, and selfies, which were reportedly posted on the message board 4chan. The incident has compromised the safety of the app's users and highlighted the risks of digital "whisper networks," which gained prominence in the Me Too era.

          <p>A growing number of adults, particularly those under 30, are turning to TikTok for their news, relying on content creators and news-adjacent memes rather than traditional media outlets. Creators like Aaron Parnas have gained millions of followers by delivering rapid-fire updates on current events, tailored for the platform's short-form video format. While users appreciate the convenience and simplified terms, the trend raises concerns about misinformation and the quality of information being consumed. The platform's algorithm-driven feed presents a new paradigm for news distribution, challenging established journalistic norms.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially limited President Trump's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border, ruling that the administration cannot ignore laws protecting migrants from being deported to places where they face persecution or torture. The D.C. Circuit Court panel upheld a lower court's finding that the president's proclamation defied U.S. law. While the ruling allows the administration to continue denying access to the asylum system itself, it affirms that migrants must still be screened for other mandatory humanitarian protections, such as "withholding of removal," which have a higher legal threshold.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a ruling that restricts "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a lower court that found such sweeps by the Trump administration likely violated the Constitution's protection against unreasonable seizures. The case stems from high-profile raids in Southern California that targeted locations like car washes and tow yards, sparking protests and fear within the region's large Latino community.</p>

This continues a trend of qualifying struggles for Hamilton in 2025. Despite his personal frustration, Hamilton congratulated Leclerc and the team, acknowledging the car's potential and shifting the blame for his poor result onto his own driving.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a turbulent week, with the S&P 500 hitting a record high before a four-day losing streak, capped by a significant drop on Friday. The volatility was fueled by a confluence of major news, including a surprisingly weak July jobs report, the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady, and President Trump's announcement of new "reciprocal" tariffs. The poor employment data, which showed only 73,000 new jobs, reignited market expectations for a September rate cut, while major tech earnings from Amazon and Apple added to the market's downward pressure.
