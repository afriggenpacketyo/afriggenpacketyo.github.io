          <p>A 30-year-old man, Kai-Ji Adam Lo, has been charged with second-degree murder after driving a car into a crowd at the Lapu Lapu festival in Vancouver, killing 11 people and injuring dozens. The attack occurred at an event celebrating Filipino culture, deeply impacting Vancouver's Filipino community. Police have ruled out terrorism, citing the suspect's history of mental health issues. The suspect was apprehended by bystanders and taken into custody by police officers after the car plowed through a crowd of people, with witnesses describing a scene of chaos and panic. The festival commemorates Lapu-Lapu, a Filipino hero who resisted Spanish colonization in the 1500s.</p>

          <p>North Korea has officially acknowledged sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine, confirming reports from South Korean and Western intelligence. According to KCNA, North Korean soldiers assisted Russian forces in "completely liberating" the Kursk border region, a claim also made by Russian Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov. The decision to deploy troops was based on a mutual defense treaty between Pyongyang and Moscow, demonstrating their "alliance and brotherhood". The US has responded by stating that North Korea must now bear responsibility for perpetuating the war, though some military experts question the preparedness of North Korean troops for modern warfare.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts project that US tariffs on Chinese imports could endanger as many as 16 million jobs in China, particularly in manufacturing for retail and wholesale sectors. Communication equipment, apparel, and chemical products are identified as particularly vulnerable due to their significant share in US-bound exports. This assessment follows the imposition of substantial tariffs by the US, aimed at reducing trade deficits and boosting domestic production, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. The Chinese government has pledged to stabilize the economy and employment, implementing measures to support those affected by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Global military expenditure reached a record $2.72 trillion in 2024, marking a 9.4% increase from the previous year and the steepest rise since 1988, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This surge is attributed to Russia's war in Ukraine and heightened tensions in the Middle East, with over 100 countries increasing their military spending. The United States remains the top spender, followed by China and Russia, with significant increases also observed in countries like Japan and Israel. The report highlights concerns that prioritizing military security may lead to economic and social trade-offs in the long term.</p>

Analysts suggest China is wary of the strategic implications of this strengthened US-Japan-Philippines alignment, viewing it as a potentially hostile bloc near its borders. The General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) will facilitate the exchange of classified military information and defense technologies between Japan and the Philippines. This framework, combined with Japan's reconnaissance capabilities and the Philippines' geographical advantage, could enable closer tracking of China's regional activities.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians are expressing cautious optimism following President Trump's meeting with President Zelensky, particularly after Trump questioned why Putin would continue attacking Ukraine while the US is attempting to broker peace. Trump suggested Putin may need to be "dealt with differently," potentially through more sanctions. This has raised hopes that Trump may not force Ukraine into a peace plan that demands territorial concessions and abandonment of NATO aspirations. The shift in tone follows a Russian missile attack on Kyiv, prompting Trump to publicly urge Putin to stop the violence.</p>

As many turbines reach the end of their lifecycle, operators are choosing to upgrade or replace them with technologically advanced models, increasing electricity output. This repowering trend offers economic benefits by avoiding the need for new property acquisition and increasing energy production with fewer, more efficient turbines.
