          <p>Ras Baraka, the Democratic mayor of Newark, New Jersey, was arrested at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center on Friday while protesting with members of Congress. According to interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, Baraka was taken into custody for trespassing and ignoring multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to leave the premises. The article indicates that this event is part of ongoing tensions between city officials and federal authorities regarding immigration policies, as Baraka and others have been trying to close the detention center, which they view as part of President Trump's deportation campaign.

          <p>President Trump fired Carla Hayden, the Librarian of Congress, marking the latest in a series of moves impacting American cultural institutions. Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, was also the first term-limited appointee. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt cited concerns over DEI initiatives and the inclusion of inappropriate books for children as reasons for the firing. The Library of Congress, responsible for digitizing its vast collection and housing the U.S. Copyright Office, has largely remained outside of culture war controversies.

          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) is no longer suitable for long-term retirement planning due to increasing longevity. Edelman suggests investors should allocate 70% to 80% of their portfolios to equities to ensure sufficient funds for a longer life expectancy, potentially reaching 100 years or more. He emphasizes the importance of considering advancements in health technology and biotech that could significantly extend lifespans, requiring larger retirement savings. According to Fidelity Investments, a retired couple aged 65 in 2024 may need as much as $315,000 saved just to cover health care expenses in retirement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, stating that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Judge William K. Sessions III emphasized that Ozturk's continued detention was unwarranted, citing a lack of evidence that she posed a threat. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, had been detained since March 25 and faced deportation proceedings allegedly due to an essay critical of Israel. The judge's decision follows criticism that the government is abusing the immigration system to deport international students.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, will have a resentencing hearing in Los Angeles court next week. Judge Michael Jesic ruled that the hearing can proceed, rejecting efforts by current district attorney Nathan Hochman to withdraw the resentencing petition. Former DA George Gascón had requested their sentences be reduced, citing modern understandings of trauma, but Hochman opposes this. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense after years of sexual assault by their father. The resentencing hearings are scheduled for May 13 and 14.</p>

          <p>With home equity interest rates currently lower, homeowners should consider the smartest ways to pay off a HELOC. One approach is to take advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just the interest, utilizing lower rates to accelerate payoff and protect against future rate increases. Homeowners should monitor the interest rate climate for opportunities to make larger payments, and strategically use the HELOC for eligible home repairs and renovations, as interest charges can be tax-deductible. Consulting a lending expert or home equity lender is recommended to build a personalized repayment strategy.</p>
