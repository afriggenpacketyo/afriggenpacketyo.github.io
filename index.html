          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after the agency reported weaker-than-expected job growth and significant downward revisions for previous months. The move has drawn widespread condemnation from economists and political figures, who accuse the president of politicizing a historically independent agency and undermining the credibility of federal economic data. Critics, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, likened the action to those taken in authoritarian countries, while the administration defended the decision by citing a need for trustworthy figures.

          <p>The French government has announced it will deport a Palestinian student for allegedly sharing an antisemitic social media post that included an image of Adolf Hitler and called for violence against Jews. The incident has prompted France to halt all evacuations of people from Gaza pending an investigation into how the student obtained a visa. The move has been praised by the French Interior Minister, who stated that "Hamas propagandists have no place" in the country, adding another layer to France's complex position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

Witkoff reportedly assured the families of his personal commitment to their cause while reaffirming plans to hold Hamas accountable for their actions.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals a vast difference in the amount of rental space a budget of $1,500 per month can secure in major U.S. cities. In Manhattan, that amount affords an average of just 216 square feet, whereas in Wichita, Kansas, renters can get an average of 1,329 square feet. The data highlights the extreme housing affordability crisis in large coastal cities like Boston and San Francisco, driven by high demand and limited supply. Conversely, cities in the Midwest and South offer significantly more space for the same price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has ordered Tesla to pay more than $240 million in damages, finding the company partially responsible for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot technology that killed one person and severely injured another. The verdict holds that Tesla's technology failed, rejecting the argument that the distracted driver was solely to blame. Lawyers for the victims' families claimed Tesla had hidden key data about the crash, which they later uncovered, strengthening their case that the car was defective and the "Autopilot" name is misleading.

          <p>This opinion article laments the U.S. government's decision to deny travel visas to a Venezuelan Little League team, preventing them from competing in the Senior League World Series. The team from Maracaibo had won their qualifying rounds but were barred from entry, despite potential exemptions for major sporting events under current travel restrictions. The author questions the rationale behind the decision, highlighting the demoralizing effect on the young athletes and arguing that it contradicts the ideal of sports promoting respect across international boundaries. The piece raises concerns about future international competitions hosted in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A European Commission proposal to penalize Israel for its conduct in Gaza by restricting access to EU research funds has stalled due to divisions among member states. While countries like Spain and Ireland have long pushed for a review of the EU-Israel trade agreement, others, notably Germany and Hungary, have resisted taking punitive action. The proposal came amid UN warnings of famine in Gaza and a hardening stance in Brussels, but it failed to gain the necessary consensus, highlighting the bloc's deep and persistent split on how to handle its relationship with Israel.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police have made a seventh arrest in the investigation into a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, where activists damaged two military aircraft. The 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of terrorism-related offenses. The incident, for which the now-proscribed group Palestine Action claimed responsibility, caused an estimated £7 million in damage and prompted a security review of all UK military bases. Four other individuals have already been charged and remanded in custody in connection with the June break-in.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a significant position in Equinix, a major data center REIT, following a stock price drop. The drop was triggered by investor concern over the company's increased capital expenditure plans and a downgraded forecast for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO). Elliott, with extensive experience in the data center sector, likely sees the spending as a necessary response to high demand from AI and hyperscalers, viewing it as a long-term growth opportunity. The firm may push for improved market communication and cost optimization to amplify returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Democrats must persistently use the Jeffrey Epstein scandal to frame President Trump as a protector of corrupt elites at the expense of ordinary people. The author suggests that instead of getting lost in conspiracy, the message should be simple and repetitive: Trump's actions to shield his powerful friends in the Epstein case are part of a pattern of favoring the wealthy. This narrative, the article contends, can connect with voters' existing beliefs about a two-tiered justice system and resonate more effectively than abstract policy debates.</p>

          <p>An investigation by The Guardian has identified Chris Booth, a 37-year-old Michigan man, as the creator of a rapidly growing, openly neo-Nazi YouTube channel. The channel, which amassed over 50,000 subscribers in two months, featured antisemitic and racist content and appeared to be monetized through YouTube's partner program. Following the investigation and inquiries from the press, YouTube terminated the channel for violating its hate speech policies. The creator's wife is a local Republican official, raising questions about platform content moderation and the mainstreaming of extremist ideologies.</p>

          <p>Indigenous leaders are denouncing President Trump's proposal to reopen Alcatraz as a detention center, calling it an affront that erases the island's crucial history as a site of Native American resistance. Following the prison's closure in 1963, a 19-month occupation by Indigenous activists beginning in 1969 became a pivotal moment in the fight for Native rights and sovereignty. Tribal members argue that using the landmark for anti-immigrant policies is retraumatizing and ignores the tangible policy changes, like the shift to self-determination, that resulted from the historic occupation.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old man from Long Beach, California, has been arrested on federal charges for attempting to provide material support to the terrorist group ISIS. Prosecutors allege that Mark Lorenzo Villanueva sent over $1,600 to individuals he believed were ISIS fighters and expressed a desire to join the organization, stating it was an "honor to fight and die for our faith." An apparent bomb was recovered from his bedroom during the arrest, and he now faces a potential sentence of up to 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Following Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders' recent bladder cancer diagnosis, this article explains the reconstructive surgery he underwent, known as neobladder reconstruction. The procedure involves removing the diseased bladder and creating a new one from a section of the patient's own small intestine. While the body adapts well without rejecting the new organ, patients must retrain themselves to use the bathroom as the neobladder cannot signal the brain. Sanders has been open about the challenges, including incontinence, helping to reduce the shame often associated with the condition.</p>
