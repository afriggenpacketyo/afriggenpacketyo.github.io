          <p>The head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Holger Münch, has expressed concerns about young people organizing themselves into groups to commit serious crimes, influenced by far-right ideologies. This follows a recent crackdown on a far-right extremist cell with members as young as 14. The article also mentions that train services at Hamburg's main station have returned to normal after a knife attack injured 18 people, with a female suspect arrested, highlighting the ongoing challenges of maintaining public safety and addressing extremism in Germany. The authorities are investigating the motives of the suspect in the Hamburg knife attack.</p>

          <p>The New York Knicks are in a dire situation, trailing the Indiana Pacers 0-2 in the Eastern Conference Finals after a 114-109 loss in Game 2. Pascal Siakam's career-high 39 points led the Pacers to victory, despite Jalen Brunson's 36 points and 11 assists for the Knicks. No NBA team has ever overcome losing the first two games at home to win a series in the conference finals. The Knicks need a quick turnaround to avoid a brief appearance in their first conference finals in 25 years, while the Pacers are two wins away from their first NBA Finals appearance since 2000.</p>

          <p>The NHS has confirmed plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade, aiming to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be open to walk-in patients and those referred by GPs and police, staffed by specialists to treat people in acute mental distress. While NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails the initiative as a pioneering model of care, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expresses skepticism, emphasizing the need for robust testing and better funding for NHS mental health services. A recent study highlighted the increasing number of people waiting 12 hours or more in A&E after a decision to admit them, underscoring the urgency of addressing mental health care access.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's trade chief has emphasized the need for a trade deal with the US based on "respect" rather than "threats," following US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stated the EU is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides and is ready to defend its interests. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best way forward. Trump expressed impatience with the pace of ongoing EU-US trade negotiations, saying his plan to raise tariffs on June 1 was set, while also suggesting a large investment in the US by a European company might lead to a delay.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued new orders requiring journalists to have official escorts for access to much of the Department of Defense's headquarters. This move is the latest in a series of restrictions imposed on the mainstream press by the Trump administration, following several leaks in recent months that have caused embarrassment to the Pentagon. The restrictions are seen as part of a broader effort by the administration to control the narrative and limit independent reporting on defense matters.

Both steelmakers have welcomed the decision, emphasizing their commitment to American workers, the steel industry, and national security.

          <p>Women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) face a difficult decision when considering pregnancy, as contraceptive medication, the primary treatment, is not an option for those trying to conceive. Marianne Barry, a 29-year-old with PMDD, expresses her fear of coming off the pill due to the return of severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts. The Welsh government acknowledges the need to improve diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD. Dr. Llinos Roberts emphasizes the limited research and treatment options available, highlighting the need for more research and individualized approaches to managing PMDD during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Many young people in China are putting retirement plans on hold due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and pressures around housing and marriage, amidst a slowing economy. They are too preoccupied with current circumstances to prioritize retirement, viewing it as distant in a rapidly changing world. The Chinese government has been urging young people to plan early for retirement due to the country's rapidly aging population and a strained state pension system. Wu Ruoshi, a 29-year-old public sector worker, stated that focusing on living well in the present is more important than constantly worrying about the future.</p>

While nearly 200 trucks carrying humanitarian aid passed through the Kerem Shalom crossing between May 20 and May 22, critics argue this is a "drop in the ocean" compared to the 600 trucks that crossed daily during a previous ceasefire. Logistical challenges, security concerns, and damaged infrastructure hinder the distribution of aid, leaving essential supplies stuck at distribution points.

          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to admit to it. This shift is attributed to a desire for more "me time," a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations, and a reevaluation of priorities following the coronavirus pandemic. Experts believe this change is positive, potentially leading to happier individuals and a healthier economy.</p>

While Aston Martin has invested in a new factory, Newey believes that addressing the simulator issue will be a two-year project. The team currently sits seventh in the constructors' championship after seven races this season.</p>

          <p>A former British soldier-turned-smuggler has revealed to the BBC how he transported dozens of Vietnamese migrants into private marinas in seaside towns across south-east England via yacht. He also described how he smuggled Albanian people in cars onto ferries, where they then jumped into lorries mid-journey. According to the ex-smuggler, these routes were easy and low-risk. Border Force acknowledges the concerning risk posed by these methods and says it will look at the vulnerabilities identified. Two harbourmasters confirmed that private marinas are easy targets for people-smugglers due to limited security.</p>

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan’s representative office and relocated it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, signaling a deepening alignment with Beijing. Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung disputes the relocation claim. Meanwhile, Somalia has banned Taiwanese passport holders, retaliating against Taiwan's growing ties with Somaliland. Experts highlight that Taiwan's diminishing presence in Africa underscores the growing economic ties between African nations and Beijing.

The reserve rice is expected to reach store shelves as early as June, addressing criticism that the government has failed to curb a spike in rice prices amid rising inflation. Koizumi intends to publish weekly retail rice prices by region and examine distribution channels. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms in early May, nearly double last year's level.</p>

          <p>Germany's commitment to reckoning with its Nazi past is often selective, embraced when it enhances the nation's self-image but ignored when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. The Herbert Quandt Media prize, named after an early SS supporter who profited from slave labor, continues to be awarded to journalists from prominent media outlets. Many of Germany’s wealthiest families built their empires on Nazi collaboration and forced labor, yet continue to be seamlessly absorbed into society. The author argues that Germany's remembrance culture is often reduced to a slogan, observed only when convenient.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan amid geopolitical tensions and discussions on de-dollarization. Businesses in Qatar are keen to take advantage of the yuan using tools available in Hong Kong, such as settlement, payment, hedging, and swaps. The trend showcases that the US’ trade war has spilled over to the financial market, prompting more countries and businesses to consider alternatives to the US dollar in international trades, payments and investments. This urgency to “de-dollarise” dovetails with China’s effort to internationalise its currency, a strategy that dates back to the 2008 financial crisis and aims to mitigate risks and assert financial independence.</p>

Despite the police department pausing automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A., a private organization operating the cameras, the technology was used to locate one of the fugitives. Critics argue that the public is not informed or consenting to being scanned, and the ACLU has called for a halt to the program.
