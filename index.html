        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, driven by robust performance in its trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's revenue from fixed income trading saw a significant 14% jump, benefiting from market volatility, while investment banking fees rose by 7%. Despite an overall 17% decline in net income compared to the previous year, which was skewed by a large gain on Visa shares, the underlying results were strong. CEO Jamie Dimon noted the U.S. economy's resilience but also reiterated warnings about geopolitical and trade-related risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's forecasts, with net income climbing 25% year-over-year to $4.02 billion. The bank's success was largely attributed to a 16% increase in total markets revenue and an 18% rise in banking revenue, capitalizing on market volatility. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance as evidence of the bank's ongoing turnaround plan, which includes strategic international pullbacks. However, the bank also reported a 16% growth in its cost of credit, citing a deteriorating economic outlook as a key factor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu has formed a multi-year partnership with Uber to integrate its Apollo Go autonomous vehicles into Uber's ride-hailing network outside of the U.S. and mainland China. The initial rollout, expected later this year in Asia and the Middle East, will eventually involve thousands of Baidu's driverless cars, allowing Uber users to hail them through the app. This collaboration allows Baidu to expand its autonomous driving business internationally while providing Uber with a proven partner in the driverless technology space. The news prompted a rise in both companies' premarket stock values.</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the United States rose to 2.7% in June, up from 2.4% in May, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data. This increase marks a halt in the previous downward trend and suggests that President Trump's tariffs are beginning to impact consumer prices. While still far below the peaks seen three years ago, the data reflects the effects of an average tariff rate of 18.7%, the highest since 1933. The article notes that further price increases are likely if additional threatened tariffs on major trading partners like the EU, Mexico, and Canada are implemented. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new head coach, Ruben Amorim, is facing difficulties in reshaping the team's squad ahead of the upcoming season, despite expressing a clear vision for its future. Five key players, including Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, have been isolated from the main squad but have not yet been sold, which is crucial for funding new acquisitions. The club has only made one major signing so far and is struggling to offload unwanted players due to their high wages and transfer fees.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 11,700 people from Afghanistan.

The ruling provides a one-week pause to allow for legal briefs to be filed, offering a brief reprieve for Afghan nationals who faced deportation.

Additionally, the government will make its mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers permanent.

To manage the fallout, the government obtained an unprecedented superinjunction to prevent media reporting while creating a new resettlement scheme to provide "cover" for the evacuations. Details of the breach and the subsequent operation were only revealed after a nearly two-year legal battle by media organizations successfully overturned the gagging order.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual salary report, while listing high earners like Gary Lineker and Zoe Ball, omits many of the corporation's most famous personalities. This is because the disclosure requirement only applies to talent paid directly from the license fee, not those employed by the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Studios, or independent production companies. Consequently, stars of major shows like "Strictly Come Dancing," "The Traitors," and "The Apprentice," including Claudia Winkleman and Lord Sugar, do not appear on the list. This system, designed to allow BBC Studios to compete commercially, means the public report provides an incomplete picture of talent earnings at the corporation.</p>

This new approach comes as 67% of China's population now lives in urban areas and the property sector faces significant challenges.

          <h2>Linn Ullmann's Novel "Girl, 1983" Explores the Intersection of Memory, Trauma, and Forgetting</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Linn Ullmann's latest book, "Girl, 1983," is examined in this review as a profound exploration of autobiographical writing, memory, and the nature of forgetting. The novel centers on a writer trying to reconstruct a painful memory from her adolescence involving a relationship with an older photographer, an experience she cannot fully recall. The review notes how Ullmann, daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, blurs the lines between fiction and memoir, using the novel form to embrace the gaps and absences in personal history. The book challenges the idea that memory is a perfect archive, suggesting that what is forgotten is as significant as what is remembered.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has received approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, a significant reversal of a previous policy that restricted such sales. CEO Jensen Huang announced the decision, stating that the U.S. government has assured the company that licenses will be granted for the shipments. This move is seen as a major win for Nvidia, allowing it to compete more effectively with rivals like Huawei in the vast Chinese market, which is home to half of the world's AI researchers. The policy shift follows lobbying efforts by tech leaders who argued the restrictions hindered U.S. competitiveness.</p>

The complaint was filed by Spain's Association of People with Achondroplasia (ADEE), which described the act as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and violating laws against using people with disabilities for public mockery. While an individual claiming to be one of the entertainers defended the event as a professional and respectful engagement, the Ministry of Social Rights has asked the prosecutor's office to determine if any laws were broken.

          <p>A recent wave of tariff threats from President Trump against more than 50 countries, including the European Union and Mexico, has injected significant uncertainty into the global economy. Economists and trade experts note that with an August 1st deadline looming, businesses are operating in a "dense fog," unable to determine if the threats will become official policy. The administration has defended its aggressive use of tariffs as a tool to ensure fair trade, boost domestic industry, and achieve other foreign policy goals. However, critics argue the unpredictable approach has yielded few comprehensive trade deals and leaves both U.S. businesses and consumers in limbo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled to permit the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to dismantle the Department of Education, overturning a lower court's temporary pause on the action. The decision allows for significant cuts at the department, which could result in the loss of approximately 1,400 jobs. Opponents had sued the administration, arguing that President Trump cannot shut down a department created by congressional law without legislative changes. While the case will continue in lower courts, critics fear that by the time a final ruling is issued, the damage to the department's functions could be irreversible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's handling of the recent Texas flash floods is drawing criticism for violating a core principle of emergency management: preparedness. The administration has been actively remaking the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) into a "lean, deployable disaster force," but this overhaul is being tested mid-crisis. Reports indicate significant delays in deploying rescue teams and a failure to answer thousands of calls from survivors, with FEMA having fewer staff and resources on the ground compared to past disasters. Experts argue that experimenting with agency structure during a catastrophic event that has claimed over 130 lives is dangerous and risks greater devastation.</p>

The project is seen as crucial for Shetland's key industries, such as salmon farming and fishing, which are constrained by current infrastructure. While funding remains a challenge, a feasibility study is underway, with a toll-based financing model similar to the Faroes' being considered.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has implemented a 17% tariff on most tomatoes imported from Mexico, effective immediately. The move follows the U.S. withdrawal from a 2019 agreement that had suspended previous anti-dumping duties, with the Commerce Department arguing the deal failed to protect American growers from unfairly low-priced Mexican imports. With approximately 70% of tomatoes consumed in the U.S. coming from Mexico, the new tariff is expected to increase prices for consumers on products like fresh tomatoes, salsas, and pizza sauces. Mexico has rejected the dumping accusations and will seek to negotiate a new agreement to avoid the duty.</p>
