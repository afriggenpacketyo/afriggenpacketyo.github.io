          <p>A Republican-led measure to temporarily fund the government successfully passed the House but failed to secure the necessary 60 votes in the Senate. This legislative stalemate leaves no clear path to prevent a government shutdown when funding expires at the end of the month. The bill's failure highlights the deep partisan divisions, with Democrats opposing the measure due to the exclusion of their priorities, particularly in health care. Both parties are now blaming each other as lawmakers leave Washington, increasing the likelihood of a funding lapse.</p>

While the system may pass east of Bermuda next week, it is not projected to pose a direct threat to land. This season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA, with Gabrielle being one of few named storms to form.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned from his position amid significant pressure from the Trump administration. Sources indicate the pressure was to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a frequent political opponent of the president, despite investigators finding insufficient evidence of mortgage fraud. President Trump publicly stated he wanted Siebert removed, escalating concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department. Siebert reportedly intends to remain in the office as a line prosecutor.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has strongly criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr for threatening ABC's broadcast license over comments made by host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz described Carr's actions as "dangerous as hell" and compared them to a mobster's shakedown, stating it was "right out of Goodfellas." While Cruz expressed his personal dislike for Kimmel's remarks about the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, he warned that using government power to regulate media speech sets a perilous precedent that could ultimately harm conservatives.</p>

Manoj, who is largely self-taught in coding, now conducts workshops at senior centers to raise awareness about the increasing sophistication of scams, particularly those using artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>UCLA has released new, formalized rules for campus protests ahead of the fall term, many of which align with demands from the Trump administration for a stricter approach to demonstrations. The guidelines ban unauthorized overnight encampments and prohibit demonstrations in Royce Quad, the site of a major pro-Palestinian protest in 2024. While the university insists the rules are content-neutral, they come as UCLA faces the withdrawal of federal research funding and pressure to crack down on activities deemed disruptive or antisemitic.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the motivations behind President Trump's recent attacks on broadcast television, particularly his pressure campaign against "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" It posits that his actions are likely driven by a long-held grudge against NBC for firing him from "The Apprentice" in 2015. Furthermore, the focus on legacy broadcast networks reveals an anachronistic view of media power in an age where social media and streaming platforms have far greater reach and influence, especially among younger audiences.</p>

          <p>Recent decisions by the CDC's advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) could inadvertently create a two-tiered system for vaccine access in the United States. The panel's vote to remove the combined MMRV vaccine from the federally funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) program means low-income children will lose free access to the single-shot option. This article suggests that as private insurers may continue to cover it, a disparity could emerge where vaccine convenience and access are determined by economic status.</p>
