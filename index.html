          <p>Hurricane Erick intensified into a Category 3 storm as it neared Mexico's Pacific coast, prompting warnings of damaging winds and life-threatening flash floods in Oaxaca and Guerrero. Local authorities urged residents in low-lying areas to seek shelter, with around 2,000 temporary shelters set up and troops on standby for cleanup efforts. Mexico experiences severe storms annually between May and November, with past storms causing significant casualties and damage. The mountainous coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to mudslides and river flooding, leading to school closures and heightened vigilance in major port cities like Acapulco. The optimism score reflects the serious nature of the event and the potential for devastation. </p>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention, showing 99.9% effectiveness in clinical trials. This approval marks a significant advancement in the fight against HIV, potentially preventing HIV on an unprecedented scale. However, this approval comes amidst concerns about the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research, which experts warn could set back vaccine development by a decade. While lenacapavir is a crucial development, researchers emphasize the continued need for a vaccine to eradicate HIV entirely. </p>

          <p>At Home, a home goods retailer, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and will close 26 stores due to slowing sales, inflation, and tariffs. The company, operating 260 stores across 40 states, has signed a restructuring agreement with lenders to eliminate nearly $2 billion in debt and secure $200 million in capital. This is not At Home's first bankruptcy filing, as it sought similar relief in 2004 under its former name, Garden Ridge. The company cites inflation, decreased demand for home goods, the shift to online shopping, and higher import tariffs as contributing factors to its financial difficulties.

          <p>The U.S. government is launching a five-prong initiative to combat the spread of New World screwworms, including building an $8.5 million insect dispersal facility in Texas. The facility will breed millions of sterile New World screwworm flies to mate with fertile flies, preventing them from laying eggs that hatch into flesh-eating larvae. The USDA also plans to convert a fruit fly breeding facility near Mexico's border with Guatemala into a screwworm fly breeding center. This effort aims to protect livestock, pets, and wildlife from the devastating pest, with officials expressing gratitude for the U.S. taking the threat seriously.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered former U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant Peter Stinson to home detention with GPS monitoring after accusations of making threats against President Donald Trump on social media. Stinson, a former sharpshooter and FEMA instructor, allegedly made threats on platforms like X, Reddit, and Bluesky. Prosecutors argued Stinson lied about his marksmanship skills, while his public defender claimed the statements were protected political hyperbole. The FBI affidavit detailed numerous online threats, including references to violence and association with ANTIFA, leading to the judge giving prosecutors until next Wednesday to file additional written briefs on the matter.</p>

The court upheld the $1 million jury verdict awarded to Irons in 2022, finding the district negligent in supervising and training its employees. The bullying, which began in 2017, included social media harassment, verbal assaults, and a physical attack, with school officials failing to adequately address the issue.

The study also uncovered widespread racial misclassification, with 41% of AI/AN deaths incorrectly classified, predominantly as "White," skewing official statistics.

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering strikes on Iran's nuclear facility, the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, according to a source familiar with the intelligence. The decision comes amid a lack of response from Iran regarding ongoing nuclear talks, potentially due to Trump's demand for unconditional surrender. Trump is gauging the reaction of his MAGA base to potential American strikes against Iran, while also being briefed on security at U.S. Army bases, which could be vulnerable to retaliation. The Israelis have also discovered that they did not eliminate all air defenses in Iran as previously believed, adding to the concern.</p>

This disagreement has also been swept into the growing rift within Trump's "America First" movement over whether the US should enter the Israel-Iran conflict.

          <p>President Vladimir Putin refused to discuss the possibility that Israel and the United States would kill Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and said the Iranian people were consolidating around the leadership in Tehran. Putin said all sides should look for ways to end hostilities in a way that ensured both Iran's right to peaceful nuclear power and Israel's right to the unconditional security of the Jewish state. Putin said he had been in touch with Trump and with Netanyahu, and that he had conveyed Moscow's ideas on resolving the conflict while ensuring Iran's continued access to civil nuclear energy.</p>
