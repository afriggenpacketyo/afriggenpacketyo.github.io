        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics indicates that retail sales growth in April slowed to 5.1%, falling short of analysts' projections, which suggests that consumption remains a significant concern for the Chinese economy. Despite this, industrial output exceeded expectations, growing by 6.1% year-on-year, which indicates that the impact of U.S. tariffs was not as severe as initially anticipated. The bureau acknowledged the presence of unstable external factors and emphasized the need to strengthen the foundation for sustained economic recovery. The Chinese government has implemented stimulus measures to boost consumption and support businesses affected by tariffs, but potential stimulus measures could be put on hold for now.

          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus, a 25-year-old resident of Twentynine Palms, as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing. Bartkus, who expressed nihilistic views against bringing people into the world against their will, is believed to have died in the explosion, which officials are treating as an intentional act of terrorism. The bombing, caused by a large vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, injured four others and significantly damaged surrounding buildings. Authorities are investigating Bartkus's writings and his attempt to livestream the attack, while emphasizing that there is no ongoing threat to the public. All embryos stored at the fertility clinic were saved, and the clinic plans to reopen at a temporary location.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" passed a critical hurdle in the House of Representatives, moving closer to a chamber-wide vote. The House Budget Committee advanced the legislation after conservatives initially blocked it, seeking assurances of stricter Medicaid crackdowns and green energy subsidy repeals. Republicans are using budget reconciliation to pass Trump's agenda, requiring adherence to specific rules related to federal spending, tax, and national debt. The bill aims to enact Trump's campaign promises on tax cuts, immigration, energy, and defense, though Senate changes are expected, necessitating further House consideration before potential enactment by July 4th.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with Stage 4 prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, a condition considered serious but increasingly manageable due to recent medical advancements. Prostate cancer specialists emphasize that while the disease is incurable at this stage, treatments have improved significantly, extending life expectancy from months to years. Cutting off testosterone, a key element in prostate cancer growth, is the primary approach, now achieved through drugs rather than surgery. The article also notes that the infusion of federal research money, particularly through Mr. Biden’s cancer moonshot effort, has largely contributed to the progress.</p>

          <p>Following the tragic incident in which a Mexican Navy ship collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, killing two crew members, investigations are underway to determine the cause. The Cuauhtémoc, a 300-foot long sailing vessel, struck the bridge after experiencing mechanical issues that caused it to veer off course. Senator Chuck Schumer has raised questions about the role of a tugboat and whether cuts to the Coast Guard may have contributed to the accident. The victims have been identified as América Yamileth Sánchez Hernández, 20, and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos, 23, with at least 22 others injured.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have resulted in the deaths of at least 103 people, according to hospitals and medics, as Israel intensifies its military operations in the region. The strikes have also forced the closure of the main hospital in northern Gaza, the Indonesian Hospital.

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen called off the strike at about 6 p.m., and NJ Transit announced that trains would resume a full schedule on Tuesday morning. The agreement was announced by Governor Philip D. Murphy, who said it was fair to NJ Transit's employees while also being affordable for the state's commuters and taxpayers.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, characterized as an aggressive form with a Gleason score of 9, which has spread to his bones. While early detection of prostate cancer often leads to a cure, Biden's case focuses on managing the disease, slowing its progression, and preserving his quality of life. The treatment plan will likely involve blocking testosterone, as the cancer is hormone-sensitive, potentially combined with other hormone therapies or chemotherapy. The article emphasizes the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual, given Biden's active status.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are becoming more severe due to climate change, which is intensifying droughts and reducing summer rain, with the risk predicted to more than double by 2100. About 60,000 forest fires rage through the EU every year, causing €2 billion in economic losses. The highest risk in Germany, for example, is in the northeastern part of the country with its large pine plantations, said Elmqvist. Preventing fires is just as important as fighting them. Solutions include controlled burning, restoring ecosystems and education.</p>
