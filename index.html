          <p>Following an audit by Baroness Louise Casey into child sexual abuse by grooming gangs, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a full national statutory inquiry.  The inquiry will cover England and Wales and address criticisms levied against Starmer for his previous reluctance to establish such an investigation.  This decision comes after the government initially dismissed calls for a national inquiry earlier this year. The inquiry will have the power to compel witnesses to provide evidence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly shifting its focus away from immigration raids on farms and hotels due to negative economic impacts.  ICE issued internal guidance to halt workplace enforcement actions in these sectors unless related to criminal investigations.  This decision comes after protests in Los Angeles and concerns from industry leaders about the impact of aggressive immigration policies.  The change reflects a significant shift in the administration's approach to immigration enforcement.</p>
