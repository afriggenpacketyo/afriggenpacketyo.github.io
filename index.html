          <p>President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles following clashes between residents and ICE agents in a predominantly Latino district, after ICE operations led to numerous arrests. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the raids as cruel and inflammatory, while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass accused ICE of sowing terror. The White House stated that the deployment is necessary due to California's failure to protect its citizens from violent mobs attacking ICE officers. Law enforcement officials warned protesters against violence and obstruction, stating that law and order would prevail. The situation remains tense, with concerns raised about the federal government's use of military force to quell dissent. Optimism is low given the escalation of tensions and the potential for further unrest.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles under Title 10, bypassing Governor Newsom's authority, raises significant legal questions about federal power and states' rights. Constitutional law scholars argue that using the military domestically to suppress protests is a chilling act that infringes on the right to dissent. The ACLU warns against the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, citing historical restrictions and the Posse Comitatus Act. Concerns are also raised about the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act, which could further escalate tensions and undermine local control.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China. The research, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China is facing a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, making the decline in fertility rates especially urgent. The study also found that traditional expectations placing the burden on women to perform most childcare duties persist in China and other East Asian countries.</p>

          <p>Recent studies challenge earlier findings suggesting the presence of a biosignature on the distant planet K2-18b. While initial research identified molecules associated with living things, new analyses indicate that these compounds could also form without life. Astronomers have raised concerns about noisy data, temperature discrepancies, and modeling methods used in the original study. Further research and observations are underway to determine the true nature of K2-18b's atmosphere and its potential for habitability.</p>
