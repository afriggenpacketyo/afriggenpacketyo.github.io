          <h2>California Woman Convicted of Murder After "Bugs Bunny" Defense Fails in Second Trial</h2>

          <p>Linda Duffey Gwozdz was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey, despite her claim it was a tragic accident. Her defense bizarrely centered on a shared "game" involving cartoon character voices, where she alleged her husband indicated the gun was unloaded using an Elmer Fudd impression. After an initial mistrial where this story was heavily featured, the prosecution streamlined its case in the second trial, omitting the cartoon details, which led to a swift guilty verdict and a sentence of 40 years to life. The case highlights how different trial strategies can lead to vastly different outcomes.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi was murdered in a case of mistaken identity in Cardiff, his sister is making a public appeal for the fugitive suspect to surrender. Aamir was stabbed to death by two contract killers who went to the wrong address. While the hitmen are serving life sentences, Mohammed Ali Ege, the man suspected of ordering the hit, remains one of Europe's most wanted fugitives after escaping custody in India in 2011. Aamir's sister, Nishat, urged Ege to turn himself in, stating he is not truly free while living a life on the run.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities issued a high-level orange typhoon warning as Typhoon Wipha approached the southern coast, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people. The storm was expected to make landfall in Guangdong province with wind speeds exceeding 150km/h (93mph). Officials evacuated over 12,000 people from the sea and 266,000 residents on land in preparation for heavy rains and potential flooding. The powerful storm had previously impacted Taiwan and the Philippines before heading towards mainland China.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week places a spotlight on major European banks like Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank as they release their quarterly earnings. Market optimism is high for the financial sector, which is expected to show resilient growth in contrast to downgrades in other industries. Concurrently, all eyes are on the European Central Bank, which is anticipated to keep interest rates on hold. However, this decision is shadowed by the looming threat of U.S. tariffs, which could force the ECB to cut rates in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Technology played a pivotal role in the investigation of Nicole Vander Heyden's 2016 murder in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Initially, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was the prime suspect, but data from his Fitbit device corroborated his alibi that he was home during the time of the murder, leading to his release. Investigators then used DNA found on the victim's sock to identify a new suspect, George Steven Burch. Data from Burch's Google Dashboard tracked his phone's location to the crime scene, the body disposal site, and other key locations, ultimately leading to his conviction for the murder.</p>

          <p>Five days of torrential rainfall across South Korea have caused widespread devastation, leaving at least 14 people dead and 12 others missing. The severe weather triggered landslides, house collapses, and flash floods, particularly in southern regions which received up to 800 millimeters (31 inches) of rain. Government reports indicate that several fatalities occurred due to collapsed homes and swollen streams. As of Sunday, nearly 4,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, though the rain has started to subside and heavy rain alerts have been lifted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that the persistent failure to achieve peace in conflicts like those in Gaza, Ukraine, and Syria stems not just from political deadlock but from a deeper crisis of morality. The world is ethically fractured, lacking a "permanent moral order" or universally accepted standards, which allows atrocities to continue as different groups justify them through moral relativism. This collapse of a shared ethical framework is mirrored by the breakdown of the international rules-based order. Without agreed-upon principles, resolving conflicts becomes nearly impossible, leaving coercion and manipulation as the primary tools in a world increasingly wedded to war.</p>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet in his Pasadena home, authorities have charged two suspects with his murder. Muhammad Abdul-Malik, 38, is accused of being the shooter, and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, 31, is accused of being the getaway driver. Moreno was playing video games in his bedroom in November 2021 when he was struck and killed. A breakthrough in the cold case came after recently enhanced surveillance video and subsequent police sketches led to the identification and arrest of the two suspects.</p>
