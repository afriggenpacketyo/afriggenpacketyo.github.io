        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to bring record-high temperatures to much of the eastern United States, impacting over 150 million Americans with extreme heat alerts. The National Weather Service warns of dangerous conditions from the Midwest to the East Coast, with light winds and sunny skies exacerbating the risk for those without adequate cooling or hydration. Meteorologists attribute the heat wave to a stationary heat dome trapping heat and humidity, with some areas potentially experiencing temperatures 40 degrees warmer than the previous week. Residents are advised to stay indoors with air conditioning, avoid strenuous outdoor activities, and remain hydrated to prevent heat-related illnesses, as climate change contributes to more frequent and longer-lasting extreme temperatures. The weather service emphasized the first heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous because the human body has yet to adjust to the warmer temperatures. </p>

          <p>French authorities are investigating a series of incidents where festivalgoers reported being stabbed with syringes during outdoor music events, with 145 cases reported nationwide and 13 in Paris.

Investigations were opened in Paris after three people reported feeling unwell after being stabbed, including a 15-year-old girl and an 18-year-old male.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's dominance in rare earth elements is being significantly strengthened by supplies from Myanmar, a country with deposits rich in heavy rare earth elements. Myanmar accounted for 57% of China's rare earth imports last year, particularly dysprosium and terbium, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing. This reliance allows China to maintain a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain, granting it considerable leverage. However, this extraction in Myanmar comes at a terrible cost to the environment and local communities, raising concerns about ethical sourcing and sustainability.</p>

          <p>Immigration raids in Los Angeles are causing economic hardship for street vendors, many of whom are undocumented and fear deportation. These vendors, who contribute to a $504 million industry, are forced to choose between risking deportation to provide for their families and staying home safely. Community organizations are providing assistance, including "Know Your Rights" workshops and financial aid, while a state bill aims to protect vendor data from immigration enforcement. The raids have created a chilling effect, with even some American citizens staying home, impacting the livelihoods of many vendors who are essential to the local economy.</p>

          <p>A Louisiana NPR station, Red River Radio, is facing potential federal funding cuts that could severely impact its ability to serve rural communities. The station, which provides vital news and emergency information to areas with limited access to other media sources, relies on government funding for about 15% of its budget. Supporters of the station argue that these cuts could have life-threatening consequences, especially during hurricane season, when residents depend on public radio for critical updates. Opponents claim the cuts are necessary to reduce taxpayer funding for media outlets they deem politically biased.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland. The court reversed a lower court order requiring the government to give migrants a "meaningful opportunity" to argue they could be tortured or killed if deported to a third country. The decision allows the administration to deport migrants to countries such as South Sudan, despite concerns about safety and human rights.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The U.S. Central Command reported that U.S. forces, alongside Qatari partners, successfully defended against the attack using Patriot batteries, with no injuries reported. President Trump stated that the U.S. had prior warning of the attack and described it as a "very weak response." The Qatari government condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty, while Iran's supreme leader claimed that no one was harmed and that Iran would not accept harassment.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has contacted Tesla after videos surfaced showing the company's robotaxis operating erratically in Austin, Texas. The incidents, including a robotaxi driving the wrong way and another braking abruptly, occurred shortly after Tesla launched its autonomous trip service to invited users. NHTSA is gathering additional information about the incidents, as it investigates potential safety defects with Tesla's FSD technology. The launch of the robotaxis fell short of Elon Musk's previous promises of full autonomy, while competitors like Waymo have surpassed 10 million paid trips.</p>

          <p>An RBN Energy executive, Rusty Braziel, expressed doubt that Iran will close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions. Braziel argued that closing the strait would harm Iran's own interests, as it exports 1.7 million barrels of oil per day through the passage. He noted that the market seems to agree, as oil prices dropped despite concerns following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Braziel also cautioned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China are negatively impacting the trustworthiness of U.S. energy exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

The channels share a mixture of true and false information, often omitting crucial context to give a misleading impression.

          <p>Local governments in China are promoting the export of "zero-mileage" used cars, which are new cars registered and immediately exported as used to inflate sales and growth figures. These tactics include creating extra licenses, fast-tracking tax rebates, and funding export infrastructure. The practice is driven by ambitious economic growth targets set by Beijing, but it is also contributing to a domestic price war and concerns about automotive "dumping" abroad. Experts suggest this practice allows automakers to show growth and dispose of cars that are difficult to sell domestically, raising concerns about the accuracy of sales figures and the sustainability of the industry.</p>

This agreement aims to address the common issue where private health insurers require patients to ask for permission before they can receive medical treatment. The pledge seeks to standardize the prior authorization approval process, deliver decisions faster, reduce the number of procedures and drugs subject to prior authorization, honor existing approvals when patients switch insurers, and build a public dashboard of industry performance.
