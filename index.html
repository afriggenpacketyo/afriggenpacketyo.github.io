          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely advanced on Monday, mirroring Wall Street's previous gains, as investors reacted to China's central bank maintaining its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. This decision, which held the one-year LPR at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%, was in line with economists' expectations despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. Major indices across the region, including Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi, saw increases, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index experienced a slight decline. The stability in China's rates, amidst global monetary policy shifts, continues to influence regional economic sentiment and investment trends, reflecting a cautious yet steady approach to monetary policy.</p>

          <p>At the San Sebastian Film Festival, Angelina Jolie voiced profound concern for America, stating she no longer recognizes her country despite her deep affection for it. The actress, who maintains an international lifestyle and worldview, criticized anything that divides or limits personal expression and freedoms, calling these current times "very, very heavy." Jolie further reiterated her long-standing desire to relocate abroad once her youngest children reach adulthood, attributing her continued residence in Los Angeles to divorce-related custody arrangements with Brad Pitt. She explicitly seeks more privacy and a sense of shared humanity that she feels is increasingly absent in her current environment.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old boy is currently in critical condition, fighting for his life, following a shooting incident that occurred outside Wembley Stadium in north-west London. Police responded to Atlantic Crescent early Sunday morning after reports of gunfire, where they discovered the teenager suffering from a gunshot injury. He was immediately rushed to a major trauma center, where he remains in a critical state. Authorities have since informed his next of kin and are providing support, while an intensive investigation is actively underway. No arrests have been made at this stage, and the incident has understandably caused significant shock and concern within the local community, leading to an increased police presence.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk publicly met and shook hands at a memorial event for right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, marking a notable reconciliation months after their spectacular public falling out. The two influential figures, who once collaborated closely during Trump's second administration, sat together in a stadium in Glendale, Arizona, sparking widespread speculation about the future of their relationship. Their previous association had soured over significant policy disagreements and public accusations, including Musk's claims about Trump's alleged involvement in the "Epstein files." This unexpected public meeting, prominently shared on social media, signals a potentially renewed alliance between the former president and the tech mogul.</p>

Her message starkly contrasted with more aggressive rhetoric from other speakers, highlighting a call for spiritual revival and continued advocacy for the American family.</p>

          <p>A tragic shooting incident at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Saturday night resulted in one fatality and two wounded individuals. Authorities swiftly arrested 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau, a former employee of the club, and charged him with second-degree murder. The victim was identified as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare, who had been enjoying dinner with his family at the restaurant. The violent event, which reportedly lasted less than a minute, also led to at least four other non-gunshot injuries among patrons.

Experts explain that music "lights up" multiple regions of the brain simultaneously, effectively reducing anxiety and psychological pain, and can even reach individuals who are unconscious. This practice helps both patients and their loved ones create shared experiences and maintain a vital sense of connection during immensely difficult times.</p>

          <p>German and Swedish fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Russian IL-20M reconnaissance plane that reportedly entered neutral airspace over the Baltic Sea without a flight plan or radio contact. This incident marks the latest in a concerning series of Russian military aircraft incursions into NATO airspace this month, which has significantly escalated regional tensions. Estonia previously reported three Russian MiG-31 jets entering its airspace, leading to an invocation of NATO's Article 4 and a formal summoning of Moscow's charge d'affaires. These repeated provocations are widely interpreted as deliberate attempts by Russia to divert attention from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and test alliance resolve.</p>

          <p>Farmers and livestock producers across the United Kingdom are currently grappling with severe, widespread hay shortages, a direct consequence of the country's historically hot and dry spring and summer months. Experts have confirmed 2025 as both the UK's hottest summer and spring on record, leading to greatly diminished fall harvest yields for crucial crops. This "nationwide problem" is forcing both agricultural buyers and sellers to increasingly rely on more expensive imported hay, significantly impacting their financial stability. The escalating situation starkly highlights the growing challenges posed by rising global temperatures and extreme weather events, which are making food production more expensive and less abundant globally.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance strategically utilized Charlie Kirk's memorial service to prominently emphasize Kirk's Christian faith and his own, a move widely interpreted as politically calculated for a potential 2028 presidential bid. Vance, who personally escorted Kirk's casket, is actively engaging Kirk's influential youth-focused Turning Point USA network, aiming to claim his mantle. His remarks, which starkly contrasted with the more conciliatory tone of Kirk's widow, positioned him as a hard-edged conservative heir to Donald Trump. Vance's deliberate actions and commanding lead in early hypothetical polls suggest a methodical approach to securing the Republican nomination, blending populist rhetoric with cultural warfare.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to aggressively investigate and prosecute his political opponents, specifically naming former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. In a series of social media posts, Trump expressed profound frustration over perceived inaction, stating, "We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility." Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, sharply criticized these direct calls as a dangerous path towards dictatorship, arguing that the Justice Department must remain fiercely independent and unbiased. This follows the resignation of a federal prosecutor who reportedly found insufficient evidence to prosecute James, highlighting intense political pressure.</p>

          <p>An Afghan mother, Nazo, heartbreakingly recounts the devastating loss of her three young sons to malnutrition within a mere two-year period, starkly illustrating Afghanistan's escalating and severe hunger crisis. The family, residing in the Sheidaee settlement, struggles daily without adequate food or any external aid, as international assistance has sharply declined. The UN's World Food Programme warns of an "unprecedented crisis" that is placing over three million children in immediate peril, a situation exacerbated by severe drought and the forced returns of Afghans from neighboring countries. The Taliban government attributes the crisis to sanctions and aid cuts, while its restrictive policies, particularly concerning women's rights, continue to hinder international recognition and crucial aid delivery.</p>

Trump praised the potential investors as "American patriots" and suggested that significant progress was being made in negotiations with China.

DRPLA, previously considered extremely rare in the UK, causes symptoms including progressive memory loss, impaired body movement control, seizures, and psychiatric disturbances. Dr. Mark Wardle notes a higher local prevalence due to "common founders," with the current generation experiencing more aggressive disease.

This expansion could potentially increase annual flights to approximately 389,000 by the late 2030s. While the airport anticipates welcoming up to 80 million passengers and creating numerous local jobs, the decision faces strong opposition from climate campaigners who are deeply concerned about the environmental impact, increased noise pollution, and rising climate emissions.
