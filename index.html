          <p>California state parks officials have launched a new lottery-style drawing system to improve access to highly coveted campsites. The system is being piloted at three popular parks: Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls. This change aims to level the playing field for would-be campers, as reservations at these locations previously vanished within minutes of becoming available. The state has also streamlined its reservation websites to provide more real-time availability information for campers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is moving forward with plans to refit a Boeing 747-8 aircraft unconditionally donated by Qatar for presidential use. A memorandum of understanding outlines the terms of the gift, which will serve as a temporary Air Force One while new official aircraft are being built. The Pentagon will be responsible for the significant costs of upgrading the jet for security, with funds expected to be reallocated from the Sentinel nuclear missile program. The arrangement has drawn scrutiny over constitutional rules regarding presidents accepting gifts from foreign governments.</p>

          <p>A court in Bogota has convicted former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe of witness tampering, a landmark ruling marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been found guilty in a criminal court. The judge determined that Uribe bribed witnesses to provide false testimony in an investigation into his alleged connections to right-wing paramilitary groups. The conviction carries a potential prison sentence of up to 12 years. The case is highly politicized, stemming from a long-running feud between Uribe and his political rivals.</p>

While this perspective sometimes aligns him with public sentiment, it also makes his administration susceptible to manipulation and misinformation.

Her mother, a former nurse who was struck off for sharing conspiracy theories, has blamed doctors for her daughter's death. The inquest is examining the appropriateness of her care after she had described NHS treatment as a violation of her human rights.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona rapidly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on Monday, becoming the first hurricane of the year in the central Pacific Ocean. The storm was located hundreds of miles south-southeast of Honolulu and is not considered an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect Iona to strengthen to a Category 2 storm as it moves westward over the next couple of days. It is then projected to gradually weaken later in the week.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority is surveying the country's airlines about their future needs for Boeing commercial jets, a move that could signal a thaw in trade relations with the U.S. The regulator specifically asked carriers about overdue Boeing orders and their fleet renewal plans for 2025 and beyond. This development comes as the director of the agency met with a senior Boeing executive to discuss expanding cooperation. Industry insiders believe Boeing could be a primary beneficiary if a broader trade deal between Washington and Beijing is reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Palestinian family seeking to flee Gaza has won a significant legal ruling against the UK government. The High Court ordered the foreign secretary to "think again" about refusing to help the family of six, who are living in a tent and have a relative with British citizenship in the UK. The Foreign Office had previously denied assistance, citing a policy that limits such help to immediate family separation cases. The judge ruled that the government must reconsider, acknowledging the legally exceptional nature of the family's perilous situation.</p>

          <p>Leaders from France and Germany have responded negatively to the new trade agreement reached between the European Union and the United States. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated the deal would "substantially damage" his country's finances, while French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called it an act of "submission." The agreement, which imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to avert a threatened 30% rate, has been met with little enthusiasm across the bloc. Many capitals seem to view it as a necessary evil to avoid an all-out trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economic analysis of the new U.S.-EU trade agreement suggests the European Union accepted an unbalanced deal to prevent a more damaging trade war. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU goods, a sharp increase from previous levels, which is expected to negatively impact the EU's GDP. In return, the EU will not retaliate with its own tariffs and has committed to large purchases of U.S. energy. While the deal reduces the uncertainty of a threatened 30% tariff, economists describe it as asymmetric. (not investment advice)</p>
