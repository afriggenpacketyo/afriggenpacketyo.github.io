        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," with its final episode scheduled for May 2026. The network stated the move is a financial decision, unrelated to the show's content or performance, and that the franchise will be retired rather than having Colbert replaced. During a taping, Colbert informed his audibly disappointed audience of the news, expressing gratitude to CBS, his staff, and viewers for the past decade. The show has been the top-rated late-night program for nine consecutive seasons, and its conclusion marks a significant shift in the late-night television landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced he has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move follows public pressure and a report about a letter from Trump to Epstein, which the president denies. While Bondi stated the Justice Department is ready to file the motion, releasing such transcripts is rare and requires court approval. This action comes after the DOJ and FBI found no evidence of a 'client list' or foul play in Epstein's death, findings that have fueled conspiracy theories among some of the president's supporters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the first round of The Open Championship, golfer Jon Rahm became audibly frustrated with a spectator after a poor tee shot on the 10th hole. The two-time major champion claimed a fan whistled during his backswing, causing a distraction on what he described as the most difficult tee shot on the course. Rahm turned toward the gallery and scolded the fan, though he later downplayed the incident to the media. He admitted that his reaction was partly to release tension and that the noise probably didn't affect his bad swing as much as he made it seem.</p>

          <p>According to two U.S. intelligence sources, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was injured during an Israeli strike on Iran last month. The sources confirmed Iranian state media reports that Pezeshkian sustained leg injuries while escaping through an emergency shaft during a Supreme National Security Council meeting. In a recent interview, Pezeshkian claimed Israel had attempted to assassinate him, though it remains unclear if he was the intended target of the attack. The incident occurred during a 12-day conflict between the two nations that also saw the killing of several high-ranking Iranian military commanders.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' efforts to pass a $9 billion spending cuts bill demanded by President Trump have been complicated by tensions over the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents. Democrats have been using procedural tactics to force a vote on making the files public, capitalizing on a divide within the GOP and pressure from Trump's base. The controversy grew after the Justice Department stated no 'client list' exists and that Epstein's death was a suicide, which has angered conspiracy-minded supporters. This political infighting threatens to delay the spending bill past its deadline, creating a complex legislative showdown.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) on its tail, similar to a rocket. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, was recently tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. Developed by a state-owned aerospace group, its design allows for rapid flight speeds and deployment without a runway, making it flexible for use in rugged terrain. The drone's intelligent control system also demonstrated autonomous capabilities, including target allocation and threat avoidance, suggesting its potential use in drone swarms.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for canceling $4 billion in federal funding for its high-speed rail project. The suit, filed by the state's attorney general, argues the decision was politically motivated, arbitrary, and illegal, citing President Trump's long-standing criticism of the project. Governor Gavin Newsom called the move a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that jeopardizes jobs. The administration pulled the funding after a federal review cited significant budget overruns and delays, concluding there was "no viable path" forward for the ambitious train line.</p>

          <p>President Trump is now labeling the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files a "hoax" and criticizing his own supporters who are demanding their release. This shift in rhetoric comes as he faces a political firestorm from his MAGA base, which is upset with the Justice Department's conclusion that no 'client list' exists. Despite calling it a hoax, Trump also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony. The White House has dismissed the idea of a special prosecutor, while Trump attempts to blame Democrats for the controversy.</p>

          <p>This article explains the function of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the reasons behind President Trump's persistent criticism of its chair, Jerome Powell. The Fed's primary role is to manage monetary policy to maintain low unemployment and stable prices, often creating a difficult balancing act. Trump's frustration stems from the central bank's decision to keep interest rates relatively high to combat inflation, a move he believes hampers economic growth. The president has also targeted Powell over a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters, though the legality of firing a Fed chair remains an untested and contentious issue.

The article analyzes this as a political maneuver to score easy points, particularly by appealing to health-conscious figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and a cult following for "Mexican Coke," which uses cane sugar. However, health experts note that from a metabolic standpoint, there is little to no difference between cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup.

The data arrives amid concerns over economic growth due to potential U.S. tariffs, which could hinder Japan's recovery after its GDP declined in the first quarter.

          <p>Tens of thousands of people are expected to participate in over 1,500 marches and rallies across all 50 U.S. states to protest the Trump administration. The "Good Trouble Lives On" day of action, organized by dozens of advocacy groups, coincides with the fifth anniversary of the death of civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis. Protesters' demands include an end to the administration's crackdown on civil and voting rights, the targeting of minority groups, and cuts to social programs. The events aim to honor Lewis's legacy of nonviolent protest and his call to create "good trouble, necessary trouble."</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common and benign condition, following speculation over photographs showing bruising on his hand and swelling in his legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt explained the bruising was likely from frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use. A physician's note confirmed the diagnosis, stating the condition is common in people over 70 and that Trump remains in "excellent health" with no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The announcement aims to quell rumors about the 79-year-old president's health.</p>

          <p>Five migrants deported from the United States to Eswatini under a third-country agreement are being held in solitary confinement indefinitely, according to a government spokesperson in the small African nation. The men, convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., were sent to Eswatini because their home countries would not accept them. The move is part of the Trump administration's controversial policy of deporting individuals to countries with which they have no ties. Human rights groups have raised alarms, as Eswatini has a poor human rights record, with credible reports of torture and unlawful killings.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has once again suspended Diane Abbott, the country's longest-serving Black MP, following a recent interview. In the interview, Abbott stated she did not regret a 2023 letter to a newspaper in which she appeared to downplay antisemitism by comparing it to prejudice against redheads. Although she later apologized for those remarks and was reinstated to the party, her recent lack of regret was seen as inconsistent with the party's stance. The decision reflects leader Keir Starmer's pledge to maintain a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism within the party.</p>

          <p>CBS is ending “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” next May, a decision driven by significant financial pressures and a dramatic shift in audience viewing habits. While the show has consistently led its broadcast competitors in ratings, it has reportedly been losing money due to declining advertising revenue. Younger audiences are increasingly consuming short-form content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube, diminishing the appeal of traditional hour-long late-night shows. The article notes that while Colbert leads network television, Fox News' "Gutfeld!" often draws a larger audience, highlighting the changing dynamics of late-night entertainment.</p>

The author rejects being called a hero, instead bestowing that title upon the local Palestinian healthcare workers who risk their lives daily without the option to leave. The article details the immense suffering of children, such as a 10-year-old girl with perforated intestines and a four-month-old orphan with a broken leg, cared for amidst critical shortages of supplies. It is a powerful call for a ceasefire and an end to the blockade, framing the situation not as a war but a massacre.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. beef prices have climbed to record highs, with a pound of ground beef now averaging over $6. This article analyzes the complex factors driving the surge, which has been developing for years. A primary cause is the shrinking U.S. cattle herd, now at its smallest size since 1951 due to persistent drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling off cattle for short-term profit. The situation is exacerbated by a ban on cattle imports from Mexico due to a parasite outbreak and the potential long-term impact of tariffs on imported beef, suggesting consumers should not expect prices to drop soon.

          <p>Following a more than 8% drop in Abbott Laboratories' stock, CEO Robert Ford described the market's response as an "overreaction." The decline came after the company posted strong quarterly results but tightened its full-year earnings guidance. Ford attributed the guidance change to an unexpected slowdown in the company's diagnostics business specifically in China, while emphasizing that the segment saw growth in all other global markets. He expressed confidence in the company's other divisions, including strong double-digit growth in medical devices and a robust generic pharmaceutical business in emerging markets.

          <p>Minnesota Vikings receiver and former USC star Jordan Addison has avoided jail time after pleading no contest to a reduced charge of reckless driving. Addison was arrested in July 2024 after a highway patrol officer found him asleep behind the wheel of a Rolls-Royce that was blocking traffic. As part of the plea deal, his initial misdemeanor DUI charges were dismissed. He was sentenced to 12 months of probation, a fine, and must complete two online courses, allowing him to put the incident behind him and focus on his NFL career, though the matter remains under review by the league.</p>
