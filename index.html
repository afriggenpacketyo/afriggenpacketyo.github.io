          <p>Costco announced impressive fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, significantly surpassing Wall Street's projections. The warehouse club reported a net income of $2.61 billion and revenue of $86.16 billion, reflecting strong performance driven by a 6.4% rise in same-store sales and 13.5% growth in e-commerce. A key factor in this success is the company's ability to attract younger members, with nearly half of new sign-ups from individuals under 40, who are drawn to its value, varied merchandise, and online convenience. This strategic appeal across age groups, coupled with a recent membership fee increase and proactive measures to reduce tariff-related costs, reinforces Costco's strong market position and future outlook.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed music producer Jack Antonoff, a collaborator with Taylor Swift, publicly rejected Live Nation Entertainment CEO Michael Rapino's claim that concert tickets remain "underpriced." Antonoff argued that selling tickets above face value should be illegal, believing this would eliminate market chaos and empower artists to control pricing for their fans. His criticism comes amidst significant legal scrutiny for Live Nation, with the Federal Trade Commission recently suing the company and its subsidiary Ticketmaster over alleged "illegal" ticket resale tactics. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice is pursuing an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation, seeking to break up the company over its alleged monopolistic control of the live events industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order, paving the way for a deal that aims to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure. This action designates the agreement as a "qualified divestiture," meeting congressional mandates for ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations or face a ban. The arrangement involves Oracle providing comprehensive security by hosting American user data and reviewing TikTok's algorithm, which will be retrained to function exclusively with U.S. user information. This new U.S.-based joint venture, valued at approximately $14 billion, will feature a majority of American investors and board members, with ByteDance maintaining a stake below 20%.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order, formally approving a proposal designed to maintain TikTok's presence in the U.S., with Vice President JD Vance announcing the business's valuation at $14 billion. This agreement addresses national security concerns, requiring China-based ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations or face an effective ban, while retaining a minority stake below 20%. Key investors in the new TikTok U.S. entity are expected to include Oracle, Silver Lake, and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund, collectively holding approximately 45%. Oracle will also manage the app's security operations and cloud computing services. The deal's finalization still hinges on China's approval and necessary legal adjustments, as ByteDance has yet to publicly confirm the transaction.</p>

Speculation about their marital status arose after Grant was spotted with a ring at a movie premiere and a report claimed a private European wedding. Both Grant and a representative for Reeves have since confirmed that they are not married, although they remain "extremely happy" in their relationship, which they made public in 2019.</p>

However, JLR's production lines remain suspended until at least next month, creating substantial financial difficulties for its supply chain, particularly smaller businesses.

          <p>New car sales in the U.S. have experienced a surprising surge, prompting Cox Automotive to increase its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million vehicles, reflecting robust demand. This accelerated purchasing behavior is largely driven by consumers' concerns over impending higher prices due to tariffs and the expiration of federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits. An initial sales bump followed President Trump's tariff announcements, with a more recent rush to buy EVs occurring before a significant $7,500 federal credit ends this month. While this has benefited the industry, analysts predict a sales slowdown in the fourth quarter as these pricing pressures and expiring incentives fully manifest, with larger automakers currently expanding their market share.

CEO Bill Nash characterized the quarter as "challenging," attributing the lackluster performance to fluctuating market conditions, a sales pull-ahead driven by earlier tariff-related buying, and depreciation in its inventory fleet.

          <p>The Israeli military declared it conducted its "most powerful strike" in Yemen, targeting Houthi security and intelligence facilities in the capital Sanaa, which reportedly resulted in eight deaths and 142 injuries. This offensive was a direct response to a recent Houthi drone attack on the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat, which wounded 22 people. The Houthi-run health ministry denounced the Israeli actions as a "brutal crime," asserting that civilian facilities and residential buildings were impacted. The IDF, however, stated its targets included military command centers and weapons storage, pledging continued operations against persistent Houthi aggression. An investigation into the Eilat attack identified late drone detection and an unsuccessful Iron Dome interception, leading to immediate corrective measures.</p>

          <p>A day after a fatal shooting at the Dallas U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, numerous migrants appeared for their scheduled appointments, unaware of the closure and deeply concerned about potential deportation for non-attendance. Despite federal officials confirming the previous day's incident was a targeted attack, many individuals, including a Colombian immigrant identified only as A., traveled significant distances, driven by fears that missing their check-ins could jeopardize their pending immigration cases. Reports indicated delayed communication from ICE regarding the facility's closure, exacerbating confusion and anxiety among those affected. Dallas Police officers, some providing assistance in Spanish, struggled to manage the volume of questions from the fearful and uncertain migrants.</p>

          <p>A widespread manhunt has been initiated in Oregon for Ty Anthony Sage, a 26-year-old murder suspect who was mistakenly released from prison on bail, an error that the Multnomah County Sheriff deemed "unacceptable." Sage, facing charges of second-degree murder and first-degree robbery in connection with the death of 15-year-old Lowgunn Ivey, had previously been denied bail, but an initial release order erroneously indicated a $5,000 bail amount. Officials are conducting a thorough review of the incident, accepting ultimate responsibility and pledging to restore community trust. The victim's mother expressed profound fear and anxiety, though authorities currently believe Sage's release is an isolated incident and does not pose an immediate risk to the community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate reduction, a $40,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) now offers more favorable monthly payments for homeowners. With current average rates at 7.88%, a 10-year HELOC would entail payments of $482.78 per month, while a 15-year option would cost $379.49, marking a notable decrease from earlier in the year. The inherent variable interest rate of HELOCs means that additional anticipated Fed rate cuts in October and December could further reduce these payments without the need for refinancing. Furthermore, borrowers benefit from the flexibility to make interest-only payments during the initial draw period, making a HELOC a potentially more accessible and manageable financing option in the current economic environment.

          <p>The impending Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black is set to test Europe's ability to secure an away victory for the first time since 2012, with an analysis pinpointing critical factors for the outcome. A decisive early performance in Friday's foursomes is considered paramount, as historical data shows overall victors consistently trouncing opponents in these initial sessions. Europe must also effectively manage the famously boisterous New York crowds, a challenge their captain Luke Donald has prepared for by providing players with virtual reality headsets to simulate crowd noise. Europe boasts a significant experience advantage with seasoned players like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose, while the U.S. team relies heavily on world number one Scottie Scheffler. The anticipated presence of President Trump further heightens the potential for an intensely electric atmosphere.</p>

This significant modernization initiative, spurred by a Trump executive order, is designed to enhance efficiency, bolster security, and reduce administrative costs, given that paper checks are substantially more prone to loss or theft. While the SSA asserts this change will ensure prompt benefit delivery, advocates for seniors and Senator Elizabeth Warren have voiced concerns for "unbanked" individuals who lack traditional bank accounts and depend on paper checks. The agency has confirmed that exceptions will be made for those genuinely unable to receive electronic payments, though detailed criteria for these exceptions remain somewhat unclear.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the enduring legacy of Allen Ginsberg, portraying him as a quintessential "poet-buffoon" on an American scale—a figure embodying "swashbuckling vulnerability" and a champion for the dispossessed. It delves into his historical presence within The Atlantic's archives, referencing his influential pro-cannabis essay "The Great Marijuana Hoax" and accounts of the Beat Generation, as well as his impact on nascent anti-establishment literary movements. The piece thoughtfully contrasts his revolutionary work, such as the powerful "Howl," with the more understated poetry of his father, Louis Ginsberg, underscoring the deep mutual respect between them despite their divergent artistic paths. This article vividly illustrates Ginsberg's unique, often tumultuous, yet profoundly influential contributions to American literary history.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon is currently evaluating President Trump's recent proposal for public companies to transition from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a concept Trump introduced via Truth Social. Solomon acknowledged that he had not deeply considered the issue until recently, noting the inherent trade-offs: arguments for the change suggest it could foster a longer-term focus on business investment, while counterarguments highlight a potential reduction in transparency for investors. Current regulations require publicly traded companies to report quarterly, though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has the authority to alter this. While JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been a vocal critic of quarterly reporting, Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster believes shareholders will continue to demand consistent communication.

          <p>President Trump has notably shifted his rhetoric regarding Russia's war against Ukraine, asserting on Truth Social that Ukraine possesses the capability to "take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that!" This change, occurring after his meetings with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and other international leaders at the UN General Assembly, was met with cautious optimism by Zelenskyy, who interpreted it as a positive signal for sustained U.S. support. However, Ukrainian politicians exhibit a range of reactions, with some parliamentarians warning against excessive optimism, viewing Trump's remarks as a potential desire to disengage from the conflict rather than an offer of direct, substantial aid. Analysts suggest this rhetorical shift might be influenced by Trump's perceived realization of President Putin's detrimental impact.</p>
