          <p>The 2025 Kentucky Derby is set to feature 19 horses, with Journalism entering as the morning-line favorite, boasting a strong record in graded-stakes races. Trainer Michael McCarthy hopes Journalism's performance can bring some joy to the Altadena community, which was affected by wildfires. Sovereignty and Sandman are also considered strong contenders. Last year's Derby saw Mystik Dan win in a photo finish, and jockey Brian Hernandez Jr., who won both the Derby and Oaks in 2024, will be riding Burnham Square this year.</p>

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the coasts of Chile and Argentina, prompting a tsunami warning that was later canceled after no tsunami was detected. Chilean authorities issued an evacuation alert for the Strait of Magellan as a precaution, with residents calmly evacuating. The earthquake's epicenter was located in the Drake Passage, south of Ushuaia, Argentina, where water activities were temporarily suspended.

          <p>Australians are participating in a national election, with the rising cost of living and economic uncertainty as major concerns for voters. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor party is slightly ahead of the Liberal-National coalition led by Peter Dutton in opinion polls. Dutton's campaign has been compared to Donald Trump's messaging, which may have contributed to a decline in support. Albanese has maintained a moderate stance towards Trump, and the election results could lead to a minority government.</p>

Governor Janet Mills challenged the administration's demands that trans girls be barred from participating in girls' sports. Maine sued the USDA to maintain its funding, which helps feed 172,000 children in the state. The settlement restores the funds, though a separate lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the Maine Department of Education over its policy for trans athletes remains ongoing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the order sent a message that lawyers must stick to the party line, violating the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained Christopher Steele. The executive order called for the suspension of security clearances and limited access to federal buildings for firm employees.</p>

The shipwreck, Emanuel Point II, sank in Florida's Pensacola Bay in 1559, and the remains of an adult and juvenile cat were found within the wreckage. Researchers believe cats accompanied sailors on ships to control rat and mice populations. Analysis suggests the cats ate a diet of fish and possibly domestic meat, indicating they were likely cared for by the sailors.</p>

          <p>President Trump's family's net worth has reportedly increased by $2.9 billion due to investments in crypto products, as his administration loosens regulations on the industry.

An Abu Dhabi-backed firm is investing billions in a stablecoin product offered by World Liberty, raising potential conflict of interest concerns. The Securities and Exchange Commission has paused investigations into crypto companies since Trump's inauguration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased shipping products directly from China to U.S. customers, now shipping all U.S. orders from local warehouses. This change follows the Trump administration's closure of a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import fees. The company had previously announced it would adjust prices after the tariff changes. The company stated that pricing for U.S. consumers will remain unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model.</p>

A proposal from Chinese officials involves special envoys appointed by Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, but the U.S. prefers direct negotiation between Trump and Xi. The dispute over China's role in fentanyl production is also hindering bilateral trust. Experts believe Beijing may use fentanyl cooperation as leverage in future trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order to end government funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), but the CPB asserts that the president lacks the authority to do so. The CPB, PBS, and NPR are all vowing to fight the order. Experts suggest that the White House may face legal challenges, with potential arguments over viewpoint discrimination. The CPB provides funding to local public radio and TV stations, particularly in rural communities.</p>

          <p>Germany's Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party has been designated as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution. The intelligence agency stated that the AfD's ethnicity-based understanding of the people is incompatible with the democratic order. The decision has drawn criticism from some US politicians. The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record number of seats.</p>
