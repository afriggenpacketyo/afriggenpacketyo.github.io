          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as winds of 60-70 mph swept across dry farmlands, causing near-zero visibility and prompting ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. The National Weather Service confirmed this was only the second dust storm warning in its history that included the city itself, with the first being in May 2023. Showers coinciding with the dust storm resulted in reports of "mud rain." Some schools closed due to power outages from previous severe weather. The article concludes by forecasting cooler, dry weather for the weekend, followed by a return to rainy conditions next week.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg discusses the Democratic Party's response to concerns about Joe Biden's age and fitness for office, particularly in light of a new book, "Original Sin," detailing his decline. She argues that Democrats engaged in a form of self-deception, prioritizing incumbency and party unity over acknowledging Biden's obvious infirmities. The article suggests that the party needs to confront its tendency toward groupthink and risk aversion, and that a reckoning is due for the missteps that paved the way for Trump's return.

          <p>Moodyâ€™s has downgraded the credit rating of the United States, citing rising debt levels and political gridlock, joining Fitch and Standard & Poorâ€™s in stripping the U.S. of its highest rating. The downgrade reflects concerns about the failure of successive administrations to address the growing national debt and the rising costs of programs like Social Security and Medicare. Republicans are struggling to agree on a package that extends tax cuts adopted under Mr. Trump in 2017.

          <p>Moody's has downgraded the US credit rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', citing concerns over the government's ability to repay its debt due to ballooning deficits and interest costs. This decision means the US has lost its last perfect credit rating. The White House responded by blaming the previous administration. While the US retains strengths like its large economy and the dollar's role as a global reserve currency, Moody's expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of GDP by 2035. A lower credit rating generally leads to higher borrowing costs for the country.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders' ability to sue the company if investors believe the company's board or executives committed any breach of fiduciary duties. The new bylaw requires a shareholder or group of shareholders to hold at least 3% of Tesla's outstanding shares to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding, a stake worth over $30 billion. This change takes advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits. The move follows Tesla's relocation of its incorporation to Texas after a court ruling against Elon Musk in Delaware.</p>
