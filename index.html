          <p>Following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the UK Prime Minister cautioned about the "risk of escalation" in the Middle East and beyond, emphasizing the need for diplomatic solutions and stability in the region. The PM stated that the UK was not involved in the US action but was informed in advance, and that the government is taking necessary measures to protect UK interests. The US Defense Secretary claimed the strikes "devastated the Iranian nuclear programme," while Iran condemned the action as "outrageous". The UK has been moving assets to the region to protect its interests and those of its allies, with British military personnel on high alert. The article details the international reactions and the potential consequences of the strikes. Optimism for de-escalation is tempered by the potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>Gulf markets ended mostly higher after the United States struck three key Iranian nuclear sites, with Tel Aviv stocks reaching an all-time high on hopes that Washington's intervention would help resolve the conflict. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly down, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Bahrain issued a "work from home mandate" to ensure public safety. An expert noted that the Gulf states have distanced themselves from the conflict, supporting a peaceful resolution and condemning Israeli aggression, which has helped isolate them from significant market impact. The market might be pricing in the removal of the Iranian threat, which international investors may view positively (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran is debating how to respond, with options ranging from immediate retaliation to delayed action or negotiation. The internal discussions are occurring amidst heightened security concerns and fears of further Israeli strikes.

A delayed response would allow Iran to launch a surprise attack when US forces are less prepared. The article explores the potential consequences of each course of action, emphasizing the survival of the Islamic Republic regime as the primary consideration.

          <p>The US attack on Iran's nuclear sites utilized decoy bombers and "misdirection" to maintain secrecy, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine explained that decoy B-2 stealth bombers were deployed to draw attention away from the actual mission. The bombers used in the attack flew under the cover of darkness, refueling multiple times in flight, in what became the longest flight involving the fleet since 2001. The mission involved precision, operational security, and the deployment of bunker-buster bombs. The article notes that Iran did not deploy fighters or surface-to-air missiles during the mission, indicating they were caught off guard.</p>

The article suggests alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while setting boundaries, such as explaining decisions instead of saying "Because I said so," and offering agency instead of making threats. Dismissing a child's emotions or assuming intentional difficulty can also be counterproductive. The key is to create an environment where cooperation feels natural by respecting the child's feelings, providing emotional safety, and involving them in the process.

          <p>Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, stated that it is too early to assess the impact of US strikes on Iran's nuclear program. Himes described the strikes as a "massive gamble" by President Donald Trump and noted the need for further assessment. He expressed concern that the strikes were undertaken without congressional approval, which he believes is a constitutional requirement. Himes also highlighted the history of US military involvements in the region, noting that they often do not end with the best-case scenario.

          <p>The US is experiencing a surge in politically motivated violence, marked by multiple incidents including attacks on Democratic legislators, violence during "No Kings" demonstrations, and threats against lawmakers. Experts attribute this trend to a period of high social change and increasing polarization. Research indicates rising support among Americans for the use of force to achieve political means. The article draws parallels to the political violence of the 1960s and 1970s. Some argue that Republican political leaders bear more culpability for the violent climate due to their rhetoric. The situation calls for American political leaders to condemn political violence in a bipartisan manner.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Florida are accused of racially gerrymandering two state senate districts to disenfranchise Black voters and skew results in the Tampa Bay area. The ACLU argues that the redistricting process packs about half of the region's Black population into a single district, diluting their voting power. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the 2022 redistricting process, arguing that it violates the 14th amendment. A decision in favor of the plaintiffs would require a redrawing of Floridaâ€™s 16th and 18th senate districts. The case highlights ongoing concerns about racial gerrymandering and its impact on minority representation.</p>
