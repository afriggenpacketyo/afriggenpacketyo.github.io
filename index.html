          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares jump over 10% after it reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a stabilization in travel bookings. While the airline had previously cut its outlook due to lower-than-expected demand, its third-quarter earnings and revenue projections have now surpassed Wall Street expectations. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while corporate travel has leveled off, travelers are still booking flights, albeit closer to their travel dates. The airline's growth was bolstered by strong sales of premium seats and its partnership with American Express. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large, orange-hued full moon, known as the 'buck moon,' will be visible over the United Kingdom, with peak viewing on Thursday evening. The moon's low position in the sky, a result of a major lunar standstill that occurs every 18.6 years, will cause it to appear larger and take on an orange color due to sunlight passing through Earth's atmosphere. The name 'buck moon' originates from Native American traditions, referring to the time of year when new antlers grow on buck deer. The phenomenon will be visible in the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, effective August 1, is raising concerns among economists about potential price hikes for a wide range of products. Copper is a crucial component in electrical wiring, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles, meaning the tariff could fuel inflation and increase costs for consumers and industries alike. While the administration argues the tariff will bolster domestic production and national security, experts warn it could also raise expenses for maintaining the nation's electric grid. The U.S. currently imports a majority of its copper from key partners like Chile and Canada. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent back-to-back floods in New Mexico and Texas have demonstrated vastly different outcomes, highlighting the critical role of community preparedness. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where three people died, the town was largely prepared for the flooding due to awareness of risks from previous wildfire 'burn scars,' allowing for a swift return to normalcy. Conversely, a more severe and unexpected flood in Texas resulted in at least 120 fatalities, catching officials by surprise. Experts note that a community's recent experience with a disaster significantly informs its response and willingness to heed warnings, shaping the human toll of such events.</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) significantly underestimated the flood risk for a Texas camp where over two dozen campers died, with private data showing more structures were in extreme hazard zones than federal maps suggested. Experts argue FEMA's reliance on historical river data, rather than modern rainfall modeling, creates a dangerous gap in assessing risk from increasingly common heavy rain events. In separate health news, the CDC reports that U.S. measles cases have hit a 33-year high, with 1,288 cases this year, driven by falling vaccination rates among kindergarteners.</p>

          <p>Legal scholars are expressing alarm over what they describe as a claim to 'dispensing power' by the Trump administration, a royal prerogative abolished in 17th-century England. The concern stems from letters sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to tech companies, instructing them to ignore a law banning TikTok by arguing the president can exempt entities from laws that interfere with foreign policy. Critics argue this assertion goes far beyond normal presidential discretion and represents a dangerous, unconstitutional power grab that would allow the president to proactively grant immunity from legal consequences, effectively placing friends of the administration above the law.</p>

          <p>UK regulator Ofcom has approved Royal Mail's plan to cease Saturday deliveries for second-class letters as part of a cost-cutting reform. Under the new system, second-class mail will be delivered on alternating weekdays, while first-class letters will continue to be delivered six days a week. The change, which Royal Mail estimates could save up to £425 million annually, comes as the volume of letters sent has plummeted over the years. While the company welcomed the decision, consumer and business groups criticized the move, fearing it will reduce service reliability and increase reliance on more expensive first-class mail.</p>

          <p>South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial victory in her legal battle against World Athletics' sex eligibility rules. The European Court of Human Rights' Grand Chamber ruled that the Swiss Federal Supreme Court violated her right to a fair hearing when it upheld regulations requiring her to reduce her natural testosterone levels to compete. Semenya, who has differences of sexual development (DSD), has been barred from her signature 800m event since 2019. While the ruling does not immediately overturn the athletic regulations, it keeps her legal challenge alive and could send the case back to the Swiss court.</p>

          <p>The devastating flash floods in Texas, which caused an estimated $18-22 billion in damages, are highlighting a critical gap in homeowner preparedness, as standard insurance policies typically exclude floods. In the hard-hit Kerr County, only about 2.5% of homeowners had separate flood coverage. Experts stress that flooding is a nationwide risk, with 99% of U.S. counties having experienced a flood event in the past two decades. They advise homeowners, even those not in designated high-risk coastal areas, to consider purchasing flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or private insurers to protect against catastrophic financial loss.</p>

          <p>A Republican spending bill has allocated an additional $75 billion to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over four years, a move that critics fear will enable a massive expansion of immigration detention and deportation.

The attack, which occurred in the Antioquia department, has been attributed to the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group. The government had suspended peace talks with the ELN in January following deadly raids, and the group has since intensified its attacks on security forces. The governor of Antioquia condemned the attack, stating the rebels used an 'equine loaded with explosives' and sent it toward a platoon of soldiers.</p>

Clinics funded by the now-defunct USAID have closed, forcing thousands of patients to navigate the public hospital system, which can be stigmatizing and time-consuming. A new UN report warns that such funding cuts risk reversing decades of progress against HIV/AIDS, which had seen new infections and deaths fall to their lowest levels in 30 years.

          <p>Following its use in New York City's mayoral primary, this article explores how ranked-choice voting (RCV) could reshape California's political dynamics. Unlike New York's partisan primaries, California's top-two 'jungle primary' system could interact with RCV in unique ways, potentially eliminating the need for primary elections in many local races and saving taxpayer money. Proponents argue RCV fosters less negative campaigning and could give underrepresented parties a better chance in competitive races. However, the potential for strategic crossover voting could lead to more centrist outcomes or, conversely, push candidates toward more extreme positions to capture second-choice votes.</p>

          <p>A controversial redistricting plan in Texas's Tarrant County is being viewed by experts as a blueprint for Republican efforts to secure political advantages ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The newly approved map, which critics have labeled 'racial gerrymandering,' shifts people of color to consolidate partisan power, a move the county judge openly admitted was to elect another Republican. This local effort comes as the Trump administration signals a desire for more redrawn maps in the state. Experts suggest this is a strategy to offset potential GOP losses in other states and to counter Texas's shifting demographics in an increasingly polarized political climate.</p>

          <p>Six months after the historic Eaton and Palisades firestorms, Los Angeles County is facing a long and painful recovery from a disaster that caused 30 deaths and destroyed thousands of homes. While the massive debris cleanup is reportedly ahead of schedule, with over 9,000 parcels cleared, thousands of victims are still navigating insurance battles, financial hardship, and the emotional toll of the loss.

Meanwhile, numerous lawsuits have been filed against utilities and insurance companies.</p>
