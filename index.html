        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has declared an immediate halt to all U.S. trade negotiations with Canada. This decision stems from an advertisement aired by the Ontario government, which featured former President Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. The Reagan Presidential Foundation had earlier criticized the ad for misrepresenting Reagan's statements and using his image without authorization. Trump asserted that Canada's actions were fraudulent and intended to influence upcoming Supreme Court arguments regarding his tariff authority. He emphasized the critical importance of tariffs for U.S. national security and economic interests, framing the termination as a direct response to what he termed "egregious behavior."</p>

          <p>Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested and charged in a federal sports betting and money laundering case. Prosecutors allege Rozier and others used nonpublic information about NBA players' injuries to gain an unfair advantage in placing illegal wagers. U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella described the case as part of a "wide-sweeping criminal enterprise" blurring lines between the NBA and organized crime. Rozier's attorney criticized the arrest's handling, claiming his client had cooperated and was previously deemed a "subject, not a target." The NBA has placed Rozier on immediate leave, emphasizing the league's commitment to game integrity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alaska Airlines experienced a nationwide ground stop on Thursday, leading to numerous flight cancellations across the country. The disruption was attributed to an IT outage affecting several key operational systems, later identified as a failure in its primary data center. The airline clarified that the incident was not a cyberattack. This event, which also impacted flights for its regional carrier Horizon Air, is the second IT outage for Alaska Airlines this year, following a similar three-hour halt in July. The airline apologized for the significant travel disruptions, assuring the public that the safety of its flights remained uncompromised.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is contemplating new export controls on software-related products to China, a move that comes in response to Beijing's rare-earth export restrictions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that "everything is on the table," indicating potential coordination with G-7 allies. This development precedes critical talks between Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, setting the stage for a possible meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping. The escalating tit-for-tat trade measures highlight deep mistrust and the ongoing "breakdown of trade truces" between the two global powers, with reciprocal tariffs looming if no agreement is reached.

          <p>Mark Killick, one of Britain's most prolific "cowboy builders," has continued to defraud customers, amassing 37 victims and over £1.25 million in his latest conviction, despite a criminal record dating back to 1995. Killick exploited legal loopholes, including changing his name twice after prison releases, to evade detection. His victims, often swayed by fake online reviews and slick websites, were unaware of his past fraud convictions and bankruptcy restriction orders. This article highlights systemic failures in regulation, with calls for tighter rules on convicted fraudsters and mandatory licensing for builders to protect homeowners and restore public confidence in the construction industry.</p>

          <p>Indian exporters, particularly in labor-intensive sectors like textiles and gems and jewelry, are struggling under punishing 50% U.S. tariffs, casting a shadow over Diwali celebrations. The U.S. is India's largest export destination, and these tariffs have jeopardized billions in revenue and millions of jobs. Manufacturers, holding unsold inventory and facing raw material costs, are contemplating production cuts. While some sectors like diamonds have a slight edge due to India's processing role, the overall export growth has significantly slowed. A potential deal to reduce tariffs to 15-16% offers a lifeline, but without it, the prospects for Indian exporters remain dim. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anthony Boyd was executed in Alabama using the controversial nitrogen gas method, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court denied his request for a stay, prompting a scathing dissent from three liberal justices. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, argued the method constitutes "cruel and unusual punishment," citing "mounting and unbroken evidence" from previous executions where inmates showed prolonged distress. Boyd, who maintained his innocence for the 1995 murder, was seen writhing and shaking during the procedure, fueling ongoing debate about the constitutionality and humanity of nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method.

          <p>The White House East Wing has been demolished, with new images confirming its rapid destruction, surprising many after President Trump previously stated the structure would remain untouched. The White House Press Secretary asserted that presidential approval is only needed for "vertical construction," citing a National Capital Planning Commission legal opinion, despite the commission's operations being affected by a government shutdown. President Trump pledged "millions of dollars" of his own money to the privately funded ballroom project, which he estimates will cost around $300 million.
