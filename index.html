          <p>A 64-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly firing multiple shots into the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento, causing property damage but no injuries. The incident, classified as a drive-by shooting, prompted the suspect's initial arrest and release on bail before the FBI took him back into federal custody on a separate charge. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, and the event has drawn condemnation from public officials, including California's governor, as an attack on democracy and journalism.</p>

          <p>Following the murder of conservative organizer Charlie Kirk, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has urged Americans to universally condemn political violence, stating the nation is at an "inflection point." In a television interview, Shapiro referenced his own experience with a firebombing at the governor's mansion to highlight the lasting damage such acts cause. He emphasized the need to find common ground and heal divisions, while also carefully distinguishing between legally protected, though sometimes offensive, political speech and illicit incitement to violence.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary catches that were pivotal in his team's 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young prevented a near-certain hit by juggling the ball with his foot before securing it for an out. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping catch at the wall to rob the Mets of a potential game-tying home run. The loss was a significant setback for the Mets, dropping them into a tie for the final National League wildcard spot.</p>

The National Hurricane Center forecasts the storm's center will pass east of Bermuda on Monday, without any watches or warnings currently in effect for land. However, swells generated by the hurricane are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward into Atlantic Canada early this week, urging caution for coastal areas.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has indicated he would accept an interim deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described such a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the stalled long-term goal of complete denuclearization, noting that Pyongyang is producing numerous new weapons annually. He expressed hope that the mutual trust between Trump and Kim could be leveraged to resume negotiations and reduce regional tensions.</p>

          <h2>Trump Downplays New Pentagon Restrictions on Journalists' Access</h2>

          <p>President Trump appeared to dismiss concerns about a new Pentagon directive that severely curtails journalists' ability to report on U.S. military matters. The memo requires reporters to pledge not to gather any information, even unclassified material, not officially authorized for release. When asked about the policy, Trump stated he doesn't believe the Pentagon should control what reporters cover and commented that "nothing stops reporters." The new rules have been heavily criticized by press freedom advocates as a form of prior restraint and an assault on independent journalism.</p>

          <p>London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, initiated a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a major section of Oxford Street, one of the world's busiest shopping districts. The event, called "This is Oxford Street," is part of a broader plan to permanently pedestrianize the area between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the visitor experience. While many pedestrians welcomed the car-free environment, the proposal has raised concerns from some local groups about accessibility for people with mobility issues and potential traffic congestion on smaller side streets.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Los Angeles County are searching for a 27-year-old man who allegedly broke into his former roommate's West Hollywood apartment and beat their small dog to death. The incident was captured on an indoor surveillance camera, which shows a masked man entering the residence and attacking the animal. Investigators have identified Anmol Bhatia, who had recently been kicked out of the apartment, as the person of interest in the case. He is also suspected of stealing items from the home during the break-in.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be part of the investment group involved in the deal to manage TikTok's U.S. operations. In a television interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as participants in the arrangement designed to address national security concerns over the app's Chinese ownership. The White House has stated that the new structure would place Americans on a majority of the company's board and give the U.S. control over its algorithm and data.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has labeled recent public criticism from U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner as "unacceptable" for a diplomat. Kushner had published a letter accusing Macron's government of insufficient action against antisemitism and linking its foreign policy to violence against Jews in France. In an interview, Macron called the statement a mistake, asserting that a French ambassador would never be permitted to make similar remarks and that such actions are not a proper use of taxpayer money. The French foreign ministry had previously summoned Kushner in a formal rebuke.</p>

          <p>Podcaster Joe Rogan recently misinterpreted a climate study on his show, claiming it showed Earth is in a cooling period, but a meteorologist has publicly corrected the misinformation. Expert Chris Gloninger clarified that while Earth should be in a long-term natural cooling cycle, human activity has reversed this trend, causing unprecedented warming over the last 150 years. He explained that the rapid temperature increase is directly tied to carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, a rate of change far steeper than any natural cycle can account for.</p>

          <p>Travelers at several major European airports, including London Heathrow and Brussels, are experiencing a second day of disruptions after a cyber-attack targeted a widely used check-in and baggage software system. The attack on the Muse software, owned by Collins Aerospace, forced airlines to revert to manual, paper-based boarding processes, causing significant delays. Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their Monday flights as there is no clear timeline for when a secure, functional version of the system will be restored.</p>

          <p>The Great Britain and Northern Ireland team concluded the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo with its worst medal performance in nearly two decades, failing to secure a single gold medal for the first time since 2003. The team finished with a total of five medals—two silver and three bronze—matching their 2019 tally but falling short of expectations set by stronger past performances. The disappointing result was compounded by injuries to key athletes and the failure of any of the highly-regarded relay teams to reach the podium.</p>
