          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has vehemently denounced recent US airstrikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean as an "act of tyranny," demanding criminal proceedings against US officials if any Colombians were killed. Speaking to the BBC, Petro questioned the disproportionate use of force, suggesting that such actions in international waters, primarily targeting Venezuela, are tantamount to murder. The Trump administration, which has recently intensified its stance on Latin American trade and immigration, maintains these strikes are vital to halt the influx of illegal narcotics into the US. This position has ignited controversy among Democratic lawmakers and United Nations experts, who describe the actions as extrajudicial executions and a potential breach of international human rights law, further straining US-Colombia relations.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed performance, influenced by a second consecutive day of tech stock sell-offs on Wall Street, notably impacting companies like Nvidia due to heightened skepticism about the AI industry's circular nature. While Japan's Nikkei 225 remained near the flatline and the Topix gained, South Korea's Kospi declined, although its defense sector saw increases. Investors across the region are closely monitoring upcoming U.S. weekly jobless claims data, which is expected to inform the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions amidst growing concerns about a weakening labor market and rising layoffs, further impacting market sentiment.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally mandate states to cooperate with immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy aimed at penalizing "sanctuary" cities and states. The judge sided with 20 plaintiff states, asserting that the policy was "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," and warned of irreparable harm due to the potential loss of critical emergency and disaster funds. This ruling underscores the ongoing legal and political battle over federal authority in immigration enforcement and its implications for state autonomy and public safety.</p>

          <h2>Former Deputy Receives One-Year Sentence for On-Duty Killing of Girlfriend's Ex-Partner</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 20:01:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former Riverside County sheriff's deputy, Oscar Rodriguez, was sentenced to one year in prison for voluntary manslaughter after killing his girlfriend's former partner, Luis Morin, while on duty. Initially, authorities deemed the shooting justified, but a civil lawsuit exposed Rodriguez's romantic involvement with Morin's ex-partner. Prosecutors, who had sought a 10-year sentence, vehemently objected to the court's decision, arguing it significantly minimizes the gravity of Rodriguez’s actions and the devastating impact on Morin’s family. This controversial sentence has sparked criticism regarding accountability within law enforcement and the justice system's handling of cases involving abuses of power.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility resulted in one detainee killed and two others critically injured, with the gunman, Joshua Jahn, dying from a self-inflicted wound. FBI officials discovered ammunition engraved with "anti-ICE" messages near the suspect, prompting an investigation into the incident as a targeted attack driven by ideological motives. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem strongly condemned the violence, attributing it to harmful anti-ICE rhetoric and calling for a national reckoning on the issue.

          <p>Parents of Mason Connor, a child diagnosed with autism, report that he began speaking just three days after starting leucovorin, an inexpensive generic drug primarily used to ease chemotherapy side effects. Pediatric neurologist Dr. Richard Frye is researching leucovorin's potential to bypass a folic acid transport blockage in the brain, a mechanism that may contribute to some autism symptoms and improve speech. Despite the absence of large-scale phase 3 clinical trials, the FDA has initiated the approval process for leucovorin as an autism treatment.

Rodgers' call for realism reflects a period of scant summer transfer activity and the departure of key players, leading to fan protests and a perception of a weaker squad.

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed he was the victim of a "triple sabotage" during his appearance at the United Nations, alleging that an escalator, a teleprompter, and a microphone all malfunctioned for him. Trump described the escalator stopping abruptly, nearly causing him and Melania to fall, and demanded an investigation into the incident, citing a British newspaper report about UN employees joking about turning off an escalator. He also noted his teleprompter failed during the initial portion of his speech and that the sound was completely off in the auditorium, preventing world leaders from hearing him. This article highlights Trump's firm belief that these incidents were a deliberate conspiracy, leading him to demand an immediate investigation from the UN Secretary-General.</p>

          <p>Actress Jessica Chastain has publicly stated she is "not aligned" with AppleTV+'s decision to postpone the release of her upcoming streaming series, "The Savant." The drama, which Chastain also executive produced, centers on an elite investigator who tracks online hate groups to prevent violent attacks and features extremist imagery. AppleTV+ cited "careful consideration" for the delay, which occurred in the wake of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Chastain argued that the show's themes are critically relevant to current events, including numerous US violent incidents, and that honoring the heroes who work to prevent violence is more urgent than ever.</p>

He cited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent commentary, which indicated that stocks are overvalued and concerns about a weakening labor market are outweighing stubborn inflation. Cramer also noted a surge in viewer questions about risky investments, leading him to "rein it in" after previously endorsing many speculative names. He encouraged investors to assess their individual risk tolerance, mentioning sectors like nuclear energy, "crypto derivatives," and quantum stocks as potentially overheated.

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald declared his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," in what appeared to be a subtle criticism directed at American rivals who are receiving $500,000 stipends. Donald emphasized that for Europe, the biennial tournament is fundamentally about "pride, representing your flag, your shirt and the legacy you leave behind," contrasting this with the American team's unprecedented player payments. While some American players, including Collin Morikawa, dismissed the idea that payment affects their desire to win, the move has drawn negative attention from critics who argue it undermines the Ryder Cup's traditional ethos and the spirit of the game.</p>
