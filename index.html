          <p>The UK House of Commons passed a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives. The bill, which will now be reviewed by the House of Lords, stipulates that adults over 18 with less than six months to live could receive assistance in ending their lives after undergoing a series of checks. Supporters argue it offers a compassionate choice, while opponents express concerns about potential manipulation of vulnerable individuals. The vote marks a major step in social policy, potentially comparable to the legalization of abortion in 1967.</p>

          <p>Many Iranians are crossing the border into Armenia to escape the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. The conflict, which began on June 13, has led to attacks on nuclear and military sites, resulting in numerous casualties. Many of those leaving Iran have residency or citizenship in other countries, and they describe a climate of fear and instability. Some Israeli ministers have suggested the conflict could lead to regime collapse in Iran, while others believe this is unlikely.</p>

          <p>A court case against England goalkeeper Khiara Keating has been dropped nearly a year after she pleaded not guilty to possessing canisters of nitrous oxide. The 20-year-old Manchester City goalkeeper was charged with possession of a Class C drug on 18 June last year after an investigation by Greater Manchester Police. Greater Manchester Police has confirmed the case has been discontinued. Keating has not made an appearance for England's senior team yet but is part of the 23-player squad selected to compete at Euro 2025 next month.</p>

          <h2>Labour to Shift Council Funding Towards Poorer Areas</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Labour plans to redistribute council funding towards more deprived areas in England, updating formulas that affect billions of pounds in allocations. The new system aims to address the higher demand for council services and weaker council tax bases in poorer areas. While ministers argue the changes will benefit communities in need, rural councils have raised concerns about potential losses. The Institute for Fiscal Studies anticipates a significant redistribution towards deprived areas, particularly in urban parts of the North and Midlands. (not investment advice)</p>
