          <p>Iran launched missiles toward Israel in response to continued Israeli airstrikes, which have reportedly hit over 200 targets. Iran's state news agency announced the commencement of a "Hard Retaliation operation," while the IDF stated that Israeli defense systems are intercepting the missiles and instructed the public to seek shelter. This escalation follows Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in Isfahan and Natanz, aimed at degrading Iran's long-range missile capabilities, according to an Israeli Army Spokesperson. The attacks have led to the suspension of nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States, which were scheduled to take place in Oman. The situation remains tense as both countries brace for further developments.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant jump after Israel launched airstrikes against Iran, raising investor concerns about potential disruptions to Middle East oil supplies.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation targeted Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program, including the main enrichment site at Natanz and senior military members, and would continue until the threat is removed. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio clarified that the U.S. was not involved in the strikes and warned Iran against targeting American interests in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC has confirmed that it will not appeal Gerry Adams' libel case victory, where the former Sinn FÃ©in leader sued the corporation over a 2016 BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight story regarding the murder of British agent Denis Donaldson. Last month, a jury found that Adams was defamed by an anonymous contributor's allegation that he sanctioned the 2006 killing, awarding him â‚¬100,000 in damages. The combined legal costs for both parties are estimated to be between â‚¬3-5 million, marking a significant financial impact for the BBC.</p>

The plane, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, crashed shortly after takeoff, killing 242 people on board and several on the ground.

The ad encourages participation in protests coinciding with a military parade celebrating the Army's 250th Anniversary.

          <p>Following Israeli attacks on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and military leaders, questions arise regarding the Iranian government's competence in protecting its citizens. The attacks, which reached multiple locations in Tehran, resulted in civilian casualties and prompted condemnation from Iranians. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's belligerent actions and rhetoric are contrasted with the regime's inability to safeguard its own people. The attacks have also impacted the succession to Khamenei and weakened Iran's Axis of Resistance, potentially leading to leadership changes or a shift in Iran's foreign policy.</p>

Zheng's powerful groundstrokes and serve proved challenging for Raducanu, who struggled with back spasms and had to take a medical timeout. While Raducanu displayed moments of strong serving and returning, Zheng ultimately won the match by upping her intensity and attacking Raducanu's serve. Despite the loss, Raducanu can remain confident in her ability to perform well on grass, but will need to bridge the gap to challenge the top players.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military installations reflect a shift in strategy influenced by the October 7 attacks. Successful campaigns against Hezbollah's leadership neutralized offensive capabilities, reducing wariness about launching similar actions against Iran. Diminished fear of diplomatic blowback, coupled with President Trump's foreign policy approach, created an environment where Israel had more leeway to act alone. Netanyahu's political situation, including criminal indictments and unpopularity, may have also influenced the timing of the strikes, potentially aimed at salvaging his poll numbers.</p>

Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood's partnership gave Australia an advantage, but Markram's stellar performance shifted the momentum. Markram shared an unbroken 143-run partnership with Temba Bavuma, who played through a hamstring injury. South Africa requires 69 more runs to secure the win and end their wait for a major men's final victory, unless Australia's bowlers can produce a remarkable performance.</p>

          <p>India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has begun investigating the Air India crash, one of the country's worst aviation accidents in decades, with assistance from U.S. and British investigators. The plane's flight data recorder was recovered from the crash site, and DNA testing is underway to identify victims. The crash occurred shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing 242 passengers and crew, with only one survivor, Vishwaskumar Ramesh. India's aviation watchdog has ordered Air India to undertake extra safety checks on its Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 planes as a preventative measure.</p>

          <p>The WNBA and E.W. Scripps have announced a new multiyear media rights agreement to carry Friday night WNBA matchups on Ion, including the "WNBA on Ion" studio show. The agreement comes after Ion has seen huge growth with the WNBA, as viewership grew 133% year over year and more than 23 million unique viewers tuned into the coverage. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the partnership with Scripps has helped the league expand its reach and visibility. The WNBA signed an 11-year media rights deal with Disney, Amazon and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal last July, valued at about $200 million per year.</p>

          <p>Amidst rising Middle East tensions and fluctuating markets, long-term investors face the dilemma of whether to buy, sell, or hold. While knee-jerk reactions are rarely the right move, minimizing downside risk is crucial, and investors should consider potential scenarios, such as Iran striking back at Israel or attacking U.S. assets. Experts recommend focusing on sales and earnings, monitoring news flow, and assessing the outlook for investments in both the near and long term.

Symptoms are similar to previous strains, including respiratory and systemic issues.

The song highlights the dark absurdity of controlling policy by controlling language, presenting a jumble of terms for listeners to reflect on. Gordon's approach avoids sloganeering and strident criticism, instead emphasizing the ridiculousness of banning words like "allergy" and "measles." The song reflects a broader trend of muted responses from the entertainment world to Trump's second term, contrasting with the more overt protest efforts during his initial rise to power.</p>

The judge began hearing arguments over whether to hold a pre-trial detention hearing to determine if Abrego Garcia should continue to be held in custody pending trial.
