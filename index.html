            <h2>American Tourists in Paris Express Shame Over Trump's Trade Policies</h2>

            <p>American tourists in Paris are experiencing a sense of shame and embarrassment due to President Trump's trade policies, with some taking precautions to conceal their nationality. The tariffs have not only impacted stock markets and businesses but also subtly affected travel and tourism. A French travel guide company has reported a significant drop in orders for books about the U.S., with readers seemingly opting for destinations like Canada instead. While some Trump supporters dismiss the negative reactions as immature, the events have fueled perceptions of a growing transatlantic rift.</p>

            <p>US envoy Steve Witkoff met with Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg to discuss a potential settlement in Ukraine, coinciding with Donald Trump's urging for a ceasefire. The meeting, described as productive, comes as European nations pledge military aid to Kyiv. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war and alleged the involvement of Chinese nationals in the Russian army, while also reiterating the need for air defense systems to protect Ukrainian cities from Russian missile attacks. Trump has expressed frustration with the lack of progress in agreeing to a truce between Kyiv and Moscow.</p>

            <p>The UK government is considering nationalizing British Steel after the company's Chinese owners requested a substantial bailout. Parliament is set to vote on granting the business secretary the power to intervene and potentially buy coal to keep the steel industry alive. Nationalization is seen as a potential solution to preserve the UK's steelmaking capacity, especially given concerns about energy costs and the age of the blast furnaces. The move reflects a shift towards more active government intervention in protecting national interests, particularly in light of changing global dynamics.</p>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that restricts their access to government buildings and cancels government contracts. The firm argues that the order is a retaliatory measure for their representation of Dominion Voting Systems, which secured a settlement from Fox News over false claims about the 2020 election. Susman Godfrey contends that the executive order is unconstitutional and an abuse of power aimed at punishing organizations and people disliked by the President.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate detained for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil, a legal US resident, faces deportation under a Cold War-era immigration law, with the government arguing his presence is adverse to American foreign policy interests. The ACLU criticized the decision, alleging it was based solely on Khalil's speech. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal the order, asserting his right to speak out against US policy.</p>

While the US runs trade deficits with major African commodity exporters, the continent's exports could be significantly impacted by the tariff policies. Resource-rich countries like South Africa and those with clothing manufacturing industries under AGOA are particularly vulnerable. Trump's tariffs, despite a temporary pause, continue to pose a threat to Africa's economic stability.</p>
