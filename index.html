          <p>Following the election of Pope Leo XIV, the Vatican has signaled a willingness to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, with support from the Italian government and requests from other world leaders. Pope Leo XIV, the first US-born pope, emphasized peace in his inaugural address and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US officials. The Vatican has a history of facilitating prisoner exchanges and supporting Ukrainian children displaced to Russia, which could make it a suitable location for peace negotiations. However, some experts caution that Pope Francis's past benevolent attitude towards Moscow may affect the Vatican's credibility with the Ukrainian side.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has continued releasing immigrants to border shelters while simultaneously suggesting that these shelters may be engaging in illegal activities related to smuggling. FEMA sent letters to shelters raising concerns about potential felony offenses, while ICE continued to request that they house released individuals. Shelters like Catholic Charities, the Holding Institute, and Annunciation House have been providing lodging, meals, and transportation to immigrants, even amidst these conflicting signals. Despite the legal concerns and financial strains, some shelters have chosen to continue providing care, citing moral obligations and long-standing relationships with federal partners.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Kate Shaw argues that the Supreme Court has been granting President Trump increasing power, particularly in personnel decisions. The court's recent order concerning members of the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards effectively allows the president to remove high-level officials, neutralizing independent expertise within the executive branch. Shaw criticizes the court's decision as radical and enabling the consolidation of power in the presidency. She contends that the ruling risks undermining the rule of law and emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" is proposed as a way to raise highly successful children by creating a safe space for them to express their emotions. This approach focuses on being attuned to a child's emotional needs, building emotional resilience, and fostering trust through open conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, respond without shaming, and view misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. The practice also involves the parent doing internal work to become less reactive and creating an environment where the child feels safe to express their authentic self.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming towards Syria and its new leader has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. Since the Islamist rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad, Israel has launched over 700 attacks on Syria to prevent weapons from falling into hostile hands. However, following Trump's meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara and the announcement of lifting sanctions, Israeli airstrikes have significantly decreased. This shift in US foreign policy has undercut Israel's efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor, causing skepticism among Israeli officials regarding Syria's true intentions.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine completed a major prisoner exchange, swapping 1,000 prisoners of war and civilian detainees, marking a rare moment of cooperation amid ongoing conflict. The exchange followed talks in Turkey, though the negotiations failed to establish a ceasefire. Despite the prisoner swap, Russia launched a large drone and missile attack on Ukraine, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Western partners to increase sanctions on Russia, emphasizing the need for stronger pressure to stop the ongoing brutality.</p>

          <p>Anne Tyler, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, discusses her "selfish motive" to explore other lives through her writing. She describes her writing as creating an "extremely believable lie" that allows readers to experience another person's life. Tyler finds inspiration in everyday conversations and observations, often overheard in public places, which she jots down in her "blue box." While Baltimore is a frequent setting in her novels, she claims it's due to "laziness" and her belief that there's more to discover in the average Baltimorean. She also shares insights into her latest book, "Three Days in June," and her approach to creating relatable characters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starr County, Texas, once a Democratic stronghold, voted Republican in 2024, highlighting a broader political realignment. The shift is attributed to the weakening of old partisan ties and the rise of ideological voting, particularly among working-class Hispanics. The county's tradition of machine politics, focused on local elections and patronage, was disrupted by national polarization. The increasing importance of cultural issues has led ideologically moderate and conservative nonwhite voters to realign with the Republican Party. The trend suggests a deeper shift in American politics beyond messaging or outreach.</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's victory, the Democratic Party is struggling with startlingly low approval ratings and internal divisions. The party's standing has plunged after a defeat that felt like a cultural rejection, with communities that Democrats had come to count on, including young people, Black voters, and Latinos, veering toward the right. The party's tarnished image comes at a critical moment, with the national party's brand becoming increasingly influential. Democratic voters crave more action and less self-reflection as the party navigates its path forward.</p>

The incident follows a massive blackout in nearby Cannes, also blamed on suspected sabotage. The power cut impacted Nice Airport, the tramway network, and neighboring towns before power was restored later in the morning.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd’s murder, the Black Lives Matter movement faces a significant backlash, with policies and public sentiment shifting away from the increased focus on racial inequality. Despite initial widespread support, recent polls indicate declining popularity of the movement and a sense that changes have not improved the lives of Black people. President Trump's administration has dismantled diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, while some who achieved prominence after Floyd's death now face criticism. However, some argue that change is never fully rolled back, and Black activism remains essential to democracy.</p>

The deletion indicates China's attempt to stabilize relations with Japan, a U.S. security ally, amid intensifying tensions between Beijing and Washington. The original draft mentioned a commitment to "maintaining the security of Northeast Asia," which could suggest increased joint military activities near Japan.

          <p>Mumbai's iconic pav bread, a staple for the working class, faces an uncertain future as the government plans to ban wood-fired bakeries to reduce pollution. A study claimed that these bakeries contribute significantly to air pollution, prompting the ban. Critics argue that this targets small businesses while ignoring larger pollution sources. While officials suggest switching to cleaner fuels, bakers fear increased costs, potentially pricing the bread out of reach for its traditional consumers. The pav bread is a vital part of Mumbai's cosmopolitan heritage, and bakers fear its unique smoky flavor will be lost with alternative baking methods.</p>

He is turning institutions such as the judiciary, legislature, and federal bureaucracy against themselves, creating an autoimmune disorder within the system. The author contends that Trump is not simply a random source of chaos but has a plan to dismantle the social contract and replace it with a new social order. This is achieved by exploiting the strengths of American democracy to erode its foundations.</p>

The survey also revealed that 44.7% believe rice prices should be brought below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, lower than recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
