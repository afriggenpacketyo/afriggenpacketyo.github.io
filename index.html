          <p>Mainland Chinese forces conducted an amphibious landing drill in the Taiwan Strait as Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te marked his first year in office. The People’s Liberation Army 73rd Group Army practiced near-shore driving and landing operations with armored amphibious vehicles on the Fujian coast. The drill coincided with Lai's pledge to strengthen Taiwan’s defense against increasing cross-strait tension. A spokesman for the mainland’s Taiwan Affairs Office stated that Lai's recent comments aligned with the Taiwan-independence position, further escalating tensions.</p>

Mushtaq's work reflects challenges faced by women due to religious conservatism and patriarchal society, focusing on lives lived at the edges and the strength it takes to persist. The win is expected to encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for a budget package containing his legislative priorities, facing opposition from both conservative and moderate factions. Conservatives are demanding steeper spending cuts and the elimination of clean energy subsidies, while moderates are resisting changes to the state and local tax deduction. Trump urged Republicans to support the bill, warning against defections, and Speaker Mike Johnson is working to build consensus before the Memorial Day deadline. The bill aims to address the deficit but faces challenges due to conflicting demands within the party.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed the End-of-Life Options Act into law, legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients with six months or less to live. The law, effective next year, allows mentally capable adults to request a prescription to end their lives, making Delaware the 11th state to permit medical aid in dying. Patients must be presented with other end-of-life care options and undergo two waiting periods and a second medical opinion before obtaining the prescription. Supporters argue the law is about compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that US export controls on AI chips to China were a failure, as companies are turning to locally-developed technology. Huang noted that China is aggressively investing in its own semiconductor supply chain, reducing Nvidia's market share from 95% to 50%. He praised Trump's understanding that US companies aren't the only providers of AI technology. China has criticized the US measures as discriminatory and called for their correction.</p>

The Trump administration has considered suspending habeas corpus for detained migrants, a move legal experts say only Congress can authorize.

          <p>A new study has discovered that high doses of radiation, commonly used in cancer treatment, could paradoxically promote the distant metastasis of tumors. Scientists at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre found that radiation could lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even when these tumors had not directly received radiation therapy. The research suggests that while radiotherapy effectively targets and destroys cancer cells, it may also have unintended negative consequences.</p>

          <p>The world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, with wildfires as the main cause, surpassing land clearances from agriculture. Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km of old-growth forests were lost, releasing 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases. The Amazon fared particularly badly amid record drought, raising concerns about its resilience and potential for irreversible decline. However, South East Asia saw reduced forest loss due to government policies.</p>
