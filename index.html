          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will update its "American Presidency" exhibit at the National Museum of American History to reflect all presidential impeachments, including both of Donald Trump's. The decision follows public reporting that a temporary placard referencing Trump's impeachments had been removed in July. The museum stated the removal was due to the placard not meeting display standards and was not influenced by any government officials. The updated exhibit will be installed in the coming weeks to provide a complete historical account of all U.S. presidents who have faced impeachment proceedings.</p>

          <p>Rapper Soulja Boy, legally named DeAndre Cortez Way, was arrested in Los Angeles on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The arrest occurred early Sunday morning after police conducted a traffic stop in the Melrose area and found the 35-year-old artist, a passenger in the vehicle, with a gun. Way, known for his 2007 hit "Crank That (Soulja Boy)," has a prior felony conviction, making it illegal for him to possess a firearm.

          <p>The White House is defending the decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a jobs report that included significant downward revisions for previous months. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the move, stating the president wants more reliable data from his own appointees. The firing has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, including a Trump-appointed predecessor, who warn it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent by politicizing a neutral statistical agency.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The tremor was felt across parts of the New York City area, including as far as Connecticut, though no damage or injuries were reported. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake was minor and not expected to cause damage. The event follows a much larger, and rare, 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity, while infrequent, does occur on the East Coast.</p>

A combined reward of $17,500 is being offered for information leading to Drummond's capture.</p>

          <p>Canada's U.S. Trade Minister, Dominic LeBlanc, stated that negotiators are prepared to continue working toward a new trade deal despite the White House increasing tariffs on certain Canadian goods to 35%. LeBlanc expressed disappointment with the decision but described recent talks as constructive and cordial. The U.S. administration cited Canada's previous retaliatory tariffs and concerns over fentanyl trafficking as reasons for the hike. LeBlanc emphasized the deeply integrated nature of the two economies and expressed hope that a mutually beneficial agreement that preserves jobs in both countries can still be reached.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Murder in the Dollhouse," examines the 2020 disappearance and murder of Jennifer Dulos, a Connecticut mother of five who vanished amid a contentious divorce. Author Richard Cohen explores the case that he describes as a "suburban nightmare," focusing on Jennifer's life and the circumstances leading to her death. Her estranged husband, Fotis Dulos, was charged with her murder but died by suicide before his trial. His girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, was later convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, though Jennifer's body has never been found, and she was legally declared dead in 2023.</p>

The plan follows a Supreme Court ruling that found extremely high, undisclosed commissions from lenders to dealers could be considered unfair.

The industry is expected to cover all costs, though concerns exist about the availability of historical data. (not investment advice)</p>

While some public figures choose to be child-free, research indicates a "fertility gap," as the average desired number of children is higher than the actual birth rate. Sociologists suggest that improving the reliability of childcare and the work-life balance could help reverse the worrying trend.</p>

          <h2>Satirical Article Imagines National Park Tours Under a Politicized Agenda</h2>

          <p>In a satirical piece, The Atlantic imagines how tours at U.S. national parks and historic sites might sound if they were altered to avoid any content that could be seen as disparaging or controversial. The article humorously rewrites tour guide scripts for sites like the Selma to Montgomery trail, Manzanar, and Gettysburg, stripping them of historical context about civil rights, internment, or the causes of the Civil War. Instead, the fictional guides focus only on neutral topics like natural beauty or offer confusing, sanitized versions of events, reflecting a hypothetical effort to present a flawless and uncontroversial version of American history.</p>

          <p>China has granted export licenses to 183 additional Brazilian coffee companies, a move that provides a significant alternative market for Brazil's coffee producers. This development comes shortly after the United States announced a steep 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee and other goods. While the U.S. has historically been a much larger market for Brazilian coffee, the new tariffs present a major challenge for exporters. The approval from China, Brazil's top overall trade partner, signals a potential shift in global coffee trade dynamics and offers a crucial lifeline for the affected Brazilian businesses.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has sparked outrage by visiting and openly praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. This action violates a long-standing "status quo" agreement that permits non-Muslims to visit the site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, but not to pray there. Jordan, the site's custodian, called the visit an "unacceptable provocation," while Palestinian authorities said it "crossed all red lines." The Israeli prime minister's office stated there has been no change in policy, despite video evidence of Ben-Gvir's prayer at one of the world's most sensitive religious sites.</p>

          <p>Actor Sydney Sweeney is facing public scrutiny after it was revealed she registered as a Republican voter in Florida in June 2024. The revelation came as her new ad campaign for American Eagle, which plays on the word "genes," drew criticism from some for being tone-deaf in the current political climate, while conservatives praised it as a rebuke of "woke" advertising. This follows a previous controversy in 2022 over guests at her mother's party wearing hats resembling MAGA merchandise. American Eagle has defended the campaign, stating it is simply about jeans.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent public appearances, marked by rambling statements and factual errors, have renewed questions about his mental fitness. During a recent trip, the 79-year-old president went on unprompted rants about windmills and falsely claimed his uncle knew the Unabomber. Experts point to these instances of digression, confusion, and confabulation as potential signs of cognitive decline, noting a deterioration from his articulation in past decades. While the White House dismisses these concerns, critics argue that the president's behavior warrants serious examination, similar to the scrutiny faced by his predecessors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce lawyers advise that individuals in a potentially rocky marriage can take steps to protect their finances. The first recommendation is to gain full awareness of all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, as access is easier. The second strategy is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly business assets acquired during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While potentially a difficult conversation, these measures can provide security and clarity for both partners should the marriage end. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests using specific calming phrases to handle children's tantrums effectively. Instead of punishment, the approach focuses on connection and validation, recognizing that a tantrum is a sign of nervous system distress. Phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" help a child feel safe and understood. This method aims to de-escalate the situation by reassuring the child, setting compassionate boundaries, and building trust, which can reduce the frequency and intensity of future meltdowns.</p>
