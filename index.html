          <h2>US Administration Imposes 50% Universal Tariff on Copper Imports, Triggering Price Drop</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 15:12:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 50% universal tariff on all copper imports, which is set to take effect immediately. This move, aimed at bolstering domestic industries, follows similar tariffs on steel and aluminum. The announcement prompted a significant market reaction, with U.S. copper prices plummeting by as much as 18% in after-hours trading, marking the largest potential single-day decline since 1989. Experts express concern that these duties could lead to increased prices for a wide range of consumer goods, from electronics to construction materials. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual tarantula mating season is approaching, leading to increased sightings of the large, hairy arachnids across several U.S. states, including California, Colorado, and Texas. During September and October, tens of thousands of male tarantulas, which can live for up to a decade, emerge to search for mates. The spiders are generally timid and rarely bite humans unless provoked, and their venom is comparable to a bee sting. The National Park Service encourages the public to observe these creatures from a safe distance, noting their important role in the ecosystem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order to eliminate the de minimis trade exemption for all international shipments, effective August 29. This policy change will subject all imported goods valued at $800 or less to duties and tariffs. The move expands a previous order that targeted only China and Hong Kong, impacting online retailers like Temu and Shein that utilized the loophole to ship products to U.S. consumers tax-free. The administration argues this closure is necessary to protect U.S. businesses and prevent the shipment of illicit substances like fentanyl. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee has voted to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, continuing its cautious approach. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. This move defies public pressure from President Trump, who has been advocating for aggressive cuts to stimulate the economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited elevated uncertainty and potential inflation from trade tariffs as key reasons for the hold, indicating no firm decisions have been made for the next meeting in September.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased after the Federal Reserve announced its decision to keep interest rates unchanged, a move influenced by stronger-than-expected economic growth. The 10-year Treasury yield rose by 5 basis points as markets reacted to the news and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Powell expressed concern that tariffs could reignite inflation, signaling a cautious approach to future rate cuts. The decision to hold rates was widely anticipated by traders, especially after a report showed the U.S. economy grew at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Automakers Absorbing Tariff Costs for Now, but Price Hikes Loom</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant costs from tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and vehicles, major automakers have so far avoided passing these expenses on to consumers. Data shows that new vehicle price increases have remained below the historical average, as companies absorb billions in tariff-related losses to maintain sales and market share. However, executives have indicated this strategy is not sustainable, and analysts predict price hikes of 4% to 8% could come with the 2026 model year vehicles. Automakers are also exploring moving more production to the U.S. and squeezing supply chain costs to mitigate the financial impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent immigration enforcement raids in California are already showing signs of a negative economic impact on the state. An analysis of census data revealed a significant 3.1% decrease in people reporting to work in the private sector when the raids began, a downturn comparable only to the COVID-19 lockdown. Economists warn that the disruption to the immigrant workforce, which constitutes a vital part of industries like agriculture and construction, could lead to job losses for citizens, project delays, and higher food prices. Business groups report sharp drops in foot traffic and sales in heavily impacted areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Workers at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, a former nuclear weapons production facility, discovered a radioactive wasp nest near tanks holding liquid nuclear waste. The nest exhibited radiation levels 10 times higher than federal regulations permit and was promptly removed and disposed of as radioactive waste. Officials stated there is no leak from the waste tanks and believe the contamination is from legacy radioactive material at the site. A watchdog group has criticized the official report as incomplete, demanding more information on the source of the contamination.</p>

          <p>As credit card balances reach record highs, many Americans are exploring debt forgiveness programs as a potential solution. This article explains that not everyone qualifies for such programs, which can reduce debt by 30% to 50%. The strongest candidates are typically those facing genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or major medical expenses, that they can document. Borrowers with significant amounts of unsecured debt, often $10,000 or more, and those who have already fallen behind on payments also have more leverage in negotiations. Other options like credit counseling and debt consolidation are available for those who don't qualify.</p>

          <p>A recent underwater expedition has discovered extensive communities of tubeworms and mollusks thriving at depths of over 31,000 feet in the Pacific Ocean's deep-sea trenches. These hadal environments, characterized by extreme pressure and lack of sunlight, were previously thought to support mostly microbial life. Researchers believe these larger creatures survive through chemosynthesis, a process where they derive energy from chemical reactions, likely fueled by microbes processing carbon that has accumulated in the trenches. The discovery challenges existing models of life at extreme depths and suggests such ecosystems may be more common than previously thought.</p>

This shift may prioritize ambitious, long-term goals like Mars missions at the expense of other scientific research and Earth-focused programs that have historically been central to NASA's purpose.
