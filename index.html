          <h2>Cardiologist Identifies Five Common Foods He Avoids Giving His Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 15:36:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has outlined five food categories he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>Joey Chestnut has won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, regaining his championship title after being banned from the previous year's event. He consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes, securing a decisive victory over the 2024 champion, Patrick Bertoletti. Despite the win, Chestnut fell short of his own 2021 world record of 76 hot dogs. In the women's competition, Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs, though this was significantly below her record-setting performance from the prior year.</p>

          <h2>Filmmaker Ken Burns Discusses the Historical Significance of the American Revolution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 15:29:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most pivotal events in world history, arguing it fundamentally 'turned the world upside down' by creating the concept of a citizen rather than a subject. He emphasized that the Declaration of Independence's ideals, though not initially inclusive of all people, inspired centuries of global movements for equality and rights. Burns, whose new film on the topic is forthcoming, also stressed the importance of embracing America's complex and often contradictory history to create a richer, more inclusive national narrative.</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the scene of a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The Yolo County coroner's office is working to identify the remains, discovered days after the incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics. Officials had previously stated that seven people were unaccounted for following the blast, which destroyed several structures and sparked grass fires across 80 acres. Investigations have revealed the business, linked to a sheriff's lieutenant and a volunteer firefighter, lacked the necessary local permits to store fireworks on the agricultural property.</p>

          <p>Economists are expressing concern over the fiscal implications of President Trump's major tax and spending legislation, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will add $3.4 trillion to the national deficit over a decade. Experts argue that with federal debt already at record levels, this bill could elevate interest rates for consumers and businesses, while also reducing the nation's capacity to respond to future economic crises. Some analysts fear this trajectory could initiate a 'doom loop' of spiraling debt and interest rates, potentially forcing drastic austerity measures in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A jury has heard that a violent brawl at Manchester Airport involving two brothers and three police officers was preceded by an assault inside a Starbucks. Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, is accused of headbutting and punching a man in the coffee shop before he and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, 26, allegedly assaulted the officers who tried to arrest them. The prosecution stated the brothers used a 'high level of violence,' resulting in one officer suffering a broken nose.

The new law creates a deduction for tipped income, although workers will still be responsible for state, local, and payroll taxes. The benefit, which is set to expire in 2028 unless extended, has eligibility limits based on annual income. While the White House touts this as a significant boost for working-class Americans, critics argue it will not help the lowest-earning workers who already have no federal tax liability, suggesting a minimum wage increase would be more effective.</p>

          <p>The direct action group Palestine Action is set to be officially banned as a terrorist organization after a High Court judge denied its request for a temporary injunction. The proscription, which takes effect at midnight, will make it a criminal offense to be a member of or express support for the group, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government moved to ban the group following activism that caused an estimated £7 million in damages. Palestine Action's lawyers argued the ban was an 'authoritarian abuse' of power against a civil disobedience group, and they plan to seek an urgent appeal.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending a widely distributed email that praised President Trump's domestic policy bill, a move analysts describe as a departure from the agency's apolitical stance. The email celebrated the bill's tax relief for seniors, quoting the SSA Commissioner hailing it as a 'historic step forward.' However, critics point out the legislation provides a temporary, enhanced standard deduction rather than a full elimination of taxes on benefits as claimed. The communication has been called 'unconscionable' by a former SSA official and has raised concerns about blurring the line between official government information and partisan messaging.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes showcased the blockchain's increasing integration into the backbone of global finance. Major institutions like Robinhood, which announced tokenized stock trading on an Ethereum-based network, are leveraging the platform for its stability and security. While conversations focused more on infrastructure and utility than price speculation, the event highlighted a shift towards using Ethereum for real-world financial applications, from asset tokenization to stablecoin settlements. Experts believe this trend will make financial transactions faster, cheaper, and more functional for a new generation of users. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of five Democratic lawmakers from Florida were barred from entering a new immigration detention facility, which has been dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' just one day after it began receiving detainees. The remote Everglades jail, managed by the state with federal funding, is a key part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The lawmakers called the denial of entry a 'blatant abuse of power' intended to hide conditions from public view. Governor Ron DeSantis and President Trump have promoted the facility as a deterrent, suggesting its harsh reputation will discourage illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>While hundreds of openly LGBTQ+ soldiers serve in the Ukrainian army, they continue to face legal discrimination and personal prejudice. A central issue is the lack of legal recognition for same-sex partnerships, which denies partners rights to medical information or compensation if a soldier is injured or killed. A bill to establish registered partnerships has been stalled in parliament for over two years. Some soldiers also report facing threats and harassment within their units, although attitudes are slowly shifting, with many comrades and commanders showing support.

          <p>A new report details the high-stakes negotiations that led to Paramount Global paying a $16 million settlement to President Trump over a CBS '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris. The settlement was seen as crucial for securing regulatory approval for Paramount's sale to Skydance Media, a deal involving Trump allies. Trump had initially demanded a much larger sum and an apology for what he claimed were deceptive edits. The final agreement, which includes Trump dropping all claims, was reached after months of pressure and the involvement of powerful figures like agent Ari Emanuel and Oracle's Larry Ellison.</p>

          <p>As competitive eaters like Joey Chestnut consume massive quantities of food in short periods, health experts explain the potential physiological consequences. The primary effect is the extreme stretching of the stomach, which can become permanently distended and lose its ability to contract properly, impacting digestion. In the short term, contestants face risks from ingesting huge amounts of sodium and fat, which can spike blood pressure and cause gastrointestinal distress. While the long-term effects are not well-studied, immediate dangers include choking, esophageal tears, and in rare cases, death.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing backlash from Jewish advocacy groups after using the antisemitic slur 'Shylocks' during a speech in Iowa. While discussing tax policy in his new spending bill, Trump used the term to describe certain bankers, referencing the villainous Jewish moneylender from Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice.' The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language 'extremely offensive and dangerous,' while another group said it normalized a quintessential antisemitic stereotype. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's offensive connotation and believed it simply referred to a moneylender charging high rates.</p>
