          <p>Eighteen people were injured in a knife attack at Hamburg's main railway station, with some sustaining life-threatening wounds.

The attack occurred between platforms, and authorities are investigating the suspect's motives, including potential homicide charges.

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to alleviate consumer burden due to soaring rice prices. The reserve rice is expected to be available in stores by June. The government intends to bypass auctions to control prices, and is exploring online sales in cooperation with Rakuten. This initiative aims to counter the recent record-high rice prices in supermarkets, which have doubled due to poor harvests and increased demand from tourism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany faces criticism for its selective approach to acknowledging its Nazi past, particularly when it comes to financial gains and strategic interests. The Herbert Quandt Media prize, celebrating the legacy of an early SS supporter involved in Nazi war crimes, continues to be awarded to journalists from prominent German media outlets. This highlights a broader reluctance to confront societal entanglement with state violence and genocide, as many wealthy German families built their empires on Nazi collaboration and forced labor. While Germany promotes its policy of acknowledging past crimes, it often ignores inconvenient truths that threaten its self-image.</p>

This trend reflects a broader movement among countries to seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar, aligning with China's long-term strategy to mitigate risks and assert financial independence.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter on May 1 as it approached the building, leading to two commercial jets aborting their landings at a Washington airport. The loss of contact, lasting about 20 seconds, occurred due to a temporary antenna's placement, which has since been moved. While the Army asserts there were no deviations from approved flight paths, the incident raised concerns about air traffic control coordination. The FAA declined to comment, and the NTSB expressed disappointment at the Army's handling of the information release.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is preparing to govern Lancashire County Council, having secured a significant majority in recent local elections. The party aims to review the council's budget, address legacy issues, and bring a fresh perspective to local governance. While lacking extensive political experience, Reform UK emphasizes the real-world experience of its newly elected councillors. The party's priorities include reversing net-zero initiatives and challenging diversity and inclusion policies, but faces scrutiny and protests as it takes on the responsibilities of running local services.</p>

          <p>A 443-foot cargo ship ran aground in Norway, coming within feet of a cabin while its owner was asleep. The helmsman of the NCL Salten was reportedly asleep at the time of the accident, failing to change course as required. The ship ran aground near Johan Helberg's cabin, causing damage to a heating pipe. The shipping company is conducting internal inquiries and assisting authorities in the investigation. The same ship had previously run aground twice before in 2023 and 2024.</p>
