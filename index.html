            <p>Argentina faced widespread transport disruptions due to a general strike protesting President Javier Milei's austerity measures. Domestic flights were grounded, and train and metro services in Buenos Aires were suspended, though international flights proceeded with minor delays. The strike, the third since Milei took office, reflects union concerns over the impact of spending cuts on vulnerable populations, including pensioners and low-paid workers. Milei's austerity plan, aimed at curbing hyperinflation, has involved slashing subsidies and public sector jobs, leading to public discontent and protests. </p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador. While upholding the lower court's order, the Supreme Court asked for clarification on the extent to which the administration can be compelled to bring Abrego Garcia back to the US. Abrego Garcia's lawyer hailed the ruling as a victory for the rule of law, while the Justice Department emphasized the President's authority in foreign affairs. The case highlights the administration's focus on deporting alleged gang members and raises questions about due process.</p>

            <p>Sony Pictures Television has won a legal battle to regain distribution rights to the popular game shows "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" from CBS. A Los Angeles court rejected CBS's bid to block Sony from taking over distribution, citing unauthorized licensing agreements. CBS Media Ventures plans to appeal the ruling, while Sony expressed satisfaction with the court's decision. The outcome marks a significant shift in the distribution landscape for these iconic game shows.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to assist in the return of a man mistakenly deported to a jail in El Salvador. The court's ruling requires the government to facilitate the man's release and ensure his case is handled correctly. While the administration conceded the deportation was an error, they argued against the lower court's order. This decision underscores the importance of due process and raises concerns about the administration's handling of immigration cases.</p>
