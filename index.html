        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced he will travel to Washington D.C. for a meeting. The announcement came after what Zelenskyy described as a long and substantive phone call with Trump and European leaders. Trump had earlier stated on social media that the best path forward is a direct Peace Agreement rather than a ceasefire, a shift from his previous remarks where he expressed a desire for a ceasefire deal from the Alaska meeting. The upcoming discussion in Washington will focus on the details of ending the war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's imposition of a steep 50% tariff on Brazil is causing significant concern for New York City coffee shops, which operate on thin margins. Business owners fear the increased costs on Brazilian coffee beans, a major import, will jeopardize their survival, forcing them to either absorb the costs or raise prices for consumers. This adds to existing price pressures from climate change, with some customers already cutting back on cafe visits. While Brazilian producers feel the strain, coffee exporters in countries with lower tariffs, like Colombia, see a potential short-term competitive advantage.</p>

          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny's 30-concert residency in San Juan has become a powerful, emotional touchstone for Puerto Ricans, particularly for those who have moved away from the island. Titled "I Don't Want To Leave Here," the shows address the collective sorrow felt by many in the diaspora who left due to economic hardship and deteriorating infrastructure. The concerts serve as a cathartic celebration of Puerto Rican culture and identity, fostering a renewed sense of pride and connection to their homeland. For many attendees, the experience has reinforced their determination to one day return to the island permanently.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electricity prices across the United States have been rising more than twice as fast as overall inflation, placing a significant financial burden on households, especially during summer months. Factors driving the surge include increased demand from power-hungry AI data centers and the rising cost of natural gas, which is a primary source for electricity generation. This situation is particularly difficult for low-income families and seniors, with one in six households already struggling to pay their power bills. While clean energy offers a cheaper long-term solution, the immediate challenge of affordability remains a critical issue for many Americans.</p>

          <p>A recent executive order signed by President Trump is set to facilitate the inclusion of "alternative assets," such as cryptocurrency and private equity, into 401(k) retirement plans. This move aims to democratize access to investment types previously reserved for wealthy individuals and large institutions. However, financial experts caution against the potential risks, including the high fees and long lock-in periods associated with private equity, and the volatility and loose regulation of crypto. Advisors suggest that if considered, these assets should only form a small portion of a portfolio for those far from retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska has drawn mixed reactions from international leaders and U.S. lawmakers, with many expressing disappointment over the lack of a concrete peace deal for Ukraine. Some U.S. legislators, like Senator Jeanne Shaheen, criticized Trump for getting "played" by Putin, while others, like Senator Lindsey Graham, expressed cautious optimism about a potential future trilateral meeting including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. In Ukraine, the reaction was largely unenthusiastic, with officials noting the absence of any agreement on a ceasefire. Russian officials, in contrast, described the meeting in positive terms.</p>

These investors have purchased thousands of apartments across the Greek capital.

          <p>Despite high expectations and elaborate staging, the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, concluded without a tangible deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump acknowledged that while "great progress" was made, they "didn't get there." Following the talks, Trump held a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who announced he would visit Washington on Monday. Putin indicated he has not changed his position, stating that the "root causes of the conflict" must be eliminated, a phrase understood to mean Ukraine ceding territory and abandoning its NATO aspirations.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China are voicing increasing concerns about the sustainability of the United States' expanding national debt, prompting calls for China to reduce its exposure to U.S. dollar assets. In a recent publication, they argued that although a default has not occurred, the current trajectory of U.S. debt is unsustainable. This sentiment aligns with China's recent actions, as it has been trimming its holdings of U.S. Treasuries to their lowest level since 2009. The researchers suggest a gradual adjustment, including increasing reserves of gold and other strategic resources to mitigate risk. (not investment advice)</p>

Firstly, the event marked a significant victory for Putin, who was welcomed back to the world stage with a red-carpet reception on U.S. soil. Secondly, the talks ended earlier than expected with vague statements, confirming no breakthrough was achieved on ending the war in Ukraine. Putin's language suggested his maximalist demands remain, while Trump's remarks notably omitted any mention of a ceasefire.
