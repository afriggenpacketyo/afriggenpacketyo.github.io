          <p>The Independent reports that obese patients are being denied knee and hip replacements by the NHS in England and Wales to reduce costs. Approximately one-third of NHS areas in England and multiple health boards in Wales are restricting patient access based on their BMI, contradicting NICE guidance. Patients are required to lose weight before becoming eligible, but waiting lists for NHS weight loss programs are extensive. The Royal College of Surgeons has criticized this policy, warning of potential mobility loss and health deterioration for affected patients.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now leading the Department of Health and Human Services, has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a research project focused on environmental toxins. This approach contrasts with the prevailing scientific consensus that genetics play a significant role in autism's development. Experts worry that Kennedy's focus on environmental factors could divert resources from genetic research, which has led to the development of promising new therapies. Scientists emphasize that autism is a complex disorder with multiple genetic factors, rather than a single environmental cause.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis that has forced school closures and triggered widespread inspections. Lead has been detected in multiple public schools, and several students have tested positive for high lead levels. The city's request for federal support was denied after the CDC's lead exposure team was laid off as part of a restructuring. Milwaukee is now managing the crisis independently, including replacing lead water service lines, but requires additional funding to complete the project.</p>

Potential recommendations include expanding cadet forces, bolstering military reserves, and creating a new civilian force to protect infrastructure.

          <h2>UK Steelmakers Decry Trump's Tariff Increase as 'Body Blow'</h2>

          <p>UK steelmakers have criticized President Donald Trump's decision to double import taxes on steel and aluminum to 50%. The trade group UK Steel warned that orders could be delayed or canceled, creating uncertainty for shipments already en route across the Atlantic. The UK government is engaging with the US to provide clarity to the industry, as the original 25% tariff remains in place while a trade deal is finalized. UK Steel is urging the government to expedite the agreement to eliminate UK steel import taxes.</p>

The Federal Reserve's inflation gauge came in cooler than expected, but tariff levels remain a concern. (not investment advice)</p>
