          <p>Recent polls indicate a decline in American faith in Donald Trump, including among Republicans, regarding key issues. A majority of voters describe his second term as “scary,” with low ratings on the economy and immigration policy. Only 24% of Americans believe Trump is focusing on the right priorities, while over half disapprove of his overall performance. These negative reviews come as Trump approaches 100 days in office, marked by global financial market instability and deportations. The polls reveal significant disapproval of Trump's handling of the economy, trade, and immigration, even among some Republicans.</p>

Trump posted on Truth Social, questioning Putin's motives for targeting civilian areas, suggesting he may not want to end the war. This shift in perspective could potentially influence Trump's approach to the conflict, offering new hope for intervention before the situation in Ukraine deteriorates further.

          <p>The 'Gran Abuelo,' a 5,400-year-old alerce tree in Chile, is facing a threat from a proposed highway that would cut through its protected rainforest habitat. This ancient tree, also known as Patagonian cypress, is not only one of the oldest but also a valuable climate record-keeper. Scientists use its rings to reconstruct climate patterns, aiding in understanding and combating climate change. The highway project, purportedly for connectivity and tourism, is suspected to be a guise for timber access, increasing the risk of wildfires and endangering the alerce species.</p>

          <p>The FBI's arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan has ignited a political firestorm, with Democrats decrying the move as an attack on judicial independence and Republicans calling for her removal. Dugan is accused of obstructing immigration officers at her courthouse. The arrest has fueled accusations of executive overreach and weaponization of federal law enforcement by the Trump administration. The incident has intensified the debate over immigration policies and the separation of powers, with both sides framing the issue as a threat to democratic values.</p>
