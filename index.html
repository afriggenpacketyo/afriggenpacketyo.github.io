          <p>This article highlights several major figures in the U.S. tech industry, including Elon Musk and Microsoft's Satya Nadella, who were once holders of H-1B visas. The program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign talent, is currently facing potential restrictions and overhauls under the Trump administration. The piece details the personal immigration journeys of these leaders, showcasing their reliance on the visa system to build their careers and companies in America. Many of these executives now advocate for immigration reform while defending the program's role in maintaining global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has announced it will begin a phased restart of its manufacturing operations after a significant cyberattack forced a month-long shutdown of its UK facilities. The halt in production had placed immense financial pressure on the company's supply chain, with many smaller firms facing potential bankruptcy. While the resumption of work is welcome news for suppliers, they emphasize that financial assistance is still crucial to recover from the substantial losses incurred. The government has offered loan guarantees to support JLR and its associated supply network during this period.</p>

The incident occurred when a makeshift cabin carrying 13 monks plunged down a mountainside after its cable reportedly snapped. Seven monks, including three foreign nationals from Romania, Russia, and India, were killed instantly in the crash. The monks were traveling to meditation units on a mountain within the Na Uyana monastery complex when the accident happened.</p>

          <p>GSK announced that CEO Emma Walmsley, the first woman to lead a major pharmaceutical company, will step down on December 31 after more than eight years in the role. She will be succeeded by Luke Miels, the current Chief Commercial Officer. During her tenure, Walmsley oversaw significant strategic moves, including the spinoff of the consumer healthcare business Haleon. However, the company's stock performance has been described as lackluster, having fallen 11% during her leadership, leading to investor disappointment despite strong financial guidance.</p>

          <p>A gunman killed at least four people and injured eight others after driving his truck into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, and subsequently setting the building on fire. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old veteran Thomas Jacob Sanford, was killed in a shootout with police. The FBI is leading the investigation, treating the incident as an act of targeted violence and working to determine a motive. Investigators are exploring potential connections to recent threats or the recent death of the church's president, Russell M. Nelson.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, is forecast to intensify into a hurricane by Tuesday. The storm is currently bringing heavy rain and tropical storm conditions to the Bahamas but is projected to move away from the southeastern United States. While a tropical storm watch for Florida's east coast has been canceled, swells generated by Imelda are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's health department, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is conducting a new safety review of mifepristone, the drug used in most U.S. abortions. The review cites a non-peer-reviewed study from a conservative think tank, which has been heavily criticized by medical experts for flawed methodology. For 25 years, mifepristone has been proven safe and effective, with serious complications occurring in less than 0.5% of users. This move is seen as part of a broader effort to curtail abortion access following the end of Roe v. Wade, potentially restricting a method that is safer and more accessible than surgical procedures.</p>

She also criticized major institutions for what she termed their "capitulation" to a tyrant, while praising public pushback that led to the reinstatement of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.

          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has reportedly assumed a primary role in directing U.S. military strikes against boats in international waters suspected of carrying narcotics from Venezuela. Operating through the empowered Homeland Security Council (HSC), which he leads, Miller's influence has at times superseded that of other top officials. The legal justification for these strikes, which some critics have called extrajudicial, is based on the administration's designation of the Tren de Aragua cartel as a foreign terrorist organization linked to the Venezuelan government, a claim that has faced legal challenges.</p>

The article details how the Trump administration and its allies are now using state power to target political opponents, a strategy previously associated with the left's "cancel culture." This tit-for-tat behavior, fueled by grievance politics, erodes foundational democratic principles like free speech and the rule of law.

          <h2>More Young Americans Opt for Skilled Trades Amid Concerns Over College Costs and AI's Impact on White-Collar Jobs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 05:00:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Americans, particularly from Gen Z, are choosing blue-collar careers over a traditional college path. This trend is driven by soaring tuition costs and increasing concerns that artificial intelligence will automate many entry-level white-collar jobs previously sought by college graduates. Skilled trades like electricians, plumbers, and welders are gaining appeal due to their strong job security, potential for entrepreneurship, and the reduced stigma surrounding vocational careers. This shift reflects a changing perception of long-term career stability in an evolving economic landscape.</p>

          <h2>Unemployment Exemption Could Shield Over 1 Million from New Medicaid Work Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 05:00:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in the new federal law requiring many Medicaid enrollees to work could exempt over a million people living in counties with high unemployment. The rule mandates work or volunteer hours for non-disabled adults, but states can apply for exemptions for counties where the unemployment rate is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national average. An analysis by KFF shows that depending on how the Trump administration interprets this rule, between 1.4 million and 4.6 million people could be shielded. However, the actual number will depend on both federal interpretation and whether individual states choose to apply for the waivers.</p>

          <p>Hunan has become the latest Chinese province to reform its regulations on non-tax revenue, aiming to ease the financial burden on private businesses and boost investor confidence. The new rules, effective November 1, mandate that proceeds from confiscated goods be sent to the state treasury and explicitly forbid local officials from using fines as a tool to increase revenue. This move comes as Beijing seeks to address the growing reliance of debt-ridden local governments on administrative fees and fines, which have been a source of struggle for companies in a slowing post-pandemic economy.</p>

          <p>Top congressional leaders from both parties are scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House, with less than two days remaining to fund the government and avert a shutdown. The meeting follows a stalemate in the Senate, where a House-passed Republican funding bill failed due to Democratic opposition. Democrats are pushing to include extensions for Affordable Care Act subsidies and restore other healthcare funding in any stopgap measure. With the funding deadline of October 1 fast approaching, both sides are publicly blaming each other for the potential shutdown while preparing for high-stakes negotiations.</p>

Led by Dr. Andriy Sirko, the team has developed a strategy of "early and comprehensive surgery," addressing multiple complex injuries in a single, lengthy operation, often on the same day the soldier is wounded. With assistance from U.S. doctors and advanced equipment, the hospital has become a critical center for treating severe war-related head trauma, adapting civilian medical technology for battlefield conditions and dramatically improving patient outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As daylight hours decrease in the fall, many people experience symptoms of seasonal depression, ranging from the "winter blues" to clinical Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Experts recommend starting bright light therapy in the autumn to help prevent or reverse these symptoms. Daily morning exposure to a 10,000-lux light box can reset the body's circadian rhythms, which are sensitive to changes in light. Research has shown that light therapy can be as effective as standard antidepressant medications, and using it as part of a consistent routine can provide an enduring positive effect throughout the winter months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of researchers is advocating for official recognition of a distinct form of diabetes, proposing the name "Type 5 diabetes." First identified in Jamaica in the 1950s, this type affects young, thin, and undernourished individuals, primarily in regions with widespread malnutrition. These patients do not fit the criteria for Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, as they produce some insulin but not enough, and are dangerously susceptible to low blood sugar if treated with standard insulin therapy. Formalizing the name, which the International Diabetes Federation has adopted, aims to galvanize research and establish safer, more effective treatment protocols.</p>

Overwhelmed with a feeling of loss, she broke down in class, and her teacher, Mrs. Welch, took her aside to listen. After hearing the full story, the teacher simply offered a comforting hug, a small gesture that Eby says centered her and made her feel she would be okay. Decades later, Eby reflects on how that single moment of empathy shaped her own approach as a teacher and demonstrated the profound impact of small, kind acts.</p>
