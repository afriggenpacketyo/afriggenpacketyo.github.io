          <p>A flash flood emergency was declared in Lincoln County, New Mexico, following intense rainfall that caused the Rio Ruidoso to rise dramatically. Multiple rescue missions were initiated, including for a father and two children reportedly washed away, and for another person trapped by the high water. Video footage showed a home being swept down the river, and the U.S. Geological Survey recorded the river rising 15 feet in about an hour. The provisional peak water level may have set a new record high for the river.</p>

          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, known from the "Tiger King" series, has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison for illegal animal trafficking and money laundering. He pleaded guilty to buying and selling endangered species, including cheetahs, lions, and a chimpanzee, on the black market. Prosecutors stated Antle, who portrayed himself as a conservationist, was a key figure in the illegal chimpanzee trade and laundered over half a million dollars. The judge considered Antle's care for animals, sentencing him below the federal guidelines.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has issued a caution against New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, describing the Democratic socialist as a "communist" and a "disaster." During a cabinet meeting, Trump asserted that New York would "never be the same" if Mamdani were elected, criticizing the Democratic party's direction. This follows previous clashes where Trump threatened to arrest Mamdani over his stance on federal immigration enforcement. Mamdani has previously characterized Trump's comments as an attack on democracy.</p>

The BBC highlighted cases where parent company Meta permanently disabled accounts, only to reinstate them after journalistic inquiry, issuing an apology for the error. A petition with over 27,000 signatures claims Meta's AI-powered moderation system is flawed and its appeal process is inadequate. The company has acknowledged issues in some areas but has not commented on a wider problem.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has appointed Sarah Mahin to lead its new Department of Homeless Services and Housing. Mahin, a veteran executive with two decades of experience, will oversee the new agency tasked with bringing more accountability to the county's homelessness spending. The department was created to take over functions from the much-criticized Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA). Mahin currently directs the county's Housing for Health program, which is seen as a model for the new agency's approach to providing housing and care.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's new forward, João Pedro, made a stunning first start for the club by scoring two goals against his former Brazilian team, Fluminense, in the Club World Cup semi-final. The 23-year-old, who joined from Brighton for a significant fee, showed his class with two impressive strikes that secured Chelsea's place in the final. Despite the importance of the goals, he respectfully chose not to celebrate against the club where he began his career. His performance has generated excitement that he could be the answer to the team's search for a consistent goalscorer.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged two men for their alleged roles in OmegaPro, a massive international cryptocurrency investment scheme that defrauded victims of over $650 million. The indictment claims the defendants operated a pyramid-style fraud, luring investors with false promises of 300% returns over 16 months through supposed foreign exchange trading. To appear legitimate, the operators promoted the scheme with extravagant events, including projecting their logo onto Dubai's Burj Khalifa. The two men face charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire raging near Marseille, France's second-largest city, has injured at least 110 people and forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents. The fire, which authorities believe was sparked by a car fire, spread rapidly due to strong winds and dry conditions, covering about 700 hectares. Approximately 800 firefighters are battling the blaze, which is not yet contained, and the city's mayor described the effort as "guerrilla warfare." The fire also caused the temporary closure of Marseille Provence airport, disrupting travel in the region.</p>

          <p>The head of France's DGSE intelligence service stated that recent American and Israeli strikes have "extremely delayed" Iran's nuclear program by many months. According to the intelligence chief, Nicolas Lerner, various stages of the program were "very seriously affected," though he noted that a significant portion of Iran's highly enriched uranium stockpile remains in the hands of Iranian authorities. The assessment comes after Iran suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), limiting the ability of international inspectors to monitor its nuclear activities.</p>

The audio is set to be used as key evidence in a crimes against humanity trial against Hasina, who fled to India after being ousted from power. Her party denies any unlawful intent.</p>

If constructed, the corridor could significantly shorten shipping times compared to routes that use the Panama Canal. The agreement currently covers only the technical, environmental, and economic studies for the ambitious project, which are expected to take up to five years to complete.</p>
