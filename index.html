          <p>The United States and China have announced substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation of their ongoing trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted they were "in-depth" and "candid." These meetings, the first since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, have raised hopes for tariff reductions and a reduction in economic tensions.

The brothers, prominent in New York's luxury real estate market, are accused of luring women to nightclubs and parties, then drugging and sexually assaulting them. The superseding indictment includes more alleged victims, bringing the total to six, with allegations that Alon and Tal Alexander should have recognized that one of the victims was underage.

          <p>The White House is in discussions with Qatar regarding the potential transfer of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet for use as Air Force One, although Qatar denies it would be a gift, saying the transfer of an aircraft for "temporary use" is under discussion. The proposed arrangement is facing legal and ethical scrutiny, with critics raising concerns about accepting gifts from foreign governments. President Trump defends the negotiations, stating the plane is offered for his use at no cost. The current Air Force One planes have been in service since the early 1990s, and Boeing has faced delays in delivering newer models.</p>

The court has ordered the preservation and analysis of the documents, and Argentina's Holocaust Museum has been invited to assist in the process.

          <p>Taiwanese authorities have removed the "Han" category from demographic groups listed on the Executive Yuan's official information page, a move seen as distancing the island from mainland China. The change categorizes Han Chinese, the majority on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as "other population." This decision comes as Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party intensifies efforts to promote the island's indigenous identity while eroding historical and cultural ties with the mainland. The revised web page now states that Taiwan's registered population consists of 2.6% indigenous, 1.2% foreign, and 96.2% "other population.</p>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, globally praised for supporting long lifespans, is under strain from a shrinking workforce and aging population. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government aims to secure funds for child-rearing by saving from the medical system, increasing the burden on high medical cost patients. The plan has sparked backlash, leading to a freeze on envisioned hikes until after the upper house election. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust.</p>
