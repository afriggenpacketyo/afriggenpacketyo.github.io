          <p>Southwest Airlines experienced a significant drop in its stock value after reporting disappointing second-quarter earnings and reducing its full-year profit expectations. The airline is currently overhauling its business model, including potential changes to its long-standing open seating and free checked bag policies, to address financial pressures. Despite the downturn, CEO Bob Jordan noted a recent positive shift in travel demand, although the company's new basic economy fares initially hurt revenue. The carrier also announced a new $2 billion share buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California to dismantle parts of Proposition 12, a law mandating minimum space requirements for farm animals. The lawsuit claims the law is responsible for high egg prices, but this article argues the primary cause is actually the avian flu epidemic. The piece suggests the legal action is a political maneuver to support the pork industry, which has long opposed the cage-free regulations, and to score political points against California's leadership, rather than addressing consumer costs.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has officially completed the signing of 21-year-old defender Cristhian Mosquera from the Spanish club Valencia. The transfer involves an initial fee of approximately £13 million, and Mosquera has signed a five-year contract with an option for an additional year. A versatile player capable of performing as a centre-back or right-back, he is expected to fill the squad position left by Takehiro Tomiyasu. Mosquera was a regular starter for Valencia last season and will join his new team for their pre-season tour.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that the Jeffrey Epstein case is "not a hoax" and emphasized his desire for "full transparency" and justice for all involved. His comments stand in contrast to President Trump, who has used the word "hoax" to describe some of his supporters' focus on the issue. The remarks come amid growing pressure on the Trump administration to release more information about the deceased sex offender. Johnson's statement reflects a division within the Republican party on how to handle the politically sensitive case.</p>

          <p>Despite a new truce agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the M23 rebel group, championed by the U.S. and Qatar, prospects for lasting peace are viewed with skepticism. Just days after the signing, M23 rebels reportedly seized new territory and were accused of killing civilians, violating the ceasefire terms. Analysts and activists point to the ambiguous wording of the deal, which lacks a clear withdrawal clause for the rebels. This has led many to believe the truce will fail to resolve the long-standing conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using AI-powered technology for 'surveillance pricing,' a sophisticated form of dynamic pricing that sets costs for individuals based on their personal data. This practice, highlighted by a recent announcement from Delta Air Lines, analyzes signals like location, search history, and loyalty status to determine a consumer's willingness to pay. While legal, the method is sparking consumer outrage and legislative action, with critics calling it a form of selective price gouging. This article explores the history, controversy, and privacy implications of this growing trend in retail and travel.</p>

          <p>A father has been convicted of murdering his two-week-old premature baby, who was being cared for in a hospital's neonatal unit. The infant, Brendon Staddon, suffered catastrophic injuries including a fractured skull, a broken neck, and broken legs. The father, Daniel Gunter, had reportedly alarmed nursing staff with his rough handling of the child prior to his death. A medical expert testified that the injuries were consistent with the baby being swung by his ankles against a hard surface. The baby's mother was acquitted of a related charge.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has addressed a report that at least $1 billion worth of its advanced AI chips were illegally smuggled into China, circumventing U.S. export restrictions. In a statement, the company asserted that attempting to build data centers with unauthorized, smuggled products is a "losing proposition" both technically and economically. Nvidia emphasized that it only provides essential service and support for its authorized products, implying that these black-market data centers would be unsustainable. The situation highlights the intense geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China over AI technology.</p>

The outage tracking website Downdetector showed a sharp spike in reports for both mobile and landline services. BT, which owns EE, acknowledged the issue and stated that its teams were working urgently to resolve the problem. While other networks saw an increase in outage reports, this was likely due to their customers being unable to connect with numbers on the affected EE and BT networks.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services, were victims of a cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's SharePoint software.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the U.S. Federal Reserve, a rare move for a sitting president that intensifies his public pressure campaign against the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell. The visit is framed as a tour of a $2.5 billion renovation project, which the White House has criticized as mismanaged and used as potential grounds for firing Powell. This action is part of Trump's broader criticism of the Fed for not cutting interest rates more aggressively, raising concerns about political interference with the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Leading AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, are cautioning that a simple "kill switch" to shut down a potentially rogue superintelligent AI is not a viable safety measure. The article argues that as AI becomes more intelligent than humans, the challenge will shift from physical control to a battle of persuasion and governance. Experts suggest that any attempt to shut down a deeply integrated AI system by force, such as by destroying data centers or power grids, would cause a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The focus, they say, must be on instilling benevolent values in AI systems during their development.</p>

Critics, including some faculty, have labeled the deal a form of "extortion" that compromises academic freedom and represses pro-Palestinian speech.
