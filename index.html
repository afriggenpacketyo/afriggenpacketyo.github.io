          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is expected to strengthen again. While its maximum wind speeds have decreased, the storm's overall size has grown, prompting tropical storm warnings for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas. The hurricane is not projected to make a direct impact on the U.S. East Coast, but its increased size could generate dangerous rip currents along the Southeast coast. Forecasters are closely monitoring its path as it undergoes an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that could lead to re-intensification.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are facing mounting uncertainty as quarterback Matthew Stafford continues to be sidelined by a back issue, preventing him from practicing with the team. With the season opener against the Houston Texans just three weeks away, Stafford has yet to take a single snap in team drills, raising serious concerns about his availability. Coach Sean McVay has provided limited updates, stating the team is trying to manage the situation, while backup quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett have been taking first-team snaps. The team's prospects for the upcoming season are now in doubt pending Stafford's recovery.</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats who left the state to prevent a quorum and block a Republican-led redistricting plan have started to return. Their departure was a tactic to temporarily derail a special legislative session called by Governor Greg Abbott to redraw congressional maps, which could create five more Republican-leaning seats. After successfully stalling the initial session, the lawmakers are gradually coming back as a new session begins. Their return follows a move by California Governor Gavin Newsom to counter the Texas GOP's push with a redistricting plan of his own.</p>

          <p>Irish novelist Sally Rooney has publicly declared her continued support for Palestine Action, even after the pro-Palestinian direct-action group was proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. Writing in the Irish Times, Rooney stated she will use her earnings and public platform to support the group's actions, adding, "if this makes me a supporter of terror under UK law, so be it." Her statement comes as Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, citing the group's targeting of arms companies and a manual providing guidance for attacks as evidence it is not a legitimate protest group.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who won New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, has officially kicked off his general election campaign with a message aimed at attracting voters beyond his party. Speaking in Brooklyn, Mamdani focused on affordability and the government's role in meeting citizens' "material needs," referencing his proposals for government-run grocery stores and rent freezes. He shared anecdotes about registered Republicans and non-Democrats who expressed interest in his campaign, framing his primary victory as the start of a broader movement. Mamdani is running against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who are both running as independents.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to meet with President Trump, reports suggest he may be pressed to surrender the entire Donbas region in exchange for a peace deal with Russia. This proposal, reportedly put forward by Vladimir Putin, would involve ceding the remainder of the Donetsk region, which Ukraine has defended at a great human cost. The potential concession is viewed as a betrayal by some Ukrainians on the front lines, while others, exhausted by war, see it as a painful choice between land and life. Any formal handover of territory faces significant constitutional hurdles and widespread public opposition in Ukraine.</p>

Chelsea managed only three shots on target throughout the game, raising early questions about their creativity and finishing ability.

          <p>After his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has reversed his position on the war in Ukraine, now advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than an immediate ceasefire. Prior to the meeting, Trump had emphasized a ceasefire as his main goal, but he now aligns with Putin's view that a comprehensive peace deal is the better path forward. This shift puts him at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who favors a ceasefire first to halt the fighting before entering into complex negotiations. The change in U.S. strategy will be a central topic during Zelenskyy's upcoming visit to the White House.</p>

          <p>A newly drilled geothermal well in Kenya's Silali field is producing enough steam to generate 22 megawatts of electricity, more than four times the typical output. This discovery is a significant advancement for Kenya's goal of expanding its renewable energy capacity and ensuring a reliable power supply. Unlike solar and wind, geothermal energy provides a constant and clean power source, which is crucial as the country faces growing electricity demand and drought-related challenges to its hydropower. The state-owned Geothermal Development Company (GDC) plans to extract 300 megawatts from the region by 2028.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman from Gaza, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment due to severe emaciation, has died. Identified as Marah Abu Zuhri, she arrived in Pisa on Wednesday as part of an Italian government program but suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away on Friday. The University Hospital of Pisa described her condition as a "very complex clinical picture" involving severe weight and muscle loss, while Israeli authorities stated she had leukemia. Her death highlights the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and an impending famine.</p>

          <p>Dr. Alieu Kamara, the sole neurosurgeon in Sierra Leone, has successfully performed the nation's first-ever spine surgery, offering new hope in a country of eight million people. The patient, Morie Abibu, was paralyzed and slowly suffocating from a mass pressing on his spinal cord. Before Dr. Kamara's arrival this year, such a condition would have been a death sentence for those unable to afford treatment abroad. The landmark operation was made possible through a grassroots network of support, including the nonprofit Mission Brain, which facilitated Dr. Kamara's training and supplied crucial equipment.</p>

          <p>Key European leaders are set to accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington for talks with President Trump, following the recent U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff expressed optimism, stating that Russia made "concessions," including an agreement to allow NATO-style security protections for Ukraine. However, Zelenskyy remains cautious, noting there is no sign yet that Russia will agree to a trilateral summit. The involvement of leaders from Germany, France, the UK, and the EU is intended to present a united front and ensure European security interests are represented in the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel conducted a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses to pressure the government into securing a ceasefire deal with Hamas for the release of remaining hostages in Gaza. The demonstrations mark an escalation in public frustration after 22 months of war, with fears that a new military offensive could endanger the lives of the approximately 50 hostages still held captive. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the protests, claiming they benefit Hamas, while far-right cabinet members reiterated their opposition to any deal that leaves Hamas in power.</p>

          <h2>Recent Downfall of Senior Ethnic Minority Officials Signals Shift in China's Anti-Corruption Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent investigation and expulsion of several high-ranking officials from ethnic minority communities in China suggests a significant shift in the country's political landscape. The downfall of cadres like Qizhala, a former Tibetan chairman, and Liu Hui, from the Ningxia Hui region, is notable because senior positions in autonomous regions have historically been reserved for non-Han individuals to promote ethnic inclusion. Observers interpret these anti-corruption probes as a signal that ethnicity-based leniency is no longer a factor in elite politics, reflecting a broader enforcement of political discipline under the current leadership.</p>
