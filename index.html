          <p>Nvidia is set to resume selling its H20 chips to China after a U.S. export ban was eased, but it faces significant challenges. Analysts predict its AI chip market share in China will drop from 66% to 54% by 2025 due to the rise of domestic competitors like Huawei. While the policy rollback is a partial win for Nvidia, Beijing is simultaneously signaling its intent to bolster homegrown AI infrastructure and has raised national security concerns about the chips, creating a complex and uncertain future for the American tech giant in the crucial Chinese market.

          <p>Approximately 3,200 Boeing employees who build fighter jets and other military hardware have gone on strike across facilities in Missouri and Illinois. The walkout, organized by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, began after members rejected a four-year labor agreement from the company. The union stated the strike is about securing respect, dignity, and a contract that reflects their critical role in national defense. Boeing expressed disappointment, noting its offer included significant wage growth, and has activated a contingency plan to continue supporting its customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a critical opinion piece, Timothy Garton Ash argues that the Democratic party and the liberal commentariat made a grave error by not encouraging President Biden to step aside before the election. He contends it was obvious to most Americans that Biden was too old for a second term, but political insiders, fearing a loss of access and a weak alternative in Kamala Harris, failed to act. The article suggests that this refusal to confront reality, coupled with an intimidating party establishment, directly contributed to the current political situation and offers lessons for the party's future.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's pre-season tour under new manager Ruben Amorim has revealed early signs of a tactical and cultural shift, though it remains to be seen if this will translate to regular season success. Amorim has implemented a more relaxed yet responsible environment, contrasting with his predecessor's prescriptive approach, and introduced new training methods and on-field strategies. While there are positive indicators, such as improved player fitness and new attacking patterns, the article notes that the true test will come against top-tier opponents like Arsenal, determining if this is genuine progress or another false dawn for the club.</p>

          <p>Democratic legislators have left Texas in a dramatic move to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a controversial new congressional map. The Democrats argue the proposed districts are a "Trump gerrymander" designed to unfairly cement GOP power and dilute the votes of minority communities. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent lawmakers from office, citing a legal opinion, while the Democrats remain defiant. This escalates a high-stakes political battle over redistricting, disaster relief funding, and the balance of power in the state.</p>

          <p>A vessel carrying approximately 157 migrants, mostly from Ethiopia, capsized in bad weather off the coast of Yemen, resulting in at least 68 deaths.

This incident highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route from the Horn of Africa to Gulf states, which the IOM describes as one of the world's most perilous. Despite the ongoing civil war in Yemen and the frequent, deadly shipwrecks, tens of thousands continue to attempt the journey each year.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD reported its first monthly delivery decline of the year, a sign of the intense pressure from an ongoing price war in the domestic market. While BYD's shipments fell, competitors like Xpeng and Xiaomi saw continued growth, highlighting a reshuffling of the competitive landscape. The fierce competition, which has seen significant discounts across multiple brands, has even prompted warnings from Chinese policymakers to curb excessive price cutting. This shift indicates a more challenging and dynamic environment for all players in the world's largest EV market.</p>

The club's recent signings, such as Omar Marmoush and Rayan Cherki, who excel at carrying the ball, further support the theory that City is moving away from its traditional slow, positional play towards a more dynamic and vertical attacking approach.</p>

          <p>A new report from the UK-China Transparency think tank suggests that some Chinese students at UK universities are being coerced by Chinese officials into spying on their peers. The goal is allegedly to monitor and suppress campus discussions on topics considered sensitive by the Chinese government, such as the status of Xinjiang or the origins of COVID-19. The report also highlights claims of intimidation against academics and their families in China. This raises serious concerns about academic freedom and free speech on UK campuses, an issue the government says it will not tolerate.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's burgeoning biotech sector. This achievement signals a new level of maturity for firms that went public under a Hong Kong rule allowing pre-revenue companies to list. A key driver for Innovent's expected profitability is its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide, which is anticipated to generate substantial sales. This success demonstrates that Chinese biotechs are creating significant value for patients and are becoming financially self-sustaining. (not investment advice)</p>
