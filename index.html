          <p>A tragic shooting occurred during a Catholic Mass at Annunciation Catholic Church in south Minneapolis, resulting in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and injuring 17 others, including 14 children. The gunman, in his 20s, fired a rifle through church windows and later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. This deliberate act of violence marred the first week of school, prompting a large law enforcement response and widespread grief. Authorities are investigating, and a family resource center has been established to support those affected.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund-owned AI company, Humain, is investing billions to establish the kingdom as a major global AI hub, aiming to be the third-largest provider behind the US and China. Launched in May, Humain plans extensive data center construction and strategic partnerships with tech giants like AMD and Nvidia. Despite ambitious targets and significant capital investment, challenges remain in attracting and retaining top AI talent, with a 50% hiring gap in AI-related roles. The initiative seeks to diversify the economy away from oil, but faces competition from neighboring UAE and questions regarding environmental impact and skill acquisition.</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced an increase in the bonus for staff who identify passengers with oversized cabin bags, from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag, starting in November. O'Leary stated the measure is not intended to "catch people out" but to encourage compliance with baggage rules, which will also help reduce flight delays. Passengers are allowed one free small carry-on bag, with a size increase coming in September due to new EU rules. The airline charges up to £75 for larger bags, and O'Leary expressed no apology for the policy, noting only a small fraction of passengers incur extra fees.</p>

          <p>German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall inaugurated a new artillery ammunition factory in Unterlüss, aiming to become Europe's largest munitions production facility. The plant will progressively ramp up production of 155mm caliber artillery shells to 350,000 units annually by 2027, addressing critical shortages in Ukraine and for NATO members. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and German ministers attended the opening, highlighting the strategic importance of the €500 million investment. Rheinmetall has seen a significant surge in stock value and orders since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, underscoring the renewed focus on defense spending.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that recent Russian drone attacks on energy infrastructure have left over 100,000 homes without power in the Poltava, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions. Ukraine's energy ministry condemned the strikes as a continuation of Moscow's strategy to cripple civilian infrastructure ahead of winter, noting that Russia had previously destroyed half of the country's electricity-generating capacity.

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's shares rose over 8% after the restaurant chain announced it would abandon its controversial new logo and reinstate the original "Old Timer" design. The decision followed widespread criticism from social media users and even President Donald Trump, who publicly urged the company to revert. The proposed redesign, which removed the iconic character and "Old Country Store" phrase, was deemed "generic" and "soulless" by many, with conservatives accusing the brand of going "woke." The company acknowledged listening to customer feedback, emphasizing its commitment to traditional values and hospitality.</p>

          <p>Fire crews are battling a massive moorland blaze covering approximately 10 square miles on Langdale Moor in North Yorkshire, an area previously used as a World War Two tank training ground. Efforts have been complicated by over 18 explosions of unexploded ordnance as the fire burns through peat. County Chief Fire Officer Jonathan Dyson described it as a "significant wildfire," requiring a defensive firefighting strategy and national assistance. The fire has more than doubled in size due to wind and temperature changes, devastating moors and farmland, leading to some evacuations and significant community effort.</p>

          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest eligibility age, carries significant financial risks that can permanently impact retirement income. Doing so results in a permanent reduction of monthly benefits, potentially down to 70% of the full amount, which also diminishes future cost-of-living adjustments. Furthermore, individuals miss out on delayed retirement credits, which offer an 8% annual increase for each year benefits are postponed until age 70, leading to a substantial difference over time.

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer surpassed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, despite a decline in overall sales. The department store narrowed its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed slower sales to lower- and middle-income customers trading down, but highlighted efforts to revitalize the brand, including reintroducing petite sections, expanding jewelry, and overhauling discount strategies. While aiming for long-term growth, Kohl's faces ongoing leadership turmoil and financial concerns, but the recent earnings beat signals potential progress in its turnaround efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Frum and classicist Mary Beard explore the prevalent misuse of ancient Roman history in contemporary political discussions, particularly regarding comparisons to American society. They caution against simplistic analogies, emphasizing the vast differences in governance, information, and economic understanding between ancient Rome and modern democracies. The discussion highlights how fascism, as an analytical category, often resurfaces in modern forms through the "endless hunt for enemies" and the exploitation of new technologies. Beard and Frum advocate for a nuanced understanding of history, stressing that while we learn from the past, modern problems require modern solutions rather than direct historical parallels.</p>

          <p>Patients using the weight-loss drug Mounjaro are experiencing difficulties obtaining their prescriptions, raising concerns about their health, ahead of a significant price increase by manufacturer Eli Lilly. The drug's price is set to rise by up to 170% from September 1, leading to increased demand and "inappropriate stockpiling." Eli Lilly has asked UK distributors to halt new pharmacy orders, while pharmacies prioritize existing patients. The National Pharmacy Association urges patients to avoid bulk buying and unlicensed sellers, emphasizing the importance of medical supervision for alternative treatments. Many patients, including those with type 2 diabetes, are struggling to maintain their treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains what tariffs are—taxes on imported goods—and how they function, typically adding a percentage to a product's value. It details President Donald Trump's rationale for implementing widespread tariffs, arguing they boost American manufacturing, protect jobs, and reduce the trade deficit by making foreign goods more expensive. The article outlines various tariffs imposed on specific goods like steel, aluminum, and cars, as well as on imports from individual countries, often as a negotiating tactic. Critics, however, point to the volatility of Trump's trade policy, which has led to increased prices for US consumers and downgraded global economic growth forecasts.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Washington D.C. have reportedly failed to secure a felony assault indictment against Sean Dunn, who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Patrol agent. This marks a setback for the White House and Justice Department, which had publicly highlighted Dunn's arrest and the federal charge. The D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office previously faced similar challenges in indicting another individual for assaulting an FBI agent, eventually opting for a misdemeanor charge. Under the Speedy Trial Act, prosecutors have a limited timeframe to pursue an indictment, potentially leading to a misdemeanor charge or dropping the case.</p>

          <p>Poland's new President Karol Nawrocki vetoed a government bill to extend social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees until March 2026, creating a bind for Prime Minister Donald Tusk's administration. Nawrocki argues that benefits like child support should only go to Ukrainians employed in Poland, stating that Polish citizens are currently treated less favorably in their own country. This move, which some critics view as anti-Ukrainian and nationalist-aligned, risks cutting off hundreds of thousands of refugees from legal status and endangers Poland's funding for Ukraine's Starlink service. The decision also highlights internal political tensions between the president and prime minister.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, publicly urged Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to take leave from the central bank, deeming it the "honorable thing to do." This pressure comes as Cook plans to file a lawsuit challenging Trump's attempt to remove her, which her attorney describes as lacking factual or legal basis. Trump's administration defends its ability to remove a Fed governor "for cause." The dispute over Cook's removal, which the Fed confirmed she would contest, could potentially escalate to the Supreme Court, highlighting a significant legal and political battle over the independence of the central bank.</p>

She then threw the pillow out the sixth-floor window. A food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the distress call and alerted the police, leading to her rescue.

          <p>Scientists have unearthed a bizarre armored dinosaur, Spicomellus afer, in Morocco, featuring meter-long spikes protruding from its neck, earning it the nickname "punk rocker" of its time. This discovery represents the oldest known ankylosaur, dating back 165 million years, and challenges existing theories on how these armored dinosaurs evolved. The elaborateness of its armor, with spikes fused directly to bone and a bony collar, was unexpected for such an early specimen. Researchers speculate that these structures might have initially been for display rather than defense, prompting a rethinking of ankylosaur evolution.</p>
