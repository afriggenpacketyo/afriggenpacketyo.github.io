          <p>During his Senate confirmation hearing, President Trump's nominee for United Nations ambassador, Mike Waltz, pledged to "make the UN great again" by directly confronting China's growing influence within the organization. The former Florida congressman argued it is "absurd" that China is still treated as a developing nation by most UN agencies, giving it favorable status. He accused Beijing of strategically placing its personnel in key international bodies and vowed to restore American leadership and ensure the U.S. maintains a strong voice at the UN.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders expressed support for President Trump's reversal on Ukraine policy, which includes new arms sales and the threat of tariffs against Russia. However, top EU officials also voiced concerns, urging the U.S. to "share the burden" of arming Ukraine, questioning the arrangement where Europe pays for U.S.-made weapons. While welcoming the tougher stance on Moscow, some EU diplomats found the 50-day peace deadline to be too long. The development highlights a complex dynamic, with Europe seeking stronger U.S. partnership while also asserting its own strategic and financial interests.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has blocked a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed unpaid medical debt from consumers' credit reports. The ruling stated that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The decision impacts approximately 15 million Americans with about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, which can negatively affect their ability to secure loans. Consumer advocates criticized the ruling, arguing it removes protections for individuals navigating a flawed medical billing system, while industry groups praised it.</p>

          <p>An ancient Roman mosaic depicting an erotic scene, which was stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II, has been returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii. The artwork, dating to the first century, was repatriated from Germany after the heirs of its last owner contacted Italian authorities to arrange its return. The mosaic, which likely decorated a bedroom floor, is considered a work of extraordinary cultural interest. The park's director hailed the return as the healing of a historical wound and a sign of a changing mentality regarding the possession of stolen art.</p>

          <p>The West Indies cricket team was dismissed for just 27 runs in their second innings against Australia, the second-worst score in the history of Test cricket. The collapse was attributed to a combination of a bowler-friendly pitch, the high quality of Australia's top-ranked team, and a fearsome opening spell from bowler Mitchell Starc. In response to the humiliating defeat, Cricket West Indies has called an emergency meeting, inviting legendary former players like Sir Viv Richards and Brian Lara to help analyze the performance and recommend actionable steps to address the team's prolonged decline.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is actively working to bolster the U.S. supply of critical minerals and counter China's market dominance, according to a defense official. This strategy was highlighted by a recent investment making the Defense Department the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the only U.S.-based rare earth miner. The official stated that the Pentagon is exploring further opportunities to strengthen domestic production of these materials, which are essential for advanced military technology like F-35 jets and drones. The U.S. is currently heavily dependent on foreign imports, particularly from China, for its rare earth supply.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index, a key measure of inflation, rose to a 2.7% annual rate in June, marking its highest level since February. On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.3%, driven by rising costs for energy, food, and household furnishings. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, saw a 2.9% annual increase. Analysts suggest the data shows early signs of tariff impacts on consumer goods and makes an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming July meeting highly unlikely.

The incident involved Waltz adding a journalist to a private Signal group chat that discussed military operations, which led to his ouster as national security advisor. While Waltz defended his actions, stating no disciplinary measures were taken after a White House probe, some senators called the move "amateurish" and "disqualifying." Despite the scrutiny, his nomination is considered likely to advance with Republican support.</p>
