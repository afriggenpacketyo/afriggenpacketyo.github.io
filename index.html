          <h2>Trump Administration Officials Waltz and Wong Depart White House Posts</h2>

          <p>National security advisor Mike Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, are leaving their positions in the Trump White House. The departures are expected to occur on Thursday, with the White House framing it as a reorganization. Waltz faced scrutiny earlier in the year after mistakenly including a journalist in a Signal chat disclosing national security discussions about a potential military strike. Wong previously served as deputy special representative for North Korea and helped negotiate Trump's summit with Kim Jong Un. </p>

          <p>Nvidia and Anthropic are engaged in a public dispute regarding U.S. chip export restrictions to China. Anthropic, an AI startup backed by Amazon, advocates for stricter controls, claiming Chinese smuggling involves hiding chips in prosthetic devices and lobster shipments. Nvidia counters that American firms should focus on innovation rather than relying on such claims. The "AI Diffusion Rule," set to take effect May 15, imposes global export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights to prevent China from gaining an advantage in AI. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is requesting the Trump administration to implement a "tariff exclusion process" to prevent a recession and protect small businesses. The chamber's CEO, Suzanne Clark, emphasized the urgency of the situation, noting that small businesses are struggling under the weight of tariffs. The request includes automatically lifting tariffs on small business importers and products not domestically available. The White House deputy chief of staff, Steven Miller, suggested that tax cuts are the primary relief for small businesses, indicating a rejection of short-term tariff relief. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk is scrutinizing the Federal Reserve's $2.5 billion building renovation, calling the price tag "an eyebrow raiser." The project, initiated in 2021 with an initial cost of $1.9 billion, has faced rising costs due to materials, construction delays, design changes, and site issues. The Fed claims the renovation will save money by consolidating staff and improving energy efficiency, but Musk believes the cost overruns should be examined as part of broader government waste. The Fed is funded by interest on securities and fees from supervised banks, not taxpayer money. </p>

          <p>McDonald's reported mixed quarterly results, with U.S. same-store sales declining by 3.6%, the largest domestic drop since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

CEO Chris Kempczinski noted that traffic from middle-income consumers has fallen nearly as much as that from low-income consumers. To combat this, McDonald's plans to focus on value meals and popular menu items, including the return of snack wraps. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investors holding gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may encounter a higher tax bill on their profits due to the IRS classifying gold and precious metals as "collectibles." Collectibles are subject to a maximum federal tax rate of 28% on long-term capital gains, which is higher than the 20% rate for stocks and real estate. This rate applies to ETFs structured as trusts, including popular gold funds like SPDR Gold Shares and iShares Gold Trust. Investors have seen substantial profits as gold prices have risen, driven by concerns about a potential global trade war and recession. (not investment advice)</p>
