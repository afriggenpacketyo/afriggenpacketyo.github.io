          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered law enforcement to find and civilly arrest Democratic state lawmakers who fled to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan. The bill, backed by Donald Trump, could create several new GOP-leaning congressional districts, and the Democrats' absence denies the House the quorum needed to conduct business. The move has created a significant political and legal standoff, with the warrants having no legal power outside of Texas, where the lawmakers have gathered in other states.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean "Diddy" Combs' request for bail, ruling that he must remain incarcerated until his sentencing in October. The judge determined that Combs poses a flight risk and a danger to the community, citing evidence of violence, including 2016 hotel surveillance footage showing him assaulting Cassie Ventura. Combs was convicted on charges of transportation to engage in prostitution, which carries a mandatory prison sentence, making his release under "exceptional reasons" unlikely.</p>

          <p>A new pilot scheme between the UK and France has commenced, aimed at curbing small boat crossings in the English Channel.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has championed the plan as a diplomatic breakthrough, while the Conservative opposition dismisses it as ineffective.</p>

          <p>Amid an ongoing legal dispute over a voided $55 billion compensation plan, Tesla's board has approved a new, interim $29 billion stock award for CEO Elon Musk. The move is intended to motivate Musk to remain focused on Tesla as it pivots towards robotics and AI, especially as he divides his attention among several companies. This new package, still the largest of its kind by a significant margin, will be nullified if the original 2018 plan is legally reinstated after appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle surged over 20% after President Donald Trump posted on social media praising its new marketing campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ad, which had previously faced criticism from some for being overly sexualized, received a boost from Trump's endorsement, calling it the "'HOTTEST' ad out there." The event highlights the volatile intersection of marketing, culture wars, and politics, where a brand's fortunes can shift dramatically based on public and political reactions.

          <p>India's Foreign Ministry has condemned pressure from the U.S. and EU regarding its continued purchase of Russian oil, labeling threats of increased tariffs from President Trump as "unjustified." A ministry spokesman asserted India's right to secure its energy supplies and accused Western nations of hypocrisy, pointing to their own ongoing trade with Russia in various sectors. The dispute adds strain to the U.S.-India trade relationship, as Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on Indian goods in response to the oil deals.</p>
