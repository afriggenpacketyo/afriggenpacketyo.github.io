          <p>China's retail sales growth in April slowed to 5.1%, falling short of analysts' expectations and indicating ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. However, industrial output grew by 6.1%, exceeding forecasts. This data emerges amidst trade tensions between China and the U.S., though recent talks have eased some fears. Despite these challenges, global investment banks have raised their forecasts for China's economic growth this year, while paring back expectations for more proactive stimulus as Beijing strives to reach its growth target of around 5%.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing challenges in pushing President Trump's budget package forward due to disagreements among conservatives regarding spending cuts. Five Republicans voted against advancing the legislation, citing concerns about insufficient spending reductions and the timing of savings versus spending. The bill aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term while cutting Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. A group of Republicans from blue states are also threatening to withhold support if the bill does not raise the cap on state and local taxes. </p>

          <p>Investigators have identified a 25-year-old man as the suspect in the bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. The suspect, Guy Edward Bartkus, had "nihilistic ideations" and specifically targeted the clinic. Authorities are treating the bombing as an act of terrorism and are examining writings that could be related to the attack. The explosion shattered windows in businesses and homes, injuring four people, and investigators are working to determine the motive behind the bombing.</p>

Three inmates have been recaptured, and rewards have been increased to encourage valuable tips. The escape has drawn intense scrutiny, with questions raised about the time it took for officials to learn of the escape and alert New Orleans police. The inmates escaped due to "defective locks" and breached a wall behind a toilet.</p>

The project, being constructed by a state-owned Chinese company, is scheduled to be completed next year. India's threat followed a deadly militant attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir. The suspension of the treaty has left Pakistan facing water security risks, as the country relies on the Indus river system for about 80 per cent of its agriculture.</p>

Patients signing up to a GP practice, who received a blood transfusion before 1996, will be offered a test for hepatitis C. Thousands of people could have been exposed to the hepatitis C virus through contaminated blood transfusions in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. If hepatitis C goes undetected and undiagnosed there may not be any noticeable symptoms for some time and it can infect the liver and cause serious damage.</p>

The experts also say it's crucial to implement policies such as the EU's Nature Restoration law quicker and more consistently, most notably to manage forests sustainably and restore carbon-rich peatlands.</p>

          <p>According to a senior Asian economist, China’s yuan has the potential to rival a weakening US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalises convertibility and access for foreigners. China wants more international use of its centrally controlled yuan, and the currency already works fluidly in cross-border purchase settlements. To push back against the dollar, China must “deepen” its financial markets so foreigners can better access yuan-denominated stocks, bonds and other assets.</p>
