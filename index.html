            <p>Upcoming inflation data is expected to show a slight cooling in prices for March, with economists projecting a 2.6% increase compared to the previous year. This data provides a glimpse into the economy before the full impact of President Trump's recent tariff announcements, including both the paused 'reciprocal tariffs' and the increased tariffs on China. While the economy remains solid with low unemployment, analysts warn that tariffs could still drive up consumer prices and increase the likelihood of a recession by impacting consumer spending and business activity. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell previously cited Trump's tariffs as a contributing factor to earlier price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Robert Reid, the FIA's deputy president for sport, has resigned citing a breakdown in governance standards and a steady erosion of principles. Reid alleges decisions are being made behind closed doors, bypassing established structures and personnel, raising concerns about accountability and transparency within the organization. His resignation follows an open letter from MotorsportUK chairman David Richards accusing the FIA of a "shift of moral compass." The controversies surrounding FIA President Ben Sulayem, including his views on women, financial matters, and alleged interference in grands prix, contribute to the backdrop of Reid's decision, which he emphasizes is about principles rather than personalities.</p>

            <p>The UK Prime Minister is expected to announce plans for dedicated police teams patrolling town centers at peak times in England and Wales. The Labour government aims to end the policing "postcode lottery" by ensuring every community has specialist neighborhood officers and boosting police ranks by 13,000 by 2029. The government's plan for neighborhood policing involves patrols in "hotspot" areas during the busiest periods, such as on Friday and Saturday nights. The Liberal Democrats said "the proof will be in the delivery of this announcement".</p>

            <p>President Trump's social media post encouraging investors to "BUY!!! DJT" preceded his announcement of a 90-day tariff pause, leading to significant market gains. Stocks soared after the tariff pause, with the S&P 500 gaining back a substantial portion of its recent losses. Critics question whether Trump was aware of the impending tariff pause when he made the post, raising concerns about potential insider trading. Trump Media's stock also surged, benefiting from the president's promotion. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>England's Children's Commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, believes the decision to ban phones in schools should be left to head teachers, not imposed nationally by the government. A survey indicates that most schools already restrict phone use, but children are spending significant time on devices outside of school. Dame Rachel emphasizes the role of parents in setting boundaries and managing children's online activities. She supports head teachers who choose to ban mobile phones, but believes it should be their decision based on what's best for their students.</p>

The Central American country’s government quickly shot down the suggestion. The US has long participated in military exercises in Panama. The Pentagon chief’s two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the US was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing’s “threats” to the region.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices declined for a second straight month in March, while producer price deflation deepened, as Chinese exporters face increasing challenges amid escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The consumer price index slid 0.1% year on year, while producer prices fell 2.5%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, rose 0.5%. Experts anticipate a divergence between consumer and producer prices due to trade disruptions. The data signals a "potential inflection point driven by policy stimulus measures, particularly initiatives aimed at boosting consumption."</p>

            <p>Many Chinese citizens are expressing defiance and support for Beijing's response to escalating tariffs imposed by the US. The new tariffs have ignited ire across China, with many anticipating economic hardship but remaining steadfast in their support of the government's stance. Chinese surveyed by the South China Morning Post on the tariff war put forward a range of responses laden with frustration and concern, as well as defiance. Unlike the trade war in the first Donald Trump administration when Chinese people, including officials and academics, were largely divided on whether China should stand tough or strike a quick deal, the new tariffs – which have been raised to 125 per cent – have ignited ire across China.</p>

The plaintiffs believe the large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals who abuse women.
