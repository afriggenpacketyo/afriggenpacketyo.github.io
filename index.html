His attorneys challenged the legality of his detention in federal court, arguing that immigration courts are not equipped to handle constitutional claims like freedom of speech. A State Department official asserted that the administration aims to remove "terrorist-supporting aliens" and that a visa is a privilege, not a right.</p>

          <p>Construction has begun on President Donald Trump's new $250 million White House ballroom, but the identities of most wealthy donors remain undisclosed, sparking ethics concerns about potential "pay-to-play" access to the administration. Legal experts, including a former Bush White House ethics lawyer, view the funding model as problematic, suggesting corporations may seek government favors. While the White House insists the project is privately funded and will benefit future administrations, the scale of the new facility could increase opportunities for political fundraising.</p>

          <p>Modern, software-dependent cars, particularly electric vehicles, are increasingly susceptible to obsolescence as hardware struggles to keep pace with rapid software updates and AI features. The article highlights that unlike traditional mechanical cars, EVs function more like smartphones, with features routed through touch screens and relying on over-the-air updates. This raises concerns that vehicles may become functionally impaired or lose capabilities as they age out of software compatibility, potentially shortening their usable lifespan despite their inherent mechanical simplicity.</p>
