          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth led a Justice Department task force meeting to investigate alleged anti-Christian bias during the Biden administration. Bondi highlighted cases involving anti-abortion protesters and FBI memos concerning radical traditionalist Catholics, although investigations found no malicious intent in the latter. The task force also cited the conviction of an Arizona man for plotting to bomb Christian churches as a success. Bondi avoided questions about Hegseth's recent Signal chat controversy involving potentially sensitive information. Optimism score: 60</p>
