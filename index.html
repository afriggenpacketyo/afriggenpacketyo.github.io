          <p>Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are set to introduce a regulatory framework for digital assets, aiming to clarify the classification of crypto as either a commodity or a security. The proposed bill seeks to allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) oversight of digital currencies. Sens. Thom Tillis and Bill Hagerty are also supporting the legislation, which includes measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. The Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on digital assets will hold a hearing on the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

Powell acknowledged strong economic growth and a robust labor market but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. These cautious remarks come amid increased criticism from President Trump, who has publicly pressured Powell to take a different approach.

          <p>The decision to provide former Chancellor Olaf Scholz with a state-paid office and a staff of eight has drawn criticism from opposition parties in Germany, who deem it excessive. Critics argue that the allocation is an unnecessary use of taxpayer money, especially considering Scholz's relatively short tenure. Traditionally, former German chancellors and presidents receive such offices to continue serving the state, but this practice has faced increased scrutiny after controversies involving past leaders. Government officials defend the decision by highlighting Scholz's expertise, particularly regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine, which began during his time in office.</p>

Researchers estimate that cuts to health programs, including Medicaid, could lead to thousands of lost lives annually, and Medicaid recipients and advocates are warning of the negative impacts of work reporting requirements.

          <p>A new report from the European Environment Agency reveals that over 100 million Europeans are exposed to unhealthy levels of noise pollution, primarily from road, rail, and air traffic. This exposure is linked to various health issues, including cardiovascular disease, mental illness, and premature death, with children being particularly vulnerable. The report identifies road traffic as the main source of noise pollution, especially in urban areas, and calls for urgent action at both EU and national levels to reduce noise pollution and improve access to quiet, green spaces. Without additional measures, the EU is unlikely to meet its 2030 target of reducing chronic noise disturbance.</p>

          <p>A baby was born to a brain-dead woman in Atlanta after her body was kept on life support for months without the family's consent, raising serious ethical questions. Emory University Hospital cited compliance with Georgia's abortion laws, which grant full constitutional rights to an "unborn child with a detectable human heartbeat," as a factor in its decision. Experts emphasize that even after death, the ethical principle of autonomy applies, and proxy decision-makers, typically next of kin, should make decisions about withdrawing care. The case highlights the conflict between fetal personhood laws and established medical ethics, potentially leading to scenarios where doctors may feel compelled to sustain deceased pregnant women.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to rescind the "roadless rule," a nearly quarter-century-old regulation that blocked logging on 59 million acres of national forest lands. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that the rule impeded road construction and responsible timber production, which would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires. The decision marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which sought to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests. Environmental groups criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections, arguing that logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense.</p>

Reading allows one to occupy a place that is totally for oneself and unaccountable to other peopleâ€™s expectations. Literature reminds us that everyone is unexceptional and everyone is exceptional. Fiction reminds you that you exist along a continuum of human experiences, and that your own everyday ennui is less of a dead end and more of a data point.</p>
