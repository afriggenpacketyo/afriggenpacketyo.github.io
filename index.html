        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration announced it will impose an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, raising the total rate to 50%. The executive order cites India's continued purchasing of Russian oil as the primary reason for the punitive measure, which is among the highest levies on any U.S. trading partner. The move is part of a broader strategy to penalize countries supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine. India has defended its oil imports as a "vital national compulsion" and criticized Western nations for their own trade with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

The server maker's performance was partly affected by U.S. tariffs, and executives noted the situation remains dynamic.

While full-year revenue guidance was lowered from a previous forecast, it still exceeded consensus estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A USA Today columnist, Nancy Armour, has criticized President Trump's creation of a federal task force for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, which he will chair. Armour likened the move to distracting a "toddler" or "rambunctious puppy," suggesting it's a way for organizers to appease Trump and prevent potential disruptions. The task force, which includes various high-level administration officials, aims to coordinate federal efforts for the games, including transportation and visa processing. Armour argued that such direct presidential leadership of an Olympic task force is unusual for a functioning democracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to revoke Washington D.C.'s "home rule" and place the capital under direct federal control, citing uncontrolled crime. The threat followed an assault on a former member of Elon Musk's "Doge" team, who was reportedly beaten while defending a woman. Trump stated on social media that if D.C. doesn't "get its act together," he would federalize the city and called for minors as young as 14 to be prosecuted as adults. While the Constitution grants Congress authority over the district, revoking the 1973 Home Rule Act would likely require legislation and face significant political and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Brentford forward Yoane Wissa has resumed first-team training after holding constructive discussions with the club's coaching staff. The 28-year-old had previously left the team's pre-season training camp in Portugal, expressing a strong desire to secure a transfer to Newcastle for the opportunity to play in the Champions League. While talks have eased immediate tensions, Wissa still seeks a move away from the club. Brentford is reportedly open to a sale but is holding out for a higher transfer fee than Newcastle's current offer of £25 million plus add-ons.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee attorney general's office has subpoenaed four medical groups for several years of abortion records as part of a lawsuit challenging the state's near-total abortion ban. The lawsuit, brought by women and doctors, seeks to clarify the vague medical exceptions in the law. The subpoenas request extensive, though anonymized, information about abortions performed, including documents and communications related to the procedures. Reproductive rights advocates express concern that such data requests could create a "chilling effect," causing doctors to hesitate in providing even legally permissible care for fear of future prosecution.</p>

          <p>New research published in the medical journal JAMA estimates that the wildfires in Los Angeles early in 2025 led to approximately 440 more deaths than officially counted. The study analyzed mortality data during the period of the Palisades and Eaton fires, comparing it to expected numbers from previous years. Researchers suggest these excess deaths were likely caused by factors such as poor air quality exacerbating health conditions and disruptions to healthcare access. The findings highlight the broader public health impact of climate-related disasters beyond direct fatalities and call for improved mortality surveillance during such emergencies.</p>

The city's mayor warned against military buildups and urged younger generations to understand the inhumane consequences of such policies.

          <p>President Trump has been framing multi-billion-dollar investment pledges from trade partners like the EU and Japan as "gifts" or a "signing bonus" for the U.S. in exchange for lower tariffs. However, this interpretation differs significantly from how these partners view the commitments. For instance, the EU described its $600 billion pledge as an "interest" from private companies, which the government cannot enforce, rather than a direct payment. This highlights a disconnect in negotiations, with the White House warning of potential retaliation if these aspirational, non-binding commitments are not met. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For retirees on a fixed income, accessing home equity is a significant financial decision. This article explores the choice between selling a home and obtaining a reverse mortgage. Experts suggest a reverse mortgage can be a great option for those who wish to stay in their home and need supplemental income to cover rising living costs, as it provides funds without a monthly repayment obligation. However, it reduces the inheritance for heirs and comes with fees. Selling is recommended for those wanting to relocate or downsize, but market conditions and tax implications must be carefully considered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lee Castleton, a prominent former sub-postmaster wrongly pursued for missing funds due to the faulty Horizon IT system, is suing the Post Office and Fujitsu for more than £4 million in damages. Court documents reveal his claim includes past and future lost earnings, pension losses, and damages for mental distress and malicious bankruptcy. In 2007, Castleton was bankrupted after losing a legal battle against the Post Office, which he had to fight without legal representation. His legal team now alleges the original judgment was obtained by fraud and that the organizations conspired to pervert the course of justice.</p>

          <p>Tween-focused retailer Claire's has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in seven years, facing approximately $500 million in debt. The company, known for its jewelry and ear-piercing services, cited increased competition, shifts in consumer spending away from brick-and-mortar stores, and its debt obligations as reasons for the filing. Claire's stores will remain open as it undergoes reorganization and explores strategic alternatives, which could include finding a buyer. The company last filed for bankruptcy in 2018, but now faces new challenges from tariffs and savvier competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

The essay explores the psychology behind aerophobia, noting it often stems from a lack of control and can be triggered by life changes.

The funding freeze, affecting over 800 grants in areas like medicine and clean energy, stems from federal allegations that UCLA acted with "deliberate indifference" to antisemitism on campus. UC has agreed to negotiate with the administration to restore the funding, which represents more than half of UCLA's annual federal grant payments.
