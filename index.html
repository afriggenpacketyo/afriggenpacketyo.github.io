          <h2>EHRC Releases Guidance on Single-Sex Spaces Following UK Supreme Court Ruling</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 12:13:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' and 'sex' as biological. The guidance addresses the inclusion or exclusion of transgender individuals in spaces like hospitals, shops, and schools, stating that trans women (biological men) should generally not be permitted in women's facilities, and vice versa, while ensuring trans people have access to facilities. It suggests providing mixed-sex facilities where possible, and lockable single-person facilities as an alternative. The EHRC is seeking feedback on the guidance before providing an updated code of practice by the end of June.</p>

          <p>A special tribunal is being planned to prosecute Russia's aggression in Ukraine, but faces obstacles including immunity for heads of state like Vladimir Putin. While investigations are underway, no arrest warrants can be issued against high-ranking officials unless their immunity is lifted. The tribunal's scope regarding the timeline of the conflict is also debated, with some arguing it should include events from 2014, not just the 2022 invasion. Political will and financial support, particularly from the US under President Trump, remain uncertain, potentially delaying or derailing the process.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is urging Americans to properly dispose of unused prescription medications instead of flushing them down the toilet. He emphasizes that flushing medications can contaminate the water system, potentially exposing people to harmful substances. While some opioid medications are safe to flush according to the FDA's "Flush List," most should be taken to designated drop-off sites, like those set up by the DEA for National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. The DEA promotes the event as a way to prevent medication misuse and opioid addiction.</p>

          <p>Recent polls indicate that Americans, including some Republicans, are losing faith in President Trump, with many describing his second term as "scary." The polls reveal low approval ratings on issues like the economy and immigration, with only a small percentage believing Trump is focused on the right priorities. A majority of voters disapprove of Trump's performance, and concerns are growing about his trade policies and workforce cuts. The negative reviews suggest growing fatigue among Americans after a period marked by financial market instability and deportations.</p>

          <p>Under President Trump, student loan forgiveness opportunities are narrowing. The Biden administration's SAVE repayment plan is unlikely to survive, and a U.S. appeals court has already blocked it. The Education Department is now arguing that the ruling requires it to end loan forgiveness under repayment plans beyond SAVE. Public Service Loan Forgiveness remains intact, but changes to the program are possible. Federal student loan borrowers are still entitled to other forgiveness opportunities, such as the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A conscious parenting coach argues that the phrase "you're okay," often used to comfort children, can be damaging to their emotional development. It teaches kids to doubt their emotions, invalidates their experiences, and short-circuits emotional processing. The phrase can also condition children to believe they must suppress their emotions to be accepted, rewiring their stress response and making it harder to trust and regulate their feelings.</p>
