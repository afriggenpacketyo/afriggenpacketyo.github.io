          <p>Driven by internet culture and social media trends, the Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words, including viral terms such as 'skibidi,' 'delulu,' and 'tradwife.' Lexical managers noted that the internet is having a fascinating effect on the evolution of the English language and that new entries are selected based on their perceived staying power. The new additions reflect modern phenomena, from online slang popularized by Gen Z to terms like 'mouse jiggler' that emerged from remote work culture during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Washington D.C. for a meeting with President Trump, Russia launched deadly drone strikes on Ukrainian cities. An attack on Kharkiv killed seven people, including a toddler and a teenager, which Ukrainian officials described as a deliberate message from Vladimir Putin that he has no intention of ending the war. The attacks underscore the ongoing violence and targeting of civilians, occurring even as high-stakes diplomatic talks are underway.</p>

          <p>A new study from Bankrate indicates that the average American's wages have lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points since the pandemic began, diminishing purchasing power. The report highlights that educators are among the professions falling furthest behind, while workers in leisure and hospitality have seen pay growth outpace rising costs. This persistent wage gap helps explain ongoing public dissatisfaction with the economy, as many households continue to struggle with the cost-of-living crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims of election rigging in the 2020 presidential election. The settlement follows a similar, larger payout by Fox News and avoids a jury trial where the network's malice could have been determined. Despite the payment, Newsmax maintained in a statement that its coverage was fair and balanced, even as court documents revealed internal doubts about the fraud claims.</p>

          <p>With two weeks remaining in the summer transfer window, Premier League clubs have already spent £2.26 billion on new players, putting them on pace to break the previous record of £2.36 billion set in 2023. The spending by English top-flight clubs dwarfs that of other major European leagues combined, with a net spend of over £1 billion more than they have received in sales. The data highlights the immense financial power of the Premier League, where multiple clubs have broken their own transfer records. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 'great resignation' trend has reversed, with consultants now describing a phenomenon of 'job hugging,' where employees are clinging to their current roles amid economic uncertainty. The rate at which workers voluntarily quit their jobs has fallen to its lowest consistent level in nearly a decade, reflecting decreased confidence in the ability to find new employment. This stagnation is attributed to a cooling labor market, slower job growth, and fewer openings, making workers more risk-averse than in recent years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts recommend that investors utilize dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a simple yet powerful way to benefit from compound interest. Instead of receiving dividend payouts as cash, a DRIP automatically uses the funds to purchase more shares of the same stock, often including fractional shares. Over the long term, this strategy can dramatically increase total returns, as demonstrated by the S&P 500, which saw significantly higher growth with dividends reinvested compared to price appreciation alone.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age for a senior to take out a reverse mortgage is typically in their late 60s to early 70s, though there is no single 'magic age.' This timing often represents a sweet spot where homeowners are more certain about their plans to age in place and have a clearer picture of their long-term income needs. The amount of equity that can be accessed increases with age, so waiting can allow for a larger loan, but the decision should ultimately be based on individual financial circumstances and goals.</p>
