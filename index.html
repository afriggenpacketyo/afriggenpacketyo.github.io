            <p>Three Indian and two Chinese students have initiated legal action against the Trump administration, challenging the termination of their F1 visas. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, alleges that the government's actions have caused severe financial and academic hardships for international students, who make up a large portion of the student body in the US. The students argue that the government failed to provide adequate notice before revoking their legal status, and that they may face deportation and visa cancellation. The Trump administration's tightening of student visa policies has sparked widespread concern among international students, universities, and advocacy groups.</p>

            <p>Dozens of police officers in Tonawanda, New York, are facing fines for allegedly participating in an unauthorized labor strike during a period of heavy snowfall this past winter. The police union president, Andy Thompson, disputes the allegations, stating that officers showed up to work and performed their duties, but that the fines are retaliatory after the town lost money due to a decrease in traffic citations issued during the snowfall. Union representatives call the fines unprecedented and an abuse of power, claiming officers are being punished for not meeting ticket quotas, which are illegal under New York law.</p>

            <p>The article explores the ethical concerns surrounding the use of snail slime in beauty products, highlighting the normalization of this practice despite questions about the snails' treatment. While the industry assures consumers that snails are well-cared for, reports suggest that some extraction methods involve stressful and even harmful procedures. The author questions the consumer's willingness to overlook these ethical issues in pursuit of youthful skin, noting that the demand for snail slime products continues to rise despite concerns from animal welfare organizations. The article also speculates on the future of the industry, suggesting that it may eventually shift to synthetic alternatives or discover new secretions from other animals.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of violating the announced "Easter truce" by continuing military actions in some areas of Ukraine. Despite Putin's order for a ceasefire, Zelenskyy reported 387 shellings and 19 assaults by Russian forces in the first six hours of the truce. Zelenskyy stated that Ukrainian forces are responding appropriately to enemy actions and reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce for 30 days. While the fighting continues, both Moscow and Kyiv are attempting to demonstrate a commitment to peace to Washington.</p>

The author argues that Trump's approach is a form of identity politics disguised as a challenge to "woke" beliefs, and that it undermines the principle of hiring the most qualified candidate. The article also raises questions about the feasibility and implications of implementing affirmative action for conservatives in universities, suggesting that such policies could exacerbate the problems they aim to solve.</p>

Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are allowed to ripen on the tree before being collected, which appeals to Chinese consumers. Steady supply and improved logistics have contributed to a surge in durian exports to China this year, with suppliers projecting a 30% increase in exports.
