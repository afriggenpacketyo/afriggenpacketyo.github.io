          <p>A stampede at the annual Shri Lairai Zatra festival in Goa, India, resulted in the deaths of six people and injuries to over 50 others. The incident occurred during a religious ceremony at the Sree Lairai Devi temple, attended by tens of thousands of devotees from Goa and neighboring states. Police are investigating the cause of the stampede, which happened despite a significant security presence. Political leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have extended condolences, and the state government has promised support to the affected families. Optimism score is 10.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tim Friede, a US man who has been deliberately injecting himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the development of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests, offering a potential universal antivenom. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's antibodies target common elements in toxins, and his motivation was to develop better therapies for victims of snakebites worldwide, which cause up to 140,000 deaths annually. The new antivenom cocktail has shown success in protecting mice against fatal doses from most of the deadliest snakes.</p>

          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is experiencing a significant drop in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and mainland China. The museum, home to Chinese art and artifacts, saw visitor numbers plummet from 6.14 million in 2016, with 3.32 million from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, to just 2.87 million in 2024, with only 50,000 from those regions. The decline is attributed to deteriorating cross-strait relations, political factors, and changes in tourism policies. The museum director aims to attract 3.5 million visitors in 2025, regardless of cross-strait travel conditions.</p>

Haney, who won against Jose Ramirez in an earlier bout, appeared cautious after being dropped three times by Garcia in their previous fight. Romero secured the win with a double left hook that floored Garcia, who struggled to recover and launch his signature left hook. The fight was described as cautious, with a low number of punches thrown, and Garcia admitted the year-long break affected his performance.</p>

          <p>Representative Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat from New Jersey, suggested the possibility of impeaching President Donald Trump for a third time if Republicans gain control after the 2026 midterms. During a campaign event, Sherrill, who is running for governor of New Jersey, emphasized the need to challenge oneself and fight against divisive tactics. She referenced her previous votes to impeach Trump and highlighted the importance of federalism and state-level challenges to potential federal overreach. Sherrill's remarks come as Representative Shri Thanedar filed articles of impeachment against Trump for alleged high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

          <p>Ryan Garcia's year-long break from boxing proved detrimental as he lost to Rolando Romero by unanimous decision in New York.

Romero's victory earned him the World Boxing Association welterweight championship, marking his third title in his career. Garcia attributed his loss to the time off and mental struggles, while Romero expressed his ambition to fight for championships, not just money.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and centralizing political power under the Communist Party. Led by party chief To Lam, the reforms include merging ministries, closing state-run media outlets, and eliminating around 100,000 public sector jobs. These changes are expected to streamline bureaucracy and redirect resources toward economic development, while also addressing dysfunction caused by the party's anti-corruption campaign. Some analysts believe that these measures also strengthen To Lam's position ahead of the 14th National Congress in 2026.</p>

This tariff, following a similar tax on imported cars, aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing, but analysts predict higher costs for businesses and consumers. While some companies have reported sales surges due to concerns about price hikes, General Motors expects billions in new costs.

The new government has ceased funding and dissolved the agency overseeing the project, with the site now a large, water-filled hole. Critics argue the funds could have been better used to address Ghana's economic challenges, and the project has become a target of the new government's anticorruption initiative.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, which is expected to increase prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. While the Trump administration claims the tariffs will boost domestic manufacturing, experts say consumers will bear the brunt of the costs. Exemptions for parts from Canada and Mexico, as well as a two-year reprieve on some duties for US-based manufacturers, offer some relief. However, the tariffs create uncertainty and could drive some suppliers out of business, leading to parts shortages.</p>

          <p>Rising sea levels threaten South Africa's coastlines, but new research suggests that drought and water loss due to climate change are causing parts of the country to lift out of the ocean. Researchers from Germany believe that drought may be causing parts of South Africa to lift out of the ocean by two millimeters each year. The study points to groundwater loss as the primary driver, with the land becoming lighter during droughts and rising up. While this may offer a buffer against rising sea levels, experts caution against optimism, as it comes at the expense of water resources.</p>
