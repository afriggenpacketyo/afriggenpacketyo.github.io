        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently passed bill in Washington state, SB 5232, has sparked controversy as it could potentially allow undocumented immigrants to receive housing assistance under the Housing and Essential Needs Referral Program (HEN). The bill removes the requirement that recipients be citizens or lawfully admitted aliens. Critics, like Republican state Sen. Leonard Christian, warn this could strain resources and prioritize non-citizens over legal residents, especially with the state facing a significant budget shortfall. The bill awaits Governor Ferguson's signature, with no clear indication of his decision. </p>

          <p>President Trump has finalized an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to establish a 10-mile artificial intelligence campus in Abu Dhabi, which will be the largest such project outside the United States.

While some experts express concerns about potential risks due to the U.A.E.'s authoritarian government and ties to China, the Commerce Department asserts the U.A.E. is committed to safeguarding advanced A.I. technologies.

          <p>Mediterranean chain Cava reported better-than-expected sales in its latest fiscal quarter, driven by a 10.8% increase in same-store sales. This growth is attributed to increased traffic and higher spending on premium items. While other restaurants report cautious consumer behavior, Cava is seeing diners trade up from fast food and down from casual dining. Despite the positive results, Cava reiterated its conservative same-store sales forecast of 6% to 8% for the year, leading to a slight dip in stock value after hours. </p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill banning the addition of fluoride to drinking water, making Florida the second state after Utah to do so. This decision goes against the advice of public health experts and medical professionals, who argue that fluoridation prevents tooth decay, particularly in children. The law aligns with the views of Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, who claim fluoride negatively affects intellectual abilities. DeSantis defended the bill as protecting against forced medication, arguing that individuals can choose fluoride through toothpaste and mouthwash. </p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill in the House, aimed at enacting President Trump's agenda, does not include a provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, despite Trump's prior promises. The exclusion is due to rules preventing changes to Social Security through the reconciliation process. Instead, the bill offers seniors an additional $4,000 deduction, which could lower taxes for some. Experts note that eliminating taxes on Social Security would negatively impact the program's long-term stability, potentially leading to earlier depletion of trust funds and automatic benefit cuts. </p>
