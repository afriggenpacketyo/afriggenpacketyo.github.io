        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has rescinded its 2022 marketing denial order for Juul, permitting the company to resume sales of its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products. Regulators stated that a review of new scientific evidence and litigation has placed Juul's application back under consideration, though it does not guarantee final authorization. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from anti-tobacco advocates, who hold Juul responsible for sparking the youth vaping crisis, even as the company no longer sells the fruit flavors that were most popular with teens.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's social media post claiming he persuaded Coca-Cola to use cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup caused shares of producer Archer-Daniels-Midland to fall. In response, Coca-Cola issued a noncommittal statement about upcoming innovative offerings, while its own stock saw a modest gain. The Corn Refiners Association reacted by warning that such a switch could threaten thousands of American manufacturing jobs and negatively impact farm income, highlighting the significant economic consequences of the unconfirmed change.

          <p>An Israeli airstrike has struck the Holy Family Catholic Church compound in Gaza City, which was serving as a shelter for displaced civilians, resulting in three deaths and several injuries. The Israeli government expressed deep regret over the incident, stating it is under investigation and that its forces do not intentionally target religious sites. The attack has drawn widespread condemnation, including from Pope Leo who called for an immediate ceasefire, further escalating international pressure and regional tensions amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in New York known for her work on the Ghislaine Maxwell and Sean "Diddy" Combs cases, has been abruptly terminated by the Department of Justice.

This action has intensified concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department, especially given its timing amid renewed controversy over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files.</p>

          <h2>UK Food Watchdog Warns Slushy Drinks Unsafe for Children Under Seven</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued new guidance advising that children under the age of seven should not consume shop-bought slushy drinks due to health risks associated with glycerol. This sweetener, used to create the slushy texture, can cause headaches, sickness, and, in some cases, shock or loss of consciousness in young children. The FSA also recommends that children aged seven to ten limit their intake to one small slushy per day and has called for warning labels at points of sale.</p>

The proposed legislation would empower the FTC and state attorneys general to prosecute offenders and require large companies to publicly justify significant price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>
