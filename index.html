          <p>American tennis player Taylor Townsend, ranked outside the top 100 in singles, secured a significant victory at the US Open by defeating No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva. The win propels her into the fourth round for the first time since 2019 and marks her third career victory over a top-10 opponent. The match followed a controversial week for Townsend, who spoke out about representation and being true to oneself after a previous opponent made disparaging remarks. Her performance is seen as a testament to her resilience, especially given past conflicts with the USTA over her fitness.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to expand fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, across the entire country. The ruling cites significant due process concerns, stating that the government must provide proper legal procedures for the large group of people living in the interior who would be affected. Previously, the policy was limited to recent arrivals near the border. This decision represents a major setback for the administration's immigration enforcement agenda, though it is expected to be appealed by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic advanced to the fourth round of the US Open after defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie in a four-set match. Despite struggling with a lower back injury that required a medical timeout, the 24-time Grand Slam champion fought back to secure the victory and end British singles participation in the tournament. Norrie, who has now lost all seven encounters with Djokovic, acknowledged being slightly overconfident after briefly gaining an advantage. Djokovic praised his own serve, which he noted has become a crucial weapon in his game as he gets older.</p>

Kim is accused of involvement in a stock manipulation scheme and receiving illicit funds and valuables. Concurrently, former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was also indicted for his role in abetting the martial law attempt, deepening the political turmoil in the country.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a "massive attack" on Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region, with explosions reported in the cities of Dnipro and Pavlograd. This escalation comes as Russian troops recently entered the region, which had previously been spared from heavy fighting. Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un publicly praised the "heroism" of his country's soldiers who were killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine. Estimates of North Korean casualties vary, with Seoul suggesting around 600 deaths while Western intelligence places the number at over 6,000.</p>

          <p>China has strongly criticized Japan's plan to deploy the U.S.-made Typhon missile system for the first time during joint military exercises next month.

Analysts interpret the move as a strategic signal from Tokyo and Washington directed at China, particularly concerning a potential conflict over Taiwan. The Typhon system is scheduled to be stationed at a U.S. base in Yamaguchi prefecture only for the duration of the military drills.</p>

          <p>A political battle over congressional redistricting is intensifying, with California and Texas at the forefront. After Texas Republicans passed a new map to create five more GOP-favored seats, California's Democratic lawmakers countered with a plan to redraw their state's districts to add five Democratic seats, aiming to nullify the Texas move. This mid-decade redistricting arms race, encouraged by President Trump, is spreading to other states like Missouri, as both parties seek to gain an advantage in the House of Representatives ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

The trial has produced several viral moments on social media, with clips of the rapper's animated testimony and facial expressions being widely shared. During cross-examination, she faced questions about her wigs and fingernails, which some observers criticized as potentially biased. Cardi B testified that the encounter was a "verbal fight" that did not become physical, stating she was concerned for her unborn child at the time.</p>

          <h2>Illinois Governor Describes Potential Federal Troop Deployment to Chicago as an 'Invasion'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned a reported plan by the Trump administration to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential deployment an "invasion." Pritzker stated that the administration has not communicated with his office about the plan and suggested President Trump has ulterior motives beyond fighting crime, possibly related to influencing future elections. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker for deflecting from the city's crime crisis. This follows similar deployments of federal agents and National Guard troops in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>Millions of dollars in television advertising are set to begin airing for California's upcoming special election on Proposition 50, a ballot measure that would redraw the state's congressional districts. The measure, championed by Democrats, aims to counter a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas and potentially shift control of the U.S. House. The campaign opposing the measure, backed by a coalition including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has already booked over $10 million in airtime, signaling an expensive and intense political fight ahead of the November vote.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will cut $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that had already been approved by Congress. The White House is using a rarely utilized procedural move known as a "pocket rescission" to bypass lawmakers and withhold funds for 15 international programs near the end of the fiscal year. The move has been criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans, with Senator Susan Collins calling it illegal. Democratic leaders warned that the action undermines bipartisan negotiations and increases the likelihood of a future government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens are now limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines in certain states, in some cases requiring a prescription, to comply with varying state guidelines. The move follows the FDA's approval of new vaccines for all seniors but only for younger individuals with specific health conditions. For example, CVS stated it cannot provide the vaccine even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico due to state laws. The changing regulatory landscape creates a patchwork of accessibility across the country for the latest COVID-19 immunizations.</p>

The movie deliberately presents an ambiguous narrative, casting doubt on both versions of events. Roberts defended the film's approach, stating the goal is to challenge audiences and provoke conversation about complex issues, acknowledging that it will infuriate some while engaging others.</p>

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine indicates that preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication without first trying behavioral therapy, contrary to clinical guidelines. The research, which examined nearly 10,000 health records, found that 68% of children aged 3 to 5 with an ADHD diagnosis were given drugs, with 42% receiving a prescription within just 30 days. Experts note that while medications can be helpful, behavioral intervention should be the first line of treatment due to potential side effects in young children, such as irritability and emotional problems.</p>
