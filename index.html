          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 against the Trump administration, granting a request from Venezuelan nationals to block their removal from the United States under the Alien Enemies Act. The court stated that the Trump administration had not provided the detainees enough time or resources to challenge their deportations. The ruling bars the removal of the men, alleged to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, pending a new decision from a lower federal appellate court. The court acknowledged the Venezuelans' interests are "particularly weighty."</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the government's increasing debt. Moody's expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by increased interest payments, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation. Despite the downgrade, Moody's changed its outlook on the U.S. from negative to stable, recognizing the country's economic strengths and the Federal Reserve's effective monetary policy. The downgrade came as the House Budget Committee rejected President Trump's domestic policy bill, which would extend tax cuts from his first term.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead woman in Georgia has been kept on life support for three months to allow her fetus to develop, a decision her family attributes to the state's abortion ban. Doctors have reportedly told the family they cannot remove life support because the state law bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. The fetus is reported to have fluid on the brain, raising concerns about its health after birth. Bioethicists question the legality of requiring life support in such cases, highlighting the uncertain legal status of fetuses since the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill has stalled in the House of Representatives due to Republican infighting over budget cuts. The bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, failed to advance through the House budget committee. Key disagreements include the extent of budget cuts, particularly to Medicaid, and the proposed tripling of a local tax deduction. Some Republicans want steeper cuts to avoid increasing the national debt, while others oppose cuts to Medicaid, fearing it would harm lower-income constituents.</p>

          <p>Man City boss Pep Guardiola has voiced his unhappiness with the scheduling of the Bournemouth game after the FA Cup final. Guardiola suggested his side have been chosen to play FA Cup semi-finals on a Saturday so often because broadcasters feel there are "more followers" for the Sunday game, adding, "They are tired to see us." It is why Guardiola thinks there should have been a greater willingness to nudge back City's game after the demands of a cup final.</p>

The fire devastated the structure, which was used as a museum and event venue.

The mansion's owner, Louisiana attorney Dan Dyess, said in a written statement that the fire had led to a "total loss" after all the time and money he invested in the building.</p>
