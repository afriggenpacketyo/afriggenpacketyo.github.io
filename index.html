          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses America's renewed interest in Greenland, driven by its strategic location and the Arctic's changing geo-economics. With the Arctic warming rapidly and Russia expanding its presence, Greenland's proximity to both Russia and the U.S. East Coast makes it a critical territory. The author suggests the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland could adopt a "Compact of Free Association" model, similar to agreements in the Pacific, to balance U.S. interests with international concerns, fostering stability and avoiding sovereignty conflicts among NATO allies. The article also notes the potential for intensified tensions within NATO if U.S.-Russian cooperation in the Arctic increases following a Ukraine deal.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports on Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow, a grand celebration of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, attended by leaders from over 20 countries. President Putin uses the event to showcase Russia's past glories and justify the war in Ukraine, with participation from countries in the "global south" as a counterweight to the West. The parade is expected to be the largest since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with the presence of foreign dignitaries serving as a measure of allegiance to Russia. Ukraine has increased attacks on Moscow leading up to the event, while Zelensky has rejected Putin's proposed ceasefire.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the challenges facing the offshore wind industry, particularly in the United States, where a construction halt has disrupted projects like the Empire Wind farm off Long Island. The pause has shocked companies like Welcon in Denmark, which was preparing to supply turbine towers. The article notes that the wind industry took a hit after the pandemic due to higher interest rates and inflation, and now relies on Europe to offset pullbacks in the U.S. Despite these challenges, some companies like Vestas and Orsted are reporting positive financial results, though their share prices remain down from the previous year.</p>

          <p>This article covers the Karen Read trial, focusing on testimony from a Massachusetts State Police sergeant who initially suggested John O'Keefe might have been struck with a bar glass, contradicting the prosecution's theory that Read killed him with her car. The sergeant acknowledged informing the medical examiner of this possibility early in the investigation. The defense questioned the thoroughness of the crime scene investigation and whether key witnesses were truthful about O'Keefe entering a residence before his death. The article also mentions evidence recovered at the scene, including a broken glass and O'Keefe's missing sneaker, as well as Read's broken taillight.</p>

          <p>This BBC article summarizes newspaper headlines, focusing on a new US-UK trade deal and the selection of a new Pope. The trade deal, hailed as "historic" by both sides, aims to reduce tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, particularly on the car industry. However, some papers note the deal's limited scope and that Britain is still in a worse position than before. The article also mentions the selection of Leo XIV as the new Pope and his message of building bridges, as well as commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a surprising surge in April, despite a significant drop in shipments to the U.S. due to increased tariffs. Overall exports jumped 8.1%, while imports declined slightly by 0.2%. Shipments to the U.S. specifically plummeted by over 21%. Experts suggest the export surge may be due to transshipments through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were implemented. The Chinese government is attempting to help exporters redirect sales to the domestic market, which could lead to deflation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with Britain, which aims to reduce the impact of tariffs and provide a political win for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal includes increased access for U.S. agricultural products to the U.K. market, while Britain will have a quota of 100,000 vehicles subject to a 10% tariff. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expects the deal to generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. The U.K. aims to reduce or eliminate U.S. import taxes on cars and steel, while the U.S. seeks greater access to the British market for agriculture.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% year-on-year in April, defying expectations of a slowdown despite increased tariffs from the U.S. Economists suggest this resilience may be due to transshipment through other countries and pre-tariff trade contracts. However, trade data is expected to weaken in the coming months, pending trade negotiations between China and the U.S. President Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, prompting China to retaliate with duties of up to 125% on American goods.</p>

While both sides are touting the agreement as a positive step, analysts note that the benefits for the US may be limited. The 10% import tax announced by Trump remains in place, and the deal primarily involves rolling back import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. Experts suggest the deal may be more about Trump securing a political victory than achieving substantial economic changes.</p>
