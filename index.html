        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norwegian oil company Equinor has committed nearly $1 billion in fresh capital to support Danish offshore wind developer Orsted. This move signals confidence in the renewable energy sector despite the Trump administration's recent actions against offshore wind projects, including canceling federal funding. Equinor, Orsted's second-largest shareholder, intends to maintain its 10% stake and nominate a board member, a decision seen by some analysts as a strategic step in a challenging political environment for green energy. The support comes as Orsted's stock has faced significant decline following US policy shifts.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is experiencing a rise in the detention of journalists, raising alarms among media rights watchdogs ahead of the country's 2026 general election. Recent cases include the temporary disappearances of two journalists, part of a broader trend that has seen Ethiopia's press freedom ranking fall significantly. Despite initial reforms under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, groups like Reporters Without Borders state that laws are being weaponized against the media, creating an atmosphere of self-censorship. This crackdown extends beyond its borders, with reports of the government targeting critical journalists in exile.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from sending dozens of unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The emergency injunction was sought by advocacy groups who argued the children would face danger and that the move violated laws protecting minors who arrive alone in the U.S. While the administration framed the flights as a family reunification program requested by Guatemala, the judge's 14-day order covers all unaccompanied children at risk of deportation. The decision highlights the ongoing legal and political battles surrounding U.S. immigration policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine, the Trump administration has refrained from imposing its most severe potential sanctions on Moscow. Analysts suggest this hesitation stems from two key factors: President Trump's desire to position himself as a peace broker and a strategic fear of pushing Russia into a deeper alliance with China. A complete economic isolation of Russia could grant Beijing unprecedented access to Russian energy, military technology, and Arctic resources, strengthening China's global position. This complex geopolitical calculation appears to be overriding calls for more punitive measures against Vladimir Putin's government.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has expressed significant concern over President Trump's pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve, calling it a "very serious danger" to the global economy. Lagarde emphasized that the independence of a central bank is crucial for economic stability, and any political interference could have worrying worldwide effects given the U.S. economy's size.

          <p>The growth rate for UK house prices has slowed to 2.1% in the year leading up to August, according to data from lender Nationwide. This cooling market coincides with reports that the government is exploring significant changes to property taxes, such as stamp duty and council tax, ahead of the Autumn budget. Experts suggest that while the housing market remains challenging for many buyers due to high prices relative to income, potential reforms and further interest rate cuts could provide some relief. The average UK home price currently stands at £271,079, reflecting persistent affordability issues for prospective homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the Scottish government-owned train operator, has permanently scrapped higher fares for travel during peak weekday rush hours. This policy makes tickets on busy routes, such as Edinburgh to Glasgow, nearly 50% cheaper, aiming to incentivize commuters to choose trains over cars for environmental and economic benefits. The move follows a pilot scheme and is expected to cost between £40 million and £45 million annually, a cost that will be covered by the ScotRail budget if not offset by increased passenger numbers.

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News argues that Labor Day should honor American workers' ingenuity rather than the political power of union leaders. The author contends that modern unions rely on government-granted coercive powers, such as forcing workers in non-right-to-work states to pay dues or be fired. The piece criticizes legislative proposals like the PRO Act, which would repeal state Right to Work laws and promote "card check" organizing over secret ballots. The author contrasts this with the views of early labor leaders like Samuel Gompers, who advocated for voluntarism over compulsion.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian authorities have announced they suspect Russian involvement in the murder of Andriy Parubiy, a former speaker of Ukraine's parliament. Parubiy was shot and killed in the western city of Lviv on Saturday in what President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called a "horrific murder." The head of the national police stated the crime was carefully planned and not accidental, with a suspect, disguised as a courier, now in custody. Parubiy was a prominent figure in the 2014 pro-European protests and served as secretary of the National Security and Defence Council during Russia's annexation of Crimea.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Announce Stricter Rules for Asylum Seekers Bringing Family Members</h2>

          <p>The UK Home Secretary is set to announce a tightening of the rules for migrants who have been granted asylum to bring their families into the country. The new criteria are expected to include tougher English language requirements and proof of sufficient funds for family members. This policy change is part of a broader government overhaul of what it calls a "broken" asylum system, which aims to reduce the reliance on housing migrants in hotels. The move comes as the government faces criticism over the number of small boat crossings, though it also highlights increased efforts to disrupt people-smuggling networks.</p>

          <p>The final stage of England's largest-ever expansion of funded childcare support has begun, offering working parents 30 hours of government-paid childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. While the government hails this as a landmark moment to help families with costs, the rollout faces significant challenges. Parents are encountering long waiting lists for nursery places, and providers warn that staff shortages and insufficient government funding rates are limiting their capacity. This has created a difficult situation where the promised support is not always accessible for those who need it.</p>

          <p>Scientists from Tarim University have discovered brine shrimp, an ancient species dating back 400 million years, in a highly saline water source in the Taklamakan Desert. Also known as Artemia, these shrimp are extremely salt-tolerant and are widely used in aquaculture as feed, as well as in medicine and cosmetics. The discovery in the city of Aral suggests the region has natural conditions suitable for cultivating such organisms. Researchers will now conduct studies to determine if it is a new species and explore its potential for developing a local aquaculture industry.</p>

          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, killing approximately 800 people and injuring over 2,500, according to the Taliban government. The quake hit late Sunday in Kunar province, near the border with Pakistan, causing extensive damage to homes and infrastructure, many of which are poorly constructed. Rescue efforts are underway, but are hampered by the remote, mountainous terrain as survivors frantically search through rubble for missing loved ones. This is the deadliest natural disaster to hit the country since a quake in October 2023, compounding the nation's ongoing humanitarian challenges.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has withdrawn its subpoena compelling former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify, a committee spokesperson confirmed.

Chairman James Comer had subpoenaed Mueller, who served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013, as part of the committee's investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case, believing he had relevant information from his time leading the bureau.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old boy in Houston has died after being shot while playing a "ding dong ditch" prank with friends on Saturday night. According to police, the boy was running from a house when someone chased him and shot him in the back. The child was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. This tragic incident is one of several recent cases where doorbell pranks, sometimes popularized by social media challenges, have escalated into violence.

          <p>China continues to revere the American Volunteer Group, known as the "Flying Tigers," a group of American mercenaries who defended the country against Japan before the U.S. entered World War II. In a sign of this enduring bond, relatives of the group's founder are among the few American guests invited to Beijing's military parade commemorating the war's end. Hired by China in 1941, the pilots and support staff were credited with destroying hundreds of Japanese planes, providing a crucial morale boost and tactical advantage. Despite current US-China tensions, the legacy of these American fighters remains a celebrated part of Chinese history.</p>
