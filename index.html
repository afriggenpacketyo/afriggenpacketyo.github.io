        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump criticized Vladimir Putin's recent intensification of attacks on Ukrainian cities, expressing disapproval of the violence and suggesting potential additional sanctions against Russia. Trump, who has often emphasized trade benefits for Russia if it ceased hostilities, stated that Putin's actions could lead to Russia's downfall. He also had harsh words for Ukrainian President Zelensky, accusing him of exacerbating the situation with his statements. The remarks follow a major Russian drone and missile barrage on Ukraine, resulting in numerous casualties, and Trump's stance signals a shift from his previous alignment with Russia in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's recent criticism of both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Russia and Ukraine continued their long-range cross-border drone attacks. Ukrainian officials reported engaging targets across the country, while Russia claimed to have downed 128 Ukrainian drones. Trump's frustration with his inability to resolve the conflict was evident in his remarks, as he expressed disappointment with Putin's actions and criticized Zelenskyy's statements. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov acknowledged Trump's assistance in organizing negotiation processes, while Ukrainian officials cited the ongoing attacks as evidence that Moscow's appeals for peace are insincere.</p>

          <p>President Trump participated in a Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and delivering remarks. In a message posted on Truth Social, Trump wished a "happy Memorial Day to all," including those he described as "scum" who have tried to undermine the country. He also targeted immigration policies and criticized judges he accused of protecting criminals, which diverges from the somber tone typically associated with honoring fallen soldiers. The president also declared new national holidays to commemorate the end of World War I and World War II in Europe, although Veterans Day already exists for a similar purpose.</p>

          <p>Sexual orientation is a complex trait determined during puberty through an interplay of biological and psychosocial factors, according to experts. It is not a choice but rather a stable aspect of identity that develops in adolescence, influenced by hormones and personal preferences. Researchers have explored genetic, hormonal, and sociocultural factors to understand its development, finding no single cause. The diversity of human sexuality is a fundamental aspect of human nature, and sexual orientation is not a disease or unnatural, but societal norms often lead to exclusion and persecution of non-heterosexual individuals.</p>

          <p>Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, argues that the Democratic party's reliance on seniority is detrimental and advocates for younger leaders who are more open to change. She emphasizes the need for open conversations about retirement among older Democrats and the importance of primaries in developing stronger candidates. Litman believes that the current political climate requires leaders who can communicate the urgency of the situation and that millennials and Gen Z leaders can bring fresh perspectives to politics. Her new book, "When We're in Charge," explores how younger leaders can improve workplaces and become better citizens.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy, marking a significant change for the airline and its customers. Starting Wednesday, passengers will be charged to check bags, a departure from the airline's tradition of offering this perk. This move comes as baggage fees generate substantial revenue for U.S. airlines, and Southwest aims to increase its revenue streams. In addition to charging for checked bags, Southwest is also introducing basic-economy tickets and eliminating open seating, aligning with industry trends.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that invasive alien plants and animals have cost Europe over $1.5 trillion in the last six decades, significantly higher than previous estimates. The research assessed data on 162 invasive species, including the Asian tiger mosquito and Japanese knotweed, and their economic impact on various countries. The UK had the highest estimated costs, and the study highlights the need for increased awareness and management of invasive species. The monetary cost of biological invasions is now on a similar scale to the global costs of extreme weather attributable to climate change.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker best known for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," has died at the age of 97. The film challenged the myth of widespread French resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II, interviewing ordinary citizens who either collaborated with the Nazis or turned a blind eye to the persecution of Jews. Despite controversy and initial bans, "The Sorrow and the Pity" became a landmark film, paving the way for revisionist accounts of wartime France.

The industry's growth is crucial for meeting rising power demand and integrating renewable energy sources, but uncertainty surrounding trade policy and tax incentives is causing concern among businesses.

          <p>The executive branch is using the language of the law to claim compliance with court orders while actually defying them, a practice termed "legalistic noncompliance." This involves deploying specious legal arguments to conceal pervasive defiance of judicial oversight, lowering public awareness of noncompliance and potentially wearing down the courts. Examples include the Alien Enemies Act, where the administration argued it had complied with orders despite not turning planes around. This strategy may also lead to "legalized noncompliance," where courts issue rules allowing the administration to appear compliant while doing little to carry out rulings.</p>
