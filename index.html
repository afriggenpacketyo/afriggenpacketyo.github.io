          <p>China initiated large-scale military exercises near Taiwan, issuing a stern warning against Taiwanese independence.  These drills, involving the army, navy, and rocket forces, are seen as a response to Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's administration.  The exercises follow increased military cooperation between the U.S. and countries in the region aimed at countering China's influence.
