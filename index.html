This case highlights ongoing tensions in U.S. immigration policy, as Abrego Garcia had previously been granted legal status protecting him from removal due to gang threats.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity showed surprising growth in June according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, which rose to 50.4 from 48.3 in May. This result contrasts with the official government PMI that indicated a third consecutive month of contraction, highlighting a divergence between smaller, export-focused firms and larger state-owned enterprises. The expansion is partly attributed to exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs, though analysts question if this momentum is sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A family in North Carolina fears they may have to ration treatments for their six-year-old daughter, who has a rare genetic condition, if proposed federal Medicaid cuts become law. The Beaver family relies on a state Medicaid waiver program to cover over $4,000 in monthly medical costs not covered by their private insurance. State officials warn that the proposed legislation, part of a larger bill, could lead to significant funding shortfalls, potentially jeopardizing specialized programs and affecting many of the state's 3 million Medicaid recipients.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident in Long Beach resulted in the death of one adult and a dog after a group of three adults and a four-year-old child ended up in the Los Angeles River on Sunday. Fire department crews rescued three of the individuals from the water near Anaheim Street, with one adult and the child being transported to a trauma center for treatment. It remains unclear how the group entered the water, but the incident occurred near a low-head dam, a structure known to create dangerous hydraulic conditions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's sudden cancellation of two pandemic-era grant programs has created significant challenges for both food aid organizations and the local farmers who supplied them. These programs provided about $1 billion for food banks and schools to purchase fresh produce directly from small farms, supporting local agriculture while feeding underserved communities. Now, nonprofits report being unable to serve as many people, and farmers who expanded operations to meet demand are facing devastating financial losses.</p>
