          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations. The agreement would reportedly involve selling the business to a group of American investors, including Oracle, allowing the app to continue operating in the U.S. while licensing algorithm technology from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. However, statements from Chinese state media and ByteDance were less definitive, highlighting ongoing negotiations and the critical issue of who will control the powerful content algorithm. The leaders also plan to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea to discuss trade and other issues.</p>

          <p>A short-term government funding bill passed by the Republican-led House failed to advance in the Senate, leaving no clear path to avoid a shutdown before the October 1 deadline. The GOP measure, which would extend funding until November 21, was blocked by Senate Democrats who cited a lack of negotiation on their priorities, particularly healthcare. With both chambers now in recess, the stalemate increases the likelihood of a funding lapse. President Trump acknowledged the possibility of a shutdown, while congressional leaders from both parties blamed each other for the impasse, with no immediate plans for further negotiation.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the system to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but anticipate it will remain over open waters for the next several days. The storm's current projected track carries it north of the Caribbean islands and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the system could pass east of Bermuda early next week, potentially bringing some impacts to the island as it continues to intensify over the ocean.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, resigned from his position amid pressure from the Trump administration to file criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources indicated that President Trump wanted Siebert fired after investigators failed to find sufficient evidence of mortgage fraud against James, a frequent political rival of the president. The investigation into James began after a criminal referral from the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Siebert's departure leaves a leadership vacuum in a key prosecutor's office and has drawn criticism as a politically motivated attack on the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz sharply criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Brendan Carr for threatening ABC's broadcast license over comments made by host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz described Carr's warning to the network as "dangerous as hell" and compared it to a mob shakedown, stating it was "right out of Goodfellas." While Cruz expressed his personal dislike for Kimmel's remarks about the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, he warned that the government regulating media content sets a perilous precedent that could ultimately harm conservatives. President Trump publicly disagreed with Cruz's assessment, defending the actions of his FCC appointee.</p>

The judge did not rule on the merits of the case but gave Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more professional and concise complaint.

          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and the FCC Chairman to revoke broadcast television licenses have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC. These broadcasters use public airwaves and are required to obtain licenses from the FCC, which mandates they operate in the "public interest." While this clause is typically invoked for issues like obscenity or children's programming, the current administration is using it to challenge what it deems biased political coverage. Experts note that revoking a license is a complex process involving investigations and legal challenges, making the current threats an unprecedented use of regulatory pressure.</p>

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy reflected on his long-running role as Tommy Shelby in "Peaky Blinders," calling the experience of playing the character for a quarter of his life a "privilege." While promoting his new film "Steve," Murphy confirmed a "Peaky Blinders" movie is forthcoming from Netflix but kept plot details confidential. He emphasized that he is very different from the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed, a role he says has been defining for his career. The success of the show, which concluded in 2022, allowed him the freedom to pursue diverse projects, including his Oscar-winning performance in "Oppenheimer."</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement agents deployed tear gas and pepper balls to disperse around 100 demonstrators outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Chicago. The protesters, including two congressional candidates, were attempting to block government vehicles during a major immigration crackdown dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz." At least three people were arrested during the clashes, which saw masked agents in riot gear fire projectiles from a rooftop. The Department of Homeland Security defended the action on social media, while Illinois's lieutenant governor, who was present earlier, condemned the response as a "violent abuse of power."</p>

          <p>A key U.S. vaccine advisory committee has voted to stop broadly recommending the annual COVID-19 vaccine for all adults, shifting its guidance to a model of individual decision-making in consultation with a medical professional. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), recently reconstituted with members appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also narrowly voted against requiring a prescription for the vaccine. The panel's new recommendations, which must be approved by the CDC director, have sparked concern and confusion within the medical community about potential impacts on vaccine access and public trust.</p>

          <p>UCLA has released new, formalized rules for campus protests that both align with and diverge from demands made by the Trump administration. The guidelines ban unauthorized demonstrations in Royce Quad, the site of a 2024 pro-Palestinian encampment, but expand other free speech zones and continue to allow pre-approved overnight events, which the White House wants prohibited. The rules were announced as the university faces a federal threat to pull hundreds of millions in research funding over its handling of past protests. University officials maintain the policies are content-neutral and represent best practices, not a reaction to political pressure.</p>

Created by producer Justin Alexio, the weekly event provides a platform where performers can connect with an appreciative audience over shared food and culture. In a competitive scene where Latinx comics often struggle for stage time, the show allows them to joke about the immigrant experience and other relatable topics. The event has grown from a monthly gathering to a sold-out weekly fixture, building a strong sense of community for both performers and attendees.</p>

Cramer also discussed specific corporate earnings, expressing optimism for AutoZone and cautioning about Micron's recent stock run. He suggested that despite some investor skepticism, the market rally could continue, as traditional indicators of a peak have not materialized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Estonia has requested an urgent Article 4 consultation with NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes over the Gulf of Finland. The Estonian government condemned the incursion as a "brazen" and "extremely dangerous provocation," summoning Russia's chargé d'affaires in protest. NATO jets from Italy, Finland, and Sweden were scrambled to intercept and escort the Russian aircraft, which had their transponders off and no flight plan. This marks the second time in a week a NATO member has invoked Article 4, which triggers formal consultations within the military alliance.</p>
