          <p>Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton has pleaded not guilty in a Maryland federal court to an 18-count indictment for unlawfully retaining and disseminating national defense information. Prosecutors allege that during and after his tenure, Bolton abused his position by sharing over a thousand pages of classified, diary-like entries with his wife and daughter. This indictment is viewed by critics as part of a broader campaign of retribution by President Trump against his perceived political adversaries, following recent charges against other high-profile figures. Bolton maintains his innocence, asserting the charges are politically motivated and distort the facts of his conduct.</p>

          <p>After maintaining a presence for over 60 years, CBS News has closed its workspace in the Pentagon, joining most major news organizations in refusing to sign new press requirements. The Pentagon's new policy mandates that journalists obtain formal authorization before publishing any information, including unclassified material, a move that press associations argue infringes on First Amendment rights. Veteran correspondents like David Martin and Bob Schieffer lamented the loss of access, stating that their constant presence in the building was crucial for building trust and breaking stories. Despite turning in their credentials, CBS News journalists have affirmed their commitment to continue covering the military.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing government shutdown persists as Democrats express deep-seated distrust in President Trump, preventing the formation of bipartisan negotiating groups, or "gangs," that have resolved past stalemates. Lawmakers state that any agreement reached would be meaningless, as the president has a history of disregarding such deals, citing a collapsed bipartisan immigration proposal as a key example. While Republicans insist on reopening the government before any talks, Democrats demand an "ironclad path forward" on key issues like healthcare subsidies. This lack of trust has created a significant obstacle, prolonging the shutdown with no clear end in sight.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor found herself in a surreal position while investigating the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski, as the case led back to her small Pennsylvania hometown. The central figures included her former high school classmate Heather Snyder, who was Shymanski's ex-wife, and Snyder's boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, who was convicted of the murder. In an exclusive interview, Snyder denied any involvement despite being the only known link between the victim and the killer. The case, which saw Holbrook sentenced to life without parole, highlights the personal and professional complexities the reporter faced while covering a story so close to home.</p>

          <p>For individuals with delinquent credit card debt, wage garnishment is a serious consequence where a creditor, after winning a court judgment, can legally take a portion of one's paycheck. Federal law limits this garnishment to the lesser of 25% of disposable income or the amount by which weekly earnings exceed 30 times the federal minimum wage. However, many states offer stricter protections, with some, like Texas and Pennsylvania, largely prohibiting wage garnishment for unsecured debts. To avoid this outcome, consumers can negotiate directly with creditors, work with debt relief companies, enter a debt management plan, or consider bankruptcy as a final resort.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC All-America Economic Survey indicates a decline in President Trump's economic approval rating, now at a net negative of -13, the lowest of his presidency according to the poll. The survey attributes this drop to public concern over inflation, job security, and the ongoing government shutdown, for which a majority of respondents blame the president and congressional Republicans. The data also reveals significant disapproval of his policies on the cost of living and tariffs, with independents showing a particularly negative shift in sentiment as their economic confidence wanes.

          <p>The Open Society Foundation, founded by billionaire George Soros, is a significant financial backer of the nationwide "No Kings" protests against President Trump, organized by the group Indivisible.

The connection is further highlighted by Indivisible's co-director's past work with Tom Perriello, a former executive director at Open Society.

          <p>While national overdose fatalities have been declining, Alaska is experiencing a renewed surge, particularly in the Matanuska-Susitna borough.

Harm reduction organizations and local residents are working to distribute naloxone and provide support, especially for Indigenous Alaskans, who are disproportionately affected. However, these vital support networks are often disrupted by municipal actions like clearing homeless encampments, which can make a dangerous situation even more precarious.</p>

Delphine, a 33-year-old nurse, disappeared from their home in December 2020 amid a contentious divorce where she had started a new relationship. Prosecutors successfully argued that even without a body, sufficient circumstantial evidence—including a neighbor hearing screams, a broken pair of glasses, and incriminating statements to his mother—proved his guilt. Convictions for murder without a body are rare, relying on jurors having an "intimate conviction" that a crime was committed.</p>

          <p>A Munich court has fined Petr Bystron, a European Parliament member for Germany's far-right AfD party, €11,250 for using symbols of unconstitutional organizations. The conviction stems from a 2022 social media post where he shared a photo collage showing former Chancellor Angela Merkel and others with raised arms in poses the court ruled resembled a banned Hitler salute. Bystron, who denies wrongdoing and claims the case is political, faces separate, more serious allegations of bribery and money laundering linked to a pro-Russian media outlet. This verdict comes as other AfD figures have also been convicted for using banned Nazi-era slogans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates, home equity loans are emerging as a more advantageous borrowing option compared to credit cards for significant financing needs. Currently, average home equity loan rates are around 8.3%, nearly three times cheaper than the average credit card rate of 22%, and offer the stability of a fixed rate. Furthermore, home equity loan rates are expected to fall more significantly in response to future Fed cuts, unlike variable credit card rates. With record-high home equity levels, homeowners can also access much larger sums of money than typical credit card limits would allow. (not investment advice)</p>

Having failed to secure a win in his first seven games, Postecoglou delivered a five-minute monologue asserting his legacy as a winner, pointing to his recent Europa League victory with Tottenham. He criticized the perception that he is a "failed manager," arguing that his track record at all previous clubs has consistently ended with winning trophies. Postecoglou vowed to replicate that success at Forest if he is given the necessary time to implement his vision.</p>

The controversial project, located near the Tower of London, has faced opposition over security concerns, including the potential for espionage on the nearby financial district and the risk of attracting large protests.
