          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. The company's enhanced detection methods, including auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, contributed to the rise in flagged submissions. Tripadvisor identifies four categories of fake submissions: boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews, with boosting and member fraud being the most prevalent. The company is continuously working to improve its technology to combat fake reviews, employing AI and behavioral biometrics to identify patterns and penalize violators. The article stresses that rooting out fake reviews is a constant "cat and mouse" game.</p>

          <p>President Trump has agreed to extend the deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union to July 9, following a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen stated that the EU and the US share a close trade relationship and require additional time to reach a satisfactory agreement. Trump had previously threatened to impose the tariffs, expressing frustration with the pace of trade negotiations with the EU. The EU has also prepared retaliatory measures against the US, but these have been put on hold pending negotiations.</p>

          <p>A Republican senator has indicated that there is sufficient resistance within the Senate to potentially stall President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill" unless significant modifications are made. Senator Ron Johnson expressed concerns that the bill increases the deficit and urged deeper spending cuts to pre-pandemic levels. The bill, which was narrowly passed by the House, faces further challenges in the Senate due to disagreements over raising the debt ceiling. Speaker Johnson defends the bill as a pro-growth investment and emphasizes the need for expedited passage to provide relief to the American people. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to rule on the cases of two former City traders who were jailed for rigging interest rates, raising concerns among senior politicians about potential miscarriages of justice. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were among 37 traders prosecuted for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks. Evidence emerged suggesting that central bankers and government officials pressured banks to engage in similar conduct on a larger scale, yet no central banker or government official was prosecuted. The Supreme Court's decision could lead to the overturning of all remaining convictions and renewed calls for a public inquiry into interest rate "rigging."</p>

The dispute arose from a disallowed goal, with the referee's early whistle preventing VAR intervention. Match of the Day pundits and Aston Villa's captain criticized the decision, citing the significant impact on their Champions League qualification hopes. Law 12 states that a goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball with the hand when the ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface or by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper has made a save.</p>

Trump had threatened to impose 50% tariffs on goods entering the US from the EU, reigniting fears of a trade war. The agreement provides a window for further negotiations between the two powers.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd’s murder, the Black Lives Matter movement faces a backlash, with the politics of “white grievance” championed by President Trump. The Justice Department has abandoned oversight agreements for police forces accused of racial bias. A Pew Research Center study found that most Americans believe the increased focus on race did not improve Black lives. The movement's popularity has declined, though support remains among a slight majority. The article notes, however, that change is never fully rolled back, and the police reform movement has had lasting impacts.</p>

          <p>An emotionally safe parenting style emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. This approach involves accepting emotions without judgment, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents focus on self-awareness and inner healing to become less reactive. By setting boundaries with empathy and preventing shame, parents create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves.</p>
