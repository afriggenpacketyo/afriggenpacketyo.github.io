          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts a record number of 18-year-old domestic students will secure their first-choice university placement, even if they narrowly miss their A-level grades. This flexibility stems from universities seeking financial stability from three-year UK undergraduates due to a decline and increased uncertainty in international student enrollment. Consequently, fewer spots are expected to be available through the clearing process, as more initial offers are likely to be accepted.</p>

          <p>The quantity of vacant homes in England is steadily increasing, with over 700,000 properties now empty, including more than 264,000 classified as long-term vacant. This trend exacerbates the national housing shortage and creates problems for local communities, such as attracting crime and pests, as exemplified by a case in Bristol. Housing charities and local councils are calling for stronger government powers to bring these properties back into use, highlighting them as a wasted resource amid rising homelessness.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4.0%, marking the fifth reduction since the previous August and bringing borrowing costs to a two-year low. This move would lower mortgage repayments for some homeowners but would also result in diminished returns for savers. The decision comes despite UK inflation rising to 3.6%, as signs of a cooling employment market could help temper future price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italy has approved the construction of the Strait of Messina Bridge, a $15.5 billion project that will connect Sicily to the mainland and become the world's longest suspension bridge. The project, which has been debated for decades, is designed to handle 6,000 cars per hour and 200 trains daily. Despite its approval, the bridge faces significant opposition due to concerns over environmental impact, potential co-opting by organized crime, and the region's seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Following an attempted carjacking and assault on a former government staffer, President Trump announced he is considering taking federal control of Washington, D.C.'s police force. Trump stated he might deploy the National Guard and that his administration's lawyers are studying the possibility of overturning the city's home rule, which has granted it limited self-government for 50 years. While violent crime in D.C. has recently declined, the incident has provided a political opportunity for Trump to act on his long-stated criticisms of the city's management.</p>

          <p>New archaeological research indicates that survivors of the AD 79 Mount Vesuvius eruption, along with other settlers, returned to live in Pompeii. Evidence suggests a "precarious" settlement, akin to a camp, existed among the ruins until the 5th century. These inhabitants likely lived in the upper floors of buried structures, scavenging for valuable materials in the devastated city. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned, revealing a previously overlooked chapter of Pompeii's history.</p>

          <p>England all-rounder Chris Woakes has been lauded for his courage after choosing to bat during a critical moment in a Test match against India, despite suffering a suspected dislocated shoulder. With England needing 17 runs to win and only one wicket remaining, Woakes emerged with his arm in a sling, prepared to bat left-handed to protect the injury. Although he did not face a ball, he ran four crucial runs before his partner was dismissed, with Woakes stating he "wouldn't have been able to live with himself" if he hadn't tried.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. suggests that the true death toll from the January Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles County may be significantly higher than official counts. Researchers estimate there were 440 more deaths than typically expected during the period, compared to the 31 officially attributed to the fires. These "excess deaths" likely resulted from indirect causes such as poor air quality and disruptions to healthcare services, highlighting the broad and often undercounted public health impact of climate-driven disasters.</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old woman prompted an emergency response after she became stuck inside the chimney of a storage building at a San Fernando recreation park. Los Angeles fire officials spent over an hour freeing her, after which she was taken to a hospital in fair condition. In a strange turn of events, the same woman was arrested the following morning when she returned to the park and was caught attempting to climb back onto the same roof.

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings, new and historical photos show the stark contrast between the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and the thriving metropolises they are today. The article recounts the dropping of the "Little Boy" and "Fat Man" bombs, which led to Japan's surrender and the deaths of approximately 210,000 people by the end of that year. It serves as a solemn reminder of the only time nuclear weapons have been used in warfare, juxtaposing the cities' tragic past with their resilient recovery.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty announced that its net income fell by 30% in its fiscal first quarter, a drop the company attributes to new tariffs on Chinese goods. The cosmetics brand, which sources about 75% of its products from China, saw its profit fall to $33.3 million. Citing the volatility and uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, the company declined to provide a full-year financial forecast, highlighting the significant impact of trade policy on its bottom line despite beating revenue and earnings expectations.

          <p>This article analyzes the potential returns on a $10,000 deposit in either a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a money market account in the current interest rate environment. While both offer similar high rates now, the CD provides a fixed, guaranteed return, making it a more predictable option. Given that interest rates are expected to be cut later in the year, the variable rate of a money market account will likely decline, making a 6-month CD the potentially higher-earning and more secure choice for savers.

          <p>Florida Power & Light (FPL) has petitioned state regulators for a nearly $10 billion rate hike over the next four years, a move advocates claim would be the largest in U.S. history. FPL argues the increase is necessary to ensure grid reliability, diversify energy sources, and cover the costs of new solar and battery facilities. However, environmental and consumer groups are pushing back, arguing the hike would exacerbate the state's affordability crisis and disproportionately funnel profits to shareholders rather than primarily benefiting customers.</p>

          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking shoe on the shore of Fish Lake, Utah, has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing in 1997. The shoe was a specific model made in 1996, which helped investigators link it to the cold case. White had disappeared during a solo fishing trip, and his boat was found empty at the time. DNA testing confirmed the remains were his, providing long-awaited closure for his family and the original searchers.</p>
