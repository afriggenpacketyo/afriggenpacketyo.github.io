          <p>Financial experts weigh in on suitable annuity options for seniors amidst market volatility and increasing lifespans. The article outlines four types of annuities: immediate, fixed indexed, deferred income, and variable, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages.

Deferred income annuities provide higher payouts later, and variable annuities offer market exposure but come with higher risk and fees. Seniors should consult a financial advisor to determine the most appropriate annuity for their financial circumstances (not investment advice).</p>
