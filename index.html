          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell engaged in a public disagreement over the cost of the central bank's headquarters renovation during a presidential visit. While pressing Powell to lower interest rates, Trump also stated that he does not believe it is necessary to fire the chairman, stepping back from earlier threats. The tense interaction highlights the ongoing friction between the administration and the independent central bank over monetary policy and operational oversight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has sued New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The lawsuit follows the shooting of a border patrol officer by an undocumented immigrant and highlights federal officials' frustration with policies they claim release criminals onto the streets. The Adams administration has expressed that while it supports the laws' essence, they may go too far regarding violent offenders.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is undergoing a significant reorganization that will force thousands of Washington D.C.-based employees to relocate or face salary reductions. The plan aims to reduce the department's federal footprint by moving offices to cities like Kansas City and Raleigh, consolidating services, and eliminating management layers. Critics warn this will weaken support for farmers, disrupt critical services like wildfire response, and lead to a mass loss of experienced staff.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a rescissions bill that claws back $9 billion in previously approved federal funding. The legislation, passed by Congress, targets approximately $8 billion from foreign assistance programs like USAID and $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The move was contentious, with some lawmakers expressing concern over the lack of detail on specific program impacts before voting on the package.</p>

          <p>A persistent heat dome that has brought dangerously high temperatures to the central U.S. is now moving east, with over 130 million Americans under heat alerts. Many areas in the Midwest have experienced feels-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees for several days. Forecasters note that the phenomenon known as "corn sweat" in the Corn Belt has exacerbated the humidity, as vast fields of corn release thousands of gallons of water vapor into the atmosphere daily.</p>

          <p>American Airlines' stock dropped significantly after the carrier issued a third-quarter profit forecast below expectations and reduced its full-year 2025 financial outlook. The CEO attributed the weaker performance to a combination of consumer softness, stagnant corporate travel demand, and operational disruptions from storms. While domestic demand has been a weak spot, the airline noted that demand appears to be improving for the coming months and it plans to scale back capacity growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued an order that temporarily blocks a federal appeals court decision that would have severely limited the Voting Rights Act. The lower court's ruling had claimed that private citizens could not bring lawsuits under the act, effectively neutralizing it in seven states by leaving enforcement solely to the Justice Department. While the block is temporary, it signals that a majority of the court is not prepared to completely dismantle the landmark civil rights law.</p>

The case involved an encounter in a hotel room in 2018, and the judge determined that the prosecution could not meet the burden of proof. The high-profile case has been through years of police and league investigations, and all five players, some of whom were in the NHL, have been on indefinite leave.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes how the Trump administration's approach to migrant family separation has evolved into a less visible, more bureaucratic process. Instead of physically separating children at the border, the current strategy involves dismantling systemic protections for minors, such as cutting funding for legal aid and making it harder for relatives to sponsor them. These changes can lead to children being detained for longer periods, creating a new form of separation and deterrence away from public view.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional. Citing a recent Supreme Court precedent, the majority opinion stated the law "meaningfully constrains" Second Amendment rights and is not consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. The ruling is a significant blow to the state's gun control efforts, though it is not yet clear if the state will appeal the decision.</p>
