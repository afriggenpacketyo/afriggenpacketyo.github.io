          <p>Chicago Cubs legend and Baseball Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg has passed away at the age of 65 after a prolonged battle with cancer. Remembered as a model of consistency, Sandberg was a 10-time All-Star, nine-time Gold Glove winner, and the 1984 National League MVP. His career was celebrated for both his exceptional defensive skills and his offensive prowess, including a famous 1984 game-tying home run that cemented his legacy. The Cubs recently unveiled a statue in his honor outside Wrigley Field, celebrating his profound impact on the team and the sport.</p>

          <p>At least 34 people have been killed by severe flooding and heavy rains in and around Beijing, with most fatalities occurring in the city's outlying districts. The storms have forced the evacuation of over 80,000 residents as authorities grapple with record rainfall, which caused landslides, power outages, and significant infrastructure damage. A major reservoir released water to prevent a larger disaster, and officials have warned residents to avoid rising rivers. This event highlights the region's vulnerability to extreme weather, echoing the severe flooding experienced in 2023.</p>

          <p>This article profiles the challenging journey of Indian cricketer Akash Deep, who recently achieved a five-wicket haul against England. Hailing from a small village in Bihar, he overcame significant personal tragedy, including the deaths of his father and brother, which forced him to temporarily abandon the sport to support his family. After relocating to Bengal, his raw talent was recognized, and with mentorship, he honed his skills, eventually earning a spot in the IPL and the national Test squad. His recent on-field success is dedicated to his sister, who is battling cancer.</p>

This shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to diversify its manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainties.

          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines experienced their largest single-day drop since 2024 after the company reported a 59% plunge in its first-quarter net profit. The decline was primarily attributed to lower interest income and significant losses from its stake in Air India, which is undergoing a complex restructuring. While the airline noted that demand for air travel remains strong, analysts expressed concern over Air India's financial drag and normalizing operating margins as competition increases. The results have led some investment banks to downgrade the stock, citing weaker cargo demand and rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Uribe, a polarizing figure credited by some for stabilizing the country but criticized by others for human rights abuses, faces up to 12 years in prison.

This move follows various local initiatives and comes as China faces the reality of being one of the world's most expensive places to raise a child.

While Israel has announced daily "tactical pauses" in fighting to secure aid routes, desperate residents have been seen looting convoys. The U.N. is calling for at least 500-600 trucks of basic supplies daily to avert a deepening humanitarian catastrophe for the territory's two million displaced people.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Issues Guidance Permitting Federal Employees to Discuss Religious Beliefs at Work</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has issued new guidance affirming the right of federal employees to engage in religious expression in the workplace, including attempting to persuade colleagues of their beliefs. The memo from the Office of Personnel Management states that workers can discuss religion, display religious items, and invite coworkers to services, as long as it is not harassing. While the policy notes that employees must stop if asked, critics like the Freedom From Religion Foundation have called it an unconstitutional move that encourages proselytizing and could lead to pressure on subordinate staff and the public.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a new peace plan and humanitarian aid strategy for Gaza. This follows a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and weekend discussions with French and German leaders, signaling a renewed European-led diplomatic push. The move comes amid warnings of mass starvation in the territory and growing domestic pressure on the UK government to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The proposed plan aims to provide immediate relief and establish a pathway toward a sustainable two-state solution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a judicial misconduct complaint against federal Judge James E. Boasberg, escalating a conflict over the administration's deportation policies. The complaint alleges the judge made improper public comments questioning whether the Trump administration would comply with court orders, thereby undermining the judiciary's integrity. This action follows Judge Boasberg's ruling that blocked deportation flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador and his subsequent finding of probable cause for contempt of court against the administration. The complaint seeks an investigation and the case's reassignment.</p>

          <p>School districts across the U.S. are facing the loss of critical mental health resources due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of millions in federal grant funding. The Department of Education cited concerns that grant recipients were using funds for race-based initiatives, a claim disputed by program administrators. In states like Connecticut, the cuts could lead to the dismissal of dozens of counselors and social workers, leaving students in underserved rural areas without access to essential mental health services. Sixteen states are now suing the administration over the funding cuts.</p>

          <p>A video has surfaced showing the violent arrest of an 18-year-old U.S. citizen in Florida by immigration agents, sparking scrutiny over expanded state law enforcement roles in immigration crackdowns. In the footage, an officer tells the teenager, Kenny Laynez, "You got no rights here. You're an amigo, brother," before he is detained. The incident occurred during a traffic stop where two of Laynez's coworkers were undocumented. Advocacy groups argue the event highlights the severe consequences of deputizing more local officers for immigration enforcement, leading to rights violations.</p>

This artifact is described as the only known stone carving from the Qin unification period that remains at its original site. The finding offers a potentially significant glimpse into the emperor's activities and reach shortly after he unified China over two millennia ago.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is being analyzed, with some economists suggesting the deal is unbalanced and will negatively impact the EU's economy. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a significant increase, while U.S. goods exported to the EU will face no tariffs. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American manufacturing and exports, some analysts believe the EU accepted unfavorable terms to avoid a worse trade war. The agreement does, however, reduce some uncertainty that was stalling markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent meeting in Scotland between UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.S. President Donald Trump provided the British leader with invaluable, direct access to his American counterpart. The interactions, which included a free-wheeling press Q&A, highlighted the unique and often unpredictable nature of Trump's diplomacy. For Starmer, this proximity offers a chance to build a solid relationship but also carries the risk of being associated with the president's off-the-cuff style. Downing Street appears to view the access as a net positive, particularly in aligning views on critical issues like the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking an injunction that would allow him to play in the upcoming football season. After the NCAA denied his waiver request for a sixth year of eligibility, Wingfield is challenging the organization's "Five-Year Rule" on antitrust grounds. The lawsuit argues the denial is unreasonable given disruptions from the pandemic and a season-ending injury, and that it prevents him from a significant NIL opportunity and career advancement. The outcome of the case could have a major impact on USC's already thin offensive line for the 2025 season.</p>
