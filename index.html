          <p>A 57-year-old British tourist, Donna Jobling, is in intensive care in Greece after contracting Legionnaires' disease while on an all-inclusive holiday in Crete. She developed a chest infection on June 5, leading to acute respiratory failure and pneumonia, and is currently stable but under constant watch at Venizeleio Hospital. EasyJet Holidays has moved other customers from the hotel as a precaution, while the Greek health ministry has issued a statement to hoteliers in Crete to raise awareness about Legionella bacteria in water systems. An emergency alert has been issued on the island by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control following the diagnosis. Optimism regarding her recovery is cautiously balanced against the severity of her condition.</p>

          <p>Jobe Bellingham scored on his first start for Borussia Dortmund in a Club World Cup match, inevitably drawing comparisons to his older brother Jude. The 19-year-old scored 45 minutes into his debut, showcasing anticipation, poise, agility, and ruthlessness. The goal in Cincinnati involved timing his run perfectly and cushioning the ball away from his marker before firing past the goalkeeper, albeit with a slight deflection. This performance capped a fine display on his full debut and is something the former Sunderland midfielder has been working on, highlighting his potential and skill.</p>

          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war has commenced with further strikes on an Iranian nuclear research facility, prompting Iran's foreign minister to warn against U.S. intervention. Israel's defense minister claimed the military killed three senior Iranian commanders, including one who allegedly financed Hamas. The U.S. State Department confirmed that several U.S. citizens were lightly wounded in an Iranian missile strike. B-2 stealth bombers have been deployed to Guam, potentially equipped to strike Iran's nuclear program, as the conflict escalates and Israel continues its operations against Hamas in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas casinos are quietly laying off dealers due to declining tourism and increasing automation. Visitor volume in Las Vegas dipped 7.8% year-over-year in March 2025, leading to reduced gaming revenue and hotel occupancy. The introduction of electronic table games and broader economic uncertainty contribute to the job cuts. Senator Jacky Rosen warns of the devastating trickle-down effect on small businesses and the local economy, while analysts link the decline to evolving U.S. travel policies and affordability concerns.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston struck down a policy change that could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding. The universities argued the move threatened critical work in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, semiconductors and other technology fields. Talwani deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, protecting essential research projects.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles, asserting the Trump administration believes a military deployment is still necessary. He alleged Newsom and Bass "egged on" violence during immigration protests and mistakenly referred to Sen. Alex Padilla as "JosÃ© Padilla." Newsom and Bass criticized Vance's remarks, with Newsom calling the misnaming "not an accident". The incident underscores ongoing tensions between the administration and California officials over immigration policies and federal deployments.</p>

          <p>The city of Pasadena canceled swimming lessons and other recreation programs at three parks due to concerns about potential immigration enforcement by federal agents. The decision was made after social media posts showed federal enforcement activity near Villa Parke. The cancellations at Villa Parke, Robinson Park, and Victory Park were done out of an abundance of caution to avoid potential conflict. The announcement follows recent detentions by federal agents at a bus stop near Villa Parke, which drew criticism from local politicians.</p>

Experts are closely watching whether the bombers will move to a U.S.-British military base on Diego Garcia, which is ideally positioned for operations in the Middle East.</p>
