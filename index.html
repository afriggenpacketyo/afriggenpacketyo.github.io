          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, has been inaugurated as Poland's new president. His narrow election victory could steer the country on a more nationalist path, creating potential friction with the centrist government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk. In his inaugural speech, Nawrocki affirmed his commitment to NATO and the EU but vowed to resist any transfer of Poland's sovereign powers to the European bloc. His presidency raises questions about the future of Poland's domestic and foreign policy, given his traditionalist values and controversial political rise.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals a significant gap between parents' confidence in paying for college and the reality of tuition bills, with many feeling unprepared once costs are finalized. College expenses have consistently outpaced inflation, with some institutions now costing over $100,000 annually. Families primarily cover these costs through income, savings, and student loans, though many underutilize key resources like the FAFSA and 529 savings plans. This growing financial strain is causing some students to reconsider higher education altogether, highlighting a critical affordability crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent walkout by Texas Democratic legislators to block a Republican-led redistricting effort is part of a long state tradition of "breaking quorum" dating back to 1870. This tactic, where lawmakers flee the state to prevent a legislative vote, was notably used in 2021 to stall an election bill and in 2003 against another redistricting plan. While past walkouts have had mixed success and faced threats of arrest, they have served as a powerful tool for the minority party to halt proceedings. A new law implemented in 2023 now imposes a $500-a-day fine on absent lawmakers to discourage future quorum breaks.</p>

          <p>A movement of "AI vegans" is emerging, composed of individuals who abstain from using artificial intelligence due to ethical, environmental, and personal wellness concerns. The article draws a parallel to dietary veganism, noting that practitioners are often vocal about their choice to avoid AI, which they argue harms critical thinking and relies on exploitative labor. The technology's significant energy and water consumption is also a major concern for this group. While a complete boycott of AI may be unrealistic for the masses, the concept encourages greater awareness of the technology's hidden costs and societal impact.</p>

          <p>On the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, Reverend Al Sharpton writes that the fundamental right to vote is facing its most significant threat since the law's passage. He argues that recent Supreme Court decisions, such as Shelby County v. Holder, have dismantled key protections and enabled states to enact restrictive voting laws that disproportionately affect minority communities. Sharpton points to the political movement led by Donald Trump as a central force in eroding democratic integrity. He calls for renewed activism, including economic pressure, to pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and protect American democracy.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate, China has announced it will waive tuition for the final year of public kindergarten, starting this fall. The policy, which also provides subsidies for children in private kindergartens, is designed to lower education costs and ease the financial burden on families. This move comes as many households grapple with a slowing economy, a weak job market, and a prolonged real estate slump. The central government will share the funding responsibility with local governments, contributing between 50% and 80% of the cost depending on the region's fiscal strength.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss researchers have created an innovative, ultra-thin material capable of significantly reducing traffic noise, offering a potential solution for urban sound pollution. The mineral foam absorber is just 2.1 inches thick but performs as effectively as much bulkier conventional materials like rock wool. Its multi-layered design forces sound waves through winding paths, dissipating them efficiently, and it can be customized to target specific frequencies. A real-world test in Zurich demonstrated a noise reduction of up to four decibels, a noticeable improvement for residential areas, though scaling up production remains a challenge.</p>

Many of his students migrated to California, applying his principles to create unique, context-driven structures that integrated with the landscape.

          <p>Palantir Technologies reported second-quarter results that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue surging 48% year-over-year. The company's U.S. commercial segment, driven by its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), was a key performer, with revenue growing 93% and customer count increasing 64%. These strong figures suggest that enterprise adoption of AI is accelerating beyond big tech, which is considered positive news for the entire AI ecosystem. This trend particularly benefits companies like Nvidia, which manufactures the essential GPUs needed to power these AI systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Now in its third year, the Leagues Cup tournament between MLS and Mexico's Liga MX continues to evolve, but its fundamental relevance is still in question. While organizers have made adjustments to the format and MLS no longer fully pauses its season, the tournament struggles for authenticity and fan engagement, especially when compared to the new Club World Cup. The event was created to capitalize on the U.S.-Mexico soccer rivalry and the large Hispanic market in the U.S. However, it is often viewed as a synthetic cash-grab in an already congested global soccer calendar, leaving its long-term success uncertain.</p>

          <p>Excessive screen time in children and adolescents is associated with an increased risk for cardiometabolic diseases, according to new research published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. The study of Danish youths found that those aged 10 and 18 who spent more time on devices had higher risks for conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and insulin resistance. Researchers found a direct correlation where each additional hour of screen time increased the overall risk score. The study also suggests that screen time harms health by displacing sleep, reinforcing the need for balanced daily routines.</p>

Linguists suggest its rise fulfills a cultural need to respond to the increasing presence of AI in daily life and the workplace. The trend has also spawned memes about "robot racism," ironically anthropomorphizing the technology by creating an outgroup that can be dehumanized, reflecting societal anxieties about automation and job displacement.</p>

The Justice Department is arguing for the president's broad power to appoint and remove executive branch officials.

          <p>Honda Motor's first-quarter operating profit fell by 50% year-over-year, significantly missing analyst estimates due to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a stronger yen. Despite the profit plunge, the Japanese automaker's revenue beat expectations, and it raised its full-year profit forecast, anticipating that the impact of tariffs would be less severe than initially projected. Honda plans to mitigate these effects by leveraging its high ratio of local production in the U.S. and potentially increasing stateside manufacturing for new energy vehicles. The results reflect broader struggles among Japanese carmakers navigating global trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>
