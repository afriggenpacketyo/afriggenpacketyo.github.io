          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, along with leaders from France and Canada, has publicly criticized Israel's military operations in Gaza, emphasizing the urgent need for humanitarian aid to enter the region. The joint statement highlights the intolerable suffering of the civilian population and warns of potential breaches of International Humanitarian Law due to the denial of essential assistance. Benjamin Netanyahu responded by saying the three leaders had offered a "huge prize" for Hamas in the Gaza war. The leaders also called for Hamas to release the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL), the world's largest EV battery maker, experienced a significant share jump in its Hong Kong debut, raising almost HK$35.7bn. The listing, however, excluded onshore U.S. investors due to escalating tensions between the United States and China. The company, labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, denies these allegations, and plans to use the funds raised to expand its European operations, particularly in Hungary, to supply batteries to major automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW and Volkswagen. The share sale marks a shift from a decade ago when Chinese companies sought U.S. listings.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the collision of a Mexican navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, with the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to 22 others. The NTSB is working to gain access to the ship, which is docked at Pier 36, to inspect the engine and interview crew members to determine the cause of the incident, and will also be reviewing electronic data to determine when the ship began accelerating. Preliminary findings indicate the ship accelerated rapidly before the collision. The U.S. Coast Guard said the Vessel Traffic Service was fully functional during the incident.</p>

          <p>Sesame Street has partnered with Netflix to ensure its continued availability after federal funding for PBS was cut. Netflix will offer a new season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes to its subscribers, while PBS will also retain access to the new episodes. The show has been a cornerstone of children's media for over five decades, using entertaining lessons and characters like Elmo and Cookie Monster to teach children about various topics, from music education to healthy eating habits.

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States, China saw a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This influx contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this reflects a shift away from US dollar assets since President Trump initiated the trade war. Bank of America analysts highlight a weaker US dollar, peaking US bond yields, and China's economic recovery as factors favoring emerging markets.</p>

          <p>The Cato Institute reports that at least 50 Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador had entered the U.S. legally. The report analyzes immigration data, revealing that these individuals were admitted after presenting themselves at a port of entry, granted parole, resettled as refugees, or entered on a tourist visa. This finding contradicts the administration's claim that only undocumented individuals were deported to the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot).</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first cut in seven months. The 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This move aims to boost the economy amidst easing trade tensions and a stronger yuan. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders reduced deposit rates, paving the way for lower lending rates.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson faces significant challenges in passing President Trump's tax and budget legislation due to conflicting demands from various Republican factions. Fiscal conservatives are pushing for deeper spending cuts, while moderate lawmakers from swing districts oppose reductions to social programs like Medicaid. The legislation also faces opposition over clean energy tax credits and the handling of state and local taxes (SALT). The small Republican majority in the House means Johnson can only afford to lose a few Republican votes, making it difficult to reach a consensus.</p>

          <p>A recent EU deal underscores the ongoing complex relationship between the UK and its European neighbors post-Brexit. The government aims to improve trading ties with the EU, but faces criticism from Brexiteers who view it as a dilution of the original Brexit agreement, and from others who deem it unambitious. The deal's acceptance of "dynamic alignment" with EU rules raises concerns about the trade-off between easier trade and surrendering some sovereignty. Despite the ongoing debates, the deal signifies the start of annual UK-EU summits, highlighting the need for continued conversation and negotiation.</p>
