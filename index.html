          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, resulted in the deaths of nine children belonging to a local pediatrician, Alaa Najjar, according to health officials. Najjar's husband was severely wounded, and their only surviving child is in critical condition. The Israeli military stated that the strike targeted suspects operating from a structure near their forces and that the incident is under review, adding that the area is a dangerous war zone and civilians had been evacuated. The renewed military action against Hamas has included a blockade of Gaza, with limited aid trickling in. The incident highlights the ongoing conflict's devastating impact on civilians and the challenges faced by medical staff in Gaza. The optimism score is 5.</p>

          <p>The Cannes Film Festival experienced a power outage due to a fire at an electrical substation, with authorities investigating possible arson. Despite the disruption, power was restored hours before the Palme d'Or ceremony, allowing scheduled events to proceed as planned. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area, causing traffic jams and store closures. The Palme d'Or was awarded to Jafar Panahi's "It Was Just an Accident," concluding the festival's events after the earlier uncertainty. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>In a symbolic move, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling Canada's independence from the United States, particularly in response to President Trump's undermining of Canadian sovereignty. This visit, the first by a British monarch to deliver a throne speech since 1977, underscores Canada's unique traditions and parliamentary system modeled after Britain's Westminster system. While most Canadians are indifferent to the monarchy, Carney's gesture serves as a strong affirmation of Canada's distinct identity amid ongoing economic and political challenges posed by the US.
