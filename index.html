          <p>Germany and the UK are deepening their military alliance by jointly developing long-range precision weapons exceeding 2000 kilometers, aiming to shield Europe from potential threats. The agreement, formalized as the Trinity House Agreement, also encompasses submarine and maritime reconnaissance cooperation in the North Atlantic and North Sea, addressing concerns over underwater cable security. This partnership seeks to establish compatible weapons systems and common standards within Europe's defense framework, while Foreign Minister backs spending up to 5% of GDP on defense. The collaboration is a constructive effort that enhances other European defense initiatives, particularly at a time when European NATO states are shouldering greater defense responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.7 percent annualized contraction in the first quarter of 2025, marking the first decline in a year due to sluggish domestic spending. To enhance national security, the parliament enacted a law enabling preemptive cyberdefense measures, allowing the government to monitor communications and neutralize hostile servers. The government also pledged to prioritize retailers in the distribution of rice stockpiles to ease consumer prices. Additionally, laws were enacted to introduce digital arrest warrants by fiscal year 2026, streamlining criminal procedures.</p>

          <p>Direct peace negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators commenced in Istanbul, marking the first discussions since early 2022.

          <p>A project in Iceland called the Krafla Magma Testbed (KMT) aims to revolutionize volcanology by building a magma observatory to improve eruption forecasting. Researchers plan to drill into a magma chamber and install monitoring equipment to gather real-time data, addressing the current limitations in predicting the intensity and timing of eruptions. This initiative seeks to build sophisticated models of volcanoes' underlying physics, similar to how weather scientists model the atmosphere, which would require better information about volcanoes themselves. The project could help the world tap into volcanoes as a source of power.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments concerning President Trump's policy on birthright citizenship, focusing on whether a single lower-court judge can block presidential policies nationwide. The administration argues against universal injunctions, suggesting courts should only apply injunctions to individual cases, a move that could shift power away from the judicial branch. The justices explored potential compromises, such as limiting universal injunctions to constitutional questions or requiring three-judge panels to impose them. A ruling against Trump could maintain the injunction on his birthright citizenship ban, while a ruling in his favor could empower him to advance his agenda with fewer judicial obstacles.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has proposed unbundling its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites from its Teams communication app to address antitrust concerns raised by European regulators. The European Commission is scrutinizing Microsoft's bundling practices following a complaint from Slack, which alleges abuse of market power. Microsoft's proposals include offering versions of Office without Teams at a reduced price, increasing interoperability for competitors, and allowing customers to move data out of Teams. Salesforce, which acquired Slack, said it will carefully scrutinize Microsoft's proposed commitments.</p>

          <p>President Trump concluded a three-nation Middle East tour, marked by significant business deals and a notable shift in U.S. policy toward Syria. The trip included a meeting with Syria's new president, reversing longstanding U.S. policies, and announcements of deals worth billions for U.S. companies. Trump also suggested progress in nuclear talks with Iran but largely sidestepped the conflict in Gaza, while also deciding not to travel to Turkey to bolster cease-fire talks involving Russia and Ukraine.</p>

Many students are curtailing travel plans, avoiding public discourse on sensitive topics, and deleting social media profiles.

This could benefit Goldman Sachs' investment banking segment, a crucial part of its business. The IPO market has faced challenges due to higher interest rates and economic uncertainty, but easing trade tensions have emboldened companies to go public. However, some experts caution that fewer companies are choosing to go public compared to past decades due to the availability of private funding.</p>
