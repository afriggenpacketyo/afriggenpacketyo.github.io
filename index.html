          <p>Several nations condemned Israel after its troops fired "warning shots" near a delegation of foreign diplomats visiting the occupied West Bank. The incident occurred near Jenin, a frequent target of Israeli military raids, and prompted outrage and demands for investigation from countries with representatives in the group. The Israeli military expressed regret for the "inconvenience caused," stating that the diplomatic convoy had strayed from the approved route and entered a restricted zone. This incident further strains Israel-Europe ties amid growing tensions over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and recent murders in Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>The Canadian province of Alberta is laying the groundwork for a referendum on seceding from Canada, fueled by long-standing grievances over the federal system's perceived limitations on its oil and gas resources. Premier Danielle Smith, while not personally advocating for secession, seeks to leverage the referendum to renegotiate Alberta's relationship with Ottawa. The move comes as Canada navigates a political transition and faces trade tensions with the United States. Some Albertans even express interest in becoming a U.S. state, reflecting deep-seated discontent with the federal government's policies.</p>

The Air Force emphasized that the test was routine and not a response to current world events, designed to demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the nation's nuclear deterrent. The Minuteman weapon system, operational since the early 1970s, is slated to be replaced by the modernized Sentinel system.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024, falling to 431,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This decrease was attributed to declining numbers of people coming to work and study following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. The Home Office reported a decrease in asylum seekers being housed in hotels, but the number remains higher than when Labour came to power last year.

Democrats criticize the bill as devastating for the middle class, citing cuts to public health insurance. The bill now moves to the Senate, where it is likely to undergo changes before a vote.</p>

          <p>Nike is set to increase prices on some trainers and clothing from June 1, following a similar warning from Adidas about hiking costs due to US tariffs. The sportswear giant cited "price adjustments" as the reason, though almost all of Nike's goods are made in Asia, a region targeted by President Trump's tariffs. Tariffs are typically paid by the company importing goods, who may choose to pass the cost on to consumers. Nike's popular Air Force 1 trainers and children's products will be exempt from the price hikes.</p>

          <p>The Republican Party is struggling to pass a major tax and spending bill due to a tax provision known as SALT (state and local tax deduction). SALT allows Americans to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes from their federal taxes. Removing the SALT cap would mostly benefit wealthy earners in high-tax states, leading to a conflict between lawmakers from high-income and lower-income states.
