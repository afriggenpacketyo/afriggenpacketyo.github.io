          <p>The Israel Defense Forces announced the recovery of the body of Ilan Weiss, a 56-year-old Israeli hostage who was killed during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Weiss was defending Kibbutz Beeri when he was killed and his body was subsequently taken into Gaza. His wife and daughter, who were also taken hostage, were released in November 2023. The recovery operation also found the remains of a second, unidentified hostage, bringing the number of hostages remaining in Gaza to 48.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering deploying the National Guard to Chicago, mirroring a recent federal surge in Washington, D.C. that has focused on immigration-related crime. The article highlights arrests of alleged gang members and individuals with serious criminal convictions, framing the potential deployment as a measure to restore safety. In response, Chicago's mayor and other Democratic leaders have criticized the move as an unlawful action that could heighten tensions between residents and law enforcement, while some local business owners express concerns over rising crime.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have unveiled a more complete picture of *Spicomellus*, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, which lived 165 million years ago. Newly discovered fossils from Morocco show the herbivorous dinosaur had long, bony spikes fused directly onto its ribs, a feature never before seen in any other vertebrate. This finding challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, which were thought to have developed their heavy armor later in response to large predators. Researchers have dubbed the uniquely armored creature the "punk rocker" of its time.</p>

          <p>Montreal-based luxury fashion retailer SSENSE has announced its intention to file for creditor protection, citing a severe liquidity crisis. The company's CEO pointed to increased trade pressures, particularly the recent suspension of the U.S. "de minimis" exemption, which had allowed for duty-free shipping on packages valued under $800. This policy change has significantly impacted e-commerce businesses that rely on shipping to American consumers. SSENSE, valued at $4 billion in 2021, plans to continue operations while it restructures its finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The July Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report indicated that inflation remains persistent, with the annual rate holding at 2.6%, while core inflation slightly increased to 2.9%. Despite these pressures, consumer spending rose by 0.5%, suggesting Americans are continuing to spend, though with more caution in discretionary areas. The data keeps the Federal Reserve on a potential path to lower interest rates in September, as analysts believe the impact of recent tariffs has not yet significantly appeared in goods prices.

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has been reelected in a landslide victory, four years after he says white officials locked him out of town hall. In 2020, Braxton won by default as the only candidate but was prevented from serving, leading to a federal lawsuit. The subsequent settlement mandated the town's first formal election in decades, as leadership had previously been passed down by appointment. This election marks a significant moment for the majority-Black town, restoring democratic governance after a prolonged legal battle.</p>

          <p>After a decade focused on smaller tours featuring his original music, "Weird Al" Yankovic is returning to his classic format of large-scale shows filled with song parodies, costumes, and elaborate staging. Yankovic explains that he stepped away from parodies partly because the decline of a musical "monoculture" made hit songs less obvious targets, and he wanted to prove his versatility. His new "Bigger & Weirder" tour embraces the full spectacle his fans expect, featuring an expanded band to replicate the layered sounds of his famous parodies of artists from Michael Jackson to Nirvana.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law a new congressional map that heavily favors Republicans, a move pushed by the Trump administration to bolster the party's majority in the U.S. House. States typically redraw maps once per decade, making this mid-decade redistricting unusual and contentious. Democrats and voting rights groups argue the map unfairly targets and marginalizes voters of color and have already filed legal challenges. The redrawing occurred after dozens of Democratic state legislators fled Texas in an unsuccessful attempt to block the vote.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has called a special election for a state Senate seat that has been vacant for nearly nine months. The election could result in a tied 19-19 chamber, giving Republicans the power to block the Democratic governor's agenda in her final year. Democrats currently hold a slim 19-18 majority. Republicans had heavily criticized Whitmer for the delay in calling the election, accusing her of trying to protect her party's control. The outcome will be critical in a state where the legislature is already split, with Republicans controlling the House.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is experiencing significant turmoil after its director, Susan Monarez, was fired less than a month into her tenure. Her dismissal prompted the resignations of three other top officials, including the chief medical officer, in protest. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to cut $5 billion in foreign aid funds that were previously approved by Congress for the current fiscal year. To achieve this, the White House is using a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission," which involves requesting to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that they expire before Congress can act. The cuts target programs at USAID and the State Department, including peacekeeping operations and democracy promotion. The move is expected to face legal challenges and has drawn bipartisan criticism for circumventing Congress's constitutional power of the purse.</p>

          <p>As a new school year begins, educators are confronting the reality that generative AI has become a deeply integrated and normalized tool for students. For the current class of high school and college seniors, AI chatbots have been available for their entire four-year careers, used for everything from writing essays to completing assignments. This widespread adoption by students, and increasingly by teachers for curriculum planning, has created a pedagogical crisis. Experts suggest this may be a breaking point, forcing a fundamental redesign of educational practices to address eroding critical-thinking skills and a culture of productivity over learning.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled the Secret Service detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris, seven months after she left office. While law mandates six months of protection, it can be extended by presidential directive, which former President Joe Biden had reportedly done for Harris for one year. The decision has sparked controversy, with allies of Harris calling it politically motivated retribution. However, some security experts suggest the move may be practical, as the Secret Service is reportedly undermanned and Harris's upcoming book tour would require significant resources.</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court injunction that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was granted to the local council following protests, which were triggered after an asylum seeker housed at the hotel was charged with sexual assault. In its ruling, the appeals court stated the original decision was flawed because it failed to consider the difficulty of relocating the migrants and risked encouraging further protests. The Home Office welcomed the decision, which prevents a precedent that could have sparked legal challenges from other councils.</p>

The primary options discussed are reverse mortgages, which are exclusive to homeowners aged 62 and older and do not require monthly repayments. Other methods include home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line with variable rates.

          <h2>Ukrainian President Zelensky Rejects Buffer Zone Proposal for Peace Deal</h2>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed proposals for a buffer zone between Ukrainian and Russian forces as part of a potential peace agreement. He argued that such a concept is outdated and fails to account for the realities of modern drone warfare, which he says has already created a 'dead zone' along the front line. The comments follow reports that European diplomats were considering a 40km demilitarized strip. Zelensky's rejection comes amid fading momentum for a high-stakes diplomatic summit between him and Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite recent U.S.-led efforts.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing chaos at the CDC, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing intense criticism for promoting dubious health claims. He recently suggested a link between psychiatric drugs and school shootings and claimed he could identify children with "mitochondrial challenges" just by looking at them in airports. This comes as former top CDC officials revealed that Kennedy has never been briefed by the agency's experts on key public health topics like vaccines. The remarks have fueled calls for his resignation and intensified concerns about his leadership of U.S. health agencies.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the National Guard's deployment in Washington, D.C. reveals a mission marked by ambiguity and a surreal atmosphere. While officially tasked with curbing violent crime, many Guard members appear uncertain of their duties, engaging in tasks like "beautification projects" and patrols in tourist areas. The military presence has chilled daily life for some residents, particularly immigrants, who fear the operation is a test for broader authoritarian measures. For others, the troops are more of a curiosity, highlighting the complex and polarized reactions to the federal occupation of the city.</p>

          <p>Tesla is seeking to overturn a verdict that found the company partially liable for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system, resulting in a potential $242.5 million payout. In a motion to appeal, the automaker argued that the crash was caused entirely by driver recklessness, not a design defect in the vehicle. The fatal incident occurred when a Model S driver, who said he believed Autopilot would brake for obstacles, accelerated through an intersection and struck a parked car, killing one person and severely injuring another. Tesla is asking for the verdict to be dismissed or for a new trial.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority in ending the protections. The court noted that the TPS statute was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from politics. The decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who have been permitted to live and work in the U.S. due to the ongoing crisis in their home country.</p>
