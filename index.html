          <p>Vancouver's Filipino community is in mourning after a car ramming attack at the annual Lapu Lapu festival resulted in 11 deaths and dozens of injuries. The attack occurred at East 43rd Avenue and Fraser, shocking the tight-knit community. Police have a 30-year-old suspect in custody who has a history of mental health issues, and terrorism has been ruled out as a motive. The festival commemorates Lapu-Lapu, a Filipino national hero, and the attack has left the community grieving and seeking answers during what the police chief called the "darkest day" in Vancouver's history.</p>

          <p>A letter written by Titanic survivor Col. Archibald Gracie before the ship's sinking sold for nearly $400,000 at auction. In the letter, Gracie remarked that he would withhold judgment on the ship until the end of the journey, which was seen as eerily prophetic. Gracie survived the sinking but died less than eight months later from health issues exacerbated by the tragedy. The sale highlights the continued public interest in the Titanic and the personal stories connected to the disaster.</p>

          <p>The Oscars have announced new rules allowing generative artificial intelligence (AI) in nominated films, sparking debate about its potential impact. Some experts, like Raymond Arroyo, worry about a diminishing return on human craftsmanship and artistic choices, suggesting AI could negatively affect the creative process. Dávid Jancsó, editor of the Oscar-winning film "The Brutalist," shared that AI tools were used to enhance dialogue, which he sees as beneficial. Concerns remain about the extent to which AI will influence filmmaking and whether it will detract from the human element that makes art compelling.</p>

          <p>China's coastguard has reportedly seized a tiny sandbank, Sandy Cay, in the South China Sea, escalating tensions with the Philippines, who also claim the territory. State media released images of Chinese officers on the disputed reef, prompting the Philippines to land on three other sandbanks and pose with their flag. The White House has expressed concern, warning that such actions threaten regional stability and violate international law. The move coincides with joint US-Philippine military drills, which China has criticized as provocative, further exacerbating the already strained relations in the region.</p>

          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which sank in 1710.

The discovery sheds light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792 but did not abolish until 1847.

          <p>A senior figure from South Africa's ruling ANC party defended his country's sovereignty amid growing tensions with the US over race relations and a new land law. ANC National Chair Gwede Mantashe said South Africa is not a province of the United States and its sovereignty will be defended. Tensions have arisen over South Africa's new expropriation law, which allows the government to seize land without compensation in certain circumstances, and the US's view of Afrikaaners as victims of racial discrimination.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that most Americans believe President Trump is making significant changes to the government, but are concerned about his focus on tariffs and their impact on prices. The poll reveals declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation, driven by the perceived impact of tariffs. While Trump's base remains supportive, some groups, including independents and young people, have become less approving. Most Americans think Trump is trying to expand the powers of the presidency.</p>

About 100 people participated in the swim trespass event, organized by the Outdoor Swimming Society, to advocate for the right to swim in reservoirs across the country. Bristol Water, which owns the reservoir, cited risks such as strong currents, cold water shock, and harmful algae as reasons for the prohibition.

          <p>A common aviation practice played a role in a fatal plane crash at Reagan National Airport. The crew of an Army Black Hawk helicopter requested and received permission to use “visual separation,” which allows pilots to navigate around other aircraft independently. This procedure, while routine, can be risky if mishandled. The request to fly under those rules is granted routinely in airspace overseen by controllers. Most of the time, visual separation is executed without note. But when mishandled, it can also create a deadly risk — one that aviation experts have warned about for years.</p>
