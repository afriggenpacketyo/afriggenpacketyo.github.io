          <p>The winning design for the Queen Elizabeth II memorial in London, created by Foster + Partners, includes a bridge with a translucent balustrade resembling the Queen's wedding tiara. The memorial, located in St. James Park near Buckingham Palace, will also feature statues of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, along with gardens dedicated to the Commonwealth and UK communities. Norman Foster emphasized the bridge's symbolism as a unifying force. The project, publicly funded and expected to cost approximately $62 million, has faced criticism regarding taxpayer expenses, especially given the substantial inheritance left to King Charles; the final design will be announced in April 2026, coinciding with what would have been Queen Elizabeth's 100th birthday month.</p>

          <p>A report by Canary Mission alleges that New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has deep ties to anti-Israel activism. Mamdani, endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders, is a prominent figure in New York City’s anti-Israel protest scene and introduced legislation to crack down on non-profits sending money to Israel. The report highlights Mamdani's participation in protests shortly after the October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack and details his parents' involvement in anti-Israel activism and support for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement. Mamdani's father, a professor at Columbia University, has been described as a Marxist with strong anti-Israel views.</p>

Despite Lyon's appeal and efforts to improve their financial situation through player sales and releasing high earners, the DNGC remained unconvinced. Lyon officials, including owner John Textor, met with the DNGC, but failed to demonstrate sufficient financial improvements to lift the punishment.

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, announcing it achieved its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aims to cut an additional $1 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. CEO Raj Subramaniam highlighted the company's transformation initiatives focused on integrating networks and reducing costs. Despite the positive results, FedEx stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance that was slightly below Wall Street expectations. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, and U.S. ground home delivery volume rose by 10% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company, won a legal victory as a judge ruled that using legally purchased copyrighted books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law. The judge deemed this use "quintessentially transformative" and protected under fair use doctrine. However, Anthropic still faces a trial in December regarding the separate issue of downloading millions of pirated books, with internal documents showing employee concerns about the legality of using pirate sites. The lawsuit was filed by authors who claimed Anthropic's practices amounted to large-scale theft, although Anthropic has expressed satisfaction with the ruling.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is currently holding approximately 59,000 detainees, potentially setting a record high as the Trump administration expands immigration arrests nationwide. Nearly half of those detained lack a criminal record, indicating the broadening scope of the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. ICE has been averaging around 1,200 daily arrests in June, nearly double the average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration. This increase is attributed to large-scale operations and the reversal of previous administration policies that focused on arresting serious criminals and national security threats.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, en route to a NATO summit in the Netherlands, declined to commit to Article 5, the collective defense agreement among NATO countries, claiming there are various interpretations of the agreement. When asked if he was committed to Article 5, Trump responded, "Depends on your definition. There's numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right?" He later added that he was committed to being friends with the leaders and helping them, but did not provide a clear commitment to mutual defense.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, faced intense questioning in a House hearing, including accusations of lying to senators and accepting pharmaceutical contributions. Kennedy was forced to retract accusations against a Democratic congressman after claiming the lawmaker’s vaccine stance was influenced by $2m in pharmaceutical contributions. Representative Kim Schrier accused Kennedy of lying to Senator Bill Cassidy about not firing the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee members, while Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pressed Kennedy on his awareness of the Trump administration’s investigation into UnitedHealthcare for criminal fraud. Kennedy also unveiled his vision for citizens wearing smartwatches for health monitoring.</p>

Based on current trends, approximately 1.8 million borrowers could reach default status in July 2025, making them subject to wage garnishment and other collection actions by the US Department of Education.
