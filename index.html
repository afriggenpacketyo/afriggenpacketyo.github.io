          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk is enhancing its direct-to-consumer sales channel in the U.S. to counter competition from copycat drugs and address political demands for lower prices. The company's CFO noted that this "cash channel" allows patients to buy weight-loss drugs like Wegovy at a significant discount, a strategy seen as responsive to the Trump administration's pricing ultimatums. Despite a 67% rise in Wegovy sales, the company faces challenges from compounded drugs, which has impacted its market share and led to a revised annual sales forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UN's World Food Programme has issued a dire warning that thousands of people in El-Fasher, the capital of Sudan's North Darfur state, are at risk of starvation. The city has been besieged by the rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since May 2024, cutting off aid routes and causing food prices to skyrocket. With soup kitchens closing and aid deliveries blocked for over a year, the UN describes a daily struggle for survival for the 300,000 people trapped in the city amid the country's wider hunger crisis.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, largely due to a rebound in its U.S. sales. The fast-food giant's domestic same-store sales grew 2.5%, reversing two consecutive quarters of decline, boosted by popular promotions like a tie-in meal with the "Minecraft" movie. The company's international markets also showed strong performance, with CEO Chris Kempczinski crediting the chain's value offerings and marketing for driving a 6% increase in global system sales.

          <p>In a formal blog post, Nvidia's chief security officer, David Reber Jr., has publicly asserted the security and integrity of the company's semiconductor chips. The statement explicitly denies the existence of any "back doors," "kill switches," or spyware embedded in its products, which are critical components in AI infrastructure, healthcare, and finance. Reber emphasized that building such vulnerabilities into chips would be a gift to malicious actors and that the company is committed to fixing security flaws, not creating them.</p>

          <p>On its 60th anniversary, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is being remembered as a landmark achievement for American democracy that now faces significant erosion. The article details how the act fundamentally reshaped U.S. politics by protecting minority voters, but recent Supreme Court decisions, like Shelby County v. Holder, have weakened its core provisions. With new legal challenges aiming to further curtail its power, advocates warn that the hard-fought protections against racial discrimination in voting are under severe threat.</p>

          <p>Newly released FBI statistics for 2024 reveal a significant nationwide decrease in crime, challenging the narrative of a crime wave promoted during the presidential election campaign. The data shows a 4.5% drop in overall violent crime, with murders falling by 14.5% to levels not seen since before the pandemic. These figures, which reflect declines in both major cities and other areas, contradict claims of out-of-control crime and indicate that the nation was safer during the final year of the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>Police in Argentina have arrested a 37-year-old man suspected of being a serial killer who targeted and murdered at least five homeless people. The suspect, known locally as the "machete man," allegedly lured his victims to his home with offers of work or a drink, where he would then kill and dismember them. The investigation began after security footage linked several missing persons cases to the same individual, leading police to the suspect's home where human remains were discovered.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economic analysis suggests that President Trump's tariffs, despite being politically unpopular and economically questionable, may be difficult for future administrations to repeal. The primary reason is the substantial revenue they generate for the U.S. government, projected to be $2.2 trillion over the next decade if they remain in place. As the U.S. faces rising deficits and congressional aversion to other tax hikes, future presidents may be reluctant to eliminate this significant source of income, effectively preserving the protectionist policies.

          <p>Despite initial confidence, many families feel unprepared for college expenses once tuition bills actually arrive, according to a new report. With college costs continuing to outpace inflation, the average amount families spent on education rose nearly 10% in the last year to around $31,000. Reports indicate that many families are not fully utilizing key financial tools, with a significant percentage not filing the FAFSA for federal aid or using tax-advantaged 529 savings plans to cover the escalating costs.
