          <h2>Canada's Election Shaped by Relationship with US Under Trump</h2>

          <p>Canada's upcoming election is poised to significantly impact its relationship with the United States, particularly amidst strained relations due to US tariffs and Donald Trump's remarks about potentially annexing Canada. The election pits the incumbent Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, against the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre. Trump's return to the White House has energized the election race, shifting the political landscape and highlighting Canadian nationalism, with recent polls suggesting a tight competition between the Liberals and Conservatives. The outcome of this election will determine Canada's approach to navigating tensions with its powerful neighbor and addressing domestic social and economic challenges.</p>

          <p>This week is crucial for Russia-Ukraine war talks as the US decides whether to continue its involvement in diplomatic efforts, according to Marco Rubio. Donald Trump's meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican precedes these critical discussions. Trump believes Zelensky is willing to concede Crimea, a claim Ukraine has previously rejected. Germany warns Ukraine against territorial concessions for a ceasefire, deeming it akin to capitulation. Trump blames Kyiv for starting the war and insists "Crimea will stay with Russia."</p>

          <p>Houthi-controlled media reports that a U.S. strike in Yemen targeted a migrant detention center in Saada, resulting in at least 35 deaths. The U.S. military has been conducting near-daily strikes against the Houthis since mid-March, aiming to diminish their threat to Red Sea vessels. CENTCOM reports over 800 targets struck, hundreds of Houthi fighters killed, and a significant decrease in Houthi attacks, though the Houthis continue to claim attacks against U.S. vessels and Israel. The Houthis assert the U.S. strikes also hit the Yemeni capital Sanaa, causing additional casualties.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is calling on Republicans to immediately eject "disruptors and troublemakers" from town hall events, alleging that "Radical Left Democrats" are paying people to infiltrate these meetings. Trump insists that GOP lawmakers should not treat these disruptors nicely and should make it clear to audiences that they are not Republican dissidents. This comes after several Republican lawmakers have faced intense criticism at town halls over Trump's policies, leading some to suggest holding phone or livestreamed events instead.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a continued decline in marriage registrations, prompting local governments to offer cash rewards to encourage young couples to marry.

The government is streamlining marriage registration rules to make it easier for couples to marry, but experts believe the effect may be limited given the country's broader demographic challenges.</p>

          <p>As anti-liberal forces gain strength globally, a liberal fightback is necessary, with Canada playing a key role. Power needs to be dispersed and controlled to ensure freedom, and coalitions of states, civil society actors, and active citizens must unite. Promoting free trade, regulating monopolistic platforms, and supporting Ukraine are crucial steps. The world needs to stand in solidarity with liberal values and counter the forces of nationalism and authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>The IMF's Europe head, Alfred Kammer, states that increased German infrastructure spending will boost Europe's economic growth but not enough to counteract the drag from U.S. tariffs. The IMF cut its growth outlook for the euro area due to President Donald Trump's volatile tariff policy. Kammer notes that tariffs and trade tensions weigh on the outlook more than the positive effects of fiscal measures. The negative impact of tariffs will be partially offset by Germany's infrastructure spending bill.</p>
