        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll indicates that 42.2% of respondents believe the farm minister's dismissal over a rice-related blunder occurred too late. This reflects public sentiment regarding the government's handling of the situation and the minister's performance. The sacking highlights the importance of public perception and accountability in Japanese politics, especially concerning essential sectors like agriculture. The poll results suggest that a significant portion of the population felt the response was not timely, potentially affecting public trust in the cabinet.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates a marginal rise in the support rate for the Ishiba Cabinet, reaching 31.7%.

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK rail policy. The first nationalized service departed on time from Woking to Surbiton, signaling a "new dawn for rail" according to the government. While the government refrained from promising lower fares, it emphasized plans to enhance services and reinvest profits into infrastructure. Unions have raised concerns about outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives insist Labour must fulfill its promises.</p>
