          <p>Germany's government is exploring a potential deportation agreement with the Taliban, signaling a significant change in its policy of not engaging directly with Afghanistan's rulers. The Interior Minister stated that relying on third parties for negotiations is not a sustainable long-term solution. This foreign policy development is occurring alongside domestic debates in Germany, including a failure to agree on electricity tax reductions and a new survey showing public support for raising the legal drinking age.</p>

          <p>Saudi boxing official Turki Alalshikh has suggested that former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury may come out of his recent retirement for a fight in 2026. Alalshikh posted on social media that he has Fury's word for a return to Riyadh, hinting at a potential rematch with Oleksandr Usyk, whom Fury often called a "rabbit." Fury himself fueled the speculation by posting about what 2026 might bring, though he also expressed a desire for a rematch with Usyk to take place in England.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus who oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" risk causing a massive tax hike and economic downturn. The author contends that blocking the legislation, which is a delicate compromise, would be a vote against military readiness, border security, and economic stability. The piece suggests that these dissenting Republicans, described as "deficit hawks," should be offered control over a second, future reconciliation bill focused on entitlement reform as an incentive to pass the current one.</p>

However, he also acknowledged that a Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoin would ultimately be linked to the US dollar, which could complicate efforts to promote the yuan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Congress moves forward with President Trump's spending bill, which includes approximately $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, Republican governors have been notably silent. This contrasts with 2017, when GOP governors were a key force in blocking similar cuts. The current legislation would impose work requirements and other policies affecting states that expanded Medicaid, 19 of which are led by Republicans. Their lack of public opposition is seen as providing political cover for the deep cuts to the healthcare program for low-income Americans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives held an overnight session to advance President Trump's major tax and spending bill, overcoming resistance from within the Republican party. The legislation, which extends tax cuts and boosts border and defense spending while cutting social programs, faces criticism from various factions. Conservative deficit hawks are concerned about its impact on the national debt, while other Republicans worry about deep cuts to Medicaid. Despite the internal divisions, GOP leadership is pressuring holdouts to pass the bill before the July 4th deadline.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting occurred late Wednesday night outside the Artis Lounge nightclub in downtown Chicago, leaving at least three people dead and 16 others wounded. Authorities report that the incident was a drive-by shooting that took place as patrons were leaving an album release party. This is the second mass shooting to occur at this location; a similar event happened in November 2022 when the venue was known as Hush Lounge, after which it was temporarily shut down by the city before reopening under a new name.</p>

          <p>A new report has found that historical child sexual exploitation investigations in Greater Manchester were significantly hampered because Manchester City Council provided heavily redacted evidence to the police. The watchdog inspectorate stated that some documents had only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value and causing major delays in multi-victim cases. While the police force has since improved its processes and a new information-sharing protocol has been established, past failings have led to an irrecoverable loss of trust for some victims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban areas often experience significantly higher temperatures than their rural surroundings, a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island" effect. This is caused by heat-absorbing materials like concrete and asphalt, the trapping of heat by tall buildings, and pollution. This effect intensifies heatwaves in cities, where most of the world's population lives. Potential solutions to mitigate this include increasing green spaces, installing reflective "cool roofs" and pavements, and adding water features, which can lower temperatures and reduce energy demand for air conditioning.</p>

          <p>A new study has shed light on the origins of Uralic-speaking peoples by combining genetic, linguistic, and archaeological data. Researchers traced a 'genetic tracer dye' showing migrations from Siberia across Eurasia between 4,000 and 11,000 years ago. The findings indicate that these migrations spread the Uralic languages to regions from the Baltic Sea to East Asia and established a connection to the eastern Ural Mountains as a likely homeland. This research helps solve a long-standing mystery about the roots of languages like Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian.</p>
