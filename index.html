          <p>An in-depth report from the occupied West Bank details how Israeli settlers, emboldened since the October 7th attacks, are intensifying their campaign to displace Palestinian communities. The article interviews a settler leader who expresses a belief that the land is destined for Jews, while Palestinians and human rights groups report a sharp rise in violence and intimidation. This pressure is seen as part of a wider agenda to expand settlements and extinguish hopes for a Palestinian state, with the UN noting a systemic pattern of human rights violations.</p>

          <p>In an interview, historian Rana Mitter of the Harvard Kennedy School explains how World War II profoundly shaped modern China, an impact he argues is often underestimated. He states that the conflict shattered the country's infrastructure and communications, forcing it to rebuild almost from scratch after the war. This historical context is crucial for understanding China's development and its current strategic interest in maintaining a peaceful Asia-Pacific region eighty years later.</p>

          <p>LSU freshman running back J.T. Lindsey has been arrested on charges of being an accessory after the fact to second-degree murder. Authorities allege that Lindsey harbored two teenage murder suspects in his university dorm room before they were apprehended by U.S. Marshals. Lindsey's lawyer maintains his client's innocence, stating that he was unaware the individuals were wanted for any crime. The university has suspended the four-star prospect pending the legal process.</p>

In a series of social media posts, he linked homelessness to crime and filth, threatening to use federal power to take over the city's policing. This comes despite local data showing a recent decline in violent crime and follows the deployment of additional federal law enforcement officers in the city.</p>

          <p>The German government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has decided to suspend the export of certain offensive weapons to Israel that could be used in a ground operation in Gaza City. Merz clarified that while Germany's fundamental solidarity with Israel remains, it cannot support actions that could lead to thousands of civilian deaths. This decision marks a significant shift in policy for one of Israel's staunchest allies and has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative party.</p>

          <p>Executives from two major U.S. carriers, Frontier and United Airlines, have issued warnings about the future of domestic air travel, suggesting flight schedule cuts are likely. The CEOs argue that the domestic market currently has too much supply relative to demand, making many routes unprofitable for the industry as a whole. This potential reduction in capacity could ultimately lead to fewer flight options and higher prices for consumers traveling within the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

Before the rally, short-sellers had targeted Apple due to its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential regulatory risks. However, positive developments, including an endorsement from President Trump, triggered the rally, creating a feedback loop that propelled the stock higher despite underlying concerns.
