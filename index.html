          <p>A Milwaukee judge, Hannah Dugan, was arrested by the FBI for allegedly obstructing immigration agents by helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest in her courtroom. This action is a significant escalation in the Trump administration's conflict with local authorities over deportation policies. The administration has been demanding that local officials assist federal deportation efforts and the arrest signals a tougher stance against those who do not comply. The arrest follows rising tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary regarding immigration cases.</p>

          <p>A Department of Health and Human Services official contradicted NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya's announcement of creating an autism registry. The HHS official stated that they are not creating an autism registry, but will link existing datasets to support research into autism causes and treatment. This reversal comes amid criticism from advocacy groups and researchers over privacy concerns and the potential misuse of patient data. The NIH maintains that its data repository will analyze de-identified data and comply with privacy laws, and that efforts are not about tracking individuals.</p>

          <p>A mini-heatwave is predicted for the UK, expected to provide a temporary boost to nature with the arrival of migratory birds and the emergence of butterflies. While a brief warm spell is beneficial for wildlife, it also raises concerns about wildfires, especially in dry heathland areas. Conservationists urge caution to prevent fires, which can devastate wildlife and habitats. Climate change is contributing to more frequent and intense wildfires, posing a significant threat to vulnerable ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump's special envoy, held a fourth meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss potential peace deals related to the Ukraine conflict.

          <p>The federal government is reversing its decision to terminate the SEVIS records of international students, a move that had complicated their ability to stay in the country. This reversal comes after numerous federal lawsuits were filed by affected students.

The action has been described as a "sigh of relief" for international students across the country.</p>

          <p>"60 Minutes" is facing an unprecedented crisis with the departure of its executive producer, Bill Owens, who cited corporate interference related to Paramount Global's merger with Skydance Media. The merger is complicated by President Trump's lawsuit against CBS over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. There are concerns that the company will settle the lawsuit to appease Trump, potentially undermining the program's journalistic independence. The staff remains committed to their hard-charging journalistic values, but uncertainty over corporate support could make it difficult to aggressively cover the Trump White House.</p>
