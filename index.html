The storm, with wind gusts exceeding 80 mph, caused widespread damage, including to two housing units at the Nebraska State Penitentiary, which led to the displacement of 387 inmates. The severe weather also caused extensive power outages and property damage across the region, while other Midwestern states brace for similar conditions, flash flooding, and extreme heat advisories.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is set in 18th-century England and centers on five mysterious sisters accused of witchcraft after they are rumored to transform into dogs. The story is told from the perspective of outsiders, examining how a community's fear and suspicion can curdle into hatred when faced with perceived transgressions against nature and social norms. The review notes that while the novel engages with familiar themes of persecuted women, its lush, violent prose and satirical take on the fear of women's bodies offer a fresh perspective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The death of 32-year-old nurse Alexandra Pennig, initially reported as a suicide by the man present, Matthew Ecker, was re-examined after detectives found inconsistencies in his story. Ecker claimed Pennig shot herself in the bathroom, but key evidence, including a dry sink where he claimed to have washed his hands, raised suspicion. The pivotal clue was a small metal piece from the bathroom door lock found under Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forced open before she was shot. This discovery led to Ecker being convicted of second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has issued an apology after two blind women were left behind by their flight from New Orleans to Orlando.

The friends shared their story to advocate for improved communication protocols for passengers with disabilities, highlighting a significant service failure by the airline.</p>

Democrats see an opportunity to campaign against the bill's unpopular provisions, which are projected to cost $3.4 trillion over ten years, making it a central issue in the fight for control of Congress.</p>

The refurbished space features restored architecture and interactive displays capturing the emotional journeys of those who passed through its doors, including poignant memories from former child refugees.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new legislative package to make tips tax-free is raising questions and some skepticism among service industry workers. The measure offers a deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income, but some workers feel it sounds "too good to be true," pointing out that state and payroll taxes will still apply. Key details remain unclear, including which occupations and types of gratuities will qualify, and how employers must report the income. This uncertainty comes as tipping averages decline amid consumer "tipping fatigue."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to place a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the moon by the end of the decade, a crucial step toward establishing a permanent human settlement. A lunar base requires a significant and reliable energy source to function, especially during the 14-day lunar nights, making nuclear power essential. The move is also framed as a matter of national security, aiming to counter a joint Chinese-Russian plan for a more powerful lunar reactor. This renewed focus on the moon could lead to significant achievements in space exploration.</p>

          <p>In her new book "SLIP," Mallary Tenore Tarpley shares her journey of living with an eating disorder, shifting from a perfectionistic goal of "full recovery" to accepting a life in the "middle place." After being diagnosed with anorexia as a teen, she found that an all-or-nothing approach was unsustainable and often led to shame and secrecy during relapses. Tarpley's memoir and research advocate for embracing imperfections and normalizing slips, arguing that this mindset makes recovery feel more attainable and allows for a full, meaningful life while managing the disorder.</p>

Experts attribute this disparity to the lack of cooperation between state and local law enforcement in California and federal agents, which is more common in Republican-led states. However, California did experience one of the nation's most dramatic increases in arrest rates.</p>
