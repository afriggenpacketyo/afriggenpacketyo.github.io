          <p>The sister of Aamir Siddiqi, a 17-year-old schoolboy killed in a mistaken-identity attack in Cardiff 15 years ago, has publicly appealed for the suspected mastermind to surrender. Aamir was fatally stabbed at his home by two contract killers who went to the wrong address. While the hitmen are serving life sentences, the man believed to have ordered the killing, Mohammed Ali Ege, remains one of Europe's most wanted fugitives after escaping custody in India. Nishat Siddiqi urged Ege to end his life on the run, stating he is "not truly free" and should return to clear his name if innocent.</p>

          <p>Typhoon Wipha has forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people in southern China as it made landfall in Guangdong province. China's meteorological authority issued an orange alert, the second-highest warning level, for the powerful storm. The typhoon, which previously impacted Taiwan and the Philippines, brought strong winds exceeding 150km/h and heavy rainfall to Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan provinces. Authorities have evacuated over 266,000 residents on land and more than 12,000 people from the sea to mitigate the risks of extreme downpours and potential flooding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming week in global finance will focus on key earnings reports from major European banks, including Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank. Market optimism is largely centered on the financial sector to continue positive momentum, even as other sectors face downgrades. Concurrently, all eyes are on the European Central Bank, which is expected to keep interest rates on hold but may be forced to act if the U.S. imposes threatened tariffs on EU imports. Analysts warn that European inflation risks are being underestimated, setting the stage for potential market volatility depending on the outcome of tariff negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Technology played a pivotal role in the investigation into the 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Initially, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was the prime suspect, but data from his Fitbit device provided an alibi by showing minimal activity during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify another man, George Steven Burch, as a suspect. Location data from Burch's Google Dashboard further implicated him by placing him at the crime scene, where the victim's body was found, and where her belongings were discarded, leading to his conviction.</p>

          <p>Five days of severe torrential rains across South Korea have led to at least 14 fatalities and left 12 people missing. The government reported that the heavy downpours caused deadly landslides, house collapses, and flash floods, particularly in southern regions like Sancheong. In one instance, a person was killed when their house collapsed, while another was swept away by a swollen stream. As of Sunday, approximately 3,840 people have been evacuated from their homes, though the rain has begun to subside and heavy rain alerts have been lifted.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, announced that the number of people missing after the catastrophic July 4th floods has been reduced from nearly 100 to just three. The flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas, with most fatalities occurring along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, a popular tourist and camping destination. The rapidly rising waters washed away homes and vehicles, devastating the area. The significant reduction in the missing persons list is attributed to extensive, coordinated search operations and investigative work over the past three weeks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense demonstrated renewed vigor, but it wasn't enough to overcome pitching struggles in an 8-7 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite scoring seven runs and hitting back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning, the Dodgers could not secure a win. Starting pitcher Emmet Sheehan had a difficult outing, and the bullpen allowed costly late runs. Key offensive moments, including a three-RBI day for Shohei Ohtani, were ultimately overshadowed by the team's inability to execute in crucial situations, resulting in their ninth loss in the last eleven games.</p>

          <p>A commentary article argues that the relentless cycle of war in places like Gaza, Ukraine, and Sudan is fueled by a global collapse of a shared moral order. The piece suggests that the deliberate targeting of civilians and widespread atrocities continue because the world is ethically fractured, lacking universal principles to guide conflict resolution. It posits that what is morally indefensible to one group is deemed permissible by another, leading to a state of moral relativism where coercion and manipulation replace objective standards. This crisis of morality, exemplified by political figures and public indifference, hinders any genuine pursuit of peace.</p>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet in his Pasadena home, two suspects have been charged with his murder. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office has charged Muhammad Abdul-Malik as the alleged shooter and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings as the getaway driver. Moreno was playing video games in his bedroom when the bullet came through his window. A break in the cold case came from recently enhanced surveillance video and police sketches that led to the suspects' identification and arrests.</p>
