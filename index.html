        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest Japan's turbulent political climate could undermine its diplomatic efforts, potentially stalling progress in trilateral summits with China and South Korea. The instability arises from the fragmented political landscape, where no single party can maintain a stable government. Takaichi's pursuit of becoming Japan's first female prime minister faces challenges in securing the necessary votes, highlighting the uncertainties within the political system. This situation could diminish Japan's ability to effectively participate in major diplomatic events and impede momentum in its relationships with key regional partners, affecting overall geopolitical dynamics. The country's diplomatic commitments could be cast in doubt. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security will impose a $1,000 immigration fee on migrants paroled in the U.S. to ensure accountability and prevent misuse of the parole system. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated that the Biden Administration abused America’s immigration system and turned parole into a de facto amnesty program, thereby allowing millions of unvetted illegal aliens into the U.S., no questions asked, to the detriment of all Americans. The fee, which may be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index, will be collected by Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The new fee seeks to deter misuse and strengthen oversight. </p>

          <p>The prime minister has criticized the decision to bar Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an Aston Villa match due to safety concerns. West Midlands Police classified the game as high risk, citing intelligence and past incidents, including clashes and hate crimes during an Ajax-Maccabi Tel Aviv match in Amsterdam. Other political figures, including Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, have also condemned the ban, with some calling it a national disgrace and suggesting antisemitism. The Safety Advisory Group, responsible for issuing safety certificates, made the decision, prompting widespread debate and concern about discrimination. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 00:12:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index hit a fresh record high for the third consecutive day due to optimism surrounding ongoing trade talks with the U.S., diverging from broader losses in Asian markets. The Kospi was the only market in positive territory, reaching an intraday high of 3,794.87, while other Asia-Pacific markets traded weaker amid fears over the banking sector and trade tensions. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports also showed a sharp rebound in September, defying expectations of a drop and reversing a previous decline. The Kospi's performance reflects investor confidence in South Korea's economic outlook amid trade negotiations.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents evacuated from storm-ravaged coastal communities in western Alaska recount their experiences of fleeing rising floodwaters and damaged homes after Typhoon Halong. The storm brought record high water levels, washing away homes and prompting a large-scale evacuation effort. One evacuee, Alexie Stone, described his house rocking and floating, with water seeping in, while another, Julia Stone, a village police officer, spoke of the chaos and the efforts to coordinate rescue teams. Despite the devastation, evacuees expressed gratitude for being alive and helping each other, with authorities working to provide shelter and restore basic services. </p>

          <p>Former members of the military are now able to apply for a digital version of their identity cards, allowing them to prove their status more easily and access public services. The digital ID can be downloaded to a smartphone and is optional, with physical veterans' cards continuing to be issued. The government says it will allow former service personnel to show their entitlement to services such as GP and mental health support, supported housing, careers advice as well as reduced entry prices at museums and money off their shopping. Digital government minister Ian Murray said the veterans' digital ID could also help address "legitimate concerns around privacy and security" of the UK-wide scheme. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers capitalized on their chances in the sixth inning to beat the Milwaukee Brewers 3-1 and take a 3-0 lead in the National League Championship Series. Tommy Edman's go-ahead single and aggressive baserunning by Freddie Freeman broke a 1-1 tie, leading to a two-run rally. The Dodgers' bullpen secured the lead, and with Shohei Ohtani set to start in Game 4, the team is in a position to sweep their way back to the World Series. The Dodgers' pitching has been strong, and they have executed well in critical situations. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has declined to lift an order blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois, citing scant evidence of a "rebellion." The court found that the deployment was a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment. The judges determined that the protests in Chicago did not amount to a rebellion and that there was insufficient evidence that protest activity impeded the ability of federal officers to enforce immigration laws. The temporary restraining order remains in effect through October 23. </p>
