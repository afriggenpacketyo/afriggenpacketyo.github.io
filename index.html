          <p>India's Ministry of External Affairs has expressed concern over the new $100,000 fee for U.S. H-1B skilled worker visas, warning of significant "humanitarian consequences." The government stated the fee would cause major disruption for families and hopes U.S. authorities can address these issues, highlighting the immense contribution of skilled workers to both nations. This policy change, affecting Indian nationals who receive over 70% of these visas, adds another layer of complexity to the already tense trade negotiations between the U.S. and India. The fee is set to take effect on September 21st.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma State football fans expressed their frustration with head coach Mike Gundy during a historic 19-12 home loss to Tulsa, the team's first defeat to their in-state rival at home in 74 years. Chants of "Fire Gundy" were audible on the game's broadcast as the Cowboys fell to a 1-2 record on the season. This loss comes after a 69-3 defeat to Oregon the previous week and a disappointing 3-9 record last season, which was the worst of Gundy's 21-year tenure. Despite the calls for his job, Gundy praised the fans' energy after the game.</p>

          <p>Southern Inyo Healthcare District, a critical access hospital in a remote part of Eastern California, is on the verge of financial collapse, with its CEO reporting it had only eight days of cash on hand. Local and state officials have sent an urgent request to Governor Gavin Newsom for a $3 million emergency infusion to prevent the hospital from closing or severely cutting services. The facility is the only hospital in a nearly 60-mile radius, serving residents and the many tourists visiting nearby Death Valley and Mt. Whitney, and its closure would create a vast "medical desert."</p>

This comes just days after severe flooding in the area turned deadly, with a two-year-old child being swept away in Barstow, California. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to churn but is expected to strengthen into a hurricane over the weekend. Forecasters predict Gabrielle will remain far out at sea and pose no direct threat to land as it tracks northeast.</p>

          <p>Sonny Curtis, a pioneering rock-and-roll musician and prolific songwriter, has passed away at the age of 88. A childhood friend of Buddy Holly and an early member of The Crickets, Curtis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the band in 2012.

          <p>The qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was marked by chaos as difficult track conditions, including high winds and light rain, led to six different drivers crashing. The high number of incidents resulted in a record six red flags, extending the session to double its normal length. The challenging Baku street circuit punished even minor errors, catching out drivers from multiple teams. Championship contenders Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri navigated the turmoil but will start the race from a disadvantaged seventh and ninth on the grid, respectively.</p>

          <p>Top congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have formally requested a meeting with President Trump to negotiate a deal to prevent an impending government shutdown. In a letter, they accused Republican leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan talks to keep the government funded beyond the September 30 deadline. The request comes after the House passed a short-term spending bill that subsequently failed in the Senate, deepening the political stalemate as both parties position to blame the other for a potential shutdown.</p>

          <p>A new study from China's Helicopter Research and Development Institute details an advanced artificial intelligence system that can allegedly detect even the stealthiest submarines with 95% accuracy. The system works by creating a dynamic, real-time map of the underwater environment using data from various sources like sonar buoys and water temperature sensors. If effective, this technology could represent a significant leap in anti-submarine warfare, potentially undermining the strategic advantage of nuclear submarine fleets which form a key pillar of nuclear deterrence for Western powers.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Apple's new, ultra-thin iPhone Air is an emblem of a broader, miserable cultural shift towards minimalism. The author contends that this trend, seen in technology, interior design, and even theater, strips objects and experiences of character, context, and joy in favor of a spartan, inoffensive aesthetic. The sleek, clean design of modern devices like the iPhone is presented as a deceptive facade, delivering a constant stream of chaos while appearing perfectly restrained. This pervasive minimalism is critiqued as a hollow status symbol reflecting a world that feels increasingly out of control.</p>

          <p>Lexi Smith, a 24-year-old from Atlanta, has shared her experience of moving to the Japanese countryside to teach English, where she rents a one-bedroom apartment for just 35,000 yen, or about $238 per month. Seeking a change from the U.S. school system and a higher cost of living, Smith relocated to the Chiba Prefecture, east of Tokyo. Her employer secured the apartment, which includes a balcony and walk-in closet, without requiring a security deposit. Smith documents her life on social media to show a different side of Japan beyond the bustling metropolis of Tokyo.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted a massive overnight aerial attack across Ukraine, resulting in at least three deaths and over thirty injuries, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The assault, which utilized hundreds of drones and missiles, targeted infrastructure and civilian areas, with a missile reportedly striking a residential building in Dnipro. In response, Ukraine claims to have successfully struck major Russian oil refineries in the Samara and Saratov regions. The attacks represent a significant escalation and occurred shortly after Estonia reported a violation of its airspace by Russian jets, heightening regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration has intensified a campaign that critics describe as an effort to crush political dissent. This article analyzes how the tragedy is being used as a pretext to escalate threats against the "radical left," with officials considering designating some groups as domestic terrorists and revoking non-profits' tax-exempt status. Despite no evidence linking such groups to the killing, the rhetoric from top administration officials aims to brand the Democratic party as an extremist organization, echoing tactics used by authoritarian governments to consolidate power and silence opposition.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for wartime or national emergencies, to address the country's significant asylum application backlog. The plan involves setting up temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of asylum caseworkers to expedite decisions and reduce the costly use of hotels for housing applicants. Party officials argue that invoking these emergency powers is necessary to secure the funds and authority needed to quickly resolve what they describe as a crisis in the immigration system.</p>

          <p>Sacramento police have arrested a 64-year-old man suspected of firing multiple shots into the lobby of the ABC10 news station. The incident occurred while the building was occupied, though no one was injured.

While the motive is still under investigation, authorities were able to identify and apprehend the suspect after linking him to a vehicle believed to have been used in the attack.</p>

          <p>In the wake of his killing, conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being positioned as a martyr within the Christian nationalist movement, an ideology his own career helped to mainstream. Religious leaders and figures associated with the movement have framed his death not just as a tragedy but as a spiritual call to arms, with his widow calling her grief a "battle cry." This article explores how Kirk's political ascent mirrored the rise of Trump-era Christian nationalism, which shifted from traditional organizing to a more aggressive, anti-democratic vision of societal conquest, a message now amplified by his death.</p>

Lewinsky emphasized that after years of trying to escape her past, she realized she had to embrace her story to help others who have faced public shaming, stating her goal is to be a "poster child for having survived shame."</p>
