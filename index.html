          <p>The entire Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board resigned, alleging that the Trump administration meddled with the board's authority to award scholarships. The board claimed the State Department denied Fulbright awards to numerous individuals selected for the 2025-2026 academic year. They also stated that an additional 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients are undergoing an unauthorized review process, potentially leading to more rejections. The board members, all appointed by former President Joe Biden, believe these actions contradict the Fulbright mission and its values of free speech and academic freedom, while a State Department official claimed the board members were partisan political appointees attempting to undermine President Trump.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to review a lower court's order that paused President Donald Trump's plans to fire a large number of federal workers. The plaintiffs in *Trump v. American Federation of Government Employees* argue that the firings would cripple federal programs and exceed presidential authority. Trump's lawyers contend that the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) should hear the challenges, despite the MSPB lacking a quorum. The case raises questions about the separation of powers and whether constraints applied to Democratic presidents will also apply to Republican presidents.</p>

          <p>Following two days of violent disorder in Northern Ireland, particularly in Ballymena, police are deploying additional officers to affected areas. The unrest, which injured 32 officers and led to six arrests, began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault. Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson described the violence as "racist thuggery targeted at ethnic minorities and police officers". In Larne, a leisure center was attacked, prompting a response from emergency services, while police are reviewing footage of the incidents for prosecutions and Police Scotland is sending additional officers to assist.</p>

          <p>Experts are raising concerns about the increasing cost of servicing the U.S. government's debt, which reached $1.1 trillion in 2024. This figure is almost double what it was five years prior, and now exceeds the nation's defense spending. The Congressional Budget Office projects that a Republican tax and spending bill could further increase the federal deficit, leading to additional interest payments. Concerns are growing that rising interest costs could crowd out vital programs like Social Security, potentially leading to financial strain, especially during an economic slowdown.

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was convicted on one count of engaging in a criminal sex act but acquitted on another count in his New York retrial, with the jury unable to reach a verdict on a rape charge. The jury foreperson had expressed concerns about discord among jurors, citing threats and intimidation. Weinstein complained that the jury behavior was depriving him of a fair trial, though the judge dismissed the jury for the day, instructing them to continue deliberations on the remaining count. The retrial stemmed from allegations of sexual assault by Mimi Haley, Jessica Mann, and Kaja Sokola, after an earlier conviction was overturned.</p>

          <p>Egg prices for consumers experienced a decrease in May, reaching a five-month low of $4.55 per dozen, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This 11% drop from April's $5.12 is attributed to the receding effects of the avian flu outbreak and a seasonal softening in demand. While prices remain higher than they were a year ago, experts note that the containment of avian flu has been a significant factor in the recent decline. However, the bird flu outbreak is not entirely contained and continues to impact the industry.</p>

Senators questioned Bedford about Republic Airways' previous attempt to certify pilots with only half the flight hours required by federal regulations. The FAA is currently dealing with safety concerns and air traffic control system issues, and Bedford's stance on the "1,500-hour rule" is a key point of contention. While Bedford emphasized public safety as his top priority, he did not directly commit to upholding the 1,500-hour rule, raising concerns among lawmakers and families of crash victims.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is deploying and federalizing National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles amidst riots and immigration protests, aiming to prevent a repeat of the 2020 Minneapolis unrest. Trump administration officials criticized Minnesota's governor for a slow response during the George Floyd protests. California Governor Gavin Newsom accused Trump of misusing the military against American citizens, but Trump and his allies assert this action is necessary to maintain order. Trump is exerting greater authority over the National Guard compared to 2020, bypassing Newsom's authority, leading to a lawsuit from the governor, who labels the move an "unmistakable step toward authoritarianism."</p>

These 17 chemically similar elements, found within the Lanthanide series, are often described as the "vitamins" of industry, enabling technologies to become smaller, faster, and stronger. China dominates the production and processing of rare earths, accounting for a significant portion of global output, while the extraction and refining processes can pose environmental challenges. They are not rare in the sense of abundance, but rather in the difficulty of extracting and separating them.</p>
