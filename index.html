          <p>A gunman drove a truck into a Michigan church during Sunday services, shooting congregants and setting the building ablaze, resulting in four deaths and eight injuries. The suspect, 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, was killed in a shootout with police, and the FBI is leading the investigation into the "targeted violence." The attack, which caused a partial collapse of the church, comes amid warnings about increased violence against religious institutions. Authorities are investigating potential motives, including any connection to the church or the recent death of a church president.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland. Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield argue the move is unlawful and unnecessary, asserting that local officials can manage public safety without federal intervention. President Trump had authorized the deployment to protect federal property, citing "war-ravaged Portland" and threats from "Antifa." Local leaders dispute this characterization, stating there is no insurrection requiring military presence.</p>

          <p>This article discusses "energy vampires" in friendships, individuals who drain one's energy through excessive complaining, self-focus, or a constant need for attention. Psychologists suggest signs include a lack of interest in your life and chipping away at your mood. To manage these relationships, experts recommend honest conversations about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries on time spent or topics discussed, and changing shared activities to less conversational ones like exercising together. These strategies aim to protect one's well-being while potentially maintaining the friendship.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the mayoral reelection race, citing constant media speculation and a Campaign Finance Board decision to withhold funds. This decision sets up a three-way contest between Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who faced a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration, stated he was "wrongfully charged" but fought for the city. His departure shifts the political landscape for America's largest city.</p>

          <p>More than 100,000 federal workers are expected to resign as part of a Trump administration program aiming for significant workforce reductions, marking the largest mass resignation in U.S. history. This comes as Congress faces a funding deadline, potentially leading to a government shutdown and further layoffs. Employees describe months of "fear and intimidation" driving their departures, feeling their mission was undermined and job security uncertain. The White House has ordered agencies to prepare for large-scale firings if a budget deal isn't reached.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's goal of expanding green marine fuels relies heavily on establishing a robust methanol supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has initiated liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations, green methanol requires a tax-free import, storage, and sales system for mainland-produced fuel. This statement was made during the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol. The company anticipates increasing green methanol usage from 2027 due to Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is requesting an expedited Supreme Court review of an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, which has been blocked by lower federal courts. Solicitor General John Sauer argues the government has a compelling interest in defining American citizenship and that the lower court decisions undermine border security. The administration seeks a definitive judgment on its reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has historically granted citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. regardless of parents' immigration status. Critics, like the ACLU, maintain the order is illegal and unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its windmills, plans to introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. With 2.6 million tourists annually and a resident population of just 100, the local council aims to control overwhelming numbers and protect residents' privacy. Tourists often walk into private gardens and homes, causing significant disruption. The fee will include museum and windmill access, with revenues intended for maintenance and new infrastructure, though local businesses fear a loss of shoppers.</p>

          <h2>Weight-Loss Injections Raise Concerns About Widening Health Inequalities</h2>

          <p>The increasing use of weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro is raising concerns about obesity becoming a "wealth issue," as access is often restricted on the NHS, leading many to pay privately. While effective, the high monthly cost (up to £350) and varying NHS eligibility criteria create a "postcode lottery," disproportionately benefiting the affluent. Experts warn this could worsen existing health inequalities, as obesity rates are higher in deprived areas. Calls are growing to widen NHS access and address the broader social determinants of obesity.</p>

Despite holding the best record in the majors in mid-June with a $322.6 million payroll, the Mets finished their season with a 38-55 record in the second half. This familiar outcome for Mets fans, reminiscent of collapses in 2007 and 2008, allowed the Cincinnati Reds to secure the final NL wildcard spot.

Despite changes in general managers and managers, the team's performance has not improved, with persistent issues in fundamentals, hitting, and pitching. Moreno, who explored selling the team previously, is not expected to do so soon, possibly waiting for collective bargaining negotiations. The organization's inability to develop young talent and its mid-market payroll operations in a major market raise questions about its future direction.</p>

Cramer acknowledges skepticism about AI's immediate tangible benefits but believes in its future potential and the strategic necessity for tech giants to invest heavily. He points to the self-funded nature of the buildout and strong demand as key differentiators. (not investment advice)</p>
