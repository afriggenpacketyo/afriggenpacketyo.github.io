          <p>Brown University has entered into a deal with the Trump administration to reinstate millions in frozen federal research grants. In return, the university agreed to several conditions, including paying $50 million to local workforce programs and making commitments regarding women's sports, admissions practices, and antisemitism. Brown's president stated the agreement was necessary to end a financially damaging grant freeze and government overreach, while the administration hailed it as a victory against "woke" university policies. The deal specifies that Brown does not admit to any wrongdoing and preserves its academic autonomy.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after initially suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting a net $2 billion impact from these levies. The automaker reported second-quarter revenue that surpassed expectations, though its stock saw a decline in after-hours trading. CEO Jim Farley highlighted ongoing "constructive conversations" with the Trump administration to mitigate the effects of tariffs on imported parts, which are crucial despite the company's large U.S. manufacturing presence. The updated guidance reflects lower earnings projections than before the tariff announcements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Arm Holdings fell after the company's first-quarter earnings report, where revenue from smartphone royalties did not meet expectations. Despite this, the company's overall revenue and future guidance were largely in line with analyst predictions. A significant development from the report was CEO Rene Haas's confirmation that Arm is considering designing its own chip components or even full solutions, a move that could turn its current partners into competitors. This strategic shift is aimed at providing a better starting point for customers like cloud service providers. (not investment advice)</p>

This achievement highlights Microsoft's successful capitalization on the artificial intelligence boom, placing it ahead of Apple in market valuation.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a rare judicial misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, accusing him of making improper public comments and criticizing his rulings in a case involving deported Venezuelan migrants. The complaint alleges the judge violated judicial rules by forecasting a "constitutional crisis" and rushing the government through litigation. Legal experts suggest the complaint may face challenges, as disagreements with a judge's rulings are typically handled through appeals, not misconduct filings. This action is part of a broader pattern of the administration's public clashes with the judiciary, escalating tensions between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, continuing its cautious approach due to ongoing economic uncertainties, particularly regarding inflation.

The decision was not unanimous, with two FOMC members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy is performing well but faces risks, justifying the decision to wait for more data before considering any rate adjustments.

          <p>William "Bill" Elwell, the founder and longtime owner of the iconic Bill's Burgers in Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley, has passed away at the age of 98. For 60 years, Elwell was a local legend, known for his gruff humor and strict "no substitutions" policy at the cash-only shack he opened in 1965. His passing has prompted an outpouring of tributes from customers and fellow restaurateurs who were inspired by his dedication and work ethic. Elwell became as much of an attraction as his classic burgers, embodying a spirit of small business that defined the neighborhood for decades.</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin, in which he alleged malicious prosecution by state officials regarding the fatal "Rust" film set shooting. Baldwin had sued prosecutors and law enforcement, claiming he was made a celebrity scapegoat for the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The dismissal was based on a lack of significant action in the case over a six-month period, although Baldwin's lawyers have 30 days to file a motion to revive it. This development comes a year after the involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin was dropped due to prosecutors withholding evidence.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his country intends to recognize a Palestinian state in September, following similar recent declarations by France and the United Kingdom.

Carney cited the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements as key reasons for the decision. He stated that the traditional approach to a two-state solution is no longer tenable, as the prospect of a Palestinian state is actively eroding.</p>

          <p>A former Israeli hostage, Emily Damari, has publicly criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, arguing the move "risks rewarding terror." Damari, who was held by Hamas for over 15 months, stated that legitimizing a state while Hamas remains in power emboldens extremists and undermines peace. Her comments echo concerns from other British families of hostages, who fear the UK's conditional recognition proposal could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining captives.

However, critics contend that this approach sacrifices long-term sustainability and global competitiveness for short-term security.

          <p>The Trump administration is launching a major initiative with companies like Google and Amazon to encourage millions of Americans to share personal health data through new apps and systems. The program aims to provide easier access to medical records and improve wellness management, focusing on areas like diabetes and weight loss. While officials promise patient data will be secure and require opt-in consent, digital privacy advocates express serious ethical and legal concerns. Critics worry the initiative could lead to the monetization of sensitive health information and create new privacy risks for patients.</p>

          <p>This article puts a spotlight on six independent Latin artists who have released critically acclaimed music but may be overlooked by the Latin Grammy Awards. While major stars often dominate the nominations, progressive and forward-thinking albums from artists like Juana Aguirre, Gepe, and Mabe Fratti are pushing creative boundaries. The piece argues that these musicians, who blend traditional folk roots with experimental electronic sounds and complex arrangements, deserve recognition in major categories like Album of the Year. It serves as a call for the Latin Academy to celebrate the innovative work happening outside the mainstream music industry.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary series, NFL legend Tom Brady, a minority owner of Birmingham City Football Club, is shown questioning the work ethic of former manager Wayne Rooney. During a November 2023 visit, Brady expressed concern about Rooney's approach and also described the team's players as "lazy and entitled." Rooney's tenure as manager was brief, lasting only 83 days as the team's performance plummeted, ultimately leading to their relegation. The series captures the awkward dynamic between the two sports icons and provides a behind-the-scenes look at a tumultuous period for the English football club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates a slight improvement in Americans' views of the economy, yet this optimism is tempered by widespread concern about future price increases. While ratings for the stock market have become more positive, two-thirds of respondents expect the prices of goods to rise, leading many to plan on reducing discretionary spending. The survey highlights a divide based on income levels, with higher-income individuals more likely to feel the positive impact of the stock market. Overall pessimism about a potential economic slowdown or recession in the next year continues to outweigh optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's grand strategy to disengage from global conflicts to focus singularly on containing China has failed. Instead of pivoting resources away from Europe and the Middle East, the U.S. has become more deeply enmeshed in both regions. The administration's continued military support for Ukraine and recent strikes against Iran have drained American power and diverted attention, contrary to the initial vision. This failure to extricate the U.S. from other entanglements has inadvertently provided Beijing with strategic breathing room, undermining the core premise of the administration's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 50% tariff on specific copper products, including pipes, tubes, and wiring, set to begin this week. The move is intended to protect national security, but the scope of the levy fell short of what was initially expected by markets. Notably, the tariff excludes raw copper materials like ores and cathodes, which surprised investors and caused U.S. copper prices to drop sharply. This targeted approach primarily benefits domestic manufacturers of finished goods rather than the U.S. copper mining industry, which had hoped for broader restrictions on all overseas shipments.

In her statement, the former vice president and 2024 nominee did not rule out a future White House bid. Her absence from the gubernatorial race reshapes the contest, which features a crowded field of prominent California Democrats, and allows her to focus on her next steps in public life.</p>
