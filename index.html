          <p>This article contrasts the Democratic party's current criticism of Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas with their actions a decade ago in Maryland. Then-Governor Martin O’Malley and Maryland Democrats engineered a gerrymandered map, famously creating a district shaped like a "broken-winged pterodactyl," with the explicit goal of ousting Republican representatives. The piece points out the apparent hypocrisy, as Democrats who defended the aggressive Maryland gerrymander now lambast similar partisan tactics being used against them in other states.</p>

          <p>A bomb threat prompted the evacuation of a hotel in St. Charles, Illinois, where a group of Texas Democratic lawmakers were staying. The legislators had fled Texas to break a quorum and block a Republican-led redistricting bill. No device was found after a thorough search, and everyone was allowed to return safely. The incident escalates the already tense political standoff, with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker vowing a full investigation into the threat.</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun broadcasting a new season of "MasterChef" that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired following a report that upheld misconduct allegations against them. The decision to air the series has drawn criticism, although the BBC stated it was for the benefit of the contestants who participated. Reviewers have noted that the new episodes seem heavily edited to minimize the hosts' banter and jokes, resulting in a noticeably different tone for the popular cooking competition.</p>

          <p>The unexpected resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler has created a vacancy on the central bank's board, giving the Trump administration several strategic options for monetary policy influence. The administration could appoint a short-term "shadow chair" to challenge current Chair Jerome Powell, or it could nominate its long-term choice for the chairmanship now. This development introduces political intrigue into the traditionally collegial institution as the administration weighs its approach to influencing the nation's interest rate policies.

          <p>The Trump administration, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has canceled nearly $500 million in contracts for developing mRNA vaccine technology, a move praised by vaccine critics but condemned by many public health experts. Kennedy stated the administration is moving beyond mRNA's limitations and investing in other solutions, citing alleged risks. However, infectious disease specialists argue the decision is baseless, endangers national security by weakening defenses against future pandemics and bioterrorism, and will cost lives.</p>

          <p>A small piece of a bathroom door lock proved to be the key piece of evidence in solving the 2022 murder of Alexandra Pennig, a nurse from St. Paul, Minnesota. Her colleague, Matthew Ecker, claimed she had died by suicide, but detectives suspected foul play. The discovery of the broken lock piece under Pennig's body indicated the door was forced open before she was shot, contradicting Ecker's story and leading to his conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year sentence.</p>

          <p>According to a report from The Atlantic, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is struggling to perform its core function of distributing research funds due to political interference from the Trump administration. Officials within the agency describe an "ongoing siege" of funding freezes, grant cancellations, and sudden policy reversals that have created a climate of fear and paralysis. This has led to a significant slowdown in grant awards, threatening to leave billions in allocated funds unspent and potentially justifying future budget cuts.</p>
