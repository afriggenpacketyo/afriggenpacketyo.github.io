          <p>A week after U.S. military strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, descriptions of the operation's success from the Trump administration have been inconsistent. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the sites were "obliterated," preliminary intelligence assessments from the Pentagon's own intelligence wing suggested a more limited setback of only a few months. The article tracks the evolving official narrative, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty about the true extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that California's public and cultural identity, largely shaped by early 20th-century academics, systematically erases authentic Native American history. The author provides examples from visitor guides, restaurant menus, and even university projects that ignore or whitewash the state's violent colonial past and the thriving, continuous existence of Indigenous tribes. The article calls for a more honest historical reckoning to correct this deeply ingrained cultural and educational amnesia across the state.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities exemplifies President Trump's evolving military doctrine, which favors discrete, high-impact strikes over sustained, open-ended campaigns. The article characterizes this as a "One-and-Done" approach, where Trump is willing to authorize significant, risky operations but remains averse to what he terms "endless wars." This strategy is now supported by a circle of advisers less inclined to challenge his instincts, though questions remain whether a single attack will be sufficient to deter Iran.</p>

          <p>The muted reactions from Beijing and Moscow following the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran suggest the anti-American axis between the three nations is more fragile than often perceived. Instead of rushing to aid its partner, China prioritized global stability and its economic ties with the West, urging de-escalation. This cautious approach reveals the asymmetrical nature of these relationships and indicates that shared antagonism toward the U.S. has its limits when a major military confrontation erupts.</p>

          <p>Scotland international Sione Tuipulotu believes he is returning to his best form for the British and Irish Lions after an injury sidelined him during the Six Nations championship. Following a strong performance against the Western Force, the center praised his midfield partner Garry Ringrose and the influential play of fly-half Finn Russell. Tuipulotu noted that the team is successfully blending the dominant Irish coaching style with the individual instincts of key players, creating a dynamic and hard-to-defend strategy.</p>

          <p>A biologist from Mount Allison University is warning New Brunswick residents of an unprecedentedly high tick population this season, a situation attributed to two consecutive mild winters. The expert notes that ticks are spreading further north and are now carrying new diseases like anaplasmosis and babesiosis, which can be more rapidly fatal than Lyme disease. The article provides essential prevention tips, such as using effective bug spray and performing frequent checks, and explains how to seek preventative antibiotic treatment from pharmacists after a bite.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has developed a searchable national citizenship data system by integrating Social Security and immigration databases to help election officials verify voter eligibility. Developed rapidly and without a public process, the tool is raising alarms among privacy advocates and legal experts about the risks of mass data consolidation and potential misuse. While it could ease the burden on voters to prove citizenship, critics are concerned about the system's accuracy and the federal government's plans for the voter data it collects.</p>

          <p>Couples planning weddings in the U.S. are facing unexpected costs due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese-made goods, which have heavily impacted the bridal industry. Because approximately 90% of U.S. wedding gowns are produced in China, a new 30% tariff has forced designers and boutiques to add surcharges or raise prices significantly. This economic pressure and price uncertainty are causing budget stress for brides and creating difficult business conditions for store owners managing long-term special orders.</p>

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is particularly concerned about the location of 400 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, as Iran has now suspended cooperation with the agency.</p>
