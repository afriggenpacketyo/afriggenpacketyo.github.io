        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Energy Department has canceled over 300 "green" funding awards, totaling nearly $8 billion, for projects across 16 states that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. These cuts, announced during a federal government shutdown, are criticized as politically motivated, jeopardizing tens of thousands of jobs and undermining efforts to reduce carbon emissions and strengthen electrical grids. The Trump administration defends the cancellations, stating the projects did not adequately advance national energy needs or offer a positive return on taxpayer investment, claiming they were rushed through by the previous administration. Democratic lawmakers and advocacy groups, including Washington Governor Bob Ferguson and Senator Martin Heinrich, contend this move is an illegal and transparent attempt to punish political opponents. They warn of increased energy costs, threatened grid reliability, and instability in affected communities.</p>

          <p>Residents of Altadena, California, are facing significant concerns over lead contamination in soil as they attempt to rebuild homes destroyed by the devastating Eaton Fire, which claimed lives and property. Many homes, built before 1975, likely contained lead-based paint, which dispersed as ash and debris during the fire. Testing by the L.A. County Department of Public Health and the University of Southern California revealed elevated lead levels, even after initial soil removal by the Army Corps of Engineers. This article highlights the health risks, particularly for young children and pregnant individuals, and the challenges homeowners face in ensuring their land is safe before reconstruction. Advocacy groups report that over a third of homeowners still lack desired soil testing.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Formula One Grand Prix is significantly boosting tourism, not only for the host city but also for the wider Asia-Pacific region. Data indicates that a substantial number of international travelers, particularly from North America and Europe, are extending their trips to include other regional destinations like Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia, often bundling race packages with island getaways. This article explains how the three-day race has evolved into a week-long event, attracting global leaders and business travelers to concurrent forums such as Token2049 and the Milken Institute Asia Summit, further enhancing its economic impact. The trend reflects a broader consumer shift towards prioritizing experiences, with increased spending on event-related activities and loyalty points, signaling a positive outlook for regional economies.</p>

The attacker, identified as 35-year-old British citizen Jihad Al-Shamie, drove a vehicle into people before assaulting them with a knife, and was subsequently killed by police. This article details the swift police response and the attacker's non-viable explosive vest, emphasizing the "immediate bravery" of security staff who prevented his entry into the crowded synagogue. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the "horrific incident," announcing increased police presence to protect Jewish communities nationwide, as investigations continue into the motivation behind the targeted attack.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is advancing a novel legal theory, claiming the U.S. is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, framing their actions as "an armed attack against the United States." This article reports on a Pentagon notification to Congress, which attempts to justify recent U.S. military strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats that killed 17 people. Critics question the legality of these attacks and the broad designation of cartels as "non-state armed groups," seeing it as an escalation of the drug war. The move appears to expand the administration's wartime powers to kill and detain cartel members with impunity, despite intelligence suggesting limited proof for some claims.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval among Latino voters appears to be eroding, primarily due to economic concerns like rising grocery and housing costs, despite his strong showing with the demographic in 2024. Recent polls indicate a majority of Hispanics disapprove of his economic handling and overall job performance, with many fearing deportation for themselves or loved ones. This article highlights that while Latino voters consistently prioritize the economy and show increased concern over immigration reform, their dissatisfaction with Trump has not translated into significant gains for Democrats. Experts suggest Democrats need to focus on concrete proposals for Latino communities rather than solely criticizing the opposition to win their support, especially with upcoming off-year and midterm elections.</p>

This article highlights how the province is exporting to over 30 countries, including Germany and Vietnam, driven by high global demand and benchmark coffee futures reaching a 50-year high. This boom has propelled raw bean prices from 40 yuan to 66 yuan per kilogram, creating a windfall for local growers and driving industrial reforms, with local factories upgrading technology to meet evolving consumer needs. The substantial increase in export volume, up 358% year-on-year in 2024, signifies Yunnan's growing influence and economic transformation in the international coffee market.</p>

          <p>The PGA of America president, Don Rea Jr., issued a belated apology for "disrespectful" and "inappropriate" fan behavior at this year's Ryder Cup, after initially downplaying the abuse as comparable to a "youth soccer game." European players, including Rory McIlroy, faced vitriolic taunts, homophobic slurs, and even a thrown beer that hit McIlroy's wife. This article details Rea's initial minimization of the incidents, which drew criticism from European players, and his subsequent contrite email to PGA members, stating, "We own our bogeys."

This article explains that while law enforcement can still release other investigatory records, sensitive areas must be blacked out. The decision came after families of two victims requested the images be withheld, balancing public interest in the case with the profound privacy concerns of those affected.

The approval comes despite a review of mifepristone's safety initiated by Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., influenced by a disputed right-wing think tank paper that experts found flawed.

          <p>The EAT-Lancet Commission has released a major update to its "planetary health diet" report, advocating for a varied menu of nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with less meat, dairy, and sugar. This article highlights new research showing that adopting such diets, coupled with reducing food waste and sustainable agriculture, could halve global greenhouse gas emissions and prevent up to 15 million premature deaths annually. Despite widespread scientific acceptance, the report faces a "coordinated campaign" of misinformation from meat and dairy industry-linked groups. The Commission emphasizes its rigorous scientific assessment and aims to counter denialism by showcasing the diet as delicious and aspirational.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is introducing a redesigned driver’s license and identification card featuring new security measures, including a first-in-the-nation digital signature on one of the two bar codes. Starting Wednesday, newly issued cards will showcase California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline, replacing previous designs like the gold miner and agricultural lands. This article explains that existing licenses remain valid until their expiration date, so there's no immediate need for motorists to update, with renewal fees remaining unchanged. The new cards incorporate "next-generation technology" with enhanced anti-counterfeit features and have removed the magnetic strip, marking the first significant design and security update since 2010. These periodic updates aim to improve security and align with measures like the REAL ID program.</p>

This article highlights Doncic's efforts to avoid injuries and ensure peak physical and mental shape, a priority stressed by coach JJ Redick after the team's early playoff exit. Teammates like Gabe Vincent praise Doncic's "greatness," creativity, and court vision, noting the ongoing learning process of playing alongside his reactive style. The team is undergoing intense drills and conditioning, with Redick pushing players in demanding runs to achieve championship-level fitness. Several key players, including LeBron James, are sitting out the first preseason game due to minor injuries or caution.</p>

          <p>As the federal government shutdown continues, President Trump and his budget director, Russ Vought, are using the impasse to threaten permanent cuts to "Democrat Agencies" and federal jobs, deepening political tensions. This article explains that while the administration frames these actions as necessary savings, critics, including law professor Bridget Dooling, dismiss them as a "bluff" to leverage Democrats into negotiations, arguing it's a misunderstanding of temporary lapses versus permanent layoffs. Vought, a key architect of Project 2025, has already announced billions in energy and infrastructure funding cancellations, targeting Democratic states. Federal unions have sued the administration, arguing these threats unlawfully disregard statutory requirements and abuse power, pushing back against the "malignant political hack" Vought.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vowed to "instantly" cut state funding, including billions in Cal Grants, to any California universities that sign President Trump's proposed "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education." Newsom's office condemned the compact as a "hostile takeover," aiming to impose government-mandated conservative ideology, erase diversity, and dictate university operations. This article highlights the compact's controversial requirements, such as closing departments hostile to conservative ideas, limiting international student enrollment to 15% with no more than 5% from one country, and banning race or sex in admissions. The University of Southern California, one of the targeted institutions, is reviewing the letter, facing significant economic challenges if it complies due to its high international student population.</p>

          <p>Celtic's European struggles continued with a defeat against Sporting Braga, marked by a controversial VAR decision that disallowed a potential equalizer from Kelechi Iheanacho, despite replays suggesting no handball. This article highlights the frustration from players and manager Brendan Rodgers over the "ridiculous" VAR call, which they felt changed the game's momentum. However, the article also points to Celtic's own significant errors, including a goalkeeping mistake by Kasper Schmeichel and defensive blunders that led to Braga's goals. This marks the fifth time this season Celtic has failed to score, raising questions about team quality, tactical choices, and summer transfer ambition.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics attempting to debunk U.S. claims regarding human rights in Xinjiang, such as forced labor, are encountering significant obstacles in accessing data from regional authorities. This article explains that while Beijing generally views these scholars as well-meaning, the reticence of local officials makes it difficult to conduct research as desired. The problems were highlighted at a Hong Kong conference, where researchers pointed to Beijing's concerns about potential distortion of information by Western researchers and the low cost of making damaging accusations. Scholars argue that disclosing more information would ultimately benefit the region's long-term development and counter negative narratives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's claim that Democrats are demanding free healthcare for undocumented migrants, used to blame them for the government shutdown, is refuted by this article. Vice President JD Vance and President Trump asserted Democrats want to give "billions of dollars in healthcare funding for illegal aliens." However, Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer called this a "total, absolute, effing lie." This article clarifies that Democrats seek to extend Obamacare subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, which do not cover undocumented immigrants. While Democrats aim to restore healthcare access for "lawfully present" immigrants affected by Trump's bill, federal law prohibits coverage for undocumented individuals.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has agreed to President Trump's long-standing demands to lower drug costs in the United States, matching the prices charged in other developed countries. This article details the deal, which includes launching all new drugs at parity prices and offering existing drugs at discounts for Medicaid patients, and participation in the new TrumpRx website. Trump, who has consistently accused drugmakers of "getting away with murder," leveraged a threat of 100% tariffs on companies not manufacturing products in the U.S. to secure the agreement. While a symbolic victory, the full impact on patient costs and global drug pricing remains to be seen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>College rankings, now a cultural staple, were once a "shocking experiment" that sparked immediate controversy, as highlighted by Edwin Embree's 1934 list. This article traces their evolution from informal appraisals to the influential U.S. News & World Report lists, which emerged in the 1980s as college became a mass-consumer good. Early attempts at ranking, like Kendric Babcock's 1911 study, were suppressed due to public outcry and political intervention. The article explains how rankings, while evolving in methodology, have profoundly shaped public perception and institutional behavior, with universities often tailoring their numbers to metrics and some even misreporting data to improve their score.</p>
