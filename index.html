          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' star pitcher Zack Wheeler has been placed on the 15-day injured list due to a blood clot in his right arm. Team officials noted Wheeler experienced "heaviness" in his arm, prompting a medical evaluation. A retired MLB team physician, Dr. Michael Jacobs, explained that such a condition is serious and treatment could involve blood thinners, which would significantly delay his return to playing. The team has not yet provided a specific timeline for his recovery.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. While its maximum sustained winds have decreased, the storm's overall size has grown, prompting tropical storm warnings for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center state Erin is likely to strengthen again and will remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of the week. Though not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, it could still bring dangerous rip currents and coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended its plans to resume operations after its flight attendants' union defied a government-issued back-to-work order. The strike, which has grounded hundreds of daily flights and affected over 100,000 passengers, continues as the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) demands fairer compensation. The union is calling for flight attendants to be paid for time spent on the ground between flights, a key point of contention in the contract negotiations. CUPE has called the government's intervention unconstitutional and invited the airline back to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are facing growing uncertainty as quarterback Matthew Stafford continues to be sidelined by a back injury with the season opener just weeks away. The 37-year-old veteran has not taken a single snap in team practices during training camp, and coach Sean McVay has provided few details on his condition or a timeline for his return. With Stafford's availability in doubt, the team is relying on backups Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett to take first-team snaps. The situation casts a shadow over the Rams' prospects, as they are considered Super Bowl contenders with a healthy Stafford leading the offense.</p>

          <p>After fleeing Texas to prevent a Republican-led redistricting effort by denying the legislature a quorum, Democratic lawmakers are now starting to return to the state. The move comes after they successfully stalled an initial special session called by Governor Greg Abbott to redraw congressional maps in a way that would favor the GOP. With a new special session underway, Democrats are cautiously returning, though GOP officials have threatened their arrest to compel their attendance. The Democrats' return follows a counter-move by California, which announced its own redistricting plan to combat the potential Republican advantage.</p>

          <p>Renowned Irish novelist Sally Rooney has publicly stated she will continue to support Palestine Action, a direct-action group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. Rooney declared in an opinion piece that she will use her earnings and public platform to support the group's actions, stating, "if this makes me a supporter of terror under UK law, so be it." The UK Home Secretary defended the ban, citing the group's targeting of arms companies and a manual providing guidance for attacks.

This development is being framed as a potential breakthrough in negotiations to end the war, as Ukraine has long sought such security assurances as an alternative to full NATO membership.

          <p>As President Zelenskyy prepares to meet with President Trump, reports suggest the U.S. may press Ukraine to surrender the entire Donbas region in exchange for Russia freezing the front line. This proposal, originating from Vladimir Putin, would involve Ukraine ceding the remainder of the Donetsk region, which has been defended at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Ukrainian historians and officials describe the potential concession as a tragedy and a betrayal, given the region's industrial importance and deep ties to Ukrainian identity. While the population is weary from war, polling indicates that about 75% of Ukrainians oppose any formal land cessation to Russia.</p>

Gabriel later clarified his remarks, explaining that by "entertainers" he was referring to the media, and that he considers himself and all his teammates to be competitors.

          <p>Dr. Alieu Kamara has become the first and only neurosurgeon in Sierra Leone, a country of eight million people, offering hope where none previously existed for patients with severe neurological conditions. Before his practice began, those with brain tumors or severe spinal injuries either died or faced extreme disability unless they were wealthy enough to travel abroad. Supported by an international network of non-profits and medical professionals, Dr. Kamara recently performed the country's first-ever spine surgery, successfully treating a man paralyzed from the neck down. His work represents a monumental step forward for the nation's healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Germany, France, the UK, and the EU are set to join President Zelenskyy for talks with President Trump in Washington, signaling a united European front in the push for a peace deal in Ukraine. The meeting follows the Trump-Putin summit, where U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff reported that Russia made concessions, including an agreement that the U.S. could offer Ukraine NATO-like security protections. While Zelenskyy has praised the U.S. security pledge as "historic," he remains skeptical of Russia's intentions and has emphasized that any negotiations must start from the current front lines.</p>

          <p>Demonstrators in Israel conducted a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses to demand the government secure a ceasefire deal with Hamas for the release of remaining hostages in Gaza. The protests, organized by families of hostages, reflect growing public frustration after 22 months of war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the demonstrations, claiming they benefit Hamas and delay the hostages' release. The action comes as fears grow for the safety of the approximately 50 hostages still held, with only about 20 believed to be alive.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in relationships suggests that couples in the happiest, long-term partnerships consistently discuss five key topics that others often neglect. These daily conversations include checking in on the state of their relationship, sharing current interests and passions, and discussing future dreams, both practical and whimsical. They also create a safe space to talk about fears and stressors, building emotional honesty and trust. Finally, they share random, spontaneous thoughts, which fosters playfulness and keeps their connection fresh and meaningful over time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent investigation and expulsion of several high-ranking officials from ethnic minority communities in China signals a significant policy shift. Previously, senior cadres from non-Han groups were rarely targeted in anti-corruption campaigns, as their appointments were part of an effort to promote ethnic inclusion in governance. However, the downfall of figures like Qizhala, the former chairman of Tibet, and Liu Hui, former chairwoman of Ningxia, suggests that this ethnicity-based leniency is ending. Observers believe this reflects a broader push for uniform political discipline across the Communist Party, regardless of an official's ethnic background.</p>
