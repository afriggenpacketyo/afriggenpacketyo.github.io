          <p>Jafar Panahi's film, ‚ÄúUn Simple Accident,‚Äù won the Palme d‚ÄôOr at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a significant moment for the Iranian director who had previously faced restrictions from making movies. The film, which was shot clandestinely, follows a group of men and women who unite after one of them kidnaps a man they believe tortured them in prison.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, O.C.G., who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution and informing U.S. authorities of previous sexual assault. Judge Brian Murphy criticized the government for claiming O.C.G. stated he wasn't afraid of being sent to Mexico, where he was allegedly sexually assaulted, but later admitting they couldn't identify the officials to whom he made that statement. The ruling highlights ongoing legal battles over the Trump administration's deportation policies and due process concerns, as O.C.G. remains in hiding in Guatemala, fearing for his safety.</p>

          <p>According to DoorDash data, chicken burgers have surpassed beef burgers as the most popular burger choice in America, driven by the viral fast-food chicken sandwich wars and a growing preference for high-protein, affordable alternatives. The shift is supported by data indicating that 74% of Generation Z and 69% of millennials have ordered a restaurant item after seeing it go viral. This trend reflects a broader movement towards diverse eating habits, with veggie burgers also gaining popularity in several states. Overall, consumers are increasingly selecting burgers based on mood, moment, and motivation.</p>
