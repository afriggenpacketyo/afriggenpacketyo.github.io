          <p>China's embrace of open-source AI models, spearheaded by DeepSeek's R1, is accelerating AI adoption and innovation.  This shift, exemplified by Baidu's open-sourcing of Ernie 4.5, challenges the dominance of closed-source models and raises questions about the massive investments of companies like OpenAI. The move is seen as a strategic response to DeepSeek's success and a broader trend in China towards open-source business models.</p>
