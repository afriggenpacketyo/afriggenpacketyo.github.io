          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% increase in data center sales, reflecting strong demand for its AI chips. The company expects $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, although this guidance was reduced due to export restrictions on China-bound H20 chips. CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's overall growth remains robust, fueled by the demand for AI infrastructure and chips used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is signaling a shift away from Washington D.C. and a recommitment to leading his tech companies, including SpaceX, Tesla, and xAI, after facing criticism for his role in the Trump administration. He has criticized Trump's tax bill and emphasized his dedication to his businesses, claiming to be working around the clock. This move comes amid public and investor backlash against Musk's political ambitions and the shortcomings of his "department of government efficiency."

          <p>Canada's decision to cull 400 ostriches on a British Columbia farm due to avian flu has drawn criticism from Trump administration officials. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz have voiced their opposition, with Kennedy urging further testing to understand the virus and Oz offering to relocate the birds to his Florida ranch. The farm owners, who have lost a legal battle to keep the birds alive, argue that the ostriches should be studied for their antibodies.
