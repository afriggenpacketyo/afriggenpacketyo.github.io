          <p>The Washington Hilton has been a fixture in D.C. politics for decades, hosting the White House Correspondents' Dinner for 57 years. The hotel has been the site of many presidential appearances since Lyndon Johnson, including fundraisers, conferences, and the National Prayer Breakfast. It was also the location of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981, which is now commemorated with a plaque. Despite controversies, the Hilton continues to be a central gathering place for political events in the nation's capital, hosting concerts and galas.</p>

          <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as his deputy, a move seen as a step towards designating a successor. Some analysts believe this signals al-Sheikh as Abbas's preferred heir, while others see it as a cosmetic change to appease Arab officials. Many Palestinians view this focus on leadership succession as disconnected from the pressing issues of the war in Gaza and Israeli military operations in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by volatile trade policies, including tariff increases and subsequent pauses, causing uncertainty in the global economy. The administration's back-and-forth actions have failed to restore confidence among investors and have led to concerns about higher prices. The outcome of ongoing trade negotiations between the US and China will likely shape perceptions of Trump's first 100 days and provide clues about his future approach. The president's actions have raised questions about the US's ability to manage the global economy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for deporting a two-year-old U.S. citizen and separating a mother from her one-year-old child. Lawyers in both cases allege that their clients were arrested during routine ICE check-ins and given limited opportunities to communicate with family. The ACLU and other groups condemned the actions as a "shocking abuse of power". The cases highlight concerns about due process and the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>A letter written by Titanic passenger Archibald Gracie from aboard the ship sold for nearly $400,000 at auction. The lettercard, penned on April 10, 1912, described the ship as "fine" but reserved judgment until the end of the journey. Gracie survived the sinking and wrote a detailed account of the disaster, but died shortly after due to complications from hypothermia. The letter is considered an exceptional museum-grade piece due to its historical significance.</p>

          <p>The FBI’s arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan has ignited strong reactions from Republican and Democratic politicians. Republicans called for her removal. Democrats regard her arrest as a reflection of the administration’s increasing disregard of judicial independence amid its push to deport immigrants on an enormous scale. The arrest has deepened the partisan divide over immigration and the role of the judiciary.</p>
