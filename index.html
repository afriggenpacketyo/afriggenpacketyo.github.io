            <p>The State Department informed a judge that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, is "alive and secure" in a Terrorism Confinement Center. This update follows a Supreme Court order directing the U.S. government to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return. Abrego Garcia's attorneys requested additional relief, including holding the government in contempt for non-compliance with prior court orders. Despite a court order barring his deportation, Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador due to an "administrative error".</p>

            <p>Twelve former OpenAI staffers have filed a brief supporting Elon Musk's lawsuit against the company's transition to a for-profit entity. They argue that such a transformation would violate OpenAI's original mission and breach the trust of employees and stakeholders. Musk co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015, but the company has since been commercializing products under CEO Sam Altman. OpenAI is facing hurdles in restructuring due to Musk's opposition and his rival startup, xAI.</p>

            <p>President Trump's changing tariff policies are causing panic buying and paralysis among consumers. The tariffs, including a 10% tax on most imports and a 145% duty on goods from China, are expected to lead to higher prices and potential shortages. Some consumers are stocking up on goods, while others are uncertain about how to proceed. The economic impact of the tariffs is expected to be significant, with some analysts predicting a recession.

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel, owned by Jingye, using emergency legislation to prevent the closure of its blast furnaces in Scunthorpe. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds indicated that nationalization is likely, aiming to protect 2,700 jobs and maintain domestic steel production. The government intervened after Jingye rejected offers to purchase raw materials, threatening to halt primary steelmaking. The legislation grants the government extensive powers to manage the plant and ensure continued operation.</p>
