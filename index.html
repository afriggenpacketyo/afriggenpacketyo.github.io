          <p>Nutrition experts are highlighting the concept of "meal sequencing," or the order in which foods are eaten, as a potential tool for better health. The method involves eating fiber-rich vegetables first, followed by protein and fats, and saving carbohydrates for last. This approach may help prevent sharp blood sugar spikes, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance or diabetes. Additionally, eating protein and fiber before carbohydrates can increase feelings of fullness and aid in weight management by promoting appetite-suppressing hormones.</p>

          <p>Intense rainfall on Saturday caused severe flash flooding in Montgomery County, Maryland, prompting over 100 rescue calls within a two-hour period as people were trapped in cars and buildings. The National Weather Service issued its first-ever flash flood emergency for the D.C. area, with floodwaters in some locations rising 10 feet in just 30 minutes. While no injuries were initially reported, dozens of water rescues were performed, including for 20 people stranded inside a building. Many residents were shocked by the unprecedented speed and intensity of the flooding.</p>

          <p>Following a week of deadly sectarian clashes in southern Syria, Bedouin fighters have withdrawn from the city of Suweida but warn they may resume fighting with the local Druze community. A fragile ceasefire is in place, but Bedouin leaders are demanding the release of their injured members still inside the city, whom they consider hostages. The conflict, which has killed over 1,120 people and displaced more than 128,000, was triggered by an abduction and escalated with the involvement of government forces and Israeli airstrikes.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy has died and four others remain in the hospital after a school coach crashed near Wheddon Cross in Somerset. The coach, carrying pupils from Minehead Middle School returning from a zoo trip, left the road and slid down a 20-foot slope. Two children are being treated in Bristol, and two adults are hospitalized in Somerset. The school was closed as the community left tributes, and fundraisers have collected over £40,000 to support those affected by the horrific incident.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze stated that abuse directed at players is worsening as the profile of women's football grows. Her comments follow teammate Jess Carter's revelation that she received racist messages during Euro 2025, prompting a police investigation. Bronze noted that while men's football sees more abuse in stadiums, women's football is increasingly targeted online. The Lionesses have also decided to stop taking a knee before matches, seeking a new way to combat racism, and are using their platform to call for more action from social media companies.</p>

          <p>Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has stated he will continue to permit his officers to wear masks during arrest operations. Despite acknowledging concerns that the practice could be exploited by imposters, Lyons argued the masks are a necessary tool to protect agents and their families from doxxing and threats. The policy has drawn sharp criticism from legal advocates and state attorneys general, who argue it undermines accountability and fosters a climate of fear in immigrant communities.</p>
