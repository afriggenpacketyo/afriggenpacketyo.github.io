          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris is contemplating her next political move, potentially including a run for governor of California, another presidential bid in 2028, or stepping away from elected office. Harris made her first major public appearance since her 2024 defeat, criticizing President Trump's economic policies. Sources close to Harris indicate she is engaging with Democratic officials and strategists to help shape the party's future direction. She is expected to announce her decision by the end of the summer and will headline a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in New York in May.</p>

Hagar expressed that he would be open to touring with Roth again if the circumstances were right, but that Roth 'always wants too much'.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking a dismissal of the state murder indictment, citing double jeopardy and other constitutional violations. They argue that the concurrent state and federal prosecutions infringe on Mangione's rights. The defense also challenges the terrorism upgrade added by the Manhattan district attorney's office, asserting a lack of evidence to support the claim that Mangione intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that could result in the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has added interim national security advisor, acting administrator of USAID, and acting archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration to his responsibilities. This unusual accumulation of roles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage each position, particularly given President Trump's unconventional governing style. The appointment was unexpected, with State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce learning of it during a press conference.

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is facing criticism after his department altered maternity funding levels, with campaigners calling the decision a 'betrayal.' Following a report into poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, almost £100m was invested annually to improve maternity safety. However, changes by the Department of Health mean that only £2m of the funding is guaranteed for maternity care this year. The Royal College of Midwives has described the funding decision as taking 'a wrecking ball' to maternity safety.</p>

          <p>Apple anticipates incurring $900 million in additional costs this quarter due to President Trump's tariffs, despite exemptions on key electronics. The company is responding by shifting production of iPhones bound for the American market away from China, with the majority of these iPhones to be manufactured in India. Apple's revenues for the first three months of the year rose 5% to $95.4 billion. Despite the challenges, Apple's sales remain strong, and the company is adapting its supply chain to mitigate the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors are implementing a new policy to expedite the filing of felony charges in sexual assault or violence cases, following a report highlighting delays in a case involving the slaying of a 13-year-old boy. The policy mandates that the process to file a criminal complaint must begin within one business day once a decision has been made to seek an arrest warrant. This change comes after concerns about a backlog of cases in the district attorney’s office, which may have contributed to delays in charging Mario Edgardo Garcia-Aquino, accused of murder in the death of Oscar Omar Hernandez.</p>

The Labor Party's Anthony Albanese is trying to reassure voters that alliances remain strong, while opposition leader Peter Dutton is facing criticism for aligning himself with Trump.
