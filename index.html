          <p>Humans triumphed over generative AI models from Google and OpenAI at the International Mathematical Olympiad, with five young participants achieving perfect scores compared to the AI models' gold-level performance. While the AI models, including Google's Gemini chatbot and OpenAI's experimental reasoning model, reached a significant milestone by earning gold-level scores for the first time, they did not achieve full marks. This development highlights the rapid improvement of AI in complex problem-solving, with Google's model solving problems within the 4.5-hour time limit this year, a significant leap from previous attempts. The event prompts reflection on the accelerating pace of AI development and its potential future capabilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AARP survey indicates that approximately two-thirds of retirees now heavily rely on Social Security for income, a significant increase from half of retirees two decades ago. This growing dependence comes as the program faces long-term financial challenges, including potential benefit reductions starting in 2034, and declining public confidence in its future reliability. Despite these concerns, 96% of Americans view Social Security as important, underscoring its critical role in retirement planning. The survey also found a lack of public understanding regarding basic Social Security facts, such as the age for maximizing benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Todd Blanche, the second-highest ranking official at the Justice Department, announced plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell in the coming days regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, stating no lead is off-limits. This outreach follows President Trump's directive to release all credible evidence, despite an earlier DOJ/FBI memo concluding no "client list" existed and Epstein died by suicide. Concurrently, a House Oversight subcommittee approved a motion to subpoena Maxwell for a deposition, reflecting continued legislative interest in her testimony. Maxwell, convicted for her role in Epstein's abuses, has confirmed discussions with the government, expressing willingness to testify truthfully.</p>

          <p>During a "Malicious Monster Truck Tour" event in Bremerton, Washington, a wheel detached from a monster truck, bouncing out of the arena and crushing several parked cars. Fortunately, the tour confirmed that no one was injured in the incident, though significant property damage occurred. The tour organizers stated the truck used industry-standard restraints and acknowledged the unpredictable nature of motorsports, committing to future safety enhancements and transparency. Video footage captured the dramatic event, showing no fans were in the wheel's path, but the incident highlights inherent risks in such competitions and the need for continuous safety improvements.</p>

          <p>A new provision in President Trump’s reconciliation bill will shift significant Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) costs to states, cutting $186 billion in federal spending over ten years. This change is expected to remove over 3 million Americans from the program, leaving states to decide how much of the $100 billion annual cost to absorb, with some likely to scale back or eliminate benefits. Critics argue these changes, including stricter enrollment requirements, undermine SNAP's purpose of feeding low-income Americans. Food banks are already raising alarms about their capacity to meet the increased demand resulting from these federal cuts.</p>

The retailer cited that customers overwhelmingly price match Target's own prices rather than competitors as the primary reason for this strategic shift. This decision comes as Target faces significant challenges in boosting sales and store traffic, having reported a nearly 3% decline in sales in its most recent quarter amid an "exceptionally challenging environment" and declining consumer confidence in the broader economy.</p>

          <p>A five-day doctors' strike in England, organized by the British Medical Association (BMA), will proceed as planned, despite recent talks with the government. The BMA stated that the government's offer, which included non-pay issues like exam fees and placement control, was insufficient, emphasizing that pay restoration remains the key issue. Health Secretary Wes Streeting criticized the union's decision as "reckless and needless," citing the generous pay rises doctors have received. The BMA, however, warns that NHS England's plan to limit routine treatment cancellations during the strike could put patients at risk by overstretching senior doctors.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has appointed Sir James Cleverly as her shadow housing secretary, a prominent role that will see him challenge Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. This move is part of a larger shake-up of Badenoch's senior team, aimed at reflecting the party's policy renewal program and underlining unity under her leadership. Sir James, a former foreign and home secretary, previously expressed skepticism about withdrawing from the European Convention of Human Rights, a stance that could put him at odds with Badenoch. The reshuffle occurs eight months into Badenoch's leadership, during a period of low polling for the Conservatives.</p>

          <p>The High Court has ruled that the estate of deceased tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his business partner, Sushovan Hussain, owe Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) £700 million. This decision stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's firm Autonomy, with the court finding that Lynch and Hussain fraudulently inflated the company's value, causing HPE to overpay significantly. A spokesperson for Lynch's estate noted his prior statement calling HPE's initial $5 billion claim a "wild overstatement," while HPE looks forward to determining the final damages. The ruling, delayed by Lynch's tragic death last year in a yachting accident, concludes a long-standing legal battle over the acquisition's financial improprieties.</p>

International pressure is mounting, with Germany facing domestic calls to join 25 other nations in demanding an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded aid flow.

The UN human rights office attributes these deaths to Israel's interference and militarization of humanitarian aid, highlighting chaotic scenes at distribution points where Israeli forces have reportedly fired on civilians. The quantity of food and other emergency supplies allowed into Gaza since the full blockade remains vastly insufficient, deepening the crisis for over two million inhabitants and leading to alarming numbers of deaths.</p>

While critics on the left decry it as a blow to free expression, and some on the right celebrate it, the article argues that the decision likely stems from the show's significant financial losses and the changing media consumption habits. The era of mass-appeal, apolitical late-night hosts is over, replaced by niche, partisan content on fragmented platforms.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many credit cards offer a grace period on new purchases, typically 21-25 days, allowing cardholders to avoid interest if they pay their full balance by the due date. However, this grace period often disappears if a balance is carried over from the previous month. Crucially, there is generally no formal grace period for late payments; missing a due date can immediately incur late fees, penalty APRs, and damage to credit scores after 30 days. The article advises contacting the credit card company immediately if a payment will be late, making a partial payment, and exploring debt relief options for consistent struggles.</p>

Further confusion arose with a Chilean journalist providing an alleged death certificate for a man with the same name, adding layers of uncertainty to the case.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates but revealed a $1.1 billion impact from President Trump's auto tariffs, contributing to a 7% drop in shares. Despite this, GM affirmed its full-year guidance, with CEO Mary Barra stating efforts are underway to "greatly reduce" tariff exposure through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. The company anticipates slower demand for electric vehicles after the September 30 expiration of federal tax credits, but expects minimal impact on 2025 results. GM also noted it has become the second-largest EV manufacturer in the U.S., focusing on EV profitability.</p>

          <p>A Harvard University study, analyzing 58,007 women's birthing records, suggests that the odds of having a boy or girl are not always 50/50, but rather follow a "weighted coin toss" within families. Researchers found that if a family's first two children are of the same sex, the likelihood of subsequent children also being that sex increases. For instance, families with three boys had a 61% chance of a fourth boy, and those with three girls had a 58% chance of a fourth girl. While the exact mechanisms are unclear, maternal age at first birth was identified as a contributing factor.</p>

Opendoor's stock tripled in days, fueled by retail traders on forums like WallStreetBets and a hedge fund manager's bullish tout. High short interest in both Opendoor (22%) and Kohl's (50%) suggests short-covering contributed to the rapid price increases, as investors buy back shares to limit losses.

          <p>The article argues that the increasing prevalence of AI-generated content, or "AI slop," on the internet is degrading the online experience, potentially pushing people towards a digital detox. As AI content becomes indistinguishable from reality and infiltrates various platforms, it erodes trust and makes online interactions less authentic. While some users may become more addicted to AI-mediated experiences, the author suggests that skeptics will increasingly turn to the real world for genuine connections, reliable information, and less commodified experiences. This shift could lead to a reorientation towards physical media and in-person interactions, fostering a healthier relationship with technology.</p>

          <p>Zimbabwean lawmakers from the ruling ZANU-PF party are proposing measures to further criminalize government critics, advocating for a national strategy to promote patriotism and national identity. This move builds on the contested Patriotic Act of 2023, which opposition lawmakers and human rights groups argue effectively stifles dissent and violates constitutional rights. Critics emphasize that true patriotism involves questioning injustice and demanding accountability, not blind loyalty. Despite a High Court striking down sections of the 2023 Act, concerns persist over the shrinking democratic space and the use of retrogressive laws to suppress criticism under the current administration.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Communications suggests that living through the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated brain aging by an average of 5.5 months, even in individuals who were not infected. The research, based on UK Biobank brain scans, found these changes were most pronounced in older people, men, and those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. While only infected participants showed a drop in cognitive abilities, the study adds to growing data on the pandemic's long-term health impacts. Scientists suggest that the observed brain aging may be reversible through lifestyle changes like exercise, healthy diet, stress management, and adequate sleep.</p>

UEFA rules prohibit clubs influenced by the same entity from competing in the same European competition, a deadline Palace reportedly missed.
