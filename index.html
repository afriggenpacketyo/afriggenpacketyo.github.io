          <p>The Russian military asserts that all Ukrainian troops have been expelled from Russia's Kursk region, a claim Ukrainian officials have not confirmed. According to Russia's Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, North Korean soldiers fought alongside Russian troops in the region. The news coincides with a meeting between U.S. President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the Vatican on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, where they discussed potential ceasefire negotiations, with both sides expressing readiness for a deal. However, Lavrov stated that some elements need to be "fine tuned."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has accused the Trump administration of deporting a two-year-old U.S. citizen, VML, along with her mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, without any meaningful process. The judge scheduled a hearing to investigate the situation, emphasizing that it is illegal and unconstitutional to deport a U.S. citizen. This case highlights ongoing concerns about the Trump administration's immigration policies and potential violations of due process, with civil rights advocates describing it as a shocking abuse of power and civil rights advocates alarmed about the comments from Trump about sending US citizens to another country to be incarcerated.</p>

          <p>A Federal Reserve Bank of New York analysis reveals that graduates with degrees in education, social work, and the arts tend to earn the lowest median incomes within five years of graduating. The salary figures, based on 2023 data, indicate that early-career pay in these fields falls below the U.S. median wage. While engineering majors can earn upwards of $80,000 early in their careers, many liberal arts and education majors earn closer to $40,000, highlighting the financial disparities among different college majors.
