        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Democratic lawmakers in Louisiana, Representative Aimee Adatto Freeman and Representative Jason Hughes, have demanded the resignation of Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson following the escape of 10 inmates from the Orleans Justice Center. Freeman cited an "alarming failure of leadership" and Hutson's alleged deflection of accountability, despite holding $14 million in reserve, while Hughes emphasized the public safety issue. Hutson has taken "full accountability" for the jailbreak and has temporarily suspended her re-election campaign. Five of the escapees have been recaptured, while five remain at large, facing charges ranging from weapons violations to murder.</p>

          <p>Labour leader Keir Starmer has announced a U-turn on planned cuts to winter fuel payments for pensioners after facing significant political pressure. The cuts, which affected over 10 million pensioners, restricted eligibility to those receiving pension credit and other income-related benefits. Starmer stated that the policy would be changed at the autumn Budget to allow more pensioners to qualify again, although the specifics remain unclear. The move has been met with mixed reactions, with calls for a full reversal and questions about the timing and scope of the changes.</p>

          <p>Public companies are navigating a delicate situation as they are obligated to inform investors about the financial impact of tariffs while trying to avoid criticism from President Trump. The article details how companies like Walmart and Mattel have faced Trump's anger after discussing tariff-related price increases. Crisis communication experts advise executives to use vague language, such as "fluid economic environment," and to let the CFO address tariff issues, avoiding the term "tariff" altogether, opting for terms like "sourcing cost" instead. This situation highlights the challenges companies face in balancing transparency with political considerations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" faces challenges due to disagreements over the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT deduction, which allows taxpayers to deduct state and local taxes, has created a divide between Republicans from high-tax districts and fiscal conservatives. Trump's previous cap on SALT deductions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act led to protests, and while Trump now pledges to end the cap, not all Republicans agree. This issue threatens to derail Trump's tax plan as some GOP members vow to vote against the bill without a SALT cap increase.</p>

Increased liquidity and regulatory updates have also contributed to bitcoin's gains.

          <p>Stock markets experienced a downturn following Target's report of weaker-than-expected sales and a warning about potential consumer pullback due to U.S. tariffs. Target's sales fell by 2.8%, leading to a decline in its stock price and contributing to broader market concerns about slowing consumer spending. The article also notes that the Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and ongoing negotiations over a tax and spending bill are weighing on investor sentiment. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Complex both experienced significant drops.</p>

The EU is considering measures such as initiating an infringement procedure or suspending Hungary's voting rights, although the most likely course of action is another infringement procedure.</p>

The ship, built in 1881, was found in nine feet of water off Manitowoc and had been buried in the sand before recent storms exposed it. The discovery is exciting because it allows a piece of lost history to resurface, with historians racing to document shipwrecks before invasive mussels destroy them. The J.C.
