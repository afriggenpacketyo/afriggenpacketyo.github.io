          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a 46% increase in cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older between 2021 and 2023. Many seniors are turning to marijuana, often in the form of edibles, to address medical issues like chronic pain, PTSD, and anxiety, viewing it as a viable alternative amid diminishing social stigma. However, some medical professionals express concern, citing research that links THC consumption to heightened cardiovascular risks, including heart disease and stroke. The article highlights the growing debate between personal relief and potential health consequences for this demographic.</p>

          <p>A port operator in northeastern China is establishing a new transit center and a dedicated shipping service dubbed the "durian express" to accelerate the delivery of the popular fruit from Southeast Asia. This initiative by Liaoning Port Group aims to reduce shipping times from nearly two weeks to as little as six days, ensuring fresher products for the region's 100 million consumers. The project addresses the logistical challenges of supplying durians to a market that is geographically distant from traditional entry points like Guangzhou or Shenzhen. This development seeks to tap into the growing demand for the fruit in a previously underpenetrated part of the country.</p>

Many of these individuals have been legally working in the country for decades, with a significant number employed as home health aides for the elderly and disabled. Advocacy groups and employers warn that losing these experienced caregivers could exacerbate an already critical nationwide shortage of healthcare workers. The article personalizes the issue through the story of one aide and the family she cares for, highlighting the human cost of the policy change.</p>

          <p>The recent killing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, in an apparently random stabbing on a Charlotte light rail train has ignited a fierce debate over public safety and the justice system. The suspect, who has a long history of criminal charges and documented mental illness, had been released from jail without bail on a prior occasion. The tragic event has drawn national attention, with political figures criticizing local officials for what they describe as a "soft-on-crime" approach that failed to prevent the violence. The incident highlights systemic challenges in managing repeat offenders and individuals with severe psychiatric issues.</p>

          <p>A group of six current and former Meta employees has come forward as whistleblowers, alleging the company actively covered up research showing harm to children on its virtual reality products. They claim that internal studies revealing children's exposure to sexual harassment, grooming, and violence were deliberately doctored or deleted by management. According to the whistleblowers, managers instructed staff to avoid research that could uncover negative findings and, in one case, ordered the removal of an interview detailing an underage user being sexually propositioned.

          <p>John Elkann, the chairman of Ferrari and Stellantis, has agreed to perform one year of community service to settle a major inheritance tax dispute in Italy. He and his siblings will also collectively pay €183 million to Italian tax authorities as part of the agreement. The dispute centered on the estate of their grandmother, Marella Caracciolo, with prosecutors alleging the siblings failed to declare approximately €1 billion in assets. While the agreement resolves the criminal investigation, Elkann's lawyer stated that it does not constitute an admission of liability, framing it as a way to conclude the painful affair.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has dismissed head coach Nuno Espirito Santo, ending his 20-month tenure despite recent successes. Nuno had guided the club to its highest Premier League finish in decades and secured a spot in the Europa League for the first time in nearly 30 years. However, his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis had become increasingly strained, with public comments from Nuno highlighting a breakdown in communication and disagreements over transfer policies.

The murders occurred in 2021 and 2023, with one victim's body being found in a national forest while the other remains missing.

          <p>This article analyzes President Donald Trump's escalating use of violent language, particularly his recent threats to deploy the military against American cities like Chicago and his rebranding of the Defense Department as the "Department of War." It argues that this rhetoric, once directed externally, is now increasingly aimed at a domestic audience, reflecting a broader embrace of machismo and aggression within his administration. The piece connects this trend to past instances, such as encouraging police brutality and the rhetoric preceding the Capitol riot. The author suggests this pattern represents an "imperial boomerang," where tools of repression used abroad are eventually turned inward.</p>

This decline in optimism is coupled with rising anxiety about job security and a broader pessimistic view of the economy.

          <p>"Father Ted" co-creator Graham Linehan has stated in a BBC interview that he does not regret the social media posts that resulted in his arrest last week. Linehan was arrested at Heathrow Airport over posts concerning his views on transgender individuals, which he says were made out of frustration that his concerns about women's rights and gender clinics are being ignored. He described his career and marriage as having been destroyed due to being "cancelled" over his views. The arrest has sparked a wider debate about free speech and policing, with Linehan now planning to sue the police for wrongful arrest.</p>

          <p>Actor Charlie Sheen is opening up about his past, stating he felt "held hostage" by secrets and potential blackmail related to his private life. In promoting his new memoir, Sheen discussed how his past drug addiction led to sexual encounters he paid to keep private, and how he used alcohol to cope with a stutter. He also reflected on the "tremendous relief" of publicly disclosing his HIV-positive diagnosis in 2015 after others had threatened to expose it. Now sober for eight years, Sheen says he wants to be vulnerable and own his stories to free himself from the past.</p>

          <h2>DHS Announces "Operation Midway Blitz" Immigration Crackdown in Chicago</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 17:45:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced a new, intensified immigration enforcement effort in Chicago named "Operation Midway Blitz." The operation will reportedly target "criminal illegal aliens" who, according to the DHS, were drawn to the city due to its sanctuary policies. Chicago's Mayor Brandon Johnson stated the city received no prior notice of the operation and remains opposed to "militarized immigration enforcement without due process," citing ICE's track record of human rights abuses. The announcement follows President Trump's recent rhetoric about sending federal forces to "clean up" the city, escalating tensions between federal and local governments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's order, allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Los Angeles to resume sweeping immigration raids. In a 6-3 decision, the conservative majority ruled that agents can continue to make stops based on factors including a person's race, language, or type of work while a legal challenge proceeds. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a strong dissent, arguing the decision subjects countless people to indignities based on their appearance and accent. The ruling is a significant development in the Trump administration's nationwide immigration crackdown, which has been particularly focused on Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Two Republican senators are opening a congressional investigation into the response of local and state officials to the deadly Palisades fire in California that occurred nine months ago. The probe, led by Senators Rick Scott and Ron Johnson, will examine the adequacy of emergency preparations, with a specific focus on why a local reservoir was empty and whether there was sufficient water to fight the blaze. This adds to several ongoing investigations into the fire, which killed 12 people and destroyed much of the community. The senators stated that families deserve answers and accountability regarding the handling of the emergency.</p>

          <p>The succession battle for Rupert Murdoch's media empire has concluded with a deal that solidifies his son Lachlan's future control of Fox Corp. and News Corp. The 94-year-old mogul and Lachlan have effectively bought out the shares of his three other adult children—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—who had opposed attempts to alter the family trust. This settlement dissolves the old trust and creates a new one solely controlled by Lachlan, ensuring the companies' conservative direction will continue. The deal resolves a bitter family dispute that saw James Murdoch become an outspoken critic of the editorial direction of outlets like Fox News.</p>

          <p>A virtual Brics summit, intended to present a united front against U.S. trade policies, revealed a more cautious approach from its members. Key nations like Brazil and India appeared hesitant to provoke further conflict with the Trump administration, signaling a desire to avoid escalating the ongoing trade war. Notably, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not attend, sending his foreign minister instead, which was interpreted as a move to carefully balance relations with Washington. The meeting highlighted the bloc's internal challenges in forming a cohesive response to U.S. economic pressure, with members prioritizing their own delicate bilateral relationships.</p>

          <p>The trial has commenced for Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump at a Florida golf course in September 2024. The 59-year-old suspect is representing himself in court, a decision the judge strongly advised against. Prosecutors allege Routh was found hiding in bushes with a semiautomatic rifle and had left a note confessing to the assassination attempt. The incident, which occurred just two months after another gunman wounded Trump at a rally, has highlighted the issue of political violence and prompted scrutiny of Secret Service protocols.</p>
