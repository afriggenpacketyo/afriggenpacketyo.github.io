          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has withdrawn charges against two British men, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. Prosecutors determined the evidence did not meet the threshold for trial, leading to not guilty verdicts. One of the accused men described the two years since his arrest as a "nightmare," expressing relief that justice had been served, while the UK Home Office called the outcome disappointing given the seriousness of the allegations.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tesla experienced a significant jump after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's stock since 2020, acquiring approximately $1 billion worth of shares. This rare and substantial insider purchase was interpreted by traders as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer. The move boosted Musk's ownership stake to around 13% and came as the company seeks shareholder approval for a new, ambitious pay package for its chief executive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Human Rights Watch is calling on major American comedians, including Dave Chappelle and Kevin Hart, not to be complicit in "whitewashing" Saudi Arabia's human rights record by performing at the upcoming Riyadh Comedy Festival. The organization argues that the Saudi government uses such high-profile entertainment events to deflect from ongoing abuses, such as the execution of journalists and suppression of dissent. This situation places the performers in a difficult ethical position, similar to controversies surrounding other Saudi-funded ventures like LIV Golf.</p>

          <p>A new UNICEF report reveals a landmark shift in global child nutrition, as obesity among school-aged children has become more common than being underweight for the first time on record. While the decline in the number of underweight children represents significant progress in combating scarcity-driven malnutrition, it is overshadowed by a rapid surge in obesity. This new crisis is largely attributed to the global proliferation of cheap, ultra-processed foods and increasingly sedentary lifestyles among children.</p>

          <p>The murder trial of a former British paratrooper, identified only as Soldier F, has commenced in Belfast for his alleged role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Northern Ireland. He is accused of murdering two men and attempting to murder five others when soldiers opened fire on civil rights demonstrators.

          <h2>UCLA Study Finds Los Angeles County Water Bills Are Rising Faster Than Inflation</h2>

          <p>According to a new UCLA report, the average cost of water in Los Angeles County has surged by nearly 60% in the last decade, significantly outpacing the rate of inflation. This trend is escalating water affordability challenges, particularly for low-income households. Researchers attribute the rising costs to essential investments in aging infrastructure, drought preparedness, and compliance with water quality standards, highlighting growing economic and social equity concerns for a basic human right.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Moves to End Federal Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed to dismantle a federal program that has required thousands of industrial facilities to report their greenhouse gas emissions for nearly two decades. The Environmental Protection Agency framed the move as a way to save businesses billions in regulatory costs, calling the program "bureaucratic red tape." Environmental advocates condemned the decision, stating it undermines climate science and public transparency, though California is noted as being better insulated due to its own comprehensive state-level reporting system.</p>

          <p>The California Public Utilities Commission is poised to approve a nearly 10% rate hike for Southern California Edison, increasing the average residential customer's bill by approximately $17 per month starting in October. Edison claims the additional revenue is crucial for upgrading its grid and funding wildfire prevention measures. The increase has sparked outrage from customers, who point to ongoing power outages and the utility's role in sparking catastrophic wildfires as reasons to deny the request.

          <p>A Department of Justice settlement proposal reviewed by the L.A. Times details the Trump administration's demands for a radical, conservative-aligned overhaul of UCLA. In exchange for unfreezing nearly half a billion in research grants, the government is demanding a $1.2 billion fine and sweeping changes to campus policies on admissions, hiring, gender identity, and free speech. The proposal includes ending gender-affirming care for minors and ensuring foreign students deemed "anti-Western" are not admitted, which UC leaders have labeled "extortion."</p>

          <h2>Proposed 'Zone Zero' Wildfire Rule in California Sparks Debate Over Environmental Impact</h2>

          <p>A proposed California regulation to create a five-foot, plant-free "zone zero" around homes in high-risk fire areas is facing significant debate. State fire officials and proponents argue it is a critical measure to protect structures from embers, which are a primary cause of home ignition during wildfires. However, opponents, including community groups and environmental scientists, warn that the one-size-fits-all rule could devastate urban tree canopies, increase heat, and destroy habitats without guaranteeing safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to intensifying extreme heat, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed an ordinance requiring landlords to ensure all habitable rooms in rental units can be cooled to 82 degrees or below. The deadline for compliance is 2027 for larger landlords and 2032 for those with 10 or fewer units, though a single cooled zone is required sooner. This policy is a significant step toward protecting vulnerable renters from the health dangers of heatwaves, which also strain the region's power grid.</p>

          <p>California health officials are creating their own COVID-19 vaccine guidelines, citing a loss of trust in federal agencies under the Trump administration. The move follows the replacement of the CDC's expert advisory committee with individuals known for vaccine skepticism, leading California to align its recommendations with professional medical groups instead. To ensure science-based guidance, California has also formed the West Coast Health Alliance with Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii, signaling a major break from federal public health leadership.</p>
