          <h2>India and Pakistan Reach Ceasefire Agreement Amid Rising Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 08:31:58 EDT</div>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, mediated by the United States, to de-escalate tensions that have been escalating since an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir. President Trump announced the ceasefire on social media, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the U.S.'s role in brokering the agreement. Indian officials initially reported attacks by Pakistan across 26 locations, but later agreed to the ceasefire, indicating a commitment to non-escalation if reciprocated. This agreement aims to ease cross-border fire and strikes that have caused civilian casualties on both sides.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the collapsing birth rates around the world and argues that this demographic crisis should be a concern for progressives. The author contends that an aging and shrinking population will lead to a decrease in the quality of life, strain the economy, and potentially harm the environment. Dismissing pronatalism as solely a right-wing issue is a mistake, the article suggests, and progressives should engage in policies that support people in having children if they desire, such as affordable housing, universal pre-K, and better healthcare. Ignoring this issue, the author warns, cedes critical ground to those with less inclusive politics.</p>

          <p>The conflict between India and Pakistan intensified as both nations exchanged missile strikes targeting air bases and military installations, with each side claiming to have acted in retaliation. Pakistan reported that India targeted at least three of its air bases, while India stated it struck Pakistani military targets in response to a wave of attacks using drones and fighter planes. The United States urged both countries to de-escalate, amid concerns that the crisis could spiral into a broader confrontation. The fighting has caused civilian casualties and prompted international diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the resurgence of silicosis, a deadly lung disease, and the dismantling of federal efforts to control it under the Trump administration. The author highlights that DOGE fired the team in charge of the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program, and the White House scrapped NIOSH's functions. The article also mentions the increasing cases of silicosis in the artificial stone countertop industry, particularly among Latino immigrants, and criticizes the administration's lack of resources and enforcement to prevent the disease.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how part-time jobs have become a trap for low-wage workers in America, with employers exploiting the lack of a minimum work hour requirement. The rise of just-in-time scheduling and the hiring of multiple part-time staff in place of full-time workers leads to inconsistent schedules and lack of benefits, making it difficult for workers to earn a decent living. The author argues that Congress should address this issue by requiring employers to set schedules in advance and removing incentives for hiring part-time workers. Ultimately, the article advocates for policy changes that would provide more stable and predictable work opportunities for low-wage workers.</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks claims by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) that the German domestic intelligence agency has withdrawn its classification of the party as "confirmed right-wing extremist." The BfV complied with the AfD's request to follow a so-called "standstill commitment" (Stillhaltezusage). This means that the agency is putting its official reclassification of the AfD as a right-wing extremist party on hold. The article clarifies that the classification was not withdrawn, and the agency is only pausing the designation to allow the court time to review the case. The article concludes that the AfD's interpretation of the "standstill" order as a partial success is misleading.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, made an uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere after being stranded in orbit for 53 years due to a rocket booster failure. The spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War-era space race, splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The event serves as a reminder of the ambitious space exploration programs of the past and the challenges of interplanetary travel. Despite the failure of its primary mission, the Kosmos-482's re-entry highlights the legacy of the Soviet Venera program, which achieved several firsts in the exploration of Venus.</p>

It discusses how China has increased exports, directed lending to industrial borrowers, and introduced economic warfare tactics like export controls. While China still relies on the West for some technologies, its willingness to weaponize the supply chain challenges the supremacy of the United States. The article also highlights the costs of this strategy to Chinese households and the potential for a cleaving of the world into competing spheres of influence.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the challenges Ukraine faces as U.S. support diminishes, with European allies struggling to provide the necessary weapons and aid. The lack of U.S. assistance has led Ukraine to seek deals for future revenue over natural resources, hoping to secure continued arms shipments. As European leaders attempt to fill the void, concerns rise about their capacity to match the scale of the challenge, given their own rearmament needs and industrial limitations. The article paints a concerning picture for Ukraine's future as it navigates an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>A new bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), introduced by Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar, aims to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances in the United States. The bill would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that restrict federal funding for research of Schedule I substances. While opinions differ on its likelihood of passage, supporters say the bill would prioritize evidence over ideology, allowing policymakers to study the effects of cannabis legalization and inform future legislation. The EBDPA would also permit research on other Schedule I substances, such as psilocybin and MDMA, which may have therapeutic potential.</p>
