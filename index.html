This determination by the IPC has intensified international pleas for a ceasefire, though Israel has denounced the famine declaration as false and is pressing ahead with preparations to seize Gaza City. Aid groups report that the quantity of food reaching Gaza remains insufficient, while the conflict continues to displace and kill civilians, with the Health Ministry reporting over 62,000 deaths since the war began.

          <p>Transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell's July prison interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche have been released, revealing her denials of witnessing any inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or former President Bill Clinton. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for a sex-trafficking scheme, also stated that a much-discussed 'client list' does not exist and dismissed allegations against Prince Andrew as 'mind-blowingly not conceivable.' The family of prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre expressed outrage, arguing that Maxwell was given a platform to 'rewrite history.'

          <p>The ongoing Ukraine war is significantly reshaping geopolitics in former Soviet states, most notably evidenced by a US-mediated peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia, signaling a decline in Russia's regional influence. While Russia officially welcomed the agreement, some analysts view it as a 'terrible humiliation' for Moscow. Azerbaijan is actively forging new alliances with Turkey and Central Asian countries, leveraging its financial independence and military cooperation. The article suggests that Russia's preoccupation with the conflict in Ukraine has created a 'window of opportunity' for these nations to assert greater independence and diversify their foreign policy. This article explores the evolving power dynamics in the post-Soviet space.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has announced it will not defend a decades-old grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), aligning with a lawsuit that deems the funding unconstitutional. The department cited the 2023 Supreme Court decision outlawing affirmative action, arguing that the program provides an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity. Over 500 HSIs, which collectively enroll 67% of the nation's Latino undergraduate students, are eligible for these grants, and a national association representing these universities plans to intervene in the lawsuit to defend the program's constitutionality.

This stance is likely to create contention with his coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), who advocate for imaginative solutions rather than just benefit cuts. Merz's comments aim to appeal to his traditional voter base and those who have shifted to the far-right.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal of potential interest rate cuts ignited a significant rally on Wall Street on Friday, particularly boosting cyclical and economically sensitive non-tech stocks such as DuPont and Home Depot. This positive market reaction followed a topsy-turvy week, with investors welcoming the prospect of lower borrowing costs. While some major tech stocks saw only modest gains, their trajectory is more closely linked to the ongoing artificial intelligence boom rather than interest rate fluctuations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average achieved a new all-time high, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also posted rallies, though they did not surpass last week's milestones. Consumer discretionary stocks notably led the S&P 500, reflecting the expectation that reduced rates will increase disposable income for consumers, stimulating spending across the economy.
