          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has finalized a season-long loan deal for Paris St-Germain's 26-year-old striker, Randal Kolo Muani. The France international, who has won two Ligue 1 titles with PSG, joins Spurs as their fourth senior signing of the summer, aiming to bolster their attacking options for their return to the Champions League. Kolo Muani expressed his pride in joining a great club and his commitment to giving his all for the team. The move provides Spurs with a versatile forward who can play both centrally and out wide, offering a different style to their existing strikers.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has strengthened its defense by signing Ecuador international Piero Hincapie from Bayer Leverkusen on a season-long loan. The deal includes a £45 million option for a permanent transfer next summer for the 23-year-old, who was part of Leverkusen's Bundesliga-winning squad. Manager Mikel Arteta praised Hincapie's physical presence and versatility, stating he will make the squad stronger and more competitive. The signing is seen as a direct replacement for Jakub Kiwior, who has been loaned out to Porto, as Arsenal continues to reshape its roster for the season.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's attempt to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi on transfer deadline day has collapsed despite the clubs agreeing to a fee of at least £35 million. The deal fell through because Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement in time, with their target Igor Julio choosing a move to West Ham instead. Guehi, who had been a key target for Liverpool to reinforce their defense, will now remain at Crystal Palace. The development was a setback for Liverpool on an otherwise busy day that saw them agree to a record deal for striker Alexander Isak.</p>

          <p>Global food corporation Nestlé has dismissed its CEO, Laurent Freixe, with immediate effect after an investigation found he violated the company's code of conduct. The termination was due to an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate, which the company deemed a necessary decision to uphold its values and governance. Freixe, who had been with the company since 1986 and CEO for one year, will be replaced by Philipp Navratil, a long-serving Nestlé executive. The company chairman emphasized that Nestlé's strong foundations and strategic course will remain unchanged despite the leadership shake-up.</p>

          <p>Oman has launched a "Golden Residency" program, becoming the latest Gulf state to offer long-term visas to wealthy foreigners in exchange for significant investment. To qualify, applicants must invest at least $520,000 in property, bonds, or businesses that create local jobs. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to stimulate private sector growth and attract international talent and capital. Investment migration experts note a growing trend among wealthy individuals, including Americans, seeking second residencies for financial security and greater freedom of movement in an increasingly unpredictable world.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," features Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. The movie explores the personal crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss, which led to struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. Johnson's performance, enhanced by prosthetics, portrays the vulnerability of a seemingly invincible athlete forced to confront his demons outside the ring. The film, which also co-stars Emily Blunt as Kerr's girlfriend, focuses on the psychological toll of defeat and the difficult path to recovery for a celebrated fighter.</p>

          <p>An analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data reveals a significant decline in the number of immigrant workers in the United States, with a drop of 1.2 million from January to July. This reduction, which includes both legal and undocumented workers, aligns with the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies and increased enforcement actions. Economists note that this trend could impact sectors heavily reliant on immigrant labor, such as agriculture and construction, potentially leading to labor shortages and affecting economic growth. The slowdown in immigration is projected to continue, complicating labor market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

The policy, which orders school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has led to the removal of classic novels, including Atwood's own "The Handmaid's Tale." Her new story sarcastically describes perfectly behaved children who grow up without any knowledge of human biology, a direct jab at the restrictive nature of the ban.

          <p>A tragic all-terrain vehicle crash at an off-roading park in Alabama resulted in the deaths of two adults and injuries to seven children. The nine individuals were riding in a single side-by-side RZR vehicle when it overturned and struck a tree in a remote area of the park. Authorities reported that none of the occupants were wearing proper safety restraints or harnesses at the time of the accident. The incident has prompted officials to emphasize the critical importance of adhering to safety protocols when operating recreational vehicles to prevent such devastating outcomes.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly backed his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over her past purchase of a flat in Hove. The controversy centers on allegations that she may have improperly minimized her tax liability by misrepresenting her primary residence. Despite calls from the Conservative party for a standards investigation, Starmer expressed his pride in Rayner, describing her as a "great story of British success" who has faced repeated attempts to undermine her. A spokesperson for Rayner has maintained that she paid all relevant taxes on the property purchase entirely properly and in line with requirements.</p>

          <p>A scientific study from the University of Montpellier has revealed a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domesticated animals, beginning in the Middle Ages. Researchers analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones found that while both groups previously followed similar size cycles, a shift occurred around 1000 AD. Wild species like foxes and deer began to shrink due to habitat loss and intensified hunting. In contrast, domesticated animals such as sheep, cattle, and chickens grew larger as humans exerted more control through selective breeding and specialized management, highlighting humanity's profound and lasting impact on the natural world.</p>

          <p>The intense fan rivalry over the romantic storyline in the hit show "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has escalated to a point where Prime Video has launched a campaign for kindness. Supporters of the show's two main love interests have engaged in online hostility, sometimes targeting the actors themselves. A board-certified psychiatrist explains this behavior as a sign of parasocial relationships, where one-sided bonds with media figures blur the line between fiction and reality. The network's intervention highlights a growing concern over toxic fandom and the need for viewers to remember the real people behind the characters.</p>

          <p>In its UK financial accounts, iconic American apparel company Levi's has warned that rising anti-American sentiment, which it links to President Trump's tariffs and government policies, could negatively impact its sales. The company fears that British consumers may increasingly favor national or European brands over American ones. This concern was listed as a key risk, alongside challenges like high inflation reducing consumer spending power and increased competition from retailer's own-label products. The statement is a rare instance of a major US brand openly connecting potential sales declines to the political climate created by the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's nationalized rail operator, has officially scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for traveling during traditional rush hours. The move is intended to encourage more people to use the train service, as post-pandemic travel patterns have left more capacity available on commuter trains. While passengers welcome the cheaper tickets, the initiative has sparked a debate on whether a similar policy could work in the rest of the UK. Experts are divided, with some warning it could lead to overcrowding on busy routes or potentially higher overall ticket prices to offset the lost revenue.</p>
