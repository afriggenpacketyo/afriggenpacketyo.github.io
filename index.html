          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the House budget bill, calling it the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years," while dismissing concerns about rising federal deficits. This statement comes in response to a Congressional Budget Office analysis suggesting the bill's tax provisions could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Johnson asserted that the bill will stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing business expansion and U.S. manufacturing. Republican senators have expressed reservations about the bill, signaling potential changes in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration continues to release people charged with illegal entry to non-governmental shelters along the US-Mexico border, despite raising concerns that such aid may violate smuggling laws. Shelters, which provide temporary housing and meals, were rattled by a FEMA letter suggesting they may be committing felony offenses. Despite this, ICE continues to request shelter services, placing these organizations in a difficult position. The releases include individuals from various countries who have been ordered released by immigration judges while awaiting court proceedings.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are debating the merits of protecting entire ecosystems rather than focusing solely on individual endangered species, particularly in light of the Trump administration's efforts to weaken the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The current act's emphasis on saving individual species can be inefficient and reactive, prompting some to advocate for a native ecosystem-protection act that would safeguard larger areas and multiple species simultaneously. While challenges exist in defining and categorizing ecosystems, this approach could provide a more comprehensive and sustainable method for biodiversity conservation.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision regarding the removal of officials from the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards has raised concerns about the expansion of presidential power. Kate Shaw argues that the court's action effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument, potentially emboldening the Trump administration to act outside traditional constitutional boundaries. This decision, along with others involving the presidency, has prompted debate over the balance of power and the rule of law.</p>
