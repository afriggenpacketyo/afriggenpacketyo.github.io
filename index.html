          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano by a majority decision in the third fight of their rivalry at Madison Square Garden, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship. The bout, which was part of the first all-female card at the iconic venue, was a tactical affair rather than an all-out war like their previous encounters. Taylor's victory was seen as a clear result, with the 39-year-old using her boxing intelligence and a strong finish to secure the win. Both fighters expressed mutual respect after the historic match, which further cemented their legacy in women's boxing.</p>

          <p>A property developer has been engaged in an eight-year legal dispute with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family over a luxury penthouse on Park Lane in London. The conflict, which began over a lift installation agreement, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched renovations, and the malicious use of a noisy lift at night. The article also references a separate BBC report on allegations of sexual assault against Fayed. The ongoing High Court case reflects the combative business style associated with Al Fayed, which appears to be continuing after his death.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. Pitcher Dustin May struggled, allowing seven runs, which created a deficit the team's potent offense could not overcome. A highlight for the Dodgers was Shohei Ohtani's 32nd home run, which landed in McCovey's Cove, but it wasn't enough to turn the tide. The loss marks the team's longest losing streak since 2017 and shrinks their division lead, highlighting inconsistencies as they approach the All-Star break.</p>

          <p>Sedrick T. Stevenson, a fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of a smiling Stevenson on the return flight, where he was under heavy guard by multiple law enforcement agencies to prevent another incident. Stevenson, who was originally wanted on firearm and drug charges, had been at large for over a month before being apprehended by U.S. Marshals in Seattle. Authorities noted the extensive coordination required to ensure his secure and uneventful transport back to face charges.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, author Raja Shehadeh argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in the ruins of Rafah constitutes a crime against humanity, likening it to a concentration camp. The author contends that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians, citing the non-enforcement of UN resolutions and the continued military support for Israel from Western nations. Despite this perceived failure of legal institutions, the piece finds hope in Palestinian resilience and the concept of "sumoud," or steadfastness. The author suggests the truth of the suffering in Gaza will eventually emerge and hold Israel accountable.</p>

          <p>Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal are reportedly close to collapsing, according to Palestinian officials. The officials claim Israel's delegation in Doha lacked the authority to make decisions on key issues, such as the extent of troop withdrawals and the mechanism for aid distribution, effectively stalling the talks. A major point of contention was a map provided by Israel showing its intent to maintain a much larger buffer zone inside Gaza than previously discussed. This move has reportedly eroded trust and led to accusations that Israel was using the talks to buy time.</p>

          <p>Chinese analysts are observing a growing, yet potentially unstable, alliance between parts of the U.S. tech sector and the "Make America Great Again" political movement. This alignment, which includes deepening ties with the defense industry, could result in a more aggressive "tech hawk" stance against China, pushing for continued technological containment and decoupling. However, some researchers suggest that underlying tensions between the tech elite and the MAGA camp could ultimately undermine these efforts.

The decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other groups, which accused the Trump administration of unconstitutional practices such as racial profiling and warrantless arrests.

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has initiated a major $365-million expansion project, despite a recent slowdown in cargo movement attributed to global trade uncertainty and tariff policies. The project, led by terminal operator International Transportation Service, will increase the port's cargo-handling capacity by 50% and enable it to accommodate larger container ships. Officials expressed confidence in the long-term necessity of the infrastructure investment, even as recent data shows a significant drop in container processing and exports. The groundbreaking ceremony highlighted the port's strategy of building for future demand in a volatile economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous former drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a U.S. federal court. Prosecutors accused Guzman Lopez of being one of the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, taking over after his father's extradition and conviction. As part of a plea deal, he admitted to coordinating the transport of various drugs into the U.S. and agreed to forfeit $80 million in assets. In exchange for his full cooperation, he will receive a reduced sentence, marking a significant development in U.S. efforts to dismantle the cartel's leadership.</p>

Retailers, some of whom have stocked the brand for over two decades, received a generic email stating the decision was final and part of a "brand elevation strategy." The move comes after a surge in Jellycat's popularity, driven by social media, which has also led to stock shortages for smaller stores.

This warning comes as the Trump administration has intensified immigration enforcement across Southern California, leading to widespread anxiety.

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle a 123-year-old railway bridge in Prague and replace it with a new, three-track structure has drawn significant criticism. While the authority argues the new bridge is necessary to handle projected increases in rail traffic, preservationists and architects contend the iconic Vysehrad bridge is a key part of the city's panorama and can be repaired. An international foundation of experts claims that only 15% of the steel needs replacement, not 70% as previously stated. The debate pits the demands of modern transportation against the preservation of historical heritage in the architecturally rich European capital.</p>

Satellite imagery and planning documents reveal a large-scale development with numerous hotels and entertainment facilities, modeled in part on the Spanish resort of Benidorm.
