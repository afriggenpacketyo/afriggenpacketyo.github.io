          <p>The Trump administration is undergoing personnel changes, with Dan Scavino taking over as director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton criticized Trump's Ukraine policy in a new op-ed. Trump also voiced his opinion on Cracker Barrel's logo redesign, urging them to revert to the old design. Republican legislators from Indiana are meeting with White House officials, potentially to discuss redistricting, though spokespeople claim it is not on the agenda, while the White House aims to gain more U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Whirlpool anticipates that President Trump's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum will provide them with a competitive edge against foreign competitors like LG and Samsung. The company manufactures 80% of its products in the U.S. and sources 96% of its metal domestically, leading to higher prices for American consumers. The tariffs could level the playing field by increasing costs for foreign competitors, potentially spurring domestic manufacturing and hiring. Research indicates similar tariffs on washing machines during Trump's first term increased prices for consumers by an average of $86 (not investment advice).</p>

Despite his background as a child psychologist, Dobson promoted strict disciplinary measures and traditional family values.

They claim the killings were committed in self-defense after years of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse by their parents.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever cautioned against seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Ukraine. They argued that such a move could set a dangerous legal precedent and potentially destabilize capital markets. A Frankfurt court ruled that Apple misled consumers by marketing some of its watches as "carbon neutral". Some Afghans in Pakistan awaiting German visas may soon be able to travel to Germany, following court challenges to the government's initial resistance.</p>

          <p>Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, is facing removal by Donald Trump amid allegations of falsifying mortgage documents. Cook denies the allegations and intends to sue, asserting that Trump lacks the authority to remove her. Cook's career spans government and academia, with a focus on the intersection of economics, race, and discrimination. Since joining the board, she has consistently voted in line with Chair Jerome Powell, supporting decisions to cut interest rates and hold them steady.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing alleged false statements on her mortgage applications. Cook is challenging the removal, claiming Trump lacks the authority to do so, leading to a potential lawsuit. The move raises questions about the Fed's independence, as Cook's removal could allow Trump to appoint someone more aligned with his economic agenda. Cook, appointed by Joe Biden in 2022, is the first African American woman to serve in the role, and her removal could have significant implications for US monetary policy.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's proposed immigration strategy, unveiled by Nigel Farage, has garnered significant attention, potentially surpassing efforts by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. The party's focus on illegal immigration aligns with voter concerns, particularly regarding small boat crossings. While solutions from political parties have become more radical, with the Conservatives considering leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, Reform's plans, including leaving the convention altogether, are the most extreme. Questions remain about the practicality and legality of Reform's proposals, particularly concerning deporting unaccompanied children and returning individuals to unsafe countries.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that large methane leaks at oil and gas facilities in the U.S. release toxic air pollutants, including cancer-causing benzene, posing health risks to nearby communities.

Researchers have launched an interactive map to highlight the health risks associated with these methane releases, but residents are often unaware of the potential impacts.

          <p>Botswana's president, Duma Boko, has declared a public health emergency due to critical shortages of essential medicines and equipment. The announcement follows the Ministry of Health's suspension of non-urgent surgeries due to a lack of medications for various conditions. Boko blamed the state procurement agency for inflated drug prices, exacerbated by a downturn in the global diamond market and cuts in US aid. The president allocated £13.8m in emergency funding for medicines, to be overseen by the military, highlighting the severity of the crisis.</p>

          <p>Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin called for a more aggressive approach from the Democratic Party in combating President Trump's policies. Martin expressed frustration with Democrats "bringing a pencil to a knife fight," urging them to stand up and fight more effectively. He emphasized the need to win elections rather than just winning arguments over policy, highlighting the importance of resources and attention to state and local parties. The DNC chair referred to the president as an "orange bastard", reflecting the party's increasingly confrontational stance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are weighing in on the mortgage interest rate forecast for fall 2025, with opinions varying on whether rates will rise or drop. The Federal Reserve's September meeting and potential rate cut are key factors influencing the outlook. While a September rate cut may already be factored into the market, further cuts in October and December could lead to lower rates later in the fall. Fannie Mae projects mortgage rates around 6.5% by the end of the year, while others anticipate rates closer to 6%, impacting the homebuying landscape (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The CDC's "Tips From Former Smokers" ads, credited with helping millions quit smoking, are set to end in September due to funding cuts. The ads, featuring real stories about the harm of smoking, prompted increased calls to quitlines and sparked numerous quit attempts. Public health advocates warn that ending the campaign will cost lives and increase healthcare costs. The cuts are part of a larger overhaul of CDC's work on chronic diseases, raising concerns about the future of tobacco prevention and cessation efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering the possibility of the U.S. government acquiring equity stakes in leading defense contractors like Lockheed Martin. The revelation comes after the U.S. government acquired a 10% stake in Intel, signaling a potential shift in economic strategy. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the Pentagon is actively exploring the idea, with President Trump rethinking how the U.S. finances its defense capabilities. Critics warn that such moves could undermine free-market principles and pose risks for the companies involved.</p>

          <p>U.S. markets showed stability on Tuesday morning despite President Trump's announcement that he had removed Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.

          <p>Investors with large profits in taxable brokerage accounts may qualify for 0% capital gains taxes, allowing them to take profits without triggering a tax bill. Many investors are unaware of their eligibility for the 0% bracket, which depends on taxable income. President Donald Trump's tax law, while not changing capital gains rates, introduced new deductions that could lower taxable income for 2025. The new tax break for older Americans could further reduce taxable income, presenting a golden opportunity to sell assets at 0% capital gains (not investment advice).</p>

The lawsuit challenged a standing order that barred federal immigration officials from immediately removing migrants challenging their detentions. Judge Cullen found that the U.S. lacked the legal right to sue and the judges were immune from the suit.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts debate the most energy-efficient way to use air conditioning, with some advocating for turning it off when leaving home and others recommending continuous operation. Setting the thermostat a few degrees higher while away is generally considered the best balance between energy efficiency and comfort. Factors such as climate, home insulation, and AC unit type influence energy savings. Adjusting the thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit for eight hours a day can save up to 10% a year on heating and cooling, while humidity levels may impact the feasibility of turning off the AC entirely.</p>
