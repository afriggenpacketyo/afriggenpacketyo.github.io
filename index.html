          <p>A student-led movement in Serbia is challenging President Aleksandar Vucic's autocratic government, marked by a unique display of solidarity, including Muslim students supporting Orthodox Easter protests. The movement gained momentum after a train station collapse in Novi Sad that killed 16 people, with protesters demanding accountability for alleged corruption behind the tragedy. Despite government attempts to quell the unrest through resignations and financial incentives, a massive demonstration involving nearly half a million people filled the streets of Belgrade. The article emphasizes the protesters' horizontal decision-making and determination to bring about change, setting an example for the world despite facing intimidation and imprisonment.</p>

          <p>The International Chamber of Shipping reports that shipping companies will need to adapt to new trading barriers, including tariffs and port fees, as global trade powers navigate trade wars. Guy Platten, secretary-general of the ICS, emphasizes the industry's resilience and ability to adjust to market changes. The US is set to impose fees on vessels owned or operated by companies in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, along with charges on Chinese-built vessels entering US ports, starting in October.

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) announced it will disband and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey after four decades of armed conflict. The decision was announced by the Firat News Agency, following a party congress in northern Iraq, and comes after PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, imprisoned since 1999, urged the group to convene a congress and formally decide to disband. The PKK has led an armed insurgency since 1984, claiming tens of thousands of lives and is listed as a terror group by Turkey and its Western allies. The group says it has carried the Kurdish issue to a level where it can be solved by democratic politics, completing its historical mission.</p>

While the U.S. has expressed intentions to prioritize the Americas, Latin American countries are wary of U.S. tariffs and actions. The article also mentions that trade between China and Latin America has significantly increased, but Latin American countries are also concerned about Chinese exporters flooding their markets with cheap goods.</p>

The blackout, which lasted for several hours, affected the entire Iberian Peninsula, disrupting services and stranding thousands of train passengers. While Spanish authorities are investigating the cause, some observers have pointed to the region's high reliance on wind and solar energy as a potential factor. However, the Spanish Prime Minister and grid operator have stated that record levels of renewable energy were not the cause.</p>

          <p>Nina Mohanty, a millennial entrepreneur, raised $2 million to develop Bloom Money, a fintech app that caters to traditional money-saving methods used by immigrant communities in the U.K. The app supports collaborative saving practices known as "money circles" or rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs). Mohanty observed that mainstream banks often fail to understand how immigrant communities manage their money, focusing primarily on remittance rather than pooling resources and building wealth locally. The app aims to address issues such as lack of regulation and suspicion from mainstream banks when these practices are conducted informally.</p>

          <p>The acceptance of a luxury plane by the Trump administration from the Qatari royal family has ignited controversy, raising questions about constitutional rules against bribery and corruption. US presidents have a long history of receiving gifts from foreign powers, ranging from furniture to animals, which are typically managed through a bureaucratic process. Gifts valued over $480 are considered property of the United States, but presidents can retain them by paying fair market value.

          <p>After trade talks in Geneva, the United States and China offered differing accounts of the outcome, leaving financial markets and businesses uncertain. While U.S. officials declared a "deal," China's vice premier for economic policy, He Lifeng, acknowledged "important consensus" but stopped short of confirming an agreement. The negotiations aimed to ease tensions following President Trump's imposition of heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, which prompted retaliatory measures from China. Despite the differing narratives, financial markets reacted positively, awaiting further details in a joint statement from both countries.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced that it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement.

Alexander, 21, was serving in an elite infantry unit on the border with Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants during the October 7 attack. The Israeli PM's office said it had not committed to any ceasefire but only to a "safe corridor" for Mr Alexander's release.</p>

With increased military spending to 2.5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product by 2027, the government hopes to rejuvenate struggling towns, improve health care, and attract skilled workers.
