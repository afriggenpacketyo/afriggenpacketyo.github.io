          <p>The Asian semiconductor market showed a mixed reaction to President Trump's proposal for a 100% tariff on imported chips, with an exemption for companies investing in U.S. manufacturing. Japanese chipmakers like Tokyo Electron saw their stocks fall, while South Korean giants Samsung and SK Hynix, along with Taiwan's TSMC, rose on expectations of exemptions due to their significant U.S. investments. The policy's full impact remains uncertain pending further details, but analysts suggest large companies with capital for U.S. expansion are positioned as the immediate beneficiaries.

Officials confirmed the outage was specific to United's systems, not a broader air traffic control issue or a cyberattack, and the airline is covering expenses for affected customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a plan to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made computer chips, a move aimed at incentivizing domestic manufacturing. Companies building facilities in the U.S., such as Apple, which concurrently announced a new $100 billion domestic investment, would be exempt from the import tax. This policy marks a departure from the subsidy-based approach of the 2022 CHIPS Act, instead using punitive measures to reshore production, which could raise costs for electronics and other goods.

          <p>Actor Dean Cain, known for playing Superman, appeared in a video encouraging people to join U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), citing the agency's role in arresting dangerous criminals. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security used an image from an upcoming "South Park" episode featuring ICE agents in a recruitment post on social media, prompting a satirical response from the show's creators. The article contrasts Cain's claims with data suggesting most ICE detainees have no criminal convictions, highlighting the cultural and political debate surrounding the agency's tactics.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Governor Cites Concerning Jobs Report Revisions as Potential Economic Turning Point</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook described the recent U.S. jobs report as "concerning," highlighting that the significant downward revisions for May and June are often typical of economic turning points. The report showed weaker-than-expected job growth in July and erased 258,000 jobs from previous estimates, prompting President Trump to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner. Cook also noted that businesses are facing an "uncertainty tax" as they spend more time preparing for macroeconomic shifts, including new tariffs, which acts as a drag on the economy.

          <h2>Analysis Shows Trump's Timeline of Jobs Report Revisions is Inaccurate</h2>

          <p>President Trump's justification for firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner rests on claims that the agency "rigged" jobs data, but his timeline of events is incorrect. Trump alleged the BLS released strong numbers before the 2024 election and revised them down afterward, but a major downward revision of 818,000 jobs was actually announced in August 2024, months before the election. Furthermore, the final report before the election, released on November 1, showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which Trump himself used at the time to criticize his opponent.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could deliver a multibillion-dollar blow to India's economy, though the impact will be uneven across sectors. While only about 2% of India's GDP is tied to U.S. exports, industries like gems, jewelry, apparel, and textiles are considered highly vulnerable. However, key sectors such as IT services and pharmaceuticals, which are major exports to the U.S., are not targeted by the current goods-focused tariffs and are expected to be largely insulated from the direct impact.

With universities making more offers than in previous years, applicants are in a strong position as institutions are reportedly keen to fill their courses for the upcoming academic year.</p>

Local governments are calling for stronger powers to bring these homes back into use, and charities are working to transform some vacant properties into affordable housing for those facing homelessness.</p>
