          <p>A woman's quick thinking was instrumental in solving the three-year mystery of a missing cyclist in Scotland. After her new boyfriend confessed to a fatal hit-and-run, he showed her the remote burial site. She secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later alerted the police, leading them directly to the remains of Tony Parsons. The victim's family expressed immense gratitude, stating his body likely would never have been found otherwise. The case is now the subject of a new documentary detailing the investigation.</p>

The Israeli military claimed responsibility, alleging al-Sharif was a Hamas leader, a claim Al Jazeera and the journalist had previously denied. This event highlights the extreme dangers faced by Palestinian journalists, with at least 178 killed since the war began, as international media access to Gaza remains heavily restricted. Press freedom organizations have condemned the targeting of journalists, calling it a deliberate strategy to suppress information.</p>

          <p>Newly released police documents detail horrific abuse leading to the death of 10-year-old Rebekah Baptiste in Arizona. The child was found unresponsive at a rural campsite where she lived off-grid with her father and his girlfriend, who are now charged with first-degree murder. Medical examiners found extensive signs of physical abuse, including a brain hemorrhage and burn marks, contradicting the couple's initial claims. Despite multiple reports to the state's Department of Child Safety by the girl's school, the abuse continued, prompting a review of the agency's handling of the case.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" after a meeting on Monday. This comes just days after Trump publicly demanded Tan's immediate resignation, citing concerns over the CEO's alleged ties to China. Following the meeting, which included cabinet members, Trump stated they would work with Tan to bring forward suggestions, signaling a significant shift in tone. The change reflects the administration's active and often unpredictable involvement in the semiconductor industry amid geopolitical tensions with China.</p>

          <p>President Trump has federalized Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department and deployed National Guard troops, citing a public safety emergency. This action places the city's police under temporary federal control for up to 30 days and brings at least 800 Guard members onto the streets. While the move is technically within presidential authority regarding the District, it has raised concerns given the context of falling crime rates and Trump's past use of federal forces.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, marking the fifth named storm of the current hurricane season. Forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict the storm will strengthen as it moves west, possibly developing into the season's first hurricane by the end of the week. While it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States, early models show it nearing the Caribbean islands as a major hurricane. The storm has already caused flooding in the Cabo Verde islands off the African coast.</p>

The incident has left thousands with extremely low water pressure and has prompted a boil water advisory for nearly 200,000 customers in the area. Officials have set up portable showers and are distributing bottled water as they work on the complex repair, which requires custom-made pipes. Authorities hope to complete the repairs by Tuesday night, but the boil water advisory will likely remain in effect longer.</p>

          <h2>Nicola Sturgeon Suggests Convicted Rapists 'Probably' Forfeit Right to Choose Gender</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that male rapists should "probably" lose the right to choose their gender. Her comments came as she reflected on the controversy surrounding a transgender offender who was initially placed in a women's prison. Sturgeon also admitted she was partly to blame for the debate over Scotland's gender recognition laws losing its "sense of rationality" and that she should have paused the legislation. Critics from her own party called the remarks "too late" and demanded an apology for her previous handling of the issue.</p>

          <p>European leaders are expressing anxiety over being shut out of the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, where the war in Ukraine will be discussed. While Trump has suggested Ukrainian President Zelensky might be invited, the door has remained closed to the rest of Europe. EU officials worry that a deal could be struck without their input, potentially redrawing borders through force. In response, EU foreign ministers held a virtual meeting to call for an unconditional ceasefire and to stress that any agreement must not award Russia for its aggression.</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a major investment to produce a new, more affordable midsize electric pickup truck, with a target price in the $30,000 range. The company plans to retool its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to build the vehicle, which it hopes to roll out within 18 months. This move represents a pivot for Ford toward smaller, cheaper EVs, as it has struggled to make a profit on its larger, more expensive models like the F-150 Lightning. The strategy aims to compete with both gasoline-powered trucks and the growing market of affordable Chinese EVs.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, this article offers a guide for consumers on how to negotiate relief directly with their card issuers. The process involves preparing financial documents, creating a budget, and documenting any financial hardship to strengthen one's negotiating position. Options include requesting temporary interest rate reductions, modified payment plans, or offering a lump-sum settlement for less than the total balance owed. The article stresses the importance of staying calm, being persistent, and getting any final agreement in writing before making a payment.</p>

          <p>A new report shows that U.S. homeowners' tappable equity reached a record high of $11.6 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with the average homeowner holding $213,000 in accessible value. For those looking to borrow against this equity, the article outlines several options. These include home equity loans, which provide a lump-sum payment at a fixed rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which function as a revolving line of credit with a variable rate. For seniors, a reverse mortgage is also presented as an option that defers repayment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has extended the deadline for high tariffs on Chinese goods to resume, delaying them for another 90 days until mid-November. The move, which was expected following recent trade talks, prevents U.S. duties from snapping back to their peak levels of 145%. Currently, the U.S. maintains a 30% tariff rate on Chinese imports, while China has a 10% levy on U.S. goods. The extension is the latest example of the administration's unpredictable trade policy, which has created uncertainty for many businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

This single mine accounts for approximately 4% of the world's forecasted lithium supply for 2025. Shares of U.S. miner Albemarle jumped 7%, while a lithium miners ETF saw a 14% increase on the news.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the next major earthquake on California's San Andreas fault may not resemble past events like the 1906 or 1857 quakes. Researchers analyzed a recent magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar on a fault system similar to the San Andreas, which ruptured a much longer section than expected. The findings imply that earthquake patterns are not easily repeatable, as each event redistributes stress along the fault, influencing future seismic activity. This could mean the next "Big One" could be a series of smaller quakes or a single, unexpectedly massive rupture.</p>

          <p>Shares of enterprise AI company C3 AI fell nearly 26% after it released preliminary first-quarter financial results and announced a sales organization restructuring. CEO Thomas Siebel called the sales performance "completely unacceptable," attributing the poor results to the disruption from the reorganization and his own ongoing health issues. The company expects revenue to be significantly lower than the same period last year and anticipates a much wider operating loss. Siebel is currently engaged in a search for his successor as chief executive. (not investment advice)</p>
