          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but both countries were accused of violating it shortly after. Israel claimed Iran launched missiles, resulting in casualties, while Iran denied these claims. Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with both nations, emphasizing the long-standing conflict between them. The ceasefire agreement, brokered with the help of Qatar, aimed to end the 12-day conflict that began with Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, prompting Iranian counterattacks. The US also took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking sites believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. The situation remains tense, with lawmakers seeking answers and evidence from the administration regarding the US strikes. Optimism surrounding the ceasefire remains uncertain given the conflicting reports and accusations from both sides. </p>

          <p>Two young bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and feasted on a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The park stated that the bears posed no threat to the public, though visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. Keepers monitored the bears and used recall training to guide them back to their enclosure without intervention. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park citing an "operational error." The park assured the public that the structural integrity of the enclosure remained uncompromised, and they are taking the incident seriously.</p>

          <p>President Trump, en route to a NATO summit in the Netherlands, declined to fully commit to Article 5, the collective defense agreement among NATO countries. When asked about his commitment, Trump stated that there are "numerous definitions" of Article 5. He expressed his commitment to being friends with NATO leaders and helping them, but deferred providing an exact definition of his commitment to mutual defense until he arrived at the summit. His remarks raised concerns among other nations about the U.S.'s dedication to the alliance. Trump emphasized his commitment to saving lives and ensuring safety.</p>

          <p>A concerning trend of syringe attacks has emerged at a French street music festival, prompting authorities to investigate. Over 145 festival attendees reported being pricked, leading to the detention of twelve suspects in the Paris region. The attacks have mobilized multiple paramedical resources, and concerns have risen about coordinated attacks due to calls circulating on social media. While it is unclear if the needles were used to inject drugs, other European countries have also noted an increase in spiking attacks, predominantly affecting women.

Lawmakers, particularly Democrats, have raised concerns about the constitutionality of the military action. Republican Rep.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance suggested that Iran's enriched uranium stockpile remains intact despite recent US bombing campaigns targeting Iranian nuclear facilities. While the US bombed nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, reports suggest that the uranium was likely moved elsewhere. Vance claimed the bombing achieved "mission success" by eliminating Iran's capacity to convert the stockpile into weapons-grade uranium. However, former UN nuclear weapons inspector David Albright noted that unaccounted-for centrifuges must still be addressed for the mission to be considered fully successful. Iran has made clear it does not wish to discuss the stockpile, which may represent one of its remaining strategic assets.</p>

Joint life annuities, which continue payments to a surviving spouse, offer lower monthly checks at around $2,449 per month.

          <p>A review of the film *28 Years Later* notes that the film reinvents the zombie genre with more developed "infected," odd human characters, and a dense plot. The film follows a 12-year-old boy named Spike as he journeys to find a cure for his mother's illness in a post-apocalyptic world. Director Danny Boyle applies a captivating digital aesthetic, using iPhones to create a fever dream crossed with an immersive video game. The film explores how isolation reshapes the human mind and ends on a cliffhanger, with a sequel set to be released in January.</p>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its rapid delivery service to over 4,000 smaller cities, towns, and rural communities across the U.S. by the end of the year. This initiative is part of a previously announced plan to invest roughly $4 billion by the end of 2026 to triple the size of its rural delivery network. The move aims to bring same- or next-day delivery to these areas for the first time, enhancing accessibility and convenience for customers in more remote locations.

          <p>New York Democrats are heading to the polls to choose a nominee for mayor, in a race that highlights the internal battle between left-wing and moderate factions within the party. The primary features a contest between former governor Andrew Cuomo, considered the "establishment" candidate, and state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. Mamdani's platform focuses on affordability, including free public buses, universal childcare, and rent freezes, while Cuomo emphasizes experience and competence.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed to "press ahead" with planned welfare changes, despite growing opposition from Labour backbench MPs. Over 120 Labour MPs have signed up to block plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments, but Starmer argues the current welfare system is "unsustainable" and needs reform. The proposed Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill would make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment. Critics cite concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into relative poverty and a lack of consultation.</p>

Rutte emphasized that this commitment comes with the expectation that European and Canadian allies will increase their defense spending.

          <p>A new book, *Toni at Random: The Iconic Writer’s Legendary Editorship*, explores Toni Morrison's role as a senior editor at Random House and her impact on Black literature. The book details how Morrison advocated for Black writers, edited groundbreaking anthologies, and pushed for greater representation in publishing. Morrison's galvanizing insight as an editor was that “a good writer could show the foolishness of racism,” as well as the many facets of Black life, “without talking to or about white people at all.” Her efforts helped transform the relationship of Black writers to white publishers, though her departure from Random House led to a decline in the number of Black authors published by the company.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order preventing the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without first giving them a chance to raise fears of torture, persecution, or death.

The Department of Homeland Security called the ruling "a victory for the safety and security of the American people." The ruling allows the administration to resume deportations while legal proceedings continue, though the administration has already entered into an arrangement with the government of El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants who it claims are gang members.</p>

Pyongyang has condemned the US attacks, accusing Washington of violating Iran's territorial integrity.

Experts suggest that North Korea will likely accelerate its nuclear weapons capabilities, further fortify its storage areas, and adopt additional protective measures.
