        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British firms operating in China are reporting a more challenging business environment, citing regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, and geopolitical uncertainties. The British Chamber of Commerce in China is advocating for clearer and consistently enforced regulations to improve the situation. Despite these difficulties, British companies remain committed to the Chinese market, though confidence in China's long-term outlook is waning due to escalating tensions between China and the US, causing investment delays. The trend reflects structural and geopolitical concerns beyond the pandemic's initial disruptions.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Agriculture Minister Resigns Amid Rice Shortage Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 02:19:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage by stating he had never purchased rice, Japan's staple grain, relying instead on gifts from supporters. This comment came during a nationwide rice shortage, exacerbating public frustration with the government's handling of the crisis. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular former environment minister, as his replacement. The shortage is attributed to decades-old policies protecting small farmers, which have hindered new agricultural land use and driven up prices, leading to rationing in supermarkets. The government has released rice from emergency stockpiles to try and ease the shortage.</p>

M&S is working to restore its systems, operations, and services, with hopes of emerging as a stronger business after the restoration process. The firm said there was more work to be done restoring systems, operations and services over the next few months, but it hoped to come out of the process "a much stronger business".</p>

Meanwhile, G7 finance leaders aim to maintain stability despite tensions over U.S. tariffs, and Japan plans to offer fast-track entry for South Koreans in June to commemorate the anniversary of diplomatic ties.</p>

The memo included proposals such as increasing the corporation tax rate on banks, extending the freeze on the threshold for the 45% tax rate, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. The Conservatives have criticized Labour, urging the Chancellor to rule out tax increases in the Autumn budget. A government spokesperson declined to comment on the leaked document.</p>

This military exercise occurred on the same day Lai pledged to strengthen Taiwan’s defense capabilities, prompting a response from mainland China, which accused Lai of maintaining a pro-independence stance.

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for the passage of a budget package, facing resistance from dueling factions within the party.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to build a consensus, but the legislation faces a tight deadline before Memorial Day. Trump urged Republicans to support the bill and expressed impatience with holdouts, but divisions remain over key issues.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a potential 1,000-foot-tall “mega-tsunami” could devastate parts of America's West Coast if a major earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone. A study estimates a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, potentially sinking coastal land and causing massive waves. Cities like Seattle and Portland are at risk, and Alaska and Hawaii are also vulnerable due to their seismic profiles. Unlike gradual climate events, this earthquake and tsunami would happen rapidly, leaving little time for adaptation.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed a bill into law legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients, making it the 11th state with such a statute. The End-of-Life Options Act allows mentally capable adults with a terminal illness and six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. The law requires patients to be presented with other end-of-life care options and mandates two waiting periods and a second medical opinion.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that U.S. export controls on AI chips to China have been ineffective, as Chinese companies are turning to locally developed alternatives. Huang noted that Nvidia's market share in China has significantly decreased, from nearly 95% to 50%, due to the export controls. The U.S. restrictions have prompted China to invest heavily in developing its own semiconductor supply chain. While the Trump administration rolled back some curbs, Huang believes that the prior rules were counterproductive.</p>

Health experts warn that nicotine pouches are addictive and may have harmful side effects, raising concerns that the upcoming ban on disposable vapes could lead more young people to turn to these stronger nicotine products.

          <p>The U.K. has suspended free trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers following concerns over the Israeli government's policies in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticized Israel's actions and summoned Israel's ambassador to the Foreign Office. The U.K. is also imposing sanctions on individuals, illegal settler outposts, and organizations supporting violence against the Palestinian community. These actions come amid mounting international pressure on Israel to ease restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza.</p>

          <p>The first blood test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease will be available in the U.S. starting in late June, following regulatory clearance. Developed by Fujirebio Holdings, the test detects amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brain and is a hallmark of Alzheimer's, and will initially be available at specialized research institutes and hospitals. The blood test is expected to be a less expensive and invasive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially improving access to new Alzheimer's treatments. The process takes roughly 30 minutes from drawing blood to diagnosis.</p>

          <p>The world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate last year, primarily due to fires, surpassing land clearances from agriculture for the first time. Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km of old-growth forests were lost, with the Amazon particularly affected by record drought. The record loss released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, raising concerns about the resilience of these forests on a warming planet. However, South East Asia bucked the trend due to government policies enforcing "no burning" laws.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans for his "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, predicting its completion by the end of his term. The project aims to expand the country’s air defense system to protect against foreign threats, similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Officials claim the Golden Dome is necessary to protect against catastrophic attacks, but experts cite logistical and financial hurdles. Trump stated the project would cost $175 billion, while the Congressional Budget Office estimates a higher cost of up to $542 billion. The system is designed to intercept missiles launched from anywhere, including space.</p>

          <p>Record-breaking global temperatures contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide in 2024, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction. Fires destroyed five times more primary tropical forests than in 2023, especially in Latin America, with Brazil experiencing its worst year for forests since 2016. As forests dry out and become increasingly degraded, fires are spreading further, releasing significant greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.
