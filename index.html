          <p>The Trump administration has announced new tariffs on imports from seven countries, set to take effect on August 1. Goods from Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan will face a 25% tariff, while South Africa will be subject to 30%, and Laos and Myanmar will face 40% duties. The move, which extends a previous tariff pause, is intended to address U.S. trade deficits, a justification experts often critique. The announcement caused a downturn in U.S. financial markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping significantly as investors reacted to the renewed trade tensions.

          <p>Roman Starovoyt, Russia's recently fired transport minister, was discovered dead from a gunshot wound in his car just hours after his dismissal by President Vladimir Putin. Starovoyt, 53, previously served as the governor of the Kursk region, which experienced a Ukrainian incursion in 2024. Russia's Investigative Committee is examining the circumstances of his death, including the possibility of suicide. The Kremlin confirmed his termination but dismissed questions about whether it was due to a loss of confidence, adding to the mystery surrounding the incident.</p>

          <p>A new lead has emerged in the manhunt for Travis Decker, the Washington man accused of killing his three young daughters, after a possible sighting in Idaho's Sawtooth National Forest. The U.S. Marshals Service is investigating a tip from a family who saw a man matching Decker's description over the holiday weekend. Decker has been a fugitive since early June when the bodies of his daughters, ages 5, 8, and 9, were found at a campsite. Authorities are urging public caution and offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

          <p>Widespread anti-government protests across Kenya have resulted in at least 10 deaths and over 560 arrests, according to human rights officials and police. Demonstrators, commemorating the historic "Saba Saba" pro-democracy protests, are demanding President William Ruto's resignation over corruption, the high cost of living, and police brutality. Authorities responded by barricading roads into the capital, Nairobi, and deploying police who used tear gas and allegedly live rounds to disperse crowds. The unrest marks a continuation of violent demonstrations sparked by recent deaths in police custody and public anger over governance.</p>

          <p>With a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated in September, homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) can take proactive steps to secure favorable terms. Financial experts suggest prospective borrowers should first check their credit reports and scores, taking measures to improve them. Secondly, they should shop around and compare offers from various lenders, not just their current mortgage provider, to establish a baseline. Finally, it is crucial to calculate potential repayment costs under different interest rate scenarios, as a HELOC uses the home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below a certain threshold. While this will provide tax relief for some seniors, policy experts clarify that it is not a repeal of the tax on benefits. The deduction, which applies to all income, will primarily benefit higher-income seniors and is set to expire at the end of 2028.</p>

          <h2>Scrutiny Mounts Over Texas Flood Response and Adequacy of Weather Warnings</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, questions are being raised about the effectiveness of the emergency response and whether residents were warned in time. While local officials claim the rainfall exceeded forecasts, a review shows the National Weather Service issued escalating warnings, though the most urgent came in the pre-dawn hours. Concerns have also surfaced about potential NWS staffing shortages and budget cuts under the Trump administration, and whether they impacted forecasting and coordination with local emergency managers. Officials have defended the forecasts, but the tragedy highlights a potential breakdown in communicating risk to the public.</p>

Schwarzenegger noted that this ideal of voluntary restraint, which shocked the world in the 18th century, remains a powerful symbol of civic stewardship. He reflected on his own journey, expressing awe at being an immigrant asked to honor the nation's first president at his historic home.</p>

In Wyoming, a man whose car was hit by a 16-year-old on an icy road raised nearly $14,000 to buy the teen a replacement vehicle after learning she had worked hard to afford her first one. Meanwhile, in Washington, two young chess champion brothers, ages 7 and 10, donated their tournament winnings to help a 10-year-old boy suffering from chronic pancreatitis.

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that discussions regarding the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are ongoing. The statement comes as President Trump has been critical of the agency's performance and has previously suggested "weaning off" FEMA, shifting more disaster response responsibility to the state level. This context is particularly relevant as the president recently approved a major disaster declaration for Texas, opening up federal FEMA funding to assist with the catastrophic flood relief efforts in the state. The administration's position creates uncertainty about the future of federal disaster response.</p>

          <p>Raynor Winn, author of the bestselling memoir "The Salt Path," is facing accusations that she fabricated or misrepresented key elements of her story. An investigation by The Observer newspaper suggests the loss of her home was not due to a bad investment, as claimed in the book, but stemmed from a fraud case and subsequent debts. The report also raises skepticism from medical experts about her husband's stated terminal diagnosis, given his long survival. Winn has described the article as "highly misleading" and stated that the book is the "true story of our journey" while seeking legal advice.</p>

          <p>The annual number of measles cases in the United States has reached its highest point in 33 years, with over 1,270 infections confirmed so far in 2025. The surge is largely fueled by a major outbreak in Texas, and experts believe the official tally likely undercounts the true number of cases. This resurgence of a vaccine-preventable disease, once declared eliminated in the U.S., is attributed to falling vaccination rates in some communities and the spread of anti-vaccine misinformation. The situation has been exacerbated by political upheaval within the nation's public health leadership.</p>
