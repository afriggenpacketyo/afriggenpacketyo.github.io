          <p>Despite rising U.S.-China tensions, Chinese students continue to seek higher education in the United States, though they are now more discerning in their choices. Applicants are prioritizing well-regarded universities, top-ranked programs, financial aid, and campus safety when making their decisions. While families express concerns about instability in the U.S., students believe the academic freedom and opportunities offered by preeminent American research universities still outweigh the potential risks. This trend highlights the enduring appeal of U.S. education for ambitious students from China.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life sentences in Idaho for murdering her two children, has been sentenced to two additional life terms in Arizona for conspiracy to commit murder. The convictions relate to the fatal 2019 shooting of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and a failed attempt on the life of her niece's ex-husband. Prosecutors argued her motives were financial gain and a desire to be with her new husband, Chad Daybell, using twisted religious beliefs as justification for the crimes. The sentencing concludes a lengthy and tragic legal saga spanning multiple states.</p>

Texas Republicans are using a special legislative session to push for new boundaries that could give them up to five additional seats in the U.S. House. Democrats are criticizing the move as a partisan power grab that ignores more pressing issues, such as recent flood recovery efforts.

They question the credibility of any information from a convicted felon desperate for a reduced sentence and note that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge. The move to have a high-ranking official like Blanche, a former personal attorney for President Trump, conduct the questioning raises concerns that the process is politically motivated rather than a standard investigative procedure.

The Trump administration had argued that the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause excludes the children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected.

Despite new trade deals being negotiated, this higher floor on tariffs is expected to translate into increased costs for businesses, which will likely be passed on to shoppers. Companies like Nestlé and General Electric have already indicated they are considering or have implemented price hikes to offset tariff-related expenses.

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering a plan to issue rebate checks to Americans, particularly those in certain income brackets, using revenue generated from his administration's new tariffs. The proposal was mentioned as an alternative to using the funds to pay down the national debt, which is projected to increase under recent tax and spending legislation. The federal government has collected approximately $100 billion in tariff revenue this year. Such a rebate would likely require new legislation from Congress to authorize the Treasury Department to issue the direct payments to taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal agents have raided a Los Angeles-area home linked to Matthew Shinn, a pastor featured in the Netflix docuseries "Dancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult." The raid is part of an ongoing investigation into allegations of sex trafficking, money laundering, and fraud. Shinn runs the Shekinah Church and a talent agency for TikTok dancers, who have accused him of being an abusive cult leader who isolates them from their families. The multi-agency operation involved the FBI, IRS, and Department of Labor, though no arrests have been announced yet.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to Scotland has been dogged by ongoing questions regarding his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Upon arriving, Trump deflected questions about the Justice Department's interview with Ghislaine Maxwell and denied reports that he contributed a lewd note to a book celebrating Epstein's 50th birthday. The controversy has intensified following the administration's reversal on releasing the Epstein investigation files, sparking backlash from both political parties. This backdrop of scandal threatens to overshadow the official purpose of his trip, which includes trade talks with UK and EU leaders.</p>

          <p>In response to images of masked federal agents conducting immigration arrests, Democratic lawmakers are proposing legislation to prohibit the practice. A federal bill, the "No Secret Police Act," would bar agents from wearing non-tactical masks, while a similar bill is advancing in California that would apply to all law enforcement in the state. Proponents argue that masked officers undermine democratic accountability and frighten the public. However, law enforcement groups oppose the bans, citing officer safety concerns like doxing and the need for protective equipment during riots or hazardous situations.</p>

          <p>Thousands of resident doctors in England have commenced a five-day strike after failing to reach a pay agreement with the government, prompting the health secretary to warn of a challenging period for the NHS. While the health service aims to minimize disruption and keep non-urgent services running, the British Medical Association (BMA) has warned that staff are being stretched too thin. The union is demanding pay restoration to offset inflation since 2008. This is the 12th strike by resident doctors since March 2023, with previous walkouts leading to over a million canceled appointments.</p>
