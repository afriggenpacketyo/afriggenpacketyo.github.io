Critics argue that this bill could push these projects out of Texas, hindering the state's and the nation's progress in the AI race against China.

            <p>A dozen residents of Pacific Palisades and Malibu, all aged 70 or older, are suing the city of Los Angeles, alleging that the Department of Water and Power (DWP) failed to prevent and contain the January wildfire that destroyed their homes. The lawsuit claims the city should have ensured key reservoirs were full and fire hydrants were operational. The plaintiffs allege the DWP ignored wind warnings and kept electrical equipment energized, contributing to the fire's spread. The case includes stories of a Holocaust survivor and a former Navy pilot who lost their homes and possessions.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has criticized the Trump administration for its handling of the Kilmar Ábrego García case, where a man was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The judge is considering whether officials are in contempt of court for failing to secure his return, despite a Supreme Court order. Meanwhile, immigration authorities reportedly deported a 19-year-old Venezuelan, Merwil Gutiérrez, despite realizing he was not the intended target. This situation underscores the administration's challenges in adhering to legal and procedural standards in immigration enforcement.</p>

            <p>Brown pelicans in Southern California are suffering from a dual crisis: domoic acid poisoning from a toxic algae bloom and starvation among baby pelicans. Hundreds of seabirds have been poisoned by the neurotoxin, and wildlife experts believe the sickened adult pelicans are leaving their young to fend for themselves, leading to malnutrition. Rescue centers are overwhelmed with both sick adults and starving chicks, stretching resources. Officials believe runoff from the Los Angeles firestorm may have contributed to the severity of the algae bloom.</p>
