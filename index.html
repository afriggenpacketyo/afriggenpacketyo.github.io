          <p>Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran regarding Iran's nuclear program are in jeopardy due to public disagreements over the terms of an interim agreement. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the proposal, asserting that Iran would not halt uranium enrichment on its soil, a stance echoed by Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi. This contrasts with President Trump's insistence that any agreement would require Iran to end enrichment activities. Despite discussions of a possible meeting, optimism has waned, with an Iranian official labeling the U.S. terms as unreasonable and expressing mistrust. The article suggests Russia may play a larger role in negotiations, but the future of the talks remains uncertain. Optimism is low, given the stark contrast in positions. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has barred most international students from entering the U.S. to study at Harvard University, escalating a conflict with the institution. The order suspends entry for foreign students unless deemed in the national interest, citing Harvard's alleged failure to report disciplinary records and its ties to researchers in China. A Harvard spokesperson denounced the order as retaliatory and a violation of First Amendment rights, vowing to protect its international students. This action follows previous attempts to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students and comes amid ongoing disputes over the school's disciplinary practices and handling of pro-Palestinian protests.</p>

Republican lawmakers are seeking testimony from Biden's former aides regarding his mental and physical capabilities, while a separate inquiry is examining clemencies Biden issued. Trump alleges that Biden's use of an autopen to sign executive actions was part of a conspiracy to mask who was truly in power. Democrats have dismissed the investigations as distractions, with Bill Clinton defending Biden's mental soundness.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which were crucial for early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in aerial dominance. Researchers analyzed the structure of 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period. The study, published in Science Bulletin, highlights the development of feathers that generated thrust and lift as an essential feature in the evolution of birds. While many feathered dinosaurs existed, most lacked the flight capabilities of modern birds.</p>

The research, conducted at University College London and the Sanger Institute, analyzed stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. Researchers believe this early microbial exposure plays a crucial role in immune system development, potentially leading to new therapies for boosting beneficial bacteria in babies.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has strongly condemned a GOP bill that he claims would strip 11 million Americans of their healthcare coverage. Sanders described the bill as unconscionable, particularly as it would provide tax breaks to those at the top. He argues that such measures are exceedingly cruel and exacerbate existing inequalities. Sanders' remarks underscore the ongoing political battle over healthcare access and affordability in the United States.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill, at the request of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, following concerns raised by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Experts, however, argue that these concerns are misguided, citing the FDA's initial thorough review in 2000 and subsequent periodic reviews that found no new safety issues. While the impact on access to mifepristone remains unclear, the drug has faced previous challenges, including a Supreme Court case in 2024 that preserved access to the pill.</p>

The MHRA recommends that women use contraception while taking these medicines and for a period afterward, as well as advising those using Mounjaro and oral contraceptives to use condoms or switch to another method.
