          <p>Professor Benjamin Horton, a British earth scientist and dean at City University of Hong Kong, views China as a leading force in climate science due to its substantial funding, advancements in green technology, and governmental backing for environmental research. Horton, who previously worked in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia, emphasized China's proactive investments in green technology and reforestation initiatives, contrasting them with other countries' cutbacks. He believes China's superpower status and pro-environment stance make it a compelling place for climate scientists to work and contribute to global environmental solutions. He highlights the availability of funding and governmental support as key factors in China's potential to drive significant progress in addressing climate change.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, faced criticism after stating he doesn't need to buy rice due to ample supplies from supporters, amidst rising rice prices impacting households. His comments, made during a fundraising event, contrasted with his ministry's efforts to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. Public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rice prices is high, with a recent survey showing 87% disapproval. Eto later expressed regret for his remarks, acknowledging they were excessive and pledging to focus on his ministerial duties to address the situation and regain public trust, despite calls for his resignation.</p>

          <p>Kyle Chan, a researcher at Princeton University, argues that China is rapidly outpacing the United States in economic and technological dominance, potentially ushering in a "Chinese century." He criticizes the Trump administration's focus on short-term trade skirmishes and its undermining of American innovation through tariff policies and cuts to research funding. China, in contrast, is making massive investments in cutting-edge technologies and expanding its manufacturing capabilities. Chan warns that America risks becoming a diminished nation, reliant on domestic consumption and producing lower-quality, more expensive goods, unless it reverses course and invests in research, innovation, and global economic ties.</p>

Concerns remain about the bill's impact on the deficit, with conservatives seeking faster implementation of Medicaid work requirements and reductions in green energy tax credits.

This show of force occurred hours after Trump announced his intention to speak with both Putin and President Zelensky, who has agreed to an unconditional cease-fire.

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles in an innovative effort to save them from extinction. The glitter is mixed with the voles' food, and conservationists track the voles' movements by identifying the glitter in their droppings. This method helps conservationists understand the voles' territory and habits, enabling them to make targeted environmental adjustments, such as removing invasive conifers or fencing off riverbanks. The project aims to help the species disperse and thrive in their natural habitats, addressing the challenges they face from habitat loss and predators.</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, paleontologists are investigating a mass grave containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus fossils to understand how these dinosaurs died. The team, led by Professor Emily Bamforth, is excavating the site, known as the "River of Death," to uncover clues about the catastrophic event that led to the dinosaurs' demise. Researchers believe the dinosaurs were part of a large herd migrating when a flash flood swept through the area, killing them. The site offers a unique opportunity to study dinosaur biology and community structure, with ongoing discoveries revealing new insights into this ancient ecosystem.</p>

The downgrade, driven by concerns about the fiscal deficit and growing debt costs, means that all three major rating agencies no longer consider the U.S. qualified for their top credit ratings. This could destabilize financial markets and potentially impact the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, leading to higher premiums for U.S. debt. The downgrade has also drawn attention to fiscal spending and interest rates in other countries, including Japan.</p>

It also would raise spending on the military and immigration enforcement. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, education and subsidies for clean energy would offset part of the price of the bill, though they would not cover the entire cost of $3.8 trillion over 10 years.
