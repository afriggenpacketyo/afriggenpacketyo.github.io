          <p>President Trump met with Senate Republicans to garner support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a legislative package advancing his agenda, with the Senate Finance Committee playing a key role in shaping the tax policy components, including the extension of the 2017 tax cuts. The House-passed version includes increased spending for the military and border security, alongside cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, potentially adding $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. While some Republicans express concerns, Senate Majority Leader John Thune aims to pass the bill, coordinating closely with Trump, who faces criticism from Elon Musk, adding complexity to the bill's passage. The President's direct involvement seeks to sway hesitant senators amidst internal and external pressures. Optimism remains for passage despite challenges, but the final form of the bill is uncertain. </p>

          <p>Egypt's Foreign Minister assured Greece that Egypt will safeguard the spiritual and religious significance of Saint Catherine's Monastery, a part of the Greek Orthodox Church, amidst a land dispute. The assurance came after an Egyptian court ruling raised concerns among Orthodox Christian leaders about the monastery's fate, but the Egyptian Foreign Ministry clarified that the ruling affirms the monks' right to use the monastery and its religious sites. The monastery, established in the sixth century at the base of Mount Sinai, is the world's oldest continually inhabited Christian monastery, holding immense religious and historical importance. Both Egypt and Greece have agreed to collaborate to protect the monastery's rights and legal status, ensuring its continued value as a place of Greek Orthodox worship. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a lawsuit against Texas, challenging the state's law that provides in-state tuition rates to undocumented immigrants, alleging it violates federal law. The DOJ argues that federal law prohibits higher education institutions from offering benefits to illegal aliens that are not also offered to U.S. citizens. This action aligns with President Trump's executive orders aimed at preventing taxpayer benefits from going to unqualified aliens and stopping state and local policies favoring aliens over American citizens. The lawsuit targets the Texas Dream Act, enacted in 2001, which allows students graduating from Texas high schools to pay in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status. </p>

Musk expressed frustration over the bill's cuts to the electric vehicle tax credit, a provision previously supported by Tesla, and disagreements over artificial intelligence deals favoring OpenAI.

The administration has been given a week to outline how it will allow the men to seek relief under habeas corpus, treating their cases as if they had never been deported.

The San Mateo County District Attorney described the case as unlike anything his office had previously encountered, noting that the relationship between Kroe and the victim began as a friendship before escalating into a nightmare. Kroe took control of the woman's finances, drained her bank accounts, and refused to allow her to leave the hotel room, even denying her medical treatment when she broke her ankle. The victim was eventually rescued after secretly contacting a friend, leading to Kroe's arrest and conviction on 33 felony counts. </p>

          <p>A researcher claims that the fungus labeled a "potential agroterrorism weapon" in a recent arrest is already widely prevalent in the U.S. Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu were charged with attempting to smuggle strains of Fusarium graminearum into the United States, but scientists say the fungus is common in native grasses and crops across the country. Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, stated that F. graminearum likely originated in North America and is responsible for the crop disease Fusarium head blight or head scab. While the disease poses a threat to crops, farmers use various methods, including fungicides, to mitigate the risk. </p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. The UK received a carve-out, maintaining duties at 25%, reflecting ongoing trade discussions with the US. Critics fear the tariffs could harm steel producers outside the US, trigger retaliation from trade partners, and increase costs for American users of the metals. Economists predict potential job losses in sectors like manufacturing and construction due to rising prices, with one analysis estimating that Trump's initial tariffs cost the economy 75,000 jobs. </p>

The conflict appears to stem from a disagreement between Magic Eden and World Liberty Financial, another of Trump's crypto businesses, over the official wallet.
