          <p>A 42-year-old man was taken into custody after stabbing eleven people with a folding knife at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The attack, which occurred near the checkout area, appeared to be random, with no predetermined victims. Six of the wounded individuals are in critical condition, while five are in serious condition at a local medical center. Citizens reportedly assisted law enforcement in apprehending the suspect and providing aid to the victims as authorities continue their investigation into the brutal incident.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that significantly deepens the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, with RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as president, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and stokes fears of a permanent national division. This development follows an agreement between paramilitary, rebel, and civilian groups aiming to create a secular "New Sudan." United Nations officials have warned this could fragment the country further, undermining diplomatic peace efforts amid a devastating humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <h2>Former Ballerina Ashley Benefield Convicted of Manslaughter in Husband's Death</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 23:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a highly publicized trial, former ballerina Ashley Benefield was found guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. The prosecution argued she killed him to gain sole custody of their daughter, while the defense claimed self-defense, citing a history of alleged abuse. The trial featured dramatic testimony, including from Benefield herself and her stepdaughter, and explored the couple's turbulent relationship, which involved accusations of poisoning and violence. The jury's lesser conviction of manslaughter, rather than second-degree murder, suggests they believed the killing was not premeditated but also not justified.</p>

The ministry confirmed the vessel and its passengers, including activists and journalists, were safe and being brought to Israel.

The move is part of Beijing's strategy to cultivate the low-altitude sector—encompassing activities up to 1,000 meters—as a strategic emerging industry.

This reduction, which includes normal attrition, will shrink NASA's staff from 18,000 to 14,000. The move is part of a broader plan to reduce the federal workforce and comes amid proposals for significant budget cuts to the space agency.

Producers described it as a "reality sitcom" that portrayed Ozzy as a lovable, often confused patriarch, a "Ward Cleaver on acid." This format was groundbreaking at the time, paving the way for a generation of celebrity-driven reality shows and endearing the "Prince of Darkness" to a whole new audience.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been declared a martyr by the Catholic Church, a key step toward sainthood. In 2007, he was murdered after refusing to accept bribes to allow a shipment of spoiled, potentially poisonous rice to enter the country. A devout Catholic and member of the Sant'Egidio community, Kositi was known for his integrity and work helping street children. His "mafia-style" killing was meant as a warning against honesty, but his story is now celebrated as an example of choosing faith and justice over corruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As football fans prepare for the emotional intensity of the Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the science behind match-day anxiety. The body's stress response, involving hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, is heightened in loyal fans, leading to physical reactions like an increased heart rate. Experts advise managing these effects by getting adequate rest, having a clear plan for the day, and engaging in movement to release pent-up energy. They also suggest reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that provides a rare license for emotional expression, regardless of the final score.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west over the Pacific than usual. This has allowed a low-pressure system to dominate, leading to persistent cloud cover and increased coastal upwelling of cold ocean water. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, the pattern is a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay insists he is not concerned about quarterback Matthew Stafford's back issue, despite the fact that the veteran has not practiced in training camp and will not practice next week. Stafford, 37, is being treated for what was initially called back soreness, and his status is now being evaluated on a week-to-week basis. The situation is reminiscent of Stafford's 2022 season, which was derailed by injury, casting uncertainty over the Super Bowl contender's prospects. For now, backup Jimmy Garoppolo is taking first-team reps as the team prepares for its season opener.</p>

          <p>A new American Eagle campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney has sparked a divided public reaction. The campaign promotes a line of jeans where proceeds support a domestic violence charity, but a promotional video focusing on Sweeney's physique has been criticized by some as "tone-deaf" for sexualizing a serious cause. Conversely, many fans have praised the ad, with some celebrating it for "killing woke advertising." Amid the controversy, American Eagle's stock saw a significant boost, as the company bets on Sweeney's star power to revive sales and generate online buzz.</p>

          <p>A union representing 12,000 employees of the Stater Bros. Markets supermarket chain in Southern California has voted to authorize a strike. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 135 stated the vote was prompted by the company allegedly breaking the law through surveillance and discrimination against union members. While the authorization does not trigger an immediate work stoppage, it strengthens the union's position ahead of contract negotiations scheduled for late July. The move follows the company's first-ever layoffs earlier in the year, which it blamed on inflation and tariffs.</p>

          <p>Veteran Israeli Arab affairs commentator Ehud Yaari has disclosed that he maintained sporadic, indirect contact with Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar after the October 7 attacks. The communication was facilitated by a mediator affiliated with Hamas, who initiated the contact on Sinwar's behalf. Yaari stated that Sinwar, who was deeply studied in Israeli history and culture, used the channel to convey messages, notably that Hamas acted out of a sense of "despair" and a belief that they had "nothing to lose." This revelation offers a rare glimpse into the mindset of the Hamas leader before he was killed.</p>
