          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has officially announced that the country is no longer bound by the restrictions imposed by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the landmark nuclear deal has officially expired. The agreement had capped Iran's nuclear activities and uranium stockpiles in exchange for sanctions relief, but its viability has been in question since the U.S. withdrawal in 2018. Despite the declaration, Tehran expressed a continued commitment to diplomacy, even as international talks to revive the deal have stalled.</p>

          <p>Organizers are preparing for the second major wave of 'No Kings' protests across the United States, with millions expected to demonstrate against the policies of President Trump's administration. The movement accuses the president of authoritarian behavior, citing concerns over immigration detentions, environmental policy, and education funding cuts as key motivators for the demonstrations. In response, some Republican leaders have criticized the event as a "hate America rally," and the governors of Virginia and Texas have mobilized their states' National Guards in preparation.</p>

During the meeting, Wang stated that China is willing to restart dialogue at all levels and work to rebuild trust between the two nations. This high-level engagement is being viewed as a potential "fresh start" for bilateral ties, which have been strained in recent years due to diplomatic and trade disputes, suggesting a mutual desire to return to a more stable and constructive relationship.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion that federal forces should be sent to San Francisco to address crime has been met with widespread ridicule and condemnation from local residents and political leaders. While acknowledging the city's challenges with homelessness and urban decay, many view the idea of a military presence as an inappropriate and alarming escalation. State and local officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, have strongly opposed the proposal, framing it as a vindictive political maneuver rather than a genuine effort to improve public safety.</p>

          <p>In anticipation of the nationwide 'No Kings' protests against President Trump's policies, Republican governors in states including Texas and Virginia have activated their National Guard troops. Organizers expect millions to participate in over 2,500 gatherings aimed at challenging what they describe as the president's authoritarianism. The mobilization of troops has been criticized by Democrats as an attempt to suppress peaceful protest, while some Trump allies have accused the demonstrators of being linked to far-left movements and have raised concerns about potential unrest.</p>

          <p>Finland's President, Alexander Stubb, has asserted that Donald Trump is uniquely positioned to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine. In an interview with the BBC, Stubb suggested that ending the conflict requires more of a "stick" than a "carrot," and that Trump is the only leader capable of applying the necessary pressure on Moscow. His comments provide a key European perspective ahead of a potential meeting between Trump and Putin, framing the U.S. president's role as central to any peace process.</p>
