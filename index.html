          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was halted due to a malfunction in the electronic line-calling system. The technology failed to make an audio call on a ball that was visibly out, leading the chair umpire to stop play. After confirming the system was unable to track the point, the umpire ordered the point to be replayed. The incident prompted frustration from Pavlyuchenkova, who claimed a game was "stolen" from her as a result of the technological error.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow has released a new book on the life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. The article explores Twain's complex personality, tracing his sardonic humor to a life marked by financial anxiety and personal pain, despite his immense success. Chernow's biography delves into how Twain's experiences shaped his iconic works like "Huckleberry Finn" and his sharp commentary on American politics, race, and culture. The piece highlights Twain's lasting legacy as a quintessential American voice whose observations remain remarkably relevant today.</p>

          <h2>Ken Burns Criticizes Proposed Funding Cuts to Public Broadcasting</h2>

          <p>Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the White House's push to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." In a recent interview, Burns defended public media entities like PBS and NPR against claims they promote certain political propaganda. He argued that PBS is essential, particularly in rural areas where it may be the only available signal, providing children's programming, educational content, and emergency information. Burns emphasized that his own extensive documentaries would not have been possible without the support and unique model of public broadcasting.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are in a critical week of negotiations to finalize a trade agreement with the United States, aiming to prevent a threatened 50% tariff on EU imports. With a July 9 deadline set by the Trump administration looming, uncertainty pervades the talks, which have already caused significant global economic anxiety. The EU is now aiming for a more modest "framework deal," similar to one secured by the UK, as a comprehensive agreement appears out of reach. Internal division within the EU adds another layer of complexity, with some nations advocating for a deal at any cost while others urge holding out for better terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its release, the cast and crew of "Jaws" look back on the notoriously difficult production that created a cinematic classic. Actor Richard Dreyfuss and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb recall the problem-plagued shoot on Martha's Vineyard, where the mechanical shark rarely worked, the budget ballooned, and tensions ran high among the actors. Despite initial fears that the film would be a failure, director Steven Spielberg's innovative approach turned misfortune into a blockbuster that defined the summer movie genre. The article highlights how the film's simple, human story of three men against a shark continues to terrify and captivate audiences.</p>

The suggestion comes amid broader calls from Sir Mark for a radical reform of UK policing, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into 12 to 15 larger ones.

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so since the group returned to power in 2021. The Taliban's foreign minister welcomed the move as the start of a "new phase of positive relations." Experts suggest Russia's decision is driven by economic interests, including positioning Afghanistan as a trade hub to Asia, and a desire to lead a coalition of autocratic states in establishing new relations with the Taliban. The move has raised concerns among human rights activists, who fear it will validate the Taliban's oppressive policies, particularly against women and girls.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League is uncertain due to the complex multi-club ownership network of its largest shareholder, John Textor. The club's participation hinges on the outcome of an appeal by Lyon, another club owned by Textor's company, against their relegation in France. If Lyon's appeal fails, they would relinquish their Europa League spot, potentially clearing the way for Palace. This situation unfolds as Textor is finalizing the sale of his 43% stake in Palace to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, a move driven by Textor's frustration over his limited influence at the London club.</p>

          <p>President Trump's first six months in office have seen a series of executive actions that critics warn are expanding presidential power and eroding democratic norms. Actions such as ordering a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, using national emergency declarations to impose tariffs, and deploying the National Guard against a state's wishes have tested the limits of executive authority. Analysts suggest that longstanding checks and balances, including Congress and the judiciary, are proving ineffective at restraining him. This trend, while not starting with Trump, is seen as a deliberate project to eliminate established limits on presidential power, setting new precedents for future administrations.</p>

          <p>Despite hyperbolic predictions from both supporters and critics, the U.S. economy has remained remarkably stable five months into President Trump's second term. Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have seen little change, and GDP growth continues at a modest pace. The article argues that the promised "golden age" was unrealistic, while the feared "economic catastrophe" from tariffs was averted because Trump quickly moderated the most extreme rates. While long-term policies may negatively affect economic fundamentals, the short-term reality is an economy that is simply "okay," which may not be sufficient for voters who remain unhappy with their financial situation.

          <p>An analysis explores the growing divide between establishment Democrats and a rising populist-progressive wing, drawing parallels to the Republican Tea Party movement a decade ago. The recent victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York City's mayoral primary is cited as evidence of this trend, which is fueled by widespread anger among the Democratic base and a desire for new leadership. While the original Tea Party had a clear set of policy goals, the current progressive energy is more disparate, though it is unified by frustration with current congressional leaders and a focus on working-class affordability issues. The article considers whether this grassroots momentum could lead to a wave of primary challenges against incumbent Democrats.</p>

          <p>FIFA has significantly cut ticket prices for the Club World Cup semi-final match between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Standard tickets, which were priced as high as $473.90 earlier in the week, were reduced to just $13.40. This move is part of a dynamic pricing strategy used for the tournament, which has seen similar price drops for other quarter-final matches. In contrast, tickets for the other semi-final between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid still start at nearly $200, highlighting the variable demand for different matchups in the competition.</p>

Polish authorities have stated no physical barriers will be erected, but signs will instruct drivers to slow down for spot checks, focusing on buses and multi-passenger cars.

          <p>A report from the research services of the German parliament, the Bundestag, has raised "substantial doubt" about the legal justification for recent Israeli and U.S. military strikes on Iran. Commissioned by a Left Party lawmaker, the report states that most international law experts believe the criteria for self-defense under the UN Charter were not met. It argues that Israel would need to prove an imminent threat of a nuclear attack, not just the existence of nuclear material. While the German government supported the strikes, this parliamentary analysis suggests a significant legal and political debate is underway within Germany regarding the actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump and the GOP are intensifying efforts to eliminate the counting of mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day, a practice they claim feeds conspiracy theories and undermines election integrity. An executive order from Trump directs the attorney general to take action against states with such grace periods, arguing it violates federal law. Following this, at least three states have passed legislation to require all ballots be received by Election Day. This push is closely tied to false claims about the 2020 election and a desire for immediate results, despite no evidence of widespread fraud associated with late-arriving but legally postmarked ballots.</p>

His rule has been marked by constitutional amendments to remove term and age limits, and critics accuse him of ruling with an iron hand.

          <p>This analysis reflects on the 20th anniversary of the G8's Gleneagles summit, which produced historic commitments to debt relief and overseas aid. The article contrasts the optimistic spirit of 2005 with today's fragmented, multipolar world, where global solidarity is strained by economic shocks, geopolitical tensions, and rising nationalism. The author notes that while the UK government has significantly cut its aid budget, the need for international action on issues like unsustainable debt in developing countries has only intensified. Despite a more fraught global backdrop, some campaigners see momentum for a new international debt relief package, though summoning the spirit of Gleneagles remains a formidable challenge.
