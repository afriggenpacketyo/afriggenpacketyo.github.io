          <p>Brave Lupus Tokyo, led by former All Black Richie Mo'unga, secured their second consecutive Japan Rugby League One title with an 18-13 victory over the Kubota Spears. Mo'unga played a pivotal role, scoring the opening try and setting up another, while also contributing eight points with his kicking. The match, held at Tokyo's National Stadium, saw Brave Lupus, coached by Todd Blackadder, maintain their dominance after finishing the regular season at the top. Despite a strong defensive effort from the Spears, Brave Lupus held on to win in the final minutes amidst heavy rain. The final score was secured after Brave Lupus was able to soak up the defensive pressure in the final minutes under cloudy skies before heavy rain began soaking the Tokyo Olympic venue. The score of the game reflects the hard-fought nature of the championship final.</p>

The House bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," also approves significant spending cuts to programs for low-income families. Negotiations in the Senate are expected to focus on the Medicaid provision, with debate anticipated on other aspects of the bill as well.

          <p>The White House is facing criticism for deporting individuals to countries other than their home nations, a practice defended by the administration as necessary for removing those with criminal records. Immigration lawyers have filed lawsuits, arguing that deportees are not given adequate time to contest their deportations to these third countries, which often include politically unstable nations. A federal judge has ruled in favor of the lawyers, asserting that migrants should have the opportunity to express fears of violence or persecution in the designated country. This policy has sparked debate about due process and the potential dangers faced by deportees sent to countries with histories of mistreating migrants, raising concerns about the ethical implications of such removals. The administration maintains that these actions are essential for public safety, while critics argue they represent a renunciation of justice.</p>

          <h2>Stricter Voting Laws No Longer Benefit Republicans, Analysis Suggests</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-held belief that stricter voting laws benefit Republicans is being challenged, as recent data indicates that these laws no longer provide the advantage they once did. Historically, lower voter turnout was seen as favorable to Republicans, as their affluent electorate was more likely to vote regardless of inconvenience. However, changing demographics and increased mobilization efforts among other groups have altered this dynamic. This shift suggests that Republicans may need to reassess their strategies regarding voting laws to maintain their electoral advantage. The change in voting patterns has led to a reassessment of traditional political strategies.</p>

          <p>At least 26 Palestinians were killed and 175 wounded while attempting to receive food aid in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials and witnesses. Witnesses reported that Israeli forces opened fire on crowds approximately 1,000 yards from an aid distribution site managed by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The Israeli Defense Forces stated they are "currently unaware of injuries caused by IDF fire within the Humanitarian Aid distribution site" and are reviewing the matter. The United Nations and major aid groups have declined to collaborate with the new aid system, citing violations of humanitarian principles, as it allows Israel to control aid distribution and forces people to relocate to distribution sites. The distribution of aid has been marred by chaos and allegations of Israeli troops firing on crowds near delivery sites.</p>

The absence of Defence Minister Dong Jun, who attended last year, also meant that no bilateral talks occurred between China and other nations, including the U.S., at a time when Beijing faces scrutiny over its military capabilities.

The IAEA also noted that Iran's cooperation regarding uranium traces at undeclared nuclear sites has been "less than satisfactory." These developments occur amid ongoing US-Iran talks aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, with tensions remaining high between Iran and Western nations.

          <p>ASEAN faces a critical opportunity to assert itself as a key player in global trade and geopolitics amidst the ongoing US-China rivalry. With a new free-trade agreement with China and potential tariff discussions with the U.S., ASEAN can leverage its diplomatic agility to foster a neutral, inclusive trade ecosystem. This involves navigating internal divisions and external pressures to prioritize regional resilience and strategic autonomy. By shaping trade rules rather than merely adapting to them, ASEAN can redefine its role and become the architect of a new regional order. The ability of the organization to exploit the US-China rivalry hinges on its diplomatic agility.</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a 16-year-old transgender athlete, won two gold medals and a silver at the California high school track and field championship, sparking considerable debate. Hernandez competed under a new rule allowing an extra student to medal in events where a transgender athlete qualifies, ensuring that a "biological female" also receives a medal. During the qualifying events, a plane flew over the stadium with a banner stating, "No boys in girls' sports," and a small protest took place outside. The California Interscholastic Federation defended its decision, stating that the rule change would open the field to more "biological female" athletes. The inclusion of transgender athletes in sports remains a contentious issue, with some advocating for inclusion and others raising concerns about fairness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that while parenthood provides a sense of meaning and fulfillment, it often leads to lower life satisfaction, particularly for mothers. Researchers analyzed data from the European Social Survey across 30 countries, finding that parents generally feel their lives have deeper significance compared to childfree individuals. However, life satisfaction levels varied significantly based on factors such as living situation and family policies. Scandinavian countries, with robust childcare and parental support systems, showed smaller differences in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents, suggesting that societal support plays a crucial role in parental wellbeing. The study highlights the complex relationship between parenthood, societal support, and overall life satisfaction.</p>
