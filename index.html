          <p>The House of Representatives is set to vote on President Trump's major tax and spending bill after clearing a procedural hurdle. The passage followed intense internal Republican debate and pressure from Trump to meet a July Fourth deadline. In protest, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries conducted a marathon speech lasting over eight hours, nearing a House record, to condemn the legislation's contents and the process. The bill, which fiscal conservatives criticize for increasing the deficit, is expected to pass and head to the president's desk for signing.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has announced it will review cases from West Virginia and Idaho concerning state laws that prohibit transgender students from participating in female sports teams. These laws were previously struck down by lower courts, which found they violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause or Title IX. This decision follows a recent ruling where the court's conservative majority upheld bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors. The cases will be argued in the fall, with a final decision expected in 2026.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its most significant measles outbreak since 2019, with over 1,200 cases confirmed across 37 states. A major cluster in West Texas has resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children, highlighting the disease's severity. Health officials attribute the surge to declining vaccination rates, with kindergarten MMR vaccination coverage falling below the 95% threshold required for community immunity. In response, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly encouraged vaccination, while maintaining opposition to government mandates for the shot.</p>

          <p>A drive-by shooting outside the Artis Lounge nightclub in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and fourteen others wounded.

The victims ranged in age from 21 to 32, and as of Thursday, no arrests have been made. The club, which has a history of violence at its location, expressed heartbreak over the disruption of its mission to be a safe space.</p>

          <p>Following a recent conflict involving Iran, the Trump administration is promoting the expansion of the Abraham Accords to include Syria and Lebanon, despite ongoing hostilities. While Israel has shown interest, significant obstacles remain, such as the disputed Golan Heights with Syria and the powerful influence of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysts are skeptical, suggesting the push is motivated more by President Trump's desire for a diplomatic victory than a realistic strategy for peace. Experts point out that unlike the original signatories, Israel has active, long-standing conflicts with both nations, making normalization far more complex.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from Fox News argues that Republicans are justified in their efforts to defund PBS and NPR due to perceived left-wing bias, particularly against Donald Trump. The author cites a recent PBS NewsHour segment on a CBS News lawsuit settlement as evidence, claiming the coverage downplayed journalistic malpractice to protect Democrats. The piece contends that public broadcasting has failed to reform despite past criticism and has become a propaganda arm for the Democratic Party. It concludes that taxpayers should no longer be forced to fund these outlets, which can instead rely on donations from their supporters.</p>

Authorities have ordered evacuations for four villages and have placed all hospitals on the island on alert as a precaution.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that the most self-defeating element of the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill" is the repeal of clean-energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. The article contends that this move will not only hinder climate change efforts but also create an energy affordability crisis by stifling the development of cheap renewable power sources just as electricity demand is spiking. It refutes the claim that renewables are unreliable, pointing to Texas's successful use of wind and solar to stabilize its grid. The author concludes the policy is driven by partisan spite, which will ultimately harm voters in Republican states the most. (not investment advice)</p>

In contrast, private lenders are offering variable rates starting as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer.

          <p>Several House Republican holdouts who initially opposed the major spending bill ultimately voted to advance it after receiving assurances from President Trump. Lawmakers like Rep. Ralph Norman stated that Trump promised to address their concerns, such as tax credits for wind and solar, at a later time, possibly through executive action. Despite their public pushback, conservatives like Rep. Chip Roy claimed victory, citing reforms to Medicaid work requirements. This suggests that the president's personal persuasion, based on future commitments rather than immediate legislative changes, was key to securing the necessary votes for the bill.</p>

          <p>Top officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), appointed under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have overruled the agency's career scientists to limit the approval of COVID-19 vaccines from Novavax and Moderna. Memos reveal that political appointee Dr. Vinay Prasad disagreed with the scientific staff's recommendation for broad approval, instead narrowing the vaccines' use to seniors and at-risk individuals. This unprecedented level of political intervention in the scientific approval process has drawn criticism for potentially eroding the FDA's credibility. The administration defended the move as "principled leadership" intended to correct the agency's course.</p>

          <p>An 80-year-old American novelist, Eleonor "Gay" Courter, and her husband may face trial in France for their alleged role in selling gold bars plundered from an 18th-century shipwreck.

The investigation began after looted ingots appeared at a U.S. auction.

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to further curtail the 'Right to Buy' scheme in England to protect the country's social housing stock. Under the new proposals, newly-built social homes will be exempt from the scheme for 35 years, and tenants will have to live in their properties for ten years, up from three, before they can purchase them. The maximum purchase discount will also be significantly reduced. The government argues these changes are necessary to ensure councils can recover building costs and prevent the depletion of affordable housing, a move praised by housing associations but criticized by Conservatives as an "attack on aspiration."</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister, Alexander Dobrindt, is advocating for direct negotiations with the Taliban to establish an official agreement for deporting convicted Afghan criminals from Germany. Currently, Germany does not have formal diplomatic ties with the Taliban government and has previously relied on secret negotiations with Qatar to facilitate such deportations. The push for a direct deal comes as migration remains a central political issue in Germany, with the conservative government vowing to take a harder line on deportations to countries like Afghanistan and Syria. The move reflects a pragmatic, albeit controversial, shift in policy.</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old Maryland man has been charged with a felony after allegedly trying to bring a "ghost gun" into the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill. The untraceable firearm, which lacked a serial number, was discovered in the man's bag during a routine security screening. The man, who claimed he forgot the gun was in his bag, does not have a license to carry a firearm in Washington, D.C. This incident is the latest in a series of more than 20 arrests for unlawful firearms possession on Capitol Hill this year, an increase from the previous year.</p>
