          <p>Emine Erdogan, wife of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has written a letter to former U.S. First Lady Melania Trump, appealing for her to support the children affected by the conflict in Gaza. Citing Mrs. Trump's previous advocacy for Ukrainian children, the letter asks her to leverage her influence to call for an end to the humanitarian crisis. The letter highlights the severe psychological distress and high mortality rate among Gazan children, urging Mrs. Trump to fulfill a "historic responsibility" by speaking out. The appeal comes as the conflict continues to exact a heavy toll on the region's youngest inhabitants.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officials have removed a significant illegal marijuana cultivation site from deep within California's Sequoia National Park. The operation, which spanned roughly 13 acres, involved the removal of over 2,300 mature plants and nearly a ton of trash and toxic materials, including a banned insecticide. Authorities noted that the site showed signs of a sophisticated drug-trafficking operation, causing extensive environmental damage through poaching, vegetation clearing, and water diversion from a creek. This action is part of an ongoing effort to combat such illegal farms that have plagued the region's national parks for two decades.</p>

The day was marked by celebrations in Kyiv, attended by international allies like Canada's Prime Minister, who pledged over a billion dollars in military aid. Concurrently, Russia launched overnight drone attacks, with one causing a fire at the Kursk nuclear power plant, though no radiation leaks were reported. The anniversary highlights Ukraine's resilience amid the protracted conflict and the ongoing diplomatic and military efforts to secure a just peace.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man facing human smuggling charges, allege that federal authorities are attempting to force him into a guilty plea. They claim that after he was wrongly deported and then returned to the U.S., he was offered a deal to plead guilty in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica. When he refused, his attorneys state that ICE threatened to deport him to Uganda instead, a country where his safety could be at risk.

          <p>Four Palestinians seeking humanitarian aid were killed by Israeli forces near a military-controlled corridor south of Gaza City, according to hospital officials and eyewitnesses. The incident occurred as a crowd was heading towards a food distribution point, with witnesses stating that troops opened fire indiscriminately when a group pushed forward. This event adds to the rising number of casualties among civilians attempting to access scarce food supplies amid a deepening famine in parts of the Gaza Strip. The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries at or near aid distribution sites since the war began.</p>

          <p>A judge in Mexico has ruled that boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. must stand trial on charges of arms trafficking and alleged connections to the Sinaloa Cartel. The case stems from a 2019 investigation by Mexican prosecutors following a complaint from U.S. authorities. Chávez Jr., who was recently deported from the U.S., participated in the hearing virtually and could face a prison sentence of four to eight years if convicted. His lawyer has dismissed the claims as "speculation," while the case proceeds amid broader U.S. pressure on Mexico to address organized crime.</p>

While the scientific value of this unethically obtained data is now considered limited, it was once cited in medical journals and influenced fields like genetics and psychiatry.

          <p>American universities are facing a crisis of public trust, caught between political pressures from both the left and the right that threaten their core mission. This article argues that to save their integrity, universities must reclaim the principle of academic freedom by adopting a stance of institutional neutrality on social and political issues. By ceasing to issue corporate-style statements on controversies, institutions can create a protected space for open inquiry and debate among faculty and students. This return to a foundational value is presented as essential to combat the perception of partisanship and preserve the university's role as a producer of knowledge for all.</p>

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that while initial application decisions have been accelerated, the appeals process faces "unacceptable delays," with an average wait time of over a year for 51,000 pending cases. The plan involves creating a new body staffed by independent adjudicators to handle appeals more swiftly than the current court system.

While showing slightly less weight loss in trials, Lilly's pill is a small-molecule drug, making it easier to manufacture at scale and free from the dietary restrictions required by Novo's product. This manufacturing advantage could allow for a lower price point and wider global availability, potentially capturing a significant share of the lucrative weight-loss drug market.

          <p>In an opinion piece, former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy argues that despite the Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and rollbacks of environmental protections, the fight against climate change is far from over. She highlights that states, cities, businesses, and local communities are continuing to push for clean energy solutions, driven by economic benefits and public demand. McCarthy points to record investments in solar and wind in states like Texas and Florida as evidence that the clean energy transition is market-driven. She asserts that this grassroots and corporate leadership will maintain America's role in the global climate effort, regardless of federal inaction.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the most effective use of artificial intelligence in the near future is not to fully automate expert jobs, but to design it as a collaborative tool that enhances human expertise. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it illustrates that imperfect automation can undermine human skill and lead to poor outcomes. Instead of aiming to replace doctors or pilots, AI should be built to complement their abilities, handling vast data analysis while humans provide context, ethical judgment, and creativity. This collaborative approach, where AI and humans work as partners, promises better results and avoids the pitfalls of premature or excessive automation.</p>

          <p>Despite growing favorability for socialism among young Americans and Democrats, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) struggles to translate numbers into significant political power. This article argues the primary reason is a deep internal rift between a pragmatic, mass-politics wing focused on winning elections within the Democratic Party and a sectarian, extremist wing with anti-democratic and revolutionary views. This factionalism prevents a unified strategy, leads to controversial resolutions like condemning Israel, and alienates popular socialist figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The result is an organization that often appears more focused on internal ideological battles than on building a broad, effective political movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay adapted from an upcoming memoir argues that when parents forgo reading aloud to their children, they miss out on a profound opportunity for connection and mutual understanding. The author recounts her experience of reading poetry and novels to her newborn, describing it as a way to share her deepest passion and guide her child's initial perceptions of the world. The act of reading together, from complex literature to simple board books, becomes a tool for teaching language, discerning patterns, and ultimately, for the parent to learn how to read the child's own developing self. It is framed as a shared journey of discovery for both parent and child.</p>

          <p>This article makes the case for tennis as an ideal lifetime sport, citing its numerous physical and mental health benefits. Beyond being a full-body, aerobic workout that improves bone density, studies suggest tennis players live significantly longer than sedentary individuals and even those who practice other sports like swimming or jogging. The sport's complexity—requiring rapid assessment of trajectory, speed, and spin while coordinating complex movements—provides significant cognitive benefits, enhancing reaction time and decision-making skills. Its relatively low risk of serious injury and social nature make it a sustainable and beneficial activity for people of all ages.</p>

          <p>A new book proposes a novel approach to climate change: creating a system of community-based carbon banks to sequester excess atmospheric carbon, inspired by how the U.S. government hoards gold. The idea involves local cooperatives accepting organic waste, converting it into a stable carbon form called biochar, and storing it. In exchange, depositors would receive a local digital currency, creating a grassroots economy based on carbon sequestration. This decentralized model aims to make carbon a valued, hoarded commodity, incentivizing its removal from the atmosphere without relying on slow-moving government action or large corporations.</p>

The storm exposed profound failures in government response at all levels, particularly within FEMA, which was unprepared for the scale of the crisis. As New Orleans continues its long recovery, the article raises concerns that the lessons about federal disaster preparedness may be forgotten amid current proposals to reduce FEMA's role.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide a crucial immigration case concerning the authority of federal agents to stop and question individuals based on their suspected legal status. The Trump administration is appealing a lower court's ruling that limited agents in Southern California from detaining people based solely on factors like their apparent ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or their presence at day-labor sites. The administration argues that agents need broad power to conduct stops based on a "reasonable suspicion" that includes these factors, given the high number of undocumented immigrants in the region, a stance critics say amounts to racial profiling.</p>
