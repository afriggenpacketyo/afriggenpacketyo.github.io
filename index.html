          <p>After escalating conflict involving missile and drone strikes, India and Pakistan announced a ceasefire agreement, though reports of violence persisted, with India disputing claims of U.S. mediation. The conflict began after an attack in Kashmir, leading to accusations and counter-accusations between the two nations, accompanied by disinformation and restricted media access. The fighting resulted in numerous casualties and damage, particularly in Poonch. The origins of the Kashmir dispute trace back to the 1947 partition of British India, with ongoing tensions and unresolved territorial claims. The article also includes an interactive map of the affected regions.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire agreement brokered with U.S. assistance, India accused Pakistan of violating the truce and announced its intention to respond to these violations. India's Foreign Secretary, Vikram Misri, confirmed the ceasefire but condemned Pakistan's actions, while Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir, reported hearing explosions in Srinagar. President Trump had initially announced the ceasefire, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirming U.S. involvement in brokering the agreement.

          <p>Torrential rains in eastern Congo caused severe flooding, washing away villages along Lake Tanganyika and resulting in at least 62 deaths and 50 missing. The floods struck early Friday, sweeping away the village of Kasaba and hampering rescue efforts due to damaged infrastructure and communication lines. The South Kivu provincial health minister reported that the Red Cross is the only humanitarian organization currently present, and the search for bodies is ongoing. This disaster compounds the existing humanitarian crisis in the region, which has been worsened by decades of conflict between government forces and rebels.</p>

          <p>As the Philippines prepares for midterm elections, many young voters are advocating for an end to political dynasties, expressing frustration with the concentration of power within long-entrenched families. These voters feel that political office has become akin to a family business, failing to address the needs of ordinary Filipinos in areas like education and healthcare. Reports indicate that a significant number of provincial governments are led by members of political dynasties, and some of these dynasties are expanding their reach across multiple elected positions. The Student Council Alliance of the Philippines is calling for enforcement of the constitutional ban on political dynasties, asserting that public office should not be inherited like private property.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration suggested that additional New Jersey Democratic lawmakers who were involved in a clash with authorities at a federal immigration detention center could face criminal charges, following the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China have commenced their first day of meetings in Geneva, aiming to address the escalating trade war initiated by President Trump's tariffs. The talks follow increased tariffs on Chinese imports by the U.S., with China retaliating with levies on U.S. goods, effectively disrupting trade between the two largest economies. Expectations for a significant breakthrough are low, but the initiation of high-level negotiations has raised hopes of de-escalating tensions and potentially lowering tariffs. Economists and investors are closely monitoring the negotiations, fearing that a prolonged economic war will result in slower growth and higher prices globally.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean after 53 years in space. The mission failed shortly after launch due to a malfunction in the launch vehicle's upper stage, stranding the probe in Earth's orbit. Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, reported that the spacecraft had re-entered the atmosphere and no longer exists, marking the end of its decades-long journey. The event serves as a reminder of the ambitious Soviet space program and the challenges of planetary exploration during the Cold War era.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake occurred in Tennessee, shaking homes as far away as Atlanta and spreading tremors across portions of the southern US. The earthquake's epicenter was near Greenback, Tennessee, and the USGS received over 23,000 public reports in the first hour after the event. While no major damage or injuries were immediately reported, the earthquake served as a reminder of the region's seismic activity, with a 5% chance of a magnitude 4 or larger aftershock in the coming week. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is one of the most active in the Southeast, and earthquakes in this region are felt over a much larger distance compared to the Western U.S.</p>

          <p>Officials from the United States and China commenced trade-related talks in Geneva, marking the first face-to-face discussions since President Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. The meetings aim to resolve a trade war that has disrupted financial markets and trade flows, with the U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. While a swift resolution is unlikely, the talks represent a potential step towards de-escalating tensions, with both sides feeling out each other's positions. A limited trade deal between the United Kingdom and the Trump administration preceded these discussions, but left tariffs in place on most British exports.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is bringing a small number of white South Africans to the U.S. as refugees, citing alleged persecution by the Black-led government, with the claims of persecution centering on violent farm attacks and affirmative action policies. The South African government denies these allegations, stating they are false and based on misinformation. Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch and French settlers, are part of South Africa's multi-racial society, but some rural white communities have expressed fears of violence and believe authorities are not doing enough to protect them. The Trump administration's program is limited to Afrikaners, who are largely seen as holding conservative and Christian values.</p>

          <p>Following a $750 million settlement from Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital, victims of gynecologist Robert Hadden's sexual assaults are questioning how he was able to abuse hundreds of women for over two decades. The latest settlement brings the total compensation for Hadden's crimes to nearly $1 billion, raising concerns about the institutions' alleged knowledge of his behavior and their failure to protect patients. Hadden was convicted in 2023 and sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients across state lines to sexually abuse them, with victims including prominent women such as Evelyn Yang. Victims are now calling for institutional accountability and improved patient safety measures.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller reflects on his career, emphasizing the importance of instinct over excessive data in making creative and business decisions. Diller argues that relying solely on data can hinder innovation and narrow one's perspective, while instinct allows for a broader understanding and better judgment. He shares anecdotes from his time at ABC, highlighting how successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" were driven by gut feelings rather than extensive research. Diller contrasts this approach with MBA students who are armed with business tools but lack simple human instinct, advocating for a balance between information and intuition.</p>

          <p>Migratory birds, crucial for maintaining ecosystem health through pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control, are increasingly affected by climate change, which is altering their migration patterns. Rising sea levels threaten coastal resting spots, while ocean acidification impacts the crustaceans that birds rely on for food, leading to reduced survival and reproduction rates. Extreme weather events, such as storms, can drag down and kill birds, while warmer temperatures can disrupt traditional migration routes and lead to conflicts with resident animals. The extinction of species like the slender-billed curlew highlights the pressures of human activity, emphasizing the need for expanded protected areas and bird-friendly practices to ensure the survival of these vital travelers.</p>
