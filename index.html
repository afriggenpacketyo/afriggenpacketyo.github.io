          <p>The Royal Family is moving forward with VE Day commemorations, hoping to keep the focus on honoring veterans and the end of World War Two. This comes after Prince Harry's candid BBC interview, where he discussed his estrangement from his father and concerns about the King's health. The events include a military procession, a Buckingham Palace balcony appearance, a tea party for war veterans, and a thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey. Despite the family's hope for an undisturbed celebration, Prince Harry's remarks have stirred public discussion, with Buckingham Palace responding to his claims about his UK security situation by emphasizing that the courts have repeatedly examined and rejected his challenges.</p>

          <p>The bodies of 13 security guards who were kidnapped from a La Poderosa gold mine in Peru have been discovered, with the mining company blaming informal miners linked to criminal gangs for the abduction. The company reports that 39 of its workers have been killed since mining operations began in 1980 due to violence from groups vying for control of the mine. The Interior Ministry has deployed special police forces to capture those responsible, amid a surge in extortion reports from artisanal miners in the area. Mining is a key economic driver in Peru, but illegal mining has boomed into a vast industry.</p>

Truex notes that Trump initially seemed to favor a closer relationship with authoritarian leaders like Xi Jinping but has since adopted a more aggressive stance, marked by a tariff war. Truex suggests that Trump's actions may be part of a bargaining tactic but also reflects a broader shift in the U.S.-China relationship.

          <p>Audrey Backeberg, who disappeared from her home in Wisconsin in 1962 at the age of 20, has been found "alive and well" after nearly 63 years. A detective assigned to review the cold case uncovered new information, revealing that Backeberg's disappearance was by her own choice. Backeberg, now 82, is living outside of Wisconsin. The detective was able to locate her through her sister's ancestry.com account and spoke with her for 45 minutes. She said an abusive husband may have played a role in her initial decision to leave her home and sounded "happy" with "no regrets."</p>

It also references Trump's claims that President Xi Jinping called him to discuss negotiations, implying China's concession, in what the article calls an absurd episode of political theater.</p>
