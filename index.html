          <p>The Trump administration has released a large collection of previously classified government files related to the 1968 assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The documents, which include FBI surveillance records, had been sealed since 1977. King's family issued a statement acknowledging the government's invasive surveillance campaign against him and urged the public to view the files with empathy and historical context. The release fulfills a campaign promise by the president to declassify records from major assassinations.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a group of stocks, which he dubs "PARC," that are being driven by strong interest from retail investors. The group includes Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase, which he believes have momentum to continue rallying despite occasional pullbacks. Cramer noted that while these companies have solid earnings, their popularity is also fueled by what he calls "irrational believers" in trendy sectors like cryptocurrency and quantum computing. He advises investors to exercise discipline and secure profits from these volatile names. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis details how the Trump administration is leveraging the judicial system, particularly through executive orders and a reshaped Supreme Court, to advance its agenda. The article highlights a confrontational approach towards lower federal courts, with the administration questioning their legitimacy and authority, leading to an unprecedented level of hostility and threats against judges. This dynamic is reshaping the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches, with long-term implications for presidential authority. The piece contrasts this with past presidents' clashes with the courts, noting the unique scale and fury of the current situation.</p>

          <p>The 13-year-old step-grandson of reality TV star Duane "Dog the Bounty Hunter" Chapman has died from an apparent accidental shooting in Florida. The teenager, Anthony, was allegedly shot by his own father, Gregory Zecca, who is Chapman's stepson. The Collier County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident, which they have described as isolated, and no arrests have been made. In a public statement, Chapman and his wife Francie confirmed the death, calling it an "incomprehensible tragic accident" and requesting privacy.</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has filed a complaint asking the Department of Justice to investigate Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for what it calls "illegal DEI practices." The complaint alleges that the university uses diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives as a proxy for race-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, thereby violating civil rights laws. The group's letter specifically targets the university's financial aid programs and pathway initiatives, arguing they circumvent the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action. The complaint calls for an end to these programs and a suspension of federal funding.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Kentucky police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. The judge's sentence notably rejected a controversial recommendation from the Trump administration's Justice Department for only one day of prison time. This sentencing marks the first prison term for any officer involved in the raid, a case that became a focal point for the Black Lives Matter movement.

The White House press secretary cited the Journal's "fake and defamatory conduct" as the reason for the exclusion, which comes after the president filed a $20 billion libel lawsuit against the paper. The White House Correspondents' Association condemned the decision as an attempt to punish a media outlet and a defiance of the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis argues that the current presidency is animated not by a coherent policy agenda but by a pervasive culture of pettiness, anger, and retribution. The article cites multiple examples, from renaming military bases and barring former officials from events to pressuring the Federal Reserve chairman and flip-flopping on Ukraine policy based on personal slights. It suggests these actions are driven by emotion and a desire to settle personal scores rather than by substantive governance. The piece concludes that this approach, while appealing to a base that enjoys culture-war grievances, ultimately lacks direction and purpose.</p>

          <h2>New CBO Analysis Finds Trump's Tax Bill Will Add $3.4 Trillion to National Debt</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that President Trump's latest tax bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts while also introducing new cuts, which will result in $4.5 trillion in lost revenue. These losses are only partially offset by an estimated $1.1 trillion in savings from stricter work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps, which the CBO estimates will leave 10 million people without health insurance. The bill also boosts funding for immigration enforcement and border security. (not investment advice)</p>

The gathering was prompted by social media posts suggesting a Monday opening, following a private soft launch for first responders and Tesla Club members over the weekend.

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration faced off in a Boston court over the government's decision to strip over $2 billion in federal funding from the university. The administration claims the cuts are a necessary response to antisemitism on campus, an argument the judge appeared skeptical of, calling it "mind-boggling." Harvard's lawyers argued the move was an attempt to control the university and would harm vital public research into medicine and science. The case is part of a broader conflict that also includes administration efforts to restrict Harvard's access to foreign student visas.</p>

The annual "Silicon Valley Pain Index" found that the wealth gap in the tech hub has widened at twice the national rate over the past decade. While the nine wealthiest households saw their collective wealth increase by $136 billion last year, 110,000 households reported having little to no assets.
