          <p>Digital physical therapy startup Hinge Health has updated its prospectus, revealing a 50% revenue increase in the first quarter, reaching $123.8 million. The company filed to go public in March but has yet to announce a price range. This comes during a period of economic uncertainty and market volatility, influenced by President Trump's tariff policies, leading some companies to delay their IPOs.

          <p>Nineteen states and Washington D.C. have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the layoffs of Health and Human Services (HHS) staffers. The states argue that these job cuts, impacting agencies like the CDC and FDA, undermine HHS's ability to perform its duties, such as worker safety and Head Start programs. The lawsuit also criticizes HHS leader Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s views on vaccines. An HHS spokesperson defended the changes as designed to strengthen the agency's capacity to serve the public.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to mifepristone, an abortion pill, aligning with the position previously taken by the Biden administration. The Justice Department argues the case, filed by conservative attorneys general, does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Texas district court where it was filed. The lawsuit aims to reverse FDA regulatory changes that expanded access to mifepristone and seeks new restrictions, including outlawing the medication for those under 18 and banning telemedicine prescriptions.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to coordinate with the super PAC 'Fix the City' supporting his mayoral bid. This involves 'red-boxing,' where candidates post strategic information publicly for super PACs to use, bypassing direct communication restrictions. The New York City Campaign Finance Board warned campaigns about the new rules targeting red-boxing, and Cuomo could face penalties if found in violation. A lawyer for Cuomo denies any wrongdoing, stating there is no evidence the super PAC acted on the information.</p>

The crescent symbolizes Islam, which Malaysia’s constitution recognizes as “the religion of the federation”. The absence of the yellow crescent in Sin Chew’s flag undermined what some view as the very essence of the nation – Malay primacy.

          <p>President Trump has proposed reopening Alcatraz as a prison to house dangerous inmates, aiming to symbolize law and order. However, experts deem the plan unrealistic due to the dilapidated state of the facility and its current status as a historic landmark. Alcatraz, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, is now a museum operated by the National Park Service. The idea has been considered before, including in 1981, but was rejected due to inadequate facilities and its value as a tourist site.</p>

The company has also withdrawn its full-year forecast, citing increased uncertainty.

Ford reported a profit decrease in the first quarter, attributing it to lower vehicle sales and production pauses.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel is "on the eve of a forceful entry to Gaza" after his security cabinet approved a new plan for tens of thousands of additional soldiers to seize and hold territory and relocate Palestinians to the south. The plan is intended to pressure Hamas to release the hostages and destroy Hamas’s infrastructure. The escalation followed more than two months in which Israel continued to blockade and bombard the Gaza Strip as cease-fire talks to free the remaining hostages ground to a near standstill.</p>

          <p>Shares of Netflix, Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery briefly fell after President Trump proposed a 100% tariff on movies made overseas. Trump called tax incentives offered by foreign countries "a national security threat". The impact and implementation of the tariff are unclear, as are the consequences to international sales. The article notes that some industry experts worry about how these duties will impact relationships with other countries.</p>
