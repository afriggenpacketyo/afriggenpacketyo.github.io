          <p>A devastating bus crash in western New York, involving a tourist vehicle returning from Niagara Falls, has claimed five lives and injured many of the 52 passengers, primarily from India, China, and the Philippines. The incident saw the bus lose control and overturn, ejecting some occupants and trapping others, with police noting most were likely not wearing seat belts. While mechanical failure and operator impairment have been ruled out, the cause remains under investigation as authorities seek dashcam footage. Hospitals received numerous patients, with many expected to recover fully, while community organizations have launched urgent appeals for blood donations and established family reunification centers.</p>

          <p>Turkey is exploring new regulations to curb significant food waste, particularly from all-you-can-eat hotel buffets and traditional large breakfasts, which currently see 8.7 million tons of food discarded annually. Advisors to President Erdogan are working on proposals, with one expert suggesting guests should customize their breakfasts rather than receiving standard large spreads. This initiative aims to address both economic problems and environmental damage caused by waste, even though private households remain the largest contributors globally. The potential changes have garnered international attention, especially from countries whose citizens frequently visit Turkey.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a new congressional map, backed by former President Trump, designed to significantly enhance Republican chances of maintaining their U.S. House majority in upcoming elections. This map is projected to create five additional Republican-leaning districts in Texas, a political victory achieved despite weeks of Democratic efforts to break quorum by fleeing the state. Governor Greg Abbott, who advocated for the map, is expected to sign it into law, though Democrats have accused the GOP of crafting an illegal and racially discriminatory plan. The article highlights the Republican strategy to improve their political performance ahead of the 2026 midterm cycle.</p>

          <p>California and Texas, the two most populous US states, are engaged in an intense redistricting battle with significant implications for the balance of power in Washington D.C. Texas initiated the conflict by redrawing its congressional maps mid-decade to add five Republican-leaning seats, prompting California to respond with its own plan to create five new Democratic-leaning districts. This article explains that gerrymandering, while legal unless racially motivated, is unusual when publicly backed by a president. The ongoing political arms race, which could spread to other states, aims to secure partisan advantage in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense researchers have developed a groundbreaking data link system for hypersonic combat, achieving time synchronization accuracy within five nanoseconds, significantly outperforming NATO's Link 16 system. This innovation, from the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, enables real-time, secure coordination among hypersonic platforms, ground command centers, and satellite intelligence despite extreme speeds. Experts suggest this marks a strategic shift towards a networked strike ecosystem, potentially leaving Western militaries "time blind" and unable to react to coordinated hypersonic swarms. The development highlights the profound and urgent implications for global defense dynamics as China prepares to showcase its advanced systems.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, shooting lava 100 feet into the air from its summit crater, marking its 31st display of molten rock since December. This highly active volcano is contained within the summit, posing no threat to homes, and offers spectacular views for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma is continuously supplied from the earth's interior, leading to these frequent, powerful eruptions. The current pattern, with lava fountains, is the fourth of its kind in 200 years, and while the duration is uncertain, it provides a unique opportunity to observe geological processes and cultural traditions related to the volcano goddess Pele.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances reveals that air pollution from oil and gas activities disproportionately affects people of color in the U.S., causing an estimated 91,000 premature deaths annually. The research, which quantifies health effects from every stage of fossil fuel activity, found that Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian American communities face higher risks of early deaths, preterm births, and childhood asthma. This article highlights that legacy zoning practices like "redlining" contribute to these disparities, placing vulnerable populations near pollution hotspots. Advocates are using these findings to press for environmental justice and a transition away from fossil fuels.</p>
