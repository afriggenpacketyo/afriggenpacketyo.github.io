          <p>The UK's bioethanol industry is on the verge of collapse after the government rejected a rescue plan for its two main producers, Vivergo Fuels and Ensus. The companies argued that a recent US-UK trade deal, which removed tariffs on US ethanol imports, made their operations financially unviable. The government stated the decision was in the national interest and would not provide value for taxpayers, despite the potential loss of hundreds of jobs and impacts on the clean fuel and CO2 supply chains.</p>

          <p>President Trump has departed for a high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, aimed at discussing a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting occurs as Russia launched a significant overnight drone and missile attack on 13 locations across Ukraine, while Russia reported downing numerous Ukrainian drones. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the summit was arranged quickly, with the president hoping to quickly assess whether a peaceful resolution is possible.</p>

Many potential nominees, including former officials and market strategists, have publicly advocated for lowering the Fed's benchmark interest rate. The candidates' views range from calls for aggressive rate cuts and fundamental "regime change" to concerns about a lack of transparency and intellectual diversity in the Federal Open Market Committee's decision-making process.

The summit's agenda is broad, with discussions expected to cover a potential ceasefire, territorial integrity, and geopolitical alliances, making the outcome highly uncertain.</p>

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" is critiqued in this article for concluding a show that often seemed hostile towards its own characters and source material. The review argues that while the original "Sex and the City" explored the indignities of single life, the sequel devolved into a cringe comedy fixated on the physical humiliations of aging. The finale reinforces the show's perceived squeamishness about physicality and its disconnect from the realities of life for anyone outside the characters' bubble of extreme wealth.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza are facing a severe water crisis, forcing them to drink contaminated water amid a scorching heatwave. The ongoing conflict has crippled infrastructure, destroying desalination plants and wells, while fuel shortages hamper the delivery of what little clean water remains. This has led to a surge in infectious diseases, particularly diarrhea, with aid groups warning that the situation is a dire public health emergency as people receive far less than the minimum daily water requirement.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake worth approximately $1.6 billion in the embattled health insurer UnitedHealth. The investment is notable given UnitedHealth's stock has fallen significantly in 2025 amid public criticism over healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices. The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in underperforming companies, and the disclosure caused UnitedHealth's stock to rise sharply in after-hours trading.

          <p>A former senior Chinese economic official has advised the government to stimulate consumption by removing purchase restrictions on items like property and vehicles. Yin Yanlin, formerly of a key party economic body, argued that encouraging affluent groups to spend would drive market demand and create a positive economic cycle. He noted that income levels are not the primary barrier to spending, pointing to the country's rapidly rising household savings rate as evidence that constrained demand, not a lack of funds, is the issue.

          <h2>Airlines Adjust to Shifting Summer Travel Patterns as Demand Peaks Earlier</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airlines are finding that traditional summer travel demand is changing, with peak periods shifting earlier in the season and becoming less predictable. Factors like earlier school start dates and travelers avoiding Europe's summer heat are causing demand to taper off in August, forcing carriers to be more strategic with their flight schedules. In response to these evolving patterns and higher operating costs, airlines are reducing capacity, which is expected to lead to higher airfares for consumers during the late summer months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent federal takeover of the D.C. police force is rooted in a long and complex history of the U.S. government's paternalistic relationship with the nation's capital. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress jurisdiction over the district, and for most of its history, residents lacked self-governance and representation. This article argues that resistance to D.C.'s autonomy has often been tied to partisan politics and racist notions that its majority-Black population cannot govern itself, a dynamic that continues to undermine the city's fight for statehood.</p>

          <p>A Reddit post has gone viral after a shopper at a Goodwill store shared photos of secondhand knick-knacks being sold at unusually high prices. The post sparked a discussion about a perceived trend of thrift stores raising prices as secondhand shopping grows in popularity, driven by younger, environmentally-conscious consumers and rising costs for new goods. While thrifting helps reduce fashion industry waste, some commenters expressed frustration that the appeal of affordability, a core tenet of thrift shopping, is being eroded.</p>

          <p>The relationship between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, which has shifted from praise to public frustration, will be a central dynamic at their meeting in Alaska. During his first term, Trump often lauded Putin, but his tone has changed recently amid Russia's ongoing war, with Trump calling the Russian leader "crazy" and expressing disappointment. This evolution adds a layer of unpredictability to the summit, as Trump's belief that he could personally negotiate an end to the war is now tempered by a more moderated and critical view of Putin's actions.</p>

          <p>The sixth round of UN negotiations aimed at creating a global treaty to end plastic pollution has failed without an agreement. The talks collapsed due to a fundamental disagreement between two main blocs of countries. Approximately 100 nations advocated for binding limits on plastic production, while major oil-producing states and plastic manufacturers, supported by a strong lobbyist presence, insisted the focus should remain on waste management and recycling, resisting any caps on production.</p>

          <p>A Labour councillor, Ricky Jones, has been found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after he made inflammatory remarks at an anti-racism rally in 2024.

Jones, who was suspended by his party, told the court his comments were ill-advised but were not intended to incite violence, a defense the jury accepted after a brief deliberation.</p>

While appointments are at the prime minister's discretion, the request highlights Reform's growing influence and its challenge to the traditional political establishment.</p>

This "fire with fire" approach, while aimed at neutralizing a GOP advantage, is sparking debate about its impact on democracy, as it prioritizes partisan gain over voter representation. The trend towards continual, politically motivated map-drawing further erodes the meaning of elections and reduces the number of competitive districts, promoting cynicism about the political process.</p>
