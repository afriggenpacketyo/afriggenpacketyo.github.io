          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia, according to her family. Giuffre had alleged that Epstein sexually trafficked her to Prince Andrew and others, claims which Andrew denied; an out-of-court settlement was reached in 2022. She had a troubled childhood and met Ghislaine Maxwell while working at Mar-a-Lago. Giuffre founded a nonprofit called SOAR to advocate for sexual assault victims. Her family stated that she was a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>A Texas mother, Teresa Isabel Bernal, was arrested for allegedly bringing vodka-spiked Jell-O shots to her child's fifth-grade class holiday party, resulting in one child vomiting and another being unable to stand. Multiple students consumed the tainted treats before school staff realized they contained alcohol. Bernal claimed she purchased the Jell-O shots from a local business and was unaware of the alcohol content; however, investigators found that the product's photo clearly indicated the presence of Smirnoff vodka.

          <p>A massive explosion and fire struck the Shahid Rajaei port in southern Iran, killing eight people and injuring over 750. The blast may be linked to a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel from China, intended to replenish Iran's missile stocks. While Iranian officials denied any attack, the incident occurred during nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States in Oman. Social media footage showed black smoke and blown-out windows, with authorities attributing the blast to a stockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Learner drivers in the UK are experiencing significant difficulties booking practical driving tests, with many comparing the process to buying festival tickets due to high demand and limited availability. The average waiting time for a test is 22 weeks, with some learners paying for apps that alert them when slots become available. The DVSA blames increased demand and booking behavior changes for the backlog, while instructors note that learners are booking tests far in advance, leading to extra costs for refresher lessons. The government aims to reduce waiting times to seven weeks by summer 2026.</p>

          <p>The area burned by wildfires in the UK has already surpassed the annual record, with over 29,200 hectares affected due to a prolonged dry spell in March and early April. The Global Wildfire Information System reports that most fires are started by humans, but favorable weather conditions have contributed to their rapid spread. Researchers warn that a second peak in the fire season is possible later in the year, and climate change is expected to increase the risk of extreme wildfires in the UK. The Met Office found that the extreme fire weather in July 2022 was made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by volatile trade policies, including increased tariffs on various countries. Despite initial increases, some tariffs were temporarily reduced following market disruptions and business leader concerns. However, continued trade tensions between the US and China have failed to restore investor confidence. The outcome of ongoing trade negotiations will likely shape perceptions of Trump's first 100 days and provide insights into his future economic strategies. Economists express concern about the potential for continued economic disruption.</p>

          <p>An influential California legislator is urging the State Bar of California to return to the national exam format after a disastrous February bar exam. The State Bar, seeking cost savings, had replaced the Multistate Bar Examination with its own questions, leading to technical issues and irregularities. Critics, including legal experts, are calling for a return to the NCBE system, citing fairness and reliability concerns. The State Bar is also facing scrutiny for using artificial intelligence to develop exam questions without informing the Supreme Court or the Committee of Bar Examiners.</p>
