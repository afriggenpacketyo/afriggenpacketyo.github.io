          <p>China is preparing for its largest military parade, commemorating the 80th anniversary of World War II victory, where it is expected to unveil advanced unmanned systems and demonstrate AI-enabled, multi-domain operations. Analysts believe the breadth of drone technologies on display will underscore the People's Liberation Army's rapid progress in integrating autonomous capabilities across air, land, and sea. While previously unseen models may be presented in formations simulating real war scenarios, security concerns likely mean these systems will be shown in static displays rather than in motion. This significant event highlights China's growing military technological prowess and its stated commitment to national sovereignty and global stability.</p>

This cautious optimism follows last Friday's lower close, as market participants evaluated recent European and U.S. inflation figures and the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, a prospect fueled by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks. Additionally, investors are digesting China's August manufacturing data, which unexpectedly returned to growth, and the agreement between India and China to be development partners, not rivals, during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting.

The summit, the largest to date with over 20 foreign leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, serves as a platform for China to project itself as a global peacemaker amidst ongoing international tensions. Xi highlighted China's investments in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education programs, emphasizing the opportunity for high-quality development and cooperation. The meeting also saw a reaffirmation of India-China relations, with both sides agreeing on the importance of being partners.</p>

The article notes that retail car prices in China have fallen significantly over the past two years, prompting authorities to warn against excessive price cuts. BYD's mid-year earnings filing acknowledged the adverse impact of increased price competition and frequent marketing on the industry's development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) reaching 50.5, surpassing economist estimates and signaling the fastest expansion since March. This improvement was largely propelled by a recovery in new export orders, indicating resilience in external demand despite existing tariffs. While overall output and new orders saw gains, the article notes that domestic demand showed less improvement, and employment in the manufacturing sector remained challenging for the fifth consecutive month. Experts caution that the durability of this upturn depends on sustained export stability and a pickup in domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Facial assessment technology shows a "buffer zone" of inaccuracy around age 16, leading to potential false positives or negatives.

          <p>Vietnam is significantly expanding its military footprint in the disputed Spratly Islands, where it occupies the most features, surpassing China in recent land reclamation efforts. Satellite images reveal that all 21 Vietnamese-occupied features have been enlarged with artificial land, and infrastructure like munitions storage is being developed on newly dredged reefs. This ongoing work signals Vietnam's determination to solidify its territorial claims in the South China Sea, which are also contested by China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei. Maritime analysts suggest these actions, while not immediately altering the strategic balance, could prompt Beijing to upgrade its own defense posture in the region.</p>

          <p>In his seven months in office, President Donald Trump has significantly altered the decor of the Oval Office, applying what he calls "Trump touches" that have led to an "extreme goldening" of the space. This makeover includes gold trimming on ceilings, door frames, and fireplaces, with even sculpted cherubim receiving a gold paint treatment. The article notes a proliferation of gold trophies, vases, and personalized coasters, all reportedly paid for personally by Trump. While a White House spokesperson described it as a "golden office for the golden age," critics have compared the aesthetic to a professional wrestler's dressing room, raising questions about the symbolism of the changes.</p>

The article notes that China's military progress, including advanced hardware, inspires domestic optimism, closing the gap on its American counterpart. However, Washington is perfecting the art of creating economic choke points over rivals by combining its technological lead with its position as the world's largest consumer market. This dynamic signifies a new front in the superpower competition, where economic might is as crucial as military strength.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has strongly criticized the Trump administration's reported plans to send military forces to Chicago, calling the move an "invasion" and asserting that President Trump has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction. Pritzker stated there has been no communication with his state regarding such a deployment, which The Washington Post reported could involve thousands of National Guard members. He suggested Trump's actions might be aimed at influencing future elections. The White House, in turn, dismissed Pritzker's accusations, blaming him for Chicago's crime rate. This highlights a significant federal-state conflict over law enforcement authority.</p>
