          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The move follows Trump's firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which the president claimed was "rigged." Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has been supported by influential figures like Steve Bannon for the role. The nomination requires Senate confirmation to proceed.

He highlighted that the industry, which offers rapid delivery of goods, presents new consumption opportunities crucial for long-term economic growth. Wang urged officials to implement targeted policies that foster high-quality development and innovation. The goal is to shift the competitive landscape from a zero-sum game to a win-win approach focused on quality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce, suspending planned tariff hikes for another 90 days until November 10. President Trump signed an executive order to formalize the delay, which prevents a 145% tariff on Chinese goods and a 125% duty on U.S. shipments from taking effect. Under the extension, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariff on Chinese imports, while China will keep a 10% tariff on American goods. The White House stated the additional time will be used for negotiations on trade imbalances and other economic issues. (not investment advice)</p>

While Trump cites 2023 statistics to portray a city in crisis, current data shows a dramatic drop in violent crime, which is now at a 30-year low. The piece points out that this tactic mirrors his previous portrayal of Los Angeles as being "invaded and occupied" during protests. Experts quoted in the article argue that the president is ignoring current positive trends to create a pretext for an unprecedented federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned that the organization is at risk of collapse. In a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission, they raised concerns about a "toxic internal culture" and potential misuse of public funds. The complaint follows a threat from Technology Secretary Peter Kyle to withdraw the institute's £100 million grant unless it pivots its research focus toward defense and national security. The staff claim this government pressure has triggered a "crisis in governance" that could lead to the institute's demise.</p>

          <p>English soccer player Jess Carter revealed she feared her Black teammate, Lauren James, would face "astronomical" racist abuse if she had been the only player to miss a penalty in a crucial Euro 2025 shootout. Carter, who was also a target of online racism during the tournament, described a sense of relief when white teammates also missed penalties, as it diluted the potential for racially focused backlash. She spoke about the profound psychological impact of the abuse, stating it made her feel "small," "scared," and not confident on the pitch, highlighting the severe emotional toll on players.</p>

          <p>The three-year-long disappearance of Scottish cyclist Tony Parsons was solved thanks to the girlfriend of one of his killers. After her boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to a fatal hit-and-run, he took her to the remote shallow grave where Parsons was buried. The girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later informed the police, leading them to the body. Parsons had gone missing during a charity bike ride in 2017, and his family expressed immense gratitude for her actions.</p>

          <p>A Sky News analysis suggests President Trump's decision to hold a bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin, excluding Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reveals a pragmatic but controversial diplomatic strategy. Trump has framed the Alaska meeting as a low-stakes "feel out" session to explore a potential deal, likely involving "land swapping." The article notes that Trump's simultaneous law-and-order crackdown in Washington D.C. appears timed to project an image of strength ahead of the summit. A gaffe where Trump misspoke about going to Russia highlights how central Putin is to his current political narrative.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" and holding a constructive meeting just days after demanding his immediate resignation. Last week, Trump had called Tan "highly CONFLICTED" over alleged ties to China, but a recent meeting with the CEO and cabinet members led to a completely different tone. Trump announced that Tan and his cabinet would work together on suggestions for the president. This sudden flip-flop highlights the administration's unpredictable involvement in the semiconductor industry amid U.S.-China tensions.</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have signed a new multi-year, first-look deal with Netflix for their Archewell Productions, extending their partnership with the streaming giant. However, this new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive and lucrative than their original 2020 overall deal, which covered overhead costs. The couple has produced several projects for Netflix, including the popular documentary series "Harry & Meghan." Under the new pact, they will continue to develop film and television projects, including a second season of Meghan's cooking show and a film adaptation of a romance novel.</p>

          <p>The gunman who attacked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta fired more than 180 shots, causing significant damage to at least four buildings. The attack broke approximately 150 windows, with some bullets penetrating "blast-resistant" glass and sending shards into numerous rooms. The shooter, who had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for his depression, killed a police officer before he was stopped by security and later died. The attack has raised concerns about the long-term impact of anti-science rhetoric on the safety of public health workers.</p>
