        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone bombardment on Ukraine, primarily targeting Kyiv, a day before President Trump was expected to speak with President Putin about a potential ceasefire. Ukrainian officials reported intercepting 88 drones out of an estimated 273, but the attack resulted in one death and several injuries, including a child. This escalation is part of a growing pattern of aerial bombardments, with waves of over 100 drones attacking towns and cities multiple times a week, indicating a concerning trend in the ongoing conflict and a show of force before diplomatic discussions.</p>

          <p>The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, as the suspect in a deadly car bombing targeting a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. Bartkus, believed to have had "nihilistic ideations," detonated explosives outside the American Reproductive Centers (ARC) and attempted to livestream the attack. The explosion, which the FBI is investigating as an "intentional act of terrorism," caused significant damage to the clinic's office but left the IVF lab and stored eggs and embryos secure. Authorities believe Bartkus is the sole fatality, and there is no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic tour in the Middle East has underscored a shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu taking a backseat. Trump's engagement with leaders in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, including lifting sanctions on Syria and pursuing deals with Iran and Yemen, has occurred without Israel's direct involvement. This marks a departure from decades of U.S. policy where Israel held a central position, raising concerns about the future of the U.S.-Israel relationship. Despite this shift, Trump insists that his actions are beneficial for Israel, citing improved relations with Middle Eastern countries.</p>

The article points out that while Black artists are reclaiming country music, the industry often prioritizes a white aesthetic, creating a divide between Black art and Black artists.

          <p>After a five-year pause, the Trump administration is set to resume seizing federal tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits from defaulted student loan borrowers. This shift away from the Biden administration's relief measures has sparked concern among borrowers, with many struggling to afford payments due to high living costs. The Education Department can garnish up to 15% of defaulted borrowers' disposable income and federal benefits, creating financial hardship for millions. Some borrowers report difficulties contacting the Education Department for assistance, despite the administration's claims of extended call hours and new resources.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire mother, Heather Strong, discovered she had a rare heart condition, Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), after suffering two strokes at a young age. Following her diagnosis, she had her family checked, and two of her three daughters were also found to have ASD. All three women underwent a minimally invasive procedure to close the holes in their hearts, performed by the same doctor at Tufts Medical Center. The Strong family hopes their experience will encourage others to get checked for potential health issues, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment.</p>
