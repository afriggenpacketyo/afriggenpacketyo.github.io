          <p>Asian-Pacific markets saw gains, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising 1.5% and the Topix index hitting a record high following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement. The news introduced a period of political uncertainty but spurred positive market reactions, while the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar. Investors are now monitoring the leadership transition within the ruling LDP and key upcoming economic data from the region, including China's August trade figures. The resignation comes after mounting pressure on Ishiba following an election defeat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques a Wall Street Journal piece by Rahm Emanuel, which suggested that viewing China as a threat could foster internal cohesion in American politics. The author refutes this premise, arguing that the United States has historically sought external enemies to unify its domestic landscape, a pattern evident even in its early republic. The piece contends that America's internal divisions, such as those leading to Donald Trump's presidency, are self-inflicted and not attributable to Chinese strategy. It challenges the narrative that China is an adversary responsible for U.S. societal fractures.</p>

          <p>Following a major immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, President Donald Trump addressed the detention of foreign workers. He proposed allowing foreign experts to enter the U.S. temporarily to train American workers in complex industries like battery and chip manufacturing. While defending the ICE operation by stating the detained individuals were present illegally, he emphasized that foreign companies investing in the U.S. must respect its immigration laws. Trump called for a system to legally and quickly bring in technical talent while prioritizing the hiring and training of the domestic workforce.</p>

The trial, which captivated the nation, centered on whether she intentionally poisoned her guests, a conclusion the jury reached after deliberation.

          <p>The South Korean government has reached an agreement with the United States to secure the release of its citizens detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia. A chartered flight is being arranged to bring the workers home pending the completion of administrative procedures. The raid, in which U.S. officials detained 475 people, has caused concern in Seoul, a key U.S. ally and major investor in American manufacturing. The incident has prompted calls within South Korea to improve the visa system to prevent similar occurrences in the future.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that President Donald Trump's recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska "gave Putin what he wanted." In an interview, Zelenskyy expressed that the meeting itself was a victory for the Russian leader, who he claims seeks the legitimacy and imagery of meeting with a U.S. president. The comments came as Ukraine faced a record assault of Russian drones and munitions. Zelenskyy reiterated the need for increased pressure from the U.S. and European allies to end the war, including halting the purchase of Russian energy.</p>

          <p>The trial for Ryan Wesley Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump in September 2024, is set to begin in Florida. Routh, who has pleaded not guilty and will be representing himself, allegedly fired a rifle at the Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach while the president was on the course. Federal prosecutors state that Routh was found with an SKS rifle and a list of Trump's upcoming events. The case highlights the issue of political violence in the U.S. and has placed scrutiny on the Secret Service's protective measures.</p>

This sentiment is echoed by Sharon Graham of the Unite union, who warned that her union might vote to sever its financial ties with the Labour Party.

However, opposition parties from across the spectrum have signaled their intent to vote against him. This follows President Emmanuel Macron's failed 2024 snap election, which resulted in a hung parliament and has left the country in a state of political paralysis for over a year.</p>

          <p>City leaders in Santa Monica are poised to declare a fiscal emergency due to a severe budget crisis exacerbated by massive legal payouts and lagging revenue. The city has paid over $229 million in settlements related to sexual assault claims against a former city employee, with more than 180 additional claims pending. This financial strain is compounded by the fact that city services have not been restored to pre-pandemic levels, and the city's budget for the upcoming fiscal year projects a significant deficit. Councilmembers have expressed grave concerns, with one fearing the city is "careening towards bankruptcy."</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have intensified their campaign in Gaza City, destroying another high-rise building and bringing the total number of razed towers to at least 50. The strike on the Al-Ruya Tower on Sunday was part of a broader assault across the Gaza Strip that killed at least 65 people. The Israeli military claimed the tower housed "terrorist infrastructure" and issued an evacuation warning before the attack, forcing displaced families sheltering nearby to flee again. This comes as Israel continues its push to occupy the city, while Palestinian officials warn that there are no safe zones.</p>

          <p>President Trump has walked back a social media post that suggested he was threatening to "go to war" with Chicago, telling reporters he intends to "clean up" American cities instead. The original post, which stated Chicago was "about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR," drew sharp criticism from Illinois' Democratic leaders. For weeks, Trump has suggested deploying the National Guard to cities like Chicago to combat crime and assist with immigration enforcement, despite opposition from local officials who call the intervention unwanted and unconstitutional. The threats have been met with protests and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Superchief Gallery, a prominent independent art space in downtown Los Angeles known for championing counterculture artists, may be forced to close this month due to financial struggles. The gallery's co-founder cites a decline in both art sales and corporate sponsorships as patrons and businesses become more cautious with their spending. This potential closure is part of a broader trend of struggling businesses in downtown L.A., which has seen several legacy establishments and cultural venues shut down post-pandemic. Despite a crowdfunding campaign, the gallery is struggling to cover its monthly expenses and has incurred significant debt.</p>

          <p>Florida's health department has clarified that its plan to eliminate some school vaccine mandates will likely not take effect for 90 days and will initially apply only to a few diseases, including chickenpox and hepatitis B. The controversial move, announced by Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, would make Florida the first state to allow families to opt out of these long-standing public health requirements. Mandates for other diseases like measles and polio will remain unless changed by legislation. The plan has drawn sharp criticism from medical experts, who warn it could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that President Trump's tariff plan will be upheld by the Supreme Court but warned of severe financial consequences if it is not. Speaking on NBC, Bessent stated that if the court rules the tariffs illegal, the Treasury Department would be forced to issue refunds on about half of the collected duties. The administration has asked the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling after a federal appeals court found that most of the "reciprocal tariffs" exceeded presidential authority, placing a significant portion of U.S. import duties in legal jeopardy.

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz captured his second U.S. Open title and sixth career Grand Slam with a commanding four-set victory over rival and defending champion Jannik Sinner. The 22-year-old Spaniard's superior performance will also return him to the world No. 1 ranking. The final was delayed due to heightened security for U.S. President Donald Trump's attendance, which drew a mixed reaction from the crowd. Alcaraz dominated much of the match with his powerful forehand and versatile play, effectively neutralizing Sinner's rhythm to win 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, marking the third time the two have met in a major final this year.</p>
