        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Inglewood Italian restaurant, Sunday Gravy, is struggling to stay afloat as tariffs on imported ingredients and rising inflation significantly cut into its profits. Owner Sol Bashirian notes a 30% sales increase but faces thousands more in monthly costs, considering a 5% surcharge to offset expenses. Financial analysts observe that eateries serving lower- and middle-income consumers, and their patrons, are particularly affected by these economic pressures. The National Restaurant Association advocates for tariff exemptions on imported food, warning that current conditions necessitate substantial menu price hikes to maintain minimal profit margins.

          <h2>Venezuelan Fishermen Fear US Strikes in Caribbean Targeting Alleged Drug Smugglers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venezuelan fishermen, like Wilder Fernández, express profound fear for their lives and livelihoods following US military strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean Sea. Despite the US claiming these strikes target "narco-terrorists," local fishermen worry about being caught in the crossfire or mistakenly hit, leading many to refuse to go to sea. Venezuela's government has denounced the actions, warning citizens to prepare for potential escalation, while a spokeswoman for a fishermen's council fears the added risks could push some into illicit activities. This article highlights the severe human impact and regional instability caused by the US operation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US military conducted another airstrike in the Caribbean targeting an alleged drug vessel, with officials confirming survivors for the first time after previous strikes resulted in 27 deaths. This marks at least the sixth such operation by the Trump administration against what it labels "narcoterrorists," though no evidence supporting these assertions has been publicly released. Venezuela's UN ambassador denounced these actions as extrajudicial executions, citing claims that two of the killed were fishermen, not drug traffickers. The White House maintains the strikes are justified to combat illicit drug trafficking into the US.</p>

          <p>Virginia's Democratic attorney general nominee, Jay Jones, faced intense scrutiny over past texts envisioning harm to a Republican House Speaker, expressing regret but pivoting to criticize Attorney General Jason Miyares' ties to Donald Trump. Miyares questioned Jones's prosecutorial experience and linked his policies to controversies, while Jones repeatedly vowed to challenge Trump in court. The debate highlighted themes of character, accountability, and political allegiances, with Miyares emphasizing his immigrant background and Jones his family's civil rights involvement. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries defended Jones's apology for the remarks.</p>

          <p>The booming e-bike market, now valued at nearly $2 billion, is accompanied by a significant increase in risks, particularly for younger riders. Emergency room visits among children aged 10 to 17 have more than tripled since 2019, prompting concerns from local officials who label high-speed e-bikes as "death traps" without proper training or licensing. While regulations vary nationwide, New Jersey Representative Josh Gottheimer has introduced legislation addressing helmet use for minors and providing grants for enforcing underage riding safety. The article highlights the urgent need for enhanced safety measures and parental awareness as these powerful devices become more accessible to youth.</p>

          <p>The US military flew three B-52 bombers near Venezuela's coast, intensifying pressure on President Nicolás Maduro's government, which the Trump administration accuses of collaborating with drug cartels. This deployment is part of a broader military buildup in the Caribbean, including warships and thousands of US forces, following recent airstrikes on alleged drug-carrying boats. President Trump also confirmed authorizing covert CIA operations in Venezuela and is considering land-based strikes against drug traffickers. Maduro denies cartel ties and views these actions as attempts at regime change, while the US faces domestic pushback for the lack of congressional authority and evidence for the strikes.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that growing concerns over sour bank loans, highlighted by recent bankruptcies and disclosed losses, will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner. He argues that credit losses are a definitive sign of economic downturn, which motivates the Fed to act swiftly without excessive inflation worries. While lower rates stimulate the economy and prevent defaults, Cramer believes these credit issues will be contained to banks and not harm the broader market. This article offers an expert's perspective on how banking sector health influences monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The defense attorney for Jonathan Rinderknecht, charged with igniting the deadly Palisades fire, argues the evidence is thin and accuses authorities of scapegoating his client. Rinderknecht faces up to 45 years in prison for allegedly starting the Lachman fire, which later reignited into the massive Palisades blaze that killed 12 people and destroyed over 6,800 structures. The lawyer contends a factual link between the initial fire and the later destructive inferno is impossible due to the time gap and variables.
