          <p>As President Trump's tariffs increased, so did the schemes to evade them, costing the U.S. government billions in revenue annually and frustrating honest companies. Chinese firms are offering methods to bypass tariffs, such as altering shipment information or transshipment through other countries. The Trump administration is focusing on fighting trade fraud and urging other countries to increase enforcement efforts. However, many U.S. companies believe the scale of illicit activity far exceeds the governments' ability to stop it, leading to unfair competition and financial disadvantage (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud.

          <p>President Trump's threat to cut funding to California over a trans-identifying athlete competing in a girls' track championship led to a rule change allowing additional girls to compete. The McGuinness family expressed gratitude for Trump's support but deemed the solution inadequate, arguing it remains unfair to biological female athletes. Katie McGuinness voiced concerns about genetic disadvantages in high school sports, while defending that she had nothing against the trans community. The California Interscholastic Federation is under a federal Title IX investigation, with the state having allowed trans athletes to compete since 2014.</p>

The study found that late baby boomers have experienced homelessness at uniquely high rates, and the death of parents is leaving many without a safety net, with the number of homeless people 65 or older increasing significantly.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at Lemon Hill in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park resulted in two deaths and nine injuries, with police identifying three shooters involved. The victims, Amya Devlin, 23, and Mikhail Bowers, 21, were killed, while the wounded ranged in age from 15 to 28. Investigators are examining social media videos and believe a gun "switch" may have been used, converting a semi-automatic weapon to fully automatic. The shooting occurred during an unscheduled gathering, prompting concerns about security at upcoming events in the park.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to End Federal Contracts with Harvard University</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 17:15:09 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to cancel approximately $100 million in federal contracts with Harvard University, alleging ongoing race discrimination and insufficient protection of Jewish students. The move directs federal agencies to seek alternative vendors, while the administration says the contract review would not include the Harvard hospital system. Critics see the action as an attack on academic freedom and research, stemming from perceived liberal bias at the university.</p>
