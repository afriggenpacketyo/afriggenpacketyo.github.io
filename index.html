        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has approved a controversial $9 billion spending cut package championed by the Trump administration. The legislation primarily targets foreign aid programs for countries affected by crises and significantly reduces funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. While Republicans celebrated the move as a step towards fiscal responsibility, Democrats condemned it, warning it undermines America's global influence and could lead to a government shutdown.</p>

          <h2>Jane Street Case in India Highlights Fine Line Between Legal Arbitrage and Market Manipulation</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's recent ban on high-frequency trading firm Jane Street has reignited debate over the distinction between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation. Experts note the key difference lies in intent, or "mens rea," and market impact; creating price discrepancies to profit is manipulation, while exploiting existing ones is arbitrage. The Securities and Exchange Board of India alleges Jane Street deliberately distorted less liquid markets to profit from options, a claim the firm disputes as standard arbitrage. The case underscores the regulatory challenges posed by sophisticated trading strategies in global financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:01:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all non-immigrant visa applicants, including tourists and students. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and will be collected upon visa issuance, starting from the 2025 fiscal year. While the provision allows for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa terms, implementation details remain unclear, causing confusion among travel associations and immigration experts. The Congressional Budget Office anticipates the measure will generate significant revenue, as few are expected to seek reimbursement.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a novel infrared sensing technology inspired by the fire beetle, an insect capable of detecting faint heat from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away. This new technology is reportedly 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, offering significant potential for military and industrial applications. The beetle's unique pit organ evolved to find charred wood, which provides the ideal conditions for its larvae to hatch. This biomimicry demonstrates how nature can inspire breakthroughs in advanced sensor design for challenging environments.</p>

          <p>Facing growing discontent from his political base, President Trump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move follows a Justice Department memo that dismissed theories of a "client list," which angered many supporters who believe in a wider conspiracy. While Bondi stated her readiness to file the court motion, it is uncertain if a judge will approve the release of traditionally secret grand jury materials. The action appears aimed at quelling the political firestorm within Trump's own party over his administration's handling of the case.</p>

Using the French TV show *Bref* as a cultural touchstone for his millennial generation, he explores themes of regret, identity, and the unexpected paths life takes.

          <h2>Cancellation of Stephen Colbert's 'Late Show' Raises Questions About Network's Motives</h2>

          <p>CBS has announced it will end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in May, despite the show consistently leading its time slot in ratings. While the network cited the move as a "purely financial decision," the timing has sparked skepticism and concern about its editorial independence. The article suggests the cancellation may be part of a pattern of capitulation to President Trump, following a controversial $16 million settlement of a lawsuit Trump filed against the network. The decision is seen by some as a blow to CBS's legacy of journalistic integrity, particularly as its parent company, Paramount, seeks federal approval for a merger.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters admitted on-air that his program made a mistake in its reporting on a phone call between California Governor Gavin Newsom and President Trump. The admission follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom, who alleged the show lied about the timeline of the call to suggest he was dishonest. Watters claimed his team misunderstood a social media post by the governor, stating, "he wasn't lying. He was just confusing and unclear." In response to the partial apology, Newsom's office indicated the lawsuit will proceed.</p>

          <p>Veteran Member of Parliament Diane Abbott has been suspended from the UK's Labour Party for a second time after making controversial comments about racism. In a BBC interview, Abbott reiterated her view that racism against Black people is distinct from prejudice faced by other groups like Jewish people or Travellers, as skin color is immediately visible. The remarks caused an immediate backlash, with the party launching an investigation and removing the whip. Abbott, who is the longest-serving female MP, stated it is "obvious this Labour leadership wants me out."</p>

Merz emphasized that Germany is now increasing its military spending in response to the threat posed by Russia. The comments came as he visited the UK to sign a new friendship and defense treaty, aiming to strengthen a "triangular alliance" between Germany, the UK, and France.</p>

          <p>Cristosal, El Salvador's most prominent human rights organization, has announced it is shutting down its operations within the country and moving to exile due to escalating government harassment. The group, which has documented abuses for 25 years, cited espionage, defamation campaigns, and legal pressure from President Nayib Bukele's administration as making its work unsafe. The decision follows the recent arrest of one of its leading activists and is part of a broader exodus of journalists and critics from the country. Cristosal has been an outspoken critic of Bukele's mass incarceration policies and the resulting human rights violations.</p>

It remains unclear whether the newly elected president was the intentional target of the attack. The revelation adds a significant new dimension to the 12-day conflict between the two nations, during which several high-ranking Iranian military commanders were also killed.</p>

          <p>China has publicly debuted a new military drone capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) on its tail, similar to a rocket. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the unmanned aerial vehicle demonstrated its reconnaissance and situational awareness capabilities in a recent drill. The design allows it to operate without a runway, offering greater deployment flexibility in rugged or remote terrains. Its advanced control system also showcased autonomous functions like target allocation and threat avoidance, which are crucial for potential drone swarm operations.</p>

          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence to create on-screen visual effects for the first time in its Argentine sci-fi series, "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated that AI was used to create a building collapse sequence, completing it ten times faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. He framed the technology as an opportunity to enhance creativity, not just reduce budgets. The move is significant as the use of AI in production was a major point of contention during the 2023 Hollywood actors' strike, where many feared it would replace human jobs.</p>

          <p>The White House has officially announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common and benign vein condition. The diagnosis was provided to explain recent mild swelling in the president's lower legs, which had fueled public speculation about his health. A presidential physician confirmed the condition is not serious and that Trump remains in "excellent health." The announcement comes amid heightened scrutiny of the health of both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, who are the oldest-ever occupants of the White House.</p>
