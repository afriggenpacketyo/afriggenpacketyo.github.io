          <h2>IMF Reduces Global Growth Forecasts Amid Trade Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund has significantly lowered its 2025 GDP growth projections for the U.S., China, and the global economy, citing escalating trade tensions as the primary cause. The IMF's report indicates that the U.S. economic growth is expected to be 1.8%, a decrease of 0.9 percentage points from January's forecast, which is more drastic than the global average reduction of 0.5 percentage points to 2.8%. The IMF attributes this revision to increased policy uncertainty, trade disputes, and reduced demand due to slower consumption growth. The report also anticipates a rise in U.S. inflation by 1 percentage point to 3% because of persistent service sector prices, core goods price increases, and tariff-related supply shocks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bath & Body Works is benefiting from its strategic decision to produce 80% of its products in the United States, providing a significant advantage in the face of increasing tariffs. The company's shift towards domestic production, which began over a decade ago with the opening of its Beauty Park facility in Ohio in 2012, allows it to avoid import tariffs and maintain stable pricing and profitability. This contrasts with competitors who rely on international manufacturing and face higher costs due to tariffs. Additionally, Bath & Body Works' domestic production enables faster response to consumer trends, reducing the need for discounts.  The company anticipates sales growth after recent declines linked to the pandemic-driven surge in demand.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced that the government will implement measures to lower gasoline prices and energy costs for households in response to rising inflation. Starting May 22, gasoline and diesel fuel prices will be reduced by 10 yen per liter, while kerosene and heavy oil will see a 5 yen reduction. Furthermore, from July to September, the government will provide subsidies to curb electricity and gas costs for households, particularly during the peak summer months when energy demand is high. These measures are being introduced ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election, following the shelving of a previous plan to offer cash handouts.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan and HELOC interest rates are currently averaging 8.40% and 8.02% respectively, as of April 22, 2025. These rates are influenced by federal funds rate adjustments, making it important for homeowners to monitor trends before applying. To secure the best possible rate, experts advise borrowers to obtain quotes from multiple lenders, choose a suitable loan term, and improve their credit score. Home equity lending options typically offer competitive interest rates due to being backed by the borrower's home, making them attractive options when needing access to cash.

The first Earth Day saw an estimated 20 million Americans participating in various demonstrations and activities, leading to the creation of the EPA and the passage of key environmental laws.

          <p>Gold prices have risen sharply, surpassing $3,500 an ounce, as President Donald Trump's repeated criticisms of the Federal Reserve's independence have unsettled investors and undermined confidence in the U.S. The precious metal, often seen as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, has benefited from heightened concerns over the global trade war. Trump's public pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates has led to equity market sell-offs and increased demand for gold.

The Tokyo District Court awarded 110,000 yen ($780) to each of the 35 plaintiffs, citing the high levels of psychological and physical stress experienced during flights. The court determined that crew rests did not qualify as breaks because attendants were still required to assist passengers, handle emergencies, and ensure flight safety.

          <p>Berry startup Fruitist, formerly known as Agrovision, has surpassed $400 million in annual sales due to the success of its jumbo blueberries and is considering going public. The company, backed by Ray Dalio's family office, has raised over $1 billion from investors. Fruitist differentiates itself by focusing on high-quality, long-lasting berries and operates a vertically integrated supply chain with farms in multiple countries. CEO Steve Magami aims to solve the issue of inconsistent berry quality by growing fruit in microclimates and using machine learning to optimize harvesting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful actions in freezing billions of dollars in federal funding. Harvard claims the administration's actions violate its constitutional rights and academic independence. The lawsuit follows Harvard's rejection of the administration's demands to change policies and leadership. The Trump administration contends that Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access taxpayer funds. Research at Harvard has contributed to advancements in treating diseases and innovating technology.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers, led by Professor Wang Chao at Shanghai University, have achieved a significant breakthrough in quantum cryptology by factoring a 90-bit RSA integer using a D-Wave Advantage quantum computer. This accomplishment, once considered impossible, raises concerns about the potential for quantum computers to decipher even the most secure encryption. As advances in quantum computing accelerate, experts warn of a future "Q-Day" when current encryption methods could be rendered obsolete, posing a threat to data security and privacy. Scientists worldwide are racing to develop countermeasures, including post-quantum cryptography, to address this emerging threat.</p>

Brian Sheppard, a guide on the Beaver Kill River in New York, notes that rising water temperatures are reducing the fishing season.

Currently, around 5.3 million borrowers are in default, and less than 40% of all borrowers are current on their student loans.
