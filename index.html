          <p>OpenAI has launched two new open-source artificial intelligence models, a strategic move seen as a direct challenge to China's leading position in the open-source AI field. CEO Sam Altman described the new models as the best and most usable in the world, marking a return to the company's origins after its last open model release in 2019. This development comes as Chinese open-source models have been gaining global popularity and precedes the anticipated launch of OpenAI's more powerful GPT-5.</p>

          <p>Japanese automaker Honda reported that its first-quarter operating profit fell by 50% year-over-year, significantly missing analyst estimates. The company attributed the sharp decline to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a stronger yen, which have affected its earnings. The report highlights the broader economic pressure on Japanese car manufacturers, who rely heavily on the U.S. market and are navigating ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries.

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced that sales of its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, increased by 67% in the second quarter. Despite this strong performance, the company plans to implement cost-cutting measures and sharpen its commercial focus following recent stock losses. The move comes after the company lowered its full-year guidance due to weaker U.S. sales growth forecasts for Wegovy and its diabetes treatment, Ozempic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's Great Barrier Reef has suffered its most significant annual loss of live coral since monitoring began nearly 40 years ago, according to a new report. The Australian Institute of Marine Science documented the devastating impact of a mass coral bleaching event in early 2024, which was caused by unprecedented levels of ocean heat stress. Scientists warn that this increased volatility points to an ecosystem under severe pressure from climate change.</p>

          <p>An economic think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves will need to raise taxes to cover a projected £41.2 billion shortfall in the government's budget. The report suggests that without tax increases or spending cuts, the government will fail to meet its self-imposed borrowing rules. This analysis puts pressure on the new government, which now faces a difficult choice between its fiscal rules and its campaign promises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Hiroshima marked the 80th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing with a solemn ceremony and a moment of silent prayer. Officials, students, and survivors gathered at the memorial, where Hiroshima's mayor warned against the growing global acceptance of nuclear weapons for defense.

          <p>A former staffer from the Department of Government Efficiency was allegedly assaulted during an attempted carjacking in Washington, D.C., leading to the arrest of two teenagers. The incident prompted President Trump to condemn the city's crime rate as "totally out of control" on social media. He threatened to use his presidential powers to place the nation's capital under federal control if local authorities do not "get its act together, and quickly."</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court to remove Democratic Representative Gene Wu from office. Abbott accuses Wu of being the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout, where dozens of Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and block a vote on a controversial Republican-drawn redistricting map. The lawsuit argues that the lawmakers abandoned their office and duties, justifying their removal.</p>

          <p>As Japan marks 80 years since the atomic bombings, there is a growing urgency to preserve the stories of the survivors, known as "hibakusha," whose numbers are rapidly declining. With their average age now over 86, museums and a new generation of "successors" are taking on the mission of conveying the firsthand accounts of the attacks. These efforts aim to ensure that the human reality of nuclear weapons is understood by future generations and that the message of peace endures.</p>

          <p>A national poll conducted by Equis research group indicates that Republican support among Latino voters who backed Donald Trump may be weakening. The survey found that a quarter of these voters are not guaranteed to vote for Republican candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. This shaky alignment, coupled with growing disapproval of Trump's job performance, suggests a potential vulnerability for the GOP, which is counting on sustained Latino support.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the closure of the state prison in Norco, effective fall 2026. The decision is driven by a declining statewide inmate population and will result in an estimated annual savings of $150 million for the state. The facility, which originally opened in the 1920s as a luxury hotel and resort, will be maintained in a "warm shutdown" state, leaving its future open for potential reuse or sale.</p>
