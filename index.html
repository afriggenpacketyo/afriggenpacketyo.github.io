          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded after being shot in what authorities describe as a deliberate ambush. The incident occurred as they responded to a wildfire on Idaho's Canfield Mountain, which officials suspect was intentionally set to lure them to the location. Law enforcement later found the body of the suspected lone gunman, who appeared to have been killed in an exchange of gunfire. The wounded firefighter is currently in stable condition after surgery, as the community mourns the heinous attack on its first responders.</p>

          <p>Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), faces a critical court ruling that could nullify its recent leadership congress and plunge it into chaos. Allies of the former chairman, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, filed a lawsuit alleging illegalities in the election of the new reformist leadership, led by Ozgur Ozel and backed by Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. Observers suggest the legal challenge may be a strategic maneuver by President Erdogan to weaken the resurgent opposition. A verdict against the current leadership could lead to the return of the old guard or the appointment of an administrator, severely hampering the party's momentum.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun debating a major legislative package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" by former President Trump, with a final vote expected after an amendment process. The bill is facing significant internal Republican opposition, notably from Senator Thom Tillis, who condemned it for breaking promises on Medicaid funding. In response to dissent, Trump urged Republican senators on social media to support the bill, reminding them they need to be reelected. The legislation's passage remains uncertain as several GOP senators who voted to advance debate are still undecided on the final version.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that trade negotiations with the U.S. have resumed after his government rescinded a planned digital services tax on technology firms. The move came after U.S. President Donald Trump suspended talks, calling the tax a "blatant attack" on the country. The 3% tax would have affected companies like Google and Amazon and applied retroactively, creating a significant liability. While the decision paves the way for further negotiations on tariffs and a new economic relationship, some analysts view it as a concession that makes the Canadian government appear vulnerable to U.S. pressure.</p>

          <p>This opinion article discusses the victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary and the subsequent wave of racist and Islamophobic attacks from political figures and commentators. The author argues that the backlash is not just about Mamdani's Muslim identity, but also his progressive politics on economics and his criticism of U.S. policy regarding Israel. The piece contends that Mamdani's refusal to moderate his principles has exposed a mainstreamed prejudice, which has gone largely unchallenged by senior Democratic leaders. His win is framed as a threat to the political establishment because it shows that a growing number of voters are rejecting long-held orthodoxies.</p>

The event is intended to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This development comes as the United States has reportedly proposed that Chinese President Xi Jinping visit the U.S. during the same month, coinciding with the U.N. General Assembly meeting. The potential for reciprocal high-level visits suggests a complex diplomatic dance between the two global powers amidst ongoing trade and geopolitical tensions.</p>

In 2020, under former CEO Bernard Looney, BP initiated a major strategic shift towards renewable energy, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050. However, Looney's abrupt resignation in 2023, coupled with the company's underperforming share price compared to peers, created uncertainty and vulnerability. Despite a recent strategic reset by new CEO Murray Auchincloss to increase oil and gas investment, investor confidence has not fully recovered, fueling rumors of acquisition interest from other energy majors.</p>

Forecasters anticipate the storm will dump three to six inches of rain, with isolated areas receiving up to 10 inches, before dissipating over Mexico.</p>

          <p>England manager Sarina Wiegman appears to be finalizing her starting lineup for the upcoming Euro 2025 championships, as indicated by the team's decisive 7-0 friendly victory over Jamaica. Key questions surrounding player fitness and selection seem to be resolving, with Lauren James returning from injury and Georgia Stanway gaining crucial minutes. The performance of players like Jess Carter and Ella Toone has intensified competition for starting positions. Despite the recent retirement of experienced players and concerns about depth, the squad is a blend of young talent and a strong core from the 2023 World Cup team.</p>

          <p>This article investigates the significant rise of right-wing extremism and nationalism among young people in cities in eastern Germany, such as Dessau. Authorities and social workers have noted a trend where Nazi-era symbols and slogans have become part of a 'cool' pop culture for some youths, who openly glorify Hitler. This radicalization is occurring in a region that has faced economic decline and depopulation since German reunification, despite significant investment. The political success of the far-right AfD party, whose local mayor in Dessau has a past with a banned neo-Nazi youth group, reflects this broader, troubling societal shift.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered at 49.7 in June, marking the third straight month of contraction and signaling ongoing economic weakness. While production and new orders saw slight improvements, factory inventory and employment levels continued to decline, reflecting persistent deflationary pressures and sluggish consumer demand. The data underscores the challenges facing Beijing as it grapples with a supply glut, a property crisis, and the impact of U.S. tariffs. Economists suggest that significant fiscal stimulus will be necessary to boost domestic demand and stabilize the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of some Japanese seafood, partially lifting a blanket ban that was imposed in 2023.

The new measure, however, does not apply to seafood from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, Tokyo, and several others, where the import suspension remains in place.

Despite a strategic partnership and Iran's crucial military aid to Russia, Moscow's response to the attacks was limited to verbal condemnation.

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs are a primary cause. In particular, the regenerative braking systems, which convert kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, result in a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness. Researchers are exploring solutions, including auditory cues and adjustments to vehicle dynamics, to mitigate the effect and improve passenger comfort in the new generation of automobiles.</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes caused "severe damage" to Iran's nuclear facilities, but not "total damage." He cautioned that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart its program if it chooses to. Grossi's assessment appears to contradict more absolute claims of destruction from U.S. officials and aligns with intelligence suggesting the strikes only set back the program by months. He stressed the importance of allowing IAEA inspectors back into the country to verify the status of Iran's nuclear materials and infrastructure.</p>
