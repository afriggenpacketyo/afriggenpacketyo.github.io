          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 07:04:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russian customs officials, in collaboration with the FSB security service, have intercepted their largest drug shipment from Latin America this year. Approximately 1,800 pounds of cocaine, valued at over $153 million, were discovered hidden within a cargo of bananas. The illicit drugs were packaged in briquettes disguised with a luxury brand's label and found with the help of service dogs. This seizure highlights a growing trend of drug traffickers using Russia as a transit hub, partly due to the ongoing war in Ukraine making other routes inaccessible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has completed new naval facilities in Oyster Bay, Philippines, intended to enhance the maintenance and repair capabilities for the Philippine military's small watercraft. While the U.S. embassy has stated the site is not a military base, analysts believe it will significantly strengthen the Philippine Navy's ability to confront Chinese vessels in the contested South China Sea. The development is seen as a strategic move to bolster the Philippines' maritime defense and potentially pave the way for shared use of naval facilities between the two allies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 07:01:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Families in Great Britain are facing a significant financial burden as the average cost for six weeks of summer holiday childcare has risen to £1,076 per child. Research from the charity Coram indicates that prices are being driven up by high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run programs, with some regions seeing price hikes of up to 13% from last year. This increase places immense pressure on working parents, who often have to pay these substantial costs upfront before receiving any government benefits, making it a major cost-of-living challenge.</p>

          <p>For decades, Russ Miller, known as the "River Cowboy," has dedicated himself to cleaning up Kentucky's rivers, personally removing an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 discarded tires. Miller's grassroots efforts began in the 1980s and led to the formation of the cleanup group Friends of Red River, which tackles the pervasive issue of illegal tire dumping. The problem is widespread, with an estimated one million tires going unaccounted for in the state each year, often ending up in waterways and posing environmental hazards, but Miller's work inspires community action and hope for change.</p>

          <p>At Donald Trump's urging, Texas Republicans are preparing to redraw the state's congressional map in a bid to gain up to five additional seats for their party. This move is seen as a risky and undemocratic effort to dilute the influence of the state's rapidly growing non-white population, which accounted for 95% of its recent population growth. Critics argue the plan would trample on minority voting rights, while political analysts note that making Republican districts more competitive to capture Democratic seats could backfire in future elections.</p>

This approach is evident in the pausing of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act enforcement and a decline in federal white-collar prosecutions.

          <p>Police in Karnataka, India, have found a 40-year-old Russian woman and her two young daughters, aged six and four, living in a cave within a remote, snake-infested forest. The woman, Nina Kutina, had reportedly been living in the cave for over a week, meditating and worshipping. She was discovered during a routine police patrol in an area known for being hazardous to tourists due to snakes and potential landslides. The family has since been moved to a detention facility as authorities address her overstayed visa.</p>

          <p>Changes under the Trump administration are set to significantly alter the federal student loan repayment landscape, potentially leaving many borrowers with higher monthly payments. The SAVE plan, a key Biden-era initiative, is now defunct, and a new bill will phase out several other income-driven repayment options for future borrowers. Consumer advocates warn that these changes will leave many without affordable choices, increasing the risk of default. New borrowers after July 2026 will have only two plans to choose from, one of which has significantly higher scheduled payments than previous options.</p>

Scientists used high-speed videography and CT scans to analyze the perfect ballistic angle and internal seed arrangement that enables this feat.
