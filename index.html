          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced a reversal of the Biden administration's policy, now permitting federal authorities to seek reporters' phone records and compel testimony in leak investigations. Bondi stated this change is crucial to protect classified and sensitive information, a broader scope than strictly classified data. This decision has sparked concerns among First Amendment advocates, particularly given President Trump's history of criticizing leaks and his confrontational stance toward the press. The new memo's phrasing suggests a potentially more expansive approach than simply reinstating previous policies, raising alarms about press freedom.</p>

These groups, though often banned in Pakistan, allegedly operate with support from Pakistan's military intelligence, aiming to challenge control over Indian-administered regions of Kashmir. Some groups have rebranded or splintered, but their objectives remain largely aligned: to challenge control over Indian-administered regions of Kashmir and, in many cases, merge the region with Pakistan. Several groups have previously fought alongside the Taliban and al-Qaeda, framing their cause as part of a broader global jihad.</p>

The article advises that IRAs are generally more effective for retirement due to tax advantages and potential for higher returns, while CDs are better for short-term savings goals with a specific purpose.

          <p>A system was reportedly set up in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Pentagon office that allowed him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard security protocols. A computer monitor in Hegseth's office provided remote access to the Signal app and text messages from his personal cellphone. This arrangement has raised security concerns, as it gives Hegseth access to his personal iPhone text messages and Signal chat groups at his desk even though his cellphone isn't physically in the office. This comes after reports that Hegseth shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen in a private Signal group.</p>
