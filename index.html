          <p>In an unusual legal agreement, Rupert Murdoch will provide Donald Trump with regular, sworn updates on his health condition. This deal postpones Murdoch's deposition in a $10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Trump over a Wall Street Journal article concerning Jeffrey Epstein. The arrangement was made after Trump's lawyers expressed concern that the 94-year-old media executive might be too ill to testify later. If a judge doesn't dismiss the case, Murdoch must be deposed within 30 days of the ruling.</p>

          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs economist, the labor market is already showing early impacts from generative AI, particularly within the technology sector. While most companies have not yet fully deployed AI, there has been a noticeable pullback in tech hiring that has disproportionately affected younger workers. The unemployment rate for tech employees aged 20-30 has risen by three percentage points this year. This trend suggests companies are pausing junior hires as they begin integrating AI to automate routine tasks.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Health has warned about the dangers of consuming unpasteurized raw milk after an outbreak sickened 21 people, including six children. The illnesses, caused by E. coli and campylobacter bacteria, have led to seven hospitalizations and were traced to a single farm. While it is illegal to sell raw milk for human consumption in Florida, it can be sold as pet food. Health officials emphasize that pasteurization is the only way to kill harmful bacteria in milk.</p>

          <p>Shares of cryptocurrency platform Coinbase fell on Tuesday after the company announced a $2 billion private offering of convertible senior notes. The decline coincided with a broader market downturn and pushed the stock more than 30% below its record high from July. This drop continues a downward trend for the company since it was added to the S&P 500. Despite recent disappointing revenue figures, some analysts remain optimistic about the company's long-term prospects amid new crypto legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was preventable, blaming owner OceanGate for using "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory oversight. The comprehensive report states the company had a "toxic" safety culture and that its operational practices were "critically flawed." Investigators determined the vessel's hull was compromised in previous incidents and faulted the late founder, Stockton Rush, for negligence that contributed to the deaths of the four other individuals on board.</p>

          <p>Leshon Johnson, a former NFL running back, has been convicted on six felony counts related to his involvement in a large-scale dogfighting operation in Oklahoma. Federal prosecutors alleged that Johnson operated Mal Kant Kennels, where he bred and sold pit bull-type dogs specifically for fighting ventures. Earlier this year, authorities seized 190 dogs from Johnson's properties. He now faces up to five years in prison for each count.</p>

          <p>In a novel approach to wildlife management, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is using audio from the 2019 film "Marriage Story" to deter wolves in Oregon. To prevent attacks on cattle, the agency deploys drones that shine spotlights on the predators and broadcast alarming sounds, including an intense argument scene between the film's main characters. This non-lethal "wolf hazing" technique has reportedly been effective, with only two cows killed in 85 days since its implementation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that his administration's planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could eventually reach as high as 250%. The threat is part of a strategy to compel drug companies to move their manufacturing operations back to the United States. Trump indicated he would start with a small tariff before raising it to 150% and then 250% within a maximum of a year and a half, a move the pharmaceutical industry warns could disrupt supply chains and raise costs.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis suggests that the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has significantly overstated its cost-cutting achievements. The review found that claimed savings from three canceled Health and Human Services contracts totaled $6.4 billion, while the actual amount of unspent, obligated funds was only about $165 million. This discrepancy is due to DOGE reporting the total potential value of contracts as savings, a figure that experts say is rarely reached.</p>
