          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is facing a bruising price war led by market leader BYD, raising concerns about financial stress. The People's Daily published a commentary warning that "disorderly 'price wars' squeeze profits across the chain." BYD's price cuts, some as steep as 34%, have led to industry executives sounding the alarm, with Great Wall Motor's chairman drawing parallels to China's moribund property sector and Evergrande. A government-backed industry group has also called on companies not to "dump" vehicles below the cost of production, reflecting growing unease about the sustainability of the current market dynamics.

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $10,000 certificate of deposit (CD) versus a $10,000 high-yield savings account in June 2025. While both options are FDIC-insured and offer security, CDs currently have slightly higher fixed interest rates for short-term periods (e.g., 4.49% for a 6-month CD). High-yield savings accounts offer variable rates, providing flexibility but potentially less guaranteed returns. The article suggests considering both options based on individual needs and financial goals, balancing the desire for higher returns with the need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has written to UEFA seeking clarity regarding Crystal Palace's Europa League place due to multi-club ownership rules. Crystal Palace qualified by winning the FA Cup, but UEFA regulations prevent an individual or entity from holding a majority stake in two clubs in the same European tournament. John Textor, owner of Eagle Football, holds a 43% stake in Palace and a 77% stake in Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. If UEFA rules against Palace, Lyon would take precedence, and Forest could potentially move up to the Europa League.</p>

While acknowledging concerns about the US potentially turning into a police state, the author argues that Britain's vague laws give police too much power to arrest people for offensive online speech. The right to protest is also under attack in Britain, with sweeping anti-protest laws being passed. The author contrasts this with the US Constitution, which, for now, provides more freedom of speech.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's tax bill could lead to increased taxes on foreign companies and investors from countries deemed to have "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. Known as Section 899, the measure could deter international companies from expanding into the United States. An analysis by the Global Business Alliance estimates that the provision could cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually in lost GDP. The tax is defended by Republican Rep. Jason Smith as a tool to protect U.S. interests, but critics warn it could harm businesses, consumers, and workers. (not investment advice)</p>

The Reichstag fire provided Hitler with the excuse he needed to suspend civil liberties and suppress political opposition, enabling him to pass legislation granting him authoritarian power.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global announced that it would lay off 3.5% of its domestic workforce, amounting to several hundred jobs. The company cited the decline in linear television, a "dynamic macro-economic environment," and the continued priority of streaming business investments as reasons for the layoffs. This decision follows a similar trend across Hollywood studios, including Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, which are also downsizing due to industry challenges.</p>
