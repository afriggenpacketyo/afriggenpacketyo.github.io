          <p>A federal judge has ordered the immediate release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, from immigration custody. Ozturk, a Turkish national, was detained after the Trump administration revoked her student visa following an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Judge Sessions stated that Ozturk's detention raised substantial claims of constitutional violations, as the government presented no evidence other than the op-ed to justify her detainment. The judge emphasized that her continued detention could potentially chill the speech of millions of non-citizens, and Tufts University expressed its pleasure in welcoming her back to campus.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering reintroducing a "most favored nation" plan to lower Medicare drug prices, according to sources familiar with the matter. This plan, previously blocked by courts during his first term, would tie the prices of some Medicare drugs to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary, pointed to higher prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic as a reason for the policy's return. The administration is continuing to negotiate the cost of Ozempic in Medicare under talks launched by the Biden administration, but only for its uses to treat diabetes and other health conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering a tax hike on Americans making $2.5 million or more, a move that some experts compare to George H.W. Bush's broken "read my lips" pledge. While Trump acknowledged the potential political backlash, he signaled a willingness to raise taxes to help lower and middle-income workers. However, some Republicans, like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, warn that raising taxes would shatter Trump's coalition and harm small businesses. Negotiations are ongoing among House Republicans to finalize Trump's "big, beautiful bill," which is expected to include an extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts.</p>

Trump suggested he was willing to lower tariffs on China to 80%, a rate many businesses would likely still consider to be extremely high. The number of freight vessels and shipping containers headed to the U.S. from China has plummeted since the tariffs announcement in early April.</p>

          <p>Lee Zeldin, the first Jewish administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, affixed a mezuza to his office door, inviting reflection on spiritual aspects of life. While many Jewish leaders praised Zeldin for celebrating his identity, Jewish environmental activists criticized his role in weakening environmental regulations. They argue that his actions contradict the Jewish value of repairing the world (tikkun olam) due to his oversight of profound changes to the agency and the weakening or repeal of regulations protecting the environment. Zeldin defended his policies as based on law, obligations, merits, and science, drawing a line between faith and policymaking.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated he might reduce tariffs on China to 80% as U.S. and Chinese negotiators prepare for trade talks in Switzerland. An 80% tariff would be a significant decrease from the current 145% but would still likely impede trade between the two countries. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that a reduction would only occur as part of a negotiation requiring concessions from China. Despite this potential flexibility, economists warn that the chances of a U.S. recession are rising due to Trump's tariffs, and companies are already feeling the pressure on their business models.</p>

The firings followed the commissioners' refusal to follow demands from members of DOGE, Trump's informal Department of Government Efficiency.

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed seeking to undo the 624,000-acre Chuckwalla National Monument in the Southern California desert, arguing that President Biden overstepped his authority by setting aside such a vast area. The plaintiffs, represented by a conservative think tank, claim Biden abused the Antiquities Act, which mandates monuments be limited to the “smallest area compatible with proper care.” Supporters of the monument argue that the law has long been used to protect large land masses. The suit claims the designation will prevent mining and recreation activities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are increasing the prices of baby products, potentially adding up to $1,000 a year to the cost of raising a child, according to parents and baby gear makers. The White House is considering a $5,000 "baby bonus" to encourage Americans to have more children, but these tariffs are counteracting that effort. Natalie Gordon, CEO of Babylist, stated that price increases are already in effect across a range of products due to manufacturers' reliance on China. Some parents are turning to resale platforms to find discounted baby items.</p>
