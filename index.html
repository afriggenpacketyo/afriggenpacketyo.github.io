          <p>Missouri's Republican lawmakers have approved a referendum to repeal the abortion-rights amendment approved by voters six months prior. The proposed constitutional amendment, which seeks to ban most abortions except in cases of sexual assault or incest, will be on the ballot in November 2026, or sooner if a special election is called. Democrats have condemned the move as an attempt to overturn the will of the voters, while Republicans insist they are giving voters a second chance with the new exceptions.

          <p>Walmart reported solid sales growth, particularly in e-commerce, but cautioned that tariffs may lead to price increases for consumers. Despite beating earnings estimates, Walmart's CFO indicated that tariffs are "still too high" and that the company will likely begin raising prices later this month. While Walmart is working with vendors to keep prices down, the magnitude and speed of the tariff increases are unprecedented. The retailer is also trying to maintain its price advantage over competitors and absorb some of the higher costs, but the impact on consumers is inevitable.</p>

          <p>The UK government is in discussions with several countries to establish overseas "return hubs" for asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. These hubs would serve as locations to process and manage the return of individuals with no further routes of appeal in the UK. While Starmer did not specify which countries are involved, Albania has stated it is not part of the talks.

          <p>The article explores the phenomenon of "dry texting" among teenagers and its impact on communication and conflict resolution. Dry texting, characterized by short, unenthusiastic responses, is a common way for teens to express disapproval or signal a change in the conversation's vibe. While phones and social media can amplify disputes, they can also transform conflicts into something quieter and more confusing, leading to anxiety and uncertainty. Experts suggest that ambiguous signals in online communication can hinder the development of conflict resolution skills, but also acknowledge that phones can sometimes help teens resolve conflicts by providing time to think before responding.</p>

          <p>Walmart's first quarter profit slipped, prompting the retailer to announce it will raise prices due to higher costs from tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump. Despite solid sales growth, Walmart did not issue a profit outlook for the second quarter, citing the chaotic environment of constantly changing tariff policies. CEO Doug McMillon stated that Walmart will do its best to keep prices low but cannot absorb all the pressure from tariffs due to narrow retail margins. The company is among the first major U.S. retailers to report financial results, providing insight into the mood of American shoppers and the impact of tariffs on business.</p>

The administration argues that federal officials made an error when listing the prairie-chickens under the Endangered Species Act, claiming the listing should be tossed out. This move is seen as prioritizing oil and gas drilling over environmental safeguards, signaling that no endangered species is safe, especially those living where fossil fuels are buried.

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether federal judges can block Trump administration policies across the country, a power that has been a major impediment to President Trump’s agenda. The dispute stems from an executive order ending birthright citizenship, which was blocked by federal judges. A decision limiting nationwide injunctions could reshape how federal courts handle challenges to Trump’s policies, curbing judicial power and boosting executive power. The oral argument may provide hints of where the justices stand on the issue, signaling potential shifts in the balance of power between the judicial and executive branches.</p>

          <p>The first direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in three years are expected to take place today in Turkey, but Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will not meet, after the Russian leader declined to join the Ukrainian leader in Istanbul. Russia has instead sent a low-level delegation, which Zelenskyy dismissed as a “theatre prop”. Zelenskyy will meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Ankara, and is reportedly expected to decide about sending a delegation to Istanbul after the meeting.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, exceeding expectations, leading Chancellor Rachel Reeves to state that the UK is "beginning to turn a corner". The growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts warn that the strong rate of growth is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased employer taxes. The Labour government has made boosting the economy its top priority, but faces criticism for its decision to increase employer taxes.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are advancing President Trump’s agenda, focusing on tax cuts and immigration funding. The legislation involves extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which would benefit higher-income individuals, and increasing funding for border security. To offset these costs, Republicans are proposing cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, leading to divisions within the party. The bill faces challenges in passing both the House and Senate due to disagreements over spending and the impact on low-income Americans.</p>

          <p>A vast bloom of toxic algae is causing mass deaths of over 200 species of marine life off the southern coast of Australia.

The South Australian government attributes the event to a marine heatwave and calm marine conditions. Authorities have warned beachgoers to avoid swimming in discolored or foamy water, as it can irritate the skin and affect breathing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's hostile approach to South Africa is fueled by a convergence of factors, including misinformation, meetings with Afrikaner activists, and hard-right conservative ideologies. Trump's views on white farmers in South Africa, influenced by figures like Gary Player and Tucker Carlson, have shaped U.S. foreign policy. The administration's actions include halting foreign aid, expelling South Africa’s ambassador, and prioritizing Afrikaner refugees, reflecting a broader focus on white victimhood and skepticism towards diversity and inclusion programs.

          <p>Argentina's Perito Moreno glacier, known for its dramatic ice falls, is experiencing increasingly large calving events, raising concerns among local guides and glaciologists. While the glacier had maintained its mass for decades, recent signs of retreat and larger ice chunks breaking off have alarmed experts. Research indicates that the glacier is losing water equivalent per year, and that increased air temperature and decreased precipitation are contributing to the imbalance. Despite this, the glacier remains a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors to witness the awe-inspiring ice falls.</p>
