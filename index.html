        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police investigating a school shooting in Austria discovered plans for a bomb attack at the home of the 21-year-old suspect. The search also revealed a non-functional pipe bomb, a "farewell" letter, and a video. The attack at the secondary school in Graz resulted in ten fatalities and eleven injuries, making it the deadliest school shooting in Austria's recent history. Authorities are still investigating the shooter's motive, as he was not previously known to law enforcement and legally owned the weapons used in the attack, which included a pistol and a shotgun, both of which will be forensically examined. The quick response by police and specialist units is believed to have saved lives.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson, the creative force behind the Beach Boys, passed away at the age of 82, leaving behind a legacy of influential pop and rock music. In his later years, Wilson faced health challenges, including a neurocognitive disorder, leading to a conservatorship. Wilson wrote the music to nearly all of the Beach Boys' best-known songs, from their early surf-rock classics to their more complex recordings of the mid-1960s and beyond. His catalog includes hits like "Surfin' U.S.A.," "Surfer Girl," and "Good Vibrations," which defined the sound of sunny California teenage life.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached an agreement regarding Gibraltar's status post-Brexit, aiming to avoid border checks between Spain and the British Overseas Territory. The agreement ensures passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the system at London's St Pancras station for Eurostar passengers. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized that the deal protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo highlighted the collaborative effort with the UK government to secure the agreement. While most parties welcomed the deal, some criticized it as a surrender of territory, underscoring the complexities of the agreement.</p>

It also calls for defunding Planned Parenthood and directing funds to life-affirming healthcare providers. The resolution's chair acknowledged the challenges in gaining support for this position, emphasizing the denomination's commitment to its stance on marriage and family.</p>

          <p>Entering a romantic relationship can often lead to a decline in friendships, as cultural norms prioritize romantic partnerships over platonic bonds. Society often places unnecessary limits on friendship, with fewer legal protections and cultural emphasis compared to marriage. The expectation that a romantic partner should fulfill all emotional needs can strain friendships, leading to feelings of jealousy and loss when a friend becomes coupled. However, prioritizing both love and friendship is possible by reimagining free time and recognizing the distinct roles individuals play in one's life.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the U.S. tariff levels on Chinese imports will not change from their current levels, even though a trade deal has not been finalized. President Donald Trump had previously mentioned a 55% tariff rate on China, which a White House official clarified is the sum of existing blanket tariffs and specific product tariffs. The announcement follows high-level trade talks in London, where Trump claimed a deal was "done" but subject to final approval. China's tariffs on the U.S. will remain at 10%, as agreed upon in a previous agreement.</p>
