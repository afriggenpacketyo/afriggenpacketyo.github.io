          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has barred U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street from its markets and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. The firm is accused of manipulating India's Nifty 50 index by making large stock purchases to drive the index up, betting on its decline, and then selling off its holdings to profit from the resulting drop. SEBI described the behavior as egregious and a threat to market integrity, especially after the firm ignored a previous advisory. Jane Street has disputed the findings and stated its commitment to complying with all regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," a major legislative package that fulfills several campaign promises. The bill contains approximately $4.5 trillion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses, alongside significant spending increases for immigration control and defense. It also implements over $1 trillion in cuts to health programs like Medicaid and the SNAP food aid program, which could cause millions to lose coverage. While a political victory for Trump, the legislation is projected to add $3.4 trillion to the national debt and faces low public approval ratings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a UFC championship fight will be held on the White House grounds as part of the "America250" celebrations next year. The president revealed the plan during a speech in Iowa, stating that UFC CEO Dana White would organize the event for an audience of 20,000 to 25,000 spectators. A White House press secretary confirmed that the president is "dead serious" about the idea, which highlights his long-standing relationship with the mixed martial arts organization. The event is one of several planned to commemorate the 250th anniversary of American independence.</p>

          <p>An Oregon jury has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of first-degree sexual assault and other related charges. The conviction stems from an incident at a 2021 party where McLemore sexually assaulted a 21-year-old woman who was incapacitated from alcohol consumption. Prosecutors argued the woman was unable to give consent, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual. The district attorney's office emphasized that celebrity status does not shield individuals from prosecution. McLemore, the seventh overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft, faces sentencing next week.</p>

          <p>An infant in Victorville, California, sustained head injuries after being dropped by its mother when she was struck by the family car, which was being moved by her 12-year-old child. The mother had given the 12-year-old permission to park the vehicle and was watching nearby while holding the baby. As the tween was parking, the car door hit the mother, causing her to fall and drop the infant. The injured baby was airlifted to a medical center for treatment, and the mother could face potential criminal charges for child cruelty.</p>

          <p>Veterans' groups and legal scholars are warning that the Trump administration's deployment of active-duty troops for domestic law enforcement, such as in Los Angeles, threatens democratic norms and erodes the U.S. Constitution. Advocates argue that using the military against civilians is inappropriate, puts service members in unprepared situations, and blurs the line between military and police roles, which is restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act. A retired lieutenant colonel described the situation as "making America militarized again," expressing concern that the administration is ignoring the rule of law for political purposes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals that the sharpest increase in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention population consists of immigrants with no criminal convictions. According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the approximately 56,000 people currently in ICE detention lack a criminal record. This trend contradicts administration claims of focusing on the "worst of the worst," as the number of non-criminal detainees has nearly doubled since May. The data highlights the real-world impact of the administration's mass deportation campaign, which often affects long-term residents and community members. (not investment advice)</p>

These cuts, resulting from a hiring freeze and budget reductions, are impacting public-facing roles crucial for visitor safety.

In response, the EPA accused the employees of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and initiated an administrative investigation.

The months of sordid allegations about violent, drug-fueled sex parties have permanently damaged his reputation as a hip-hop mogul.
