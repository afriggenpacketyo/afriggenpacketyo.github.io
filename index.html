          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases at a slower pace beyond April of next year, scaling back debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen. Simultaneously, the BOJ will maintain its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, reflecting a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid ongoing economic uncertainties. The central bank's decision comes after yields on long-term government bonds surged last month, driven by concerns about Japan's fiscal health. The BOJ's statement emphasized the uncertainty surrounding trade policies and their potential impact on overseas economic activity and prices. The central bank will conduct another interim assessment at its June 2026 monetary policy meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Salvador Plasencia has agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine in connection with the overdose death of actor Matthew Perry. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors will drop additional charges, including falsifying records, and the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Plasencia allegedly referred to Perry as a "moron" in text messages and is accused of illegally supplying Perry with ketamine, which the medical examiner determined to be the primary cause of Perry's death. The doctor also allegedly enlisted another doctor to supply the drug and showed Perry's assistant how to inject it, as Perry was also getting ketamine from another source.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold has outperformed traditional safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasurys, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025. Experts attribute this shift to gold's freedom from government liabilities, making it an appealing option amid fiscal sustainability concerns and geopolitical instability. The dollar index has weakened, and U.S. Treasurys have faced sell-offs due to concerns about fiscal discipline. Gold's appeal is further bolstered by its status as a large, liquid, and apolitical market, as instability in the Middle East has also dented demand for U.S. safe havens.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that the Trump administration's directives leading to the cancellation of several National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants were unlawful. The judge stated that the cancellations, which targeted studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), violated federal law. The judge ordered the NIH to reinstate the terminated grants, with some estimates suggesting that up to $1.8 billion in research funding had been cut. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) expressed disagreement with the ruling and is considering legal options, including an appeal.</p>

Local chalk streams and the Test and Itchen rivers, which supply most of the south's water, have been impacted by the dry conditions. If river levels continue to decline, the company may need to implement hosepipe bans or cease using the streams altogether.</p>

Conservationists attribute the decline to changes in farming methods, fewer insects, and fewer nesting sites in tall buildings.

          <p>Leaders of G7 nations have urged a "de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza," while reaffirming their "commitment to peace and stability" and recognizing Israel's right to self-defense. President Trump departed the summit early due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. The US Defense Secretary announced the "deployment of additional capabilities" to the Middle East to bolster the Pentagon's "defensive posture." There were signs of division earlier at the G7 over conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer announced a tariffs deal between the US and UK, removing tariffs completely for the aerospace industry and implementing a 10% levy on the car industry. While the UK is exempt from the global tariff of 50% on steel and aluminum, a 25% tariff remains, with ongoing negotiations to remove it. The deal also includes reciprocal access to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef being sold each way, benefiting British farmers. This agreement, reached in an unorthodox way, is considered a triumph for the Prime Minister amid domestic political woes.</p>
