          <p>Across North America, Indigenous communities are intensifying their efforts to raise awareness about violence disproportionately affecting their populations, particularly women and girls. Rallies, prayer walks, and self-defense classes are being organized to push for better cooperation among law enforcement agencies in addressing the thousands of open FBI cases involving missing and murdered Indigenous people. Community leaders emphasize the importance of educating young people about the risks they face, sharing personal stories of loss and resilience to foster change and protect future generations. Advocates are also calling for the full implementation of Indigenous Alerts within state AMBER Alert systems, requiring additional resources and coordination with tribal nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, arguing that the foreign production of films poses a national security threat and harms the American movie industry. This decision follows Trump's previous appointments of film stars as special envoys to revitalize Hollywood. The move has drawn criticism from industry bodies and foreign governments, who fear it could disrupt the global film market and increase costs. Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs on China in a separate statement, while also meeting with various countries to discuss trade deals. </p>

          <p>Joy Air, a regional airline in western China, has suspended all flights due to multiple labor disputes and a debt crisis, leaving pilots to find alternative income through gig economy jobs. The airline, backed by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting smaller cities with regional hubs using Chinese-made aircraft. The suspension is primarily attributed to a lack of profitable routes, as high-speed rail networks offer cheaper alternatives for travel within Shaanxi, impeding Joy Air's cash flow and negatively impacting the company's operations.</p>

          <p>The finance ministers and central bank governors of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, along with Japan, China, and South Korea, have cautioned about the potential global economic repercussions of protectionist trade policies following the U.S. President's announcement of higher import tariffs.

Meanwhile, Japan and India are expected to enhance defense cooperation amid China's increasing military presence in the Indo-Pacific region, and Japan clarified it will not use its U.S. bond holdings as leverage in trade talks.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison, as a symbol of law, order, and justice, stating that America has been plagued by repeat criminal offenders. The proposal has been met with strong opposition from leading Democrats, who deem it unserious and an attack on the rule of law. Experts question the necessity and cost-effectiveness of reopening Alcatraz, citing a decline in the federal prison population and the availability of empty beds in existing facilities. The prison, closed in 1963, currently operates as a tourist site.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared that he would impose a 100 percent tariff on movies “produced” outside the United States, claiming the issue posed a national security threat. The Motion Picture Association declined to comment on the announcement. It remains unclear whether the tariff would apply to independent foreign-language films, movies on streaming services, or films receiving tax incentives from foreign countries. This decision comes as Hollywood has increasingly turned to foreign locales for film production due to cheaper costs and tax incentives offered by countries like Britain, Hungary, Australia, and Canada.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years due to the resumption of development projects suspended during the pandemic. Despite the decline, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence.</p>

          <p>Will Hutchins, known for his role as the comically genteel sheriff Tom Brewster in the television western “Sugarfoot,” has died at the age of 94. The show, which premiered in 1957, was a popular western that set Hutchins apart for his non-violent approach to conflict resolution. After “Sugarfoot,” Hutchins continued to work in television and film, but eventually transitioned to working as a clown, traveling the world and entertaining audiences. He later worked as a shipping clerk at NBC before retiring in 1996.</p>

          <p>Chinese garment factories in Guangzhou are facing challenges due to U.S. tariffs and a slowdown in domestic consumer spending. The tariffs have made it difficult for factory owners to sell to the United States, while declining home values have curbed domestic spending. Some factory owners are considering relocating their operations to other provinces or countries to reduce costs. As a result, many factories are experiencing declining orders, suspending production lines, and watching neighboring businesses shut down.</p>
