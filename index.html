          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are holding a multi-day, multi-million dollar wedding celebration in Venice, drawing a host of celebrity guests. The extravagant event has sparked significant local backlash, with protest groups like "No Space for Bezos" criticizing the disruption and the city's focus on wealthy tourists over residents' needs. Environmental groups have also demonstrated, arguing that those who can afford such lavishness can also afford to pay more in taxes. The controversy highlights growing tensions over over-tourism and wealth inequality in historic European cities.</p>

          <p>Gold is widely considered a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, making it an attractive commodity during periods of economic uncertainty. Its market price is subject to constant fluctuation based on several key drivers. These factors include the fundamental principles of supply and demand, prevailing global economic conditions, and the current rate of inflation. Additionally, geopolitical instability, movements in currency values, central bank policies, and overall market sentiment all play a significant role in determining its value.

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, indicated a slight increase in consumer prices for May. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose to 2.7% on an annual basis, exceeding economists' forecasts and moving further from the Fed's target. The report also revealed a decline in both consumer spending and personal income, suggesting a potential weakening of the economy.

          <p>A group of 19 Virginia sheriffs has formally endorsed incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares for re-election. In a public letter, the sheriffs praised Miyares's support for law enforcement and strongly criticized his Democratic challenger, Jay Jones. They characterized Jones's platform as a "criminals first" agenda that would weaken law enforcement and lead to a rise in crime. The endorsement highlights the contentious nature of the race, which is being watched as a key indicator ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has published research identifying a potential pathway to enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue. The study, published in the journal Science, found that mice lack the ability to produce sufficient retinoic acid, a key compound for tissue repair, due to a disabled genetic switch. By reactivating this specific switch, the researchers were successfully able to trigger ear tissue regeneration in a mouse. This discovery could have significant implications for advancing regenerative medicine in vertebrates, including humans, by potentially unlocking latent healing capabilities.</p>

          <p>New, riskier investment options like cryptocurrency and private equity may soon be available in 401(k) retirement plans, sparking debate among financial experts. Proponents, such as BlackRock's Larry Fink, argue that this "democratizes" access to potentially high-return assets previously reserved for wealthy investors. However, some investor advocates warn these options are ill-suited for average retirement savers due to their volatility, high fees, lack of transparency, and illiquidity. The discussion highlights a fundamental conflict between offering greater choice and ensuring the long-term security of Americans' retirement savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker and a key Tesla supplier, is aggressively expanding its global operations. Following a major IPO, the company is investing heavily in new factories in Europe, including in Hungary and Spain, to be closer to major automakers and counter fierce competition in its domestic market. CATL also plans to roll out its battery-swapping technology in Europe, a move that could significantly alter the EV landscape by addressing issues of charging speed and battery longevity, though it requires industry-wide standardization.</p>

          <p>Recent reports highlight stories of immigrants, some undocumented for decades, choosing to leave the U.S., a phenomenon sometimes termed "self-deportation." Experts caution that this may not be a widespread trend but rather a result of the Trump administration's strategy to create a climate of fear, as mass deportations are logistically difficult and costly. For those who do leave, the decision is deeply personal and fraught with legal and financial challenges. The administration has also launched a new "assisted voluntary return" program, but its uptake and effectiveness remain limited so far.</p>

It contrasts his energetic, policy-focused campaign with the perceived passivity of the Democratic establishment, suggesting his success could inspire a new wave of challenges from the party's base. The author posits that Mamdani's victory proves the party's left flank can be a major asset, energizing voters with a clear moral vision, rather than a liability to be managed.

Kuniskis aims to reclaim significant market share from competitors like GM and Toyota, which have gained ground as Ram's sales fell 38% from their 2019 peak.

          <p>Following the murder of a teenage TikTok star, this article explores the dangers faced by women in Pakistan who have a public online presence. It highlights how patriarchal norms contribute to a culture of threats, privacy violations, and stalking that can escalate into physical violence. Women who use social media for self-expression or professional purposes often face a backlash that frames them as immoral, making harassment seem justified to some. Despite some platform improvements, many women feel that the complaint processes are ineffective, leaving them vulnerable to both online and offline harm.</p>

          <p>Heat health alerts are now in effect for most of England as the country prepares for a second heatwave, with temperatures forecast to rise into the 30s Celsius. An amber alert, indicating a potential impact on the entire population, covers London and southern regions, while a less severe yellow alert is active in the Midlands and Yorkshire. The peak heat is expected on Monday, which could become the hottest day of the year so far and coincide with the start of the Wimbledon tennis championship. These events are becoming more common and intense due to climate change.</p>
