          <h2>Footwear Giants Request Tariff Exemption from Trump Administration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 15:55:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike, Adidas, and other major footwear brands have jointly appealed to President Trump for an exemption from his reciprocal tariffs, warning of an "existential threat" to the industry. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, representing 76 brands, stated that high tariff rates would disproportionately affect lower and middle-income families, potentially leading to business closures and inventory shortages. The group emphasized that the tariffs, ranging from 150% to 220%, would not stimulate domestic manufacturing as promised, but rather create uncertainty and hinder investment in sourcing changes. Adidas had previously cautioned that tariffs would increase prices for American consumers, while Nike anticipated reduced current-quarter sales due to global levies and economic instability.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that measles cases in the U.S. have surpassed 900, with infections confirmed in 29 states, with the majority of cases occurring among unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status. At least six states are experiencing outbreaks, defined as three or more related cases, and the CDC notes that 13% of measles patients this year have been hospitalized, predominantly those under 19 years old. Experts express concern about the resurgence of a disease that was previously considered eradicated, attributing the increase to lagging vaccination rates and emphasizing the high contagiousness and potential for serious complications, including brain damage and pneumonia. The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine for effective protection against measles.</p>

          <p>A significant oil spill off the coast of Louisiana has raised alarms, particularly in light of recent DOGE-driven staff reductions at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The spill, originating from a well blowout in Garden Island Bay, threatens vital wildlife habitats and fisheries, with over 30,000 gallons of an oily mixture already collected. Former disaster response specialists warn that the loss of experienced personnel at NOAA, including experts in spill response, could hamper containment and cleanup efforts. The leak is occurring near the Pass-a-Loutre Wildlife Management Area, a sensitive ecological zone, raising concerns about potential harm to threatened species and the region's shrimp industry. The Coast Guard has federalized the response and is working to control the source of the leak.</p>

          <p>Five current or former Iowa State football coaching staff members have been punished by the NCAA for sports gambling violations, including wagering on the school's basketball programs. The coaches collectively placed over 6,200 online bets totaling more than $100,000, leading to Level II violations that could compromise the integrity of collegiate athletics. The penalties include a one-year show-cause order, attendance at an NCAA Regional Rules Seminar, and a two-week suspension for any future hires. The investigation stemmed from a state inquiry into sports wagering activities at campus athletic facilities, revealing dozens of athletes involved in underage gambling and identity theft.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has largely rebounded from the sharp sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff announcements in early April, fueled by renewed hopes for trade talks with China. The S&P 500 has climbed back to pre-tariff levels, buoyed by a stronger-than-expected jobs report. However, despite the recent optimism, the market remains below its February high, and questions persist about the long-term economic impact of the administration's trade policies. While some tariffs have been temporarily paused, new taxes on imports, particularly from China, are taking effect, raising concerns about slower economic growth and potential pullbacks in corporate hiring and investment. The volatility underscores the market's sensitivity to the ongoing trade tensions and their potential fallout.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a significant reduction in NASA's budget, cutting approximately $6 billion while reallocating $1 billion to Mars-focused missions. The proposed changes align with Elon Musk's long-held ambition for manned missions to Mars. NASA plans to streamline its workforce, IT services, and facility operations, while terminating several missions deemed "unaffordable." NASA's acting administrator acknowledged the tough choices ahead, stating that some activities would wind down. The budget allocates over $7 billion for moon exploration, but it would retire the SLS rocket, Orion spacecraft, and Gateway programs, ending green aviation spending and the Mars Sample Return Program.</p>

The American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) aim to fill the gap in the scientific process after the administration reevaluated the NCA, potentially slashing funding and eliminating responsible offices. The NCA report, due in 2027, is crucial for projecting future climate change impacts and informing decision-making.

          <p>Temu, the bargain Chinese retailer, has stopped shipping directly from China to the U.S. after the de minimis tariff loophole was cut off, as a result of an executive order signed by President Trump. This loophole allowed items worth $800 or less to enter the country duty-free. Temu has shifted its website and app to feature only products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses, with items previously shipped from China now labeled as out of stock. This change forces Temu to alter its business model and circumvent higher levies, raising prices and suspending its aggressive advertising. Temu states that pricing for U.S. shoppers remains unchanged as they actively recruit U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

Patterson is accused of serving a beef Wellington dish containing the poisonous mushrooms at a lunch in July 2023. Prosecutors allege that Patterson deliberately poisoned her guests, lied about a cancer diagnosis as a pretext for the lunch, and pretended to suffer similar symptoms afterward. Patterson has pleaded not guilty, claiming she ate some of the meal herself and genuinely got sick, but not as severely as the others. Her defense argues that the incident was a tragic accident.</p>

          <p>Amid the largest measles outbreak in 25 years, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will direct federal health agencies to explore potential new treatments for the disease, including vitamins.

Experts argue that decades of research have found no miracle treatment for measles, and that focusing on untested treatments could have grave consequences. Doctors in West Texas have reported that Kennedy's focus on treatments has led some patients to delay critical medical care in favor of unproven supplements.</p>

Since the collapse of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli troops have been carving out buffer zones in Gaza, restricting the population's movement and access to aid. While Israel seeks the return of hostages, its ultimate goal remains to defeat Hamas. Efforts by mediators to restore the ceasefire have been unsuccessful due to disagreements on core demands.</p>

          <p>As economic uncertainty grows worldwide, gold prices have reached record highs, driven by investors seeking "safe havens" for their money. The current surge in gold prices coincides with President Trump's continued announcement of new tariffs, which has shaken financial markets and threatens to reignite inflation. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that the economic outlook for the world, including the United States, has worsened significantly due to Trump's tariffs. Analysts suggest that if these trends continue, gold prices could continue to rise to unprecedented levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite occasional public criticism, the relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News remains strong due to mutual need. Trump treats Fox News as a political instrument, using it to amplify his messages and attack perceived enemies. Fox News, in turn, benefits from Trump's high profile and the attention he brings to the network. The show Fox & Friends serves as both a platform for friendly interviews and a way for White House officials to communicate directly with the president. While Trump may flirt with other networks, he consistently returns to Fox News, highlighting the enduring utility of their partnership.</p>
