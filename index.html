          <p>A pet zebra has been on the loose in Tennessee for several days after escaping and causing disruptions on a highway near Nashville, according to local officials. Professional tracking teams and a K9 unit have been deployed to aid in the search for the animal, which initially escaped into a wooded area off Interstate 24. The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office is in communication with the zebra's owner, who acquired the animal just the previous Friday. Anyone who spots the zebra is urged to contact the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office to assist in its safe recovery.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed after Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right PVV party, withdrew his support from the governing coalition due to disagreements over migration policies. Wilders pushed for stricter asylum measures, including freezing applications and limiting family reunification, which led to the coalition's dissolution. The move has sparked shock and anger among political leaders, with accusations that Wilders engineered the crisis for his own political gain. Prime Minister Dick Schoof has offered the resignation of the cabinet to King Willem-Alexander, and new elections are likely to be held in the autumn.</p>

          <p>The wife and children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, attack, are in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and are being processed for expedited removal. Soliman is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails during a pro-Israel demonstration, and authorities are investigating whether his family had any knowledge of or supported the attack. Soliman, who was in the U.S. on an expired tourist visa, allegedly planned the attack for a year and waited until his daughter's high school graduation to carry it out.

          <p>Antonio McDowell, 49, has been exonerated after spending 28 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, marking the 51st exoneration linked to the misconduct of former Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was framed for murder after refusing to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect in a shooting case. There was no evidence connecting McDowell to the crime, but Guevara coerced false identifications from witnesses. McDowell was granted clemency in 2020, and his murder conviction was thrown out after DNA evidence excluded him as the source of DNA found on the victim's clothing.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has lowered its expectations for UK economic growth this year to 1.3% due to US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt. The OECD cited the UK's "very thin" buffer in public finances and called on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to boost tax revenue and cut spending. While the UK economy showed better-than-expected growth between January and March, the OECD cautioned that "momentum is weakening" due to "deteriorating" business sentiment. It forecast the UK economy would expand by 1% in 2026, compared to the 1.2% predicted earlier. (not investment advice)</p>
