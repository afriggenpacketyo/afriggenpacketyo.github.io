          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer characterized by a Gleason score of 9, with metastasis to the bone. The diagnosis followed a routine physical exam where a small nodule was discovered. The article provides an overview of prostate cancer, its prevalence, and the meaning of the Gleason score, explaining that a score of 9 indicates the cancer is aggressive and likely to spread rapidly. Treatment options may include hormone therapy to slow the cancer's growth, and the American Cancer Society emphasized the importance of early detection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the 'NVLink Fusion' program, allowing customers to use non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's NVLink, previously exclusive to Nvidia chips. This enables semi-custom AI infrastructure by combining Nvidia processors with different CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Partners like MediaTek and Qualcomm Technologies can now connect their CPUs with Nvidia's GPUs in AI data centers. According to an analyst, NVLink represents Nvidia's plans to capture a share of data centers based on ASICs, which have traditionally been seen as Nvidia competitors.</p>

Trump stated the call would focus on stopping the 'bloodbath' and trade, and he plans to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO members afterward. Despite Trump's threats of sanctions, Russia's war goals remain unchanged, including Ukraine's ceding of regions and a block on Kyiv's NATO accession.

          <p>The White House proposed budget to Congress that completely eliminated funding for Head Start, the six-decade-old early childhood education program for low-income families that serves as a source of childcare for large swaths of the American working class. The article suggests the Republican's childcare policy is based on undoing the historic gains in women's rights and status, and pushing American women out of the workforce. Conservatives romanticize the role of the unpaid housewife, and the state of affairs has been worsened by the dramatic rise in the cost of childcare.</p>

          <p>US advocacy groups are campaigning against Republican proposals to cut Medicaid and Obamacare, potentially leaving millions without health insurance. The House bill proposes cuts to Medicaid by adding work requirements, and it is expected to save $715bn. The ACA is a public health insurance program that covers about 71 million low-income, disabled and elderly Americans. Republicans also want to allow premium tax credits available through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to expire. The congressional budget office estimates that these proposals could cause more than 13 million people to lose insurance by 2034.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's legislative agenda, the 'one big, beautiful bill,' faces challenges due to its expensive nature and potential economic consequences. Republicans aim to extend the Trump tax cuts, add new tax breaks, increase spending on immigration enforcement and the military, and raise the debt ceiling. However, the House GOP proposes deep cuts to Medicaid, clean energy, student loans, and food stamps to offset some costs. The article points out that Trump is proceeding as if conditions are similar to 2017, but conditions have changed and the US just went through a period of its highest inflation in decades.</p>

          <p>Author Michael Connelly discusses his upcoming novel, 'Nightshade,' the fourth season of 'The Lincoln Lawyer,' and the 'Ballard' spinoff. Connelly mentions that 'The Lincoln Lawyer' books take the most time to write because he consults with lawyer friends to ensure accuracy. Connelly also states that he almost retired, but the opportunity to write about detectives like RenÃ©e Ballard and Det. Sgt. Stilwell changed his mind. He is now working on another Stilwell story and is heavily involved with the television series, 'Ballard,' debuting in July.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating radical views expressed online by Guy Edward Bartkus, the suspect in the Palm Springs bombing at a fertility clinic. The FBI is reviewing a manifesto threatening an attack on a fertility clinic, and the suspect is believed to have died in the blast. The website associated with the bombing outlined a case for 'a war against pro-lifers' and cited fringe philosophies such as abolitionist veganism and pro-mortalism. The author referenced the recent death of a person he claimed as a close friend, which may have contributed to his depression.</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to cut federal funding for K-12 education in Maine after Gov. Janet Mills refused to follow an executive order banning transgender athletes from school sports. Maine schools rely heavily on federal dollars to support low-income students, special education, mental health services, and after-school programs. Federal funds account for 6-13% of school funding, supporting students from low-income families, English language learners, and students with disabilities. Educators in Maine express concern about the potential impact of federal cuts on staffing and programming for students.</p>

          <p>Warsaw's pro-EU mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, narrowly won the first round of voting in Poland's presidential election with 31.36% of the vote. His main opponent, national-conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki, came in at 29.54%, setting up a runoff vote for June 1. A key factor for round two could be voters who supported far-right candidates that were eliminated in the first round. Trzaskowski is from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Coalition, and a win would allow Tusk more space to push his EU-friendly reform agenda that has been held up by the current nationalist president.</p>

          <p>Mainland electric vehicle (EV) maker Leapmotor's European production is expected to be moved to a Stellantis factory in Spain, Germany, Italy or Slovakia. The relocation follows Stellantis' decision to stop making Leapmotor's Chinese partner's cars in Poland earlier this year. The move was likely to drive up Leapmotorâ€™s European production costs by about 10 per cent, but it had no plans to raise prices. By the end of 2025, the company expects that at least 10 per cent of its vehicles sold globally will come from outside China, Wu said.</p>

          <p>Israel has escalated its bombardment of Gaza but has yet to begin a significant advance, possibly to pressure Hamas to compromise in cease-fire talks. Benjamin Netanyahu faces pressure from cabinet allies who want to resettle Gaza with Israeli civilians, balanced against military concerns about sustaining a long-term occupation. Despite preventing food and fuel from reaching Gaza, Israel restarted some aid deliveries, drawing criticism from its right-wing base. Netanyahu is trying to do a little bit of everything by announcing a bigger ground operation, and responding to pressure from the Trump administration, while buying more time for hostage negotiations.</p>
