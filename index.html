          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay nearly $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The Justice Department revealed that Credit Suisse AG Singapore held undeclared accounts for U.S. persons with over $2 billion in assets between 2014 and 2023. This criminal conspiracy allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021, violating a prior 2014 plea agreement. Whistleblowers provided detailed evidence, including names and documents, leading to the settlement and underscoring the importance of cooperation in ongoing investigations.</p>

The country, which has transformed its economy through garment manufacturing, now faces the risk of reduced orders and economic hardship. The industry has made significant strides in improving safety and sustainability, but tariffs could undermine these efforts and threaten the livelihoods of countless workers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ended a tariff loophole that allowed inexpensive goods from China to enter the United States without paying tariffs, potentially impacting delivery companies like UPS and FedEx. The de minimis exemption, which allowed goods worth $800 or less to be imported without tariffs, is now gone, leading to expected declines in shipments from China. UPS anticipates a 25% decline in revenue from China-to-U.S. shipments, its most profitable trade lane, and has announced job cuts.

          <p>Sen. Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have caused significant delays and cancellations. Schumer pointed to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, old technology, and depleted federal funds as contributing factors. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark because of the disruptions, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area." The problems are attributed to equipment outages and staffing levels in Philadelphia, where the air traffic control center that oversees Newark's airspace is based.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry, following President Trump's call for tariffs on movies filmed overseas. This proposal aims to counter the loss of film and television production to states and nations offering incentives and cheaper labor. Senator Adam Schiff also announced his office was working on a federal film incentive proposal. The industry has expressed concerns that tariffs would cause more harm than good, advocating for federal assistance in the form of tax credits.</p>
