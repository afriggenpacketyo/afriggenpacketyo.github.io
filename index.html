          <p>A New Jersey federal judge rejected the government's attempt to move Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil's case to Louisiana.  The decision keeps the case closer to Khalil's pregnant wife and allows the judge to address the merits of his continued confinement.  Khalil's lawyers lauded the ruling as a victory against the government's attempt to manipulate jurisdiction.  The judge's decision prevents a potentially unfavorable ruling from a more conservative court.</p>
