          <p>ICE Homeland Security Investigations visited over 100 businesses in the Washington, D.C., area, focusing on restaurants, carry-out spots, and bars, to conduct worksite enforcement operations aimed at ensuring businesses comply with U.S. immigration and employment laws. No arrests were made during these visits, but agents distributed information requesting I-9 forms to verify employee identities and employment authorizations. Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed disturbance over the ICE activity, emphasizing that the Metropolitan Police Department was not involved and the operation appeared to disrupt rather than target criminals. The Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington voiced deep concern about the impact on the local economy, noting that immigrants constitute a significant portion of the restaurant workforce.</p>

          <p>Apple is appealing a court decision finding them in contempt for violating an earlier order in the Epic Games case, arguing that compliance would cost the company substantial sums. The ruling requires Apple to allow developers to include links within their apps that direct users to external payment options, bypassing Apple's commission fees. Apple contends that developers are already exploiting this order to reduce consumer choice and damage Apple's business. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney hailed the ruling as forcing Apple to compete, while Apple claims it has complied with the original court order and will appeal the contempt ruling.</p>

          <p>India launched strikes on Pakistan in response to a terrorist attack in Kashmir that killed 26 civilians. The Indian government reported hitting nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan’s side of the disputed Kashmir region. Pakistan military officials said that more than 20 people had been killed and dozens injured after six places were hit on the Pakistani side of Kashmir and in Punjab Province. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought numerous wars, with the disputed area of Kashmir as a prime flashpoint, since 1947.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. defended the independence of the judiciary and denounced attempts to impeach judges over disagreements with their rulings, speaking at an event in Buffalo. His remarks echoed a similar statement issued in March in response to threats by President Trump and his allies to impeach federal judges who ruled against administration policies. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also denounced attacks on the judiciary, citing increased threats and professional retaliation against judges. Roberts emphasized the judiciary's role in checking the excesses of Congress or the executive branch, requiring a degree of independence.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the West is at an inflection point, with US President Donald Trump’s policies and rhetoric accelerating the unraveling of the Western world order. The author contends that Trump's tariffs, attacks on NATO allies, denial of facts, embrace of nationalism, and undermining of democratic norms are echoing the mistakes of past rulers, potentially leading to irreversible decline. The author draws parallels to the fall of the Roman Empire, suggesting that Trump's policies of stoking internal division and focusing on perceived external threats mirror fatal errors made by past leaders.</p>

Rollins acknowledged potential mistakes but insisted key positions were not accepted in the second round.
