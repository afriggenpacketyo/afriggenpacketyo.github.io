          <p>The article discusses the fear and anxiety within the immigrant community in Southern California following increased ICE activity. Raids have become more aggressive under the current administration, leading to confusion and fear among undocumented individuals. The story recounts a specific raid at a Home Depot parking lot in Los Angeles, where ICE agents, along with local law enforcement, detained numerous day laborers. While authorities claim they target criminals, community activists argue that these actions sow fear and disrupt lives, the article also mentions the reduction of people who migrate to the United States due to the anti-immigrant policies, with many feeling they cannot find peace. The situation has left many immigrants feeling trapped and vulnerable.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' legal team has indicated a change in their trial strategy as prosecutors prepare to rest their case in the federal trial against him. The defense now anticipates needing only two to five days to present their case, a shorter timeframe than initially requested, which suggests they may perceive weaknesses in the prosecution's arguments. Combs faces charges including racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault. Legal experts suggest the defense might be emphasizing that the prosecution has not met its burden of proof, especially if the case relies heavily on testimony from ex-girlfriends and former employees. The trial has involved graphic testimonies and evidence, including videos and text messages, related to the alleged crimes.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, which is designed for future lunar missions. The test included a critical zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, verifying the spacecraft's ability to safely extract astronauts during launch failures. The Mengzhou spacecraft features a modular design with two versions: one for near-Earth operations and another for deep-space lunar missions. This test marks a significant step toward China's goal of crewed lunar missions by 2030 and represents the first such test since 1998, when a similar trial was conducted for the Shenzhou spacecraft program.</p>

          <p>Officials in Britain are warning about the dangers of cosmetic procedures like fillers and Botox being performed in unsafe locations, such as public toilets and hotel rooms. The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) is calling for urgent regulation of the industry to protect people from unlicensed practitioners. Unsafe fillers and fat-dissolving injections are also being sold online, posing additional risks to consumers. The government is considering new regulations to address these concerns, and trading standards officials advise checking qualifications and avoiding practitioners who operate through social media. The advisory comes after reports of adverse side effects from suspected counterfeit botox and risky procedures like liquid Brazilian butt lifts.</p>

The retailer aims to show it is "on the front foot" ahead of the summer trading season after the incident disrupted deliveries and caused empty shelves. While stock levels have normalized, the discount serves as a gesture of appreciation to its 6.5 million members, although some analysts suggest it may not appeal to all customers due to the high spending threshold. The cyber attack, which cost the Co-op millions in lost sales, prompted the retailer to shut down systems to restrict the damage.</p>

          <p>Australia is set to become the first country worldwide to eliminate all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, effectively lifting the ban on gay and bisexual men. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, will begin next month and are expected to increase the donation pool by approximately 625,000 individuals. Previously, men who had sex with men within the past three months were prohibited from donating blood or plasma. The updated approach will ask all donors about anal sex with new or multiple partners, requiring a three-month waiting period for blood donation but still allowing plasma donation. This change reflects research indicating no impact on blood and plasma supply safety.</p>

          <p>Dozens of families are calling for an independent inquiry into maternity care at Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) NHS Trust, following concerns about inadequate care. These families have reported incidents of babies dying or being injured, as well as women experiencing trauma due to inadequate care. The concerns arose after a previous investigation revealed potentially avoidable deaths of 56 babies and two mothers at the trust between 2019 and 2024. Whistleblowers have also shared concerns about the standard of care at LTH maternity units, citing a culture where staff are afraid to raise concerns. The NHS trust has expressed deep sorrow and acknowledged the need for improvements, but families are pushing for a comprehensive review.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) democracies have launched an action plan to reduce risks to critical mineral supply chains, addressing overdependence on China. The plan aims to enhance cooperation within the G7 and with like-minded nations to safeguard economic security against nonmarket practices. Cooperation areas include monitoring mineral shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, and recycling. The G7 will develop a roadmap for standards-based markets for critical minerals by the end of the year, emphasizing responsible investment in critical mineral projects. The leaders stressed the importance of stable relations with China, urging it to refrain from market distortions and harmful overcapacity.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 1.7% year-over-year decline in May, the sharpest drop in eight months, as shipments to the United States plummeted. The decrease was influenced by falling automobile exports, particularly to the U.S., which dropped by 24.7%. The Bank of Japan acknowledged that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade factors and overseas economic slowdowns. Tariffs are considered a significant threat to Japan's economic outlook, potentially impacting GDP. The trade deficit stood at 637.6 billion yen in May, and trade negotiations with the U.S. are ongoing, with Japan prioritizing concessions for its automobile sector. (not investment advice)</p>
