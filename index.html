          <p>During a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on the DHS's 2026 budget, House Democrats, led by ranking member Bennie Thompson, sharply criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's leadership, citing concerns over immigration policies and legal compliance. Democrats accused the Trump administration of lying to the courts and the American people, and Rep. Seth Magaziner criticized Noem for deporting children and other individuals without due process. Noem defended the administration's approach to border control, highlighting efforts to deport known terrorists and maintain operational control of the southern border. The hearing also addressed issues of due process for those arrested by ICE and the potential suspension of habeas corpus, with Noem stating she believes it falls under the president's prerogative.</p>

          <p>Three wildfires in northern Minnesota have burned nearly 37,000 acres since Sunday, with the Jenkins Creek Fire being the largest and most rapidly growing. The Camp House Fire has destroyed dozens of structures, and investigations are ongoing into the cause of all three fires, including a group of campers suspected of leaving a fire unattended. Weather conditions are expected to improve slightly with upcoming storms, and the Minnesota National Guard has been activated to assist in firefighting efforts. A portion of the Superior National Forest is closed, and officials are urging people to evacuate impacted areas for their own safety and to allow firefighters to work effectively.</p>

          <p>President Trump, during a speech in Saudi Arabia, criticized Western intervention and nation-building efforts in the Middle East, drawing both applause and skepticism. He declared that the United States would no longer lecture other nations on how to live and urged the people of the region to chart their own destinies. While some in the Middle East welcomed the sentiment, viewing it as a rejection of past American policies, others expressed concern about the potential impact on human rights and regional stability. Trump also expressed a desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and for a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, meeting with the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Shara, during his Gulf tour.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a plan to raise the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers to $30 per hour by 2028, despite warnings from business leaders about potential job losses and a slowdown in tourism. The proposal, hailed by labor leaders as the highest minimum wage in the country, also requires employers to provide $8.35 per hour for health care by July 2026. While supporters argue that the wage increase will benefit workers and boost the local economy, opponents predict that hotels and airport businesses will cut back on staffing and investment in the city, potentially impacting the 2028 Olympic Games.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status in state-funded health care benefits starting in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit and economic uncertainty. Those already enrolled will not be affected, but starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" will have to pay a $100 monthly premium. Newsom cited higher-than-expected costs for the program and the impact of federal tariff policies as reasons for the decision, estimating that the changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029. He blamed President Trump's tariff policies for the shortfalls, estimating that the polices have cost the state $16 billion in tax revenues.</p>

Dozens of tenured Harvard professors have also pledged to donate 10% of their salaries to support the university's legal challenge. The administration claims Harvard has failed to address race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment on campus, while Harvard argues it has made necessary changes and is compliant with federal law.</p>

The lawsuit seeks legal protection for the district's new policy that ensures female-only participation in sports.

          <p>US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the FDA to review the regulations around the abortion pill mifepristone, citing "new data" from a flawed analysis used by anti-abortion groups to push for restrictions or a ban. The analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed, claims higher complication rates from mifepristone than previously known, but medical experts have criticized it for overstating adverse effects. Anti-abortion leaders intend to use the analysis to pressure the FDA and lawmakers to roll back access to the drug, potentially ending telemedicine prescriptions as a first step. Over 100 scientific studies have affirmed the safety and effectiveness of mifepristone for ending pregnancies.</p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention in Texas after a federal judge ordered his immediate release, citing a lack of evidence supporting his detention and concerns about chilling protected speech. Suri, an Indian national, was detained for two months following his arrest by federal agents who revoked his visa. The Trump administration claimed Suri was detained for spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media, but his lawyers denied the claims, arguing the government was retaliating against him for supporting Palestinians. Suri is also fighting deportation in a separate immigration case.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after spending over three decades behind bars for killing their parents. The brothers previously served life sentences without parole, claiming they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before being sent to the governor's office for approval. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, who opposed resentencing, described the decision as "monumental" with significant implications. Relatives of the Menendez brothers expressed joy and hope after the judge's decision.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has committed to maintaining state-funded health insurance for undocumented residents, even amid a budget shortfall and potential federal penalties. This decision sets California apart from other states and reflects its commitment to integrating undocumented immigrants into the community. Newsom acknowledged that the state faces a $12 billion budget shortfall, which may necessitate cuts to the coverage that undocumented people qualify for, including capping enrollment and adding monthly premiums. However, he emphasized the economic and moral reasons for providing healthcare to undocumented residents, who are a vital part of the state.</p>

Dugan has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing she is entitled to judicial immunity.

          <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to charge monthly premiums for undocumented immigrants and stop adding new enrollees to the program as soon as January. He is making this change in order to balance the state's budget. The move is an attempt to save money in California's budget, and it is being done in order to make the budget balance after the program has been more expensive than anticipated.</p>
