          <p>Democrat Xp Lee won a special election for a Minnesota House seat, filling the vacancy left by the late Rep. Melissa Hortman who was tragically assassinated in June. Lee's victory over Republican Ruth Bittner restores a 67-67 tie in the chamber, preserving a crucial power-sharing agreement between the two parties. The election took place amidst heightened concerns over political violence, a theme both candidates addressed during their campaigns, aiming to calm a charged atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-expected decline in August, falling just 0.1% year-on-year, an improvement from July's 2.6% drop. This was largely due to a rebound in shipments to other Asian countries and a significant jump in exports to Western Europe. However, exports to the United States continued to fall sharply, particularly in the automotive sector, highlighting ongoing challenges from U.S. tariffs and slowing external demand. The data provides a mixed economic picture as the country faces political uncertainty and the Bank of Japan prepares for its upcoming rate decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced plans to speed up the phase-out of all Russian oil and gas imports, stating that Russia's war economy is financed by these revenues. Following a call with U.S. President Donald Trump, she indicated the Commission will soon present its 19th sanctions package targeting Russia's energy, banking, and crypto sectors. This move aligns with President Trump's recent push for Europe to impose tariffs on Chinese imports and cease purchasing Russian oil as a condition for further U.S. sanctions.</p>

          <p>Syria is facing its most severe drought in 36 years, which has caused wheat harvests to plummet by 40% and is exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation. With nearly 90% of the population in poverty, the UN warns that food insecurity could reach unprecedented levels, potentially forcing more families to migrate. The crisis has crippled rain-fed farmland, causing the collapse of rural livelihoods and a sharp increase in the price of bread, a staple food. International aid agencies are providing temporary relief, but long-term solutions are needed to prevent a deeper crisis.</p>

The city attorney's office announced a plea agreement with the current developers, who will be required to tear down the dilapidated structures by 2026. Construction on the homes was originally halted in 2002, and the city ordered their demolition in 2003, but a series of subsequent owners failed to comply, leaving the structures as a long-standing blight on the community.</p>

          <p>Authorities have charged 71-year-old George Zinn with obstruction of justice, alleging he falsely confessed to shooting Charlie Kirk to create a diversion and help the actual gunman escape. Shortly after the assassination, Zinn reportedly shouted "I shot him - now shoot me," intentionally misleading law enforcement at the scene. The primary suspect, Tyler Robinson, even referenced the false arrest in text messages to his roommate. Zinn is being held without bail and also faces separate, unrelated charges for possession of child sexual abuse material.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified JPMorgan Chase as a potential candidate to join the exclusive club of companies with a $1 trillion market capitalization, a feat currently dominated by tech giants. He attributed the bank's potential to its strong performance across lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon. Cramer noted that the entire banking sector has been performing well, with Wall Street showing a willingness to pay higher price-to-earnings multiples for financial stocks.

          <p>New data reveals a significant shift in driver preferences in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. This represents a dramatic increase from just over 6% a decade ago. Industry experts, such as the AA, attribute this trend to the growing popularity of electric vehicles, which do not have manual gearboxes, and the approaching 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. As a result, the skill of driving a manual car is becoming increasingly irrelevant for a new generation of drivers.</p>

          <p>Strong, gusty winds in Washington state have kicked up old volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, creating hazy skies and reducing air quality. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, is occurring due to persistently dry and snow-free conditions in the area. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have confirmed that this is not new volcanic activity and the volcano's alert level remains normal, though they warn the airborne ash can be hazardous to aircraft.</p>

          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo spacecraft, on its maiden flight carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies, has experienced a delay in its rendezvous with the International Space Station. The delay was caused by two premature shutdowns of its main engine during crucial orbital adjustment burns. Flight controllers are now working to diagnose the problem and develop a new plan to safely guide the uncrewed ship to the station. The arrival, originally scheduled for Wednesday, is now on hold indefinitely while engineers investigate the issue.</p>
