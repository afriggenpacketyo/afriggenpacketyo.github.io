          <h2>CNBC Survey Shows Half of Americans Hold Negative Views on Tesla and Elon Musk</h2>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey reveals that nearly half of Americans have a negative perception of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, contrasting with more favorable views of General Motors. The survey suggests that Musk's controversial political stances, including his support for President Trump and Republican policies, may be alienating potential Tesla buyers. Interestingly, while many are negative on Tesla, they are more positive about electric vehicles in general, especially among Democrats. Republicans, however, show the opposite trend, favoring Tesla but disliking EVs. Optimism among investors and the public towards Tesla is waning due to the company's struggles to keep pace with cheaper competitors in China. (not investment advice)</p>

Hegseth himself blamed "leakers" for the revelations, characterizing the shared information as informal and unclassified coordination for media purposes.

          <p>This article examines the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, despite a court order. The author questions the administration's claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, citing a doctored image used as evidence. The piece argues that the relevant legal issue is whether the government can bypass due process and if it must remedy its mistake. The columnist emphasizes the importance of limiting abusive government power and protecting the right to due process for everyone, regardless of their background.</p>
