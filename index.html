          <p>SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service confirmed a significant network outage, with over 60,000 user reports logged on Downdetector. The disruption occurred just one day after the company announced the public availability of its direct-to-cell satellite service in partnership with T-Mobile. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the issue on his social media platform, X, apologizing for the inconvenience and stating that service would be restored shortly. It was not immediately clear if the new T-Mobile service was impacted by the outage, which follows other recent service disruptions on Musk's platforms.</p>

          <p>During a visit to the Federal Reserve, President Donald Trump and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had a public disagreement over the costs of renovating the central bank's headquarters. Trump claimed construction costs had topped $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed on the spot. Despite the tension and his ongoing pressure for the Fed to lower interest rates, Trump suggested it was not "necessary" to fire Powell, a reversal from earlier considerations. The visit is seen as part of Trump's campaign to influence the central bank's monetary policy amid his criticism of its current interest rate stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Jets quarterback Justin Fields has reportedly avoided a major setback after being carted off the field during a training camp practice. The team announced that Fields suffered a dislocated toe but did not sustain a serious injury and is considered day-to-day, averting significant missed time. Head coach Aaron Glenn suggested someone may have stepped on Fields' toe and confirmed that veteran quarterback Tyrod Taylor is prepared to step in if needed. Fields, who was signed in the offseason to replace Aaron Rodgers, is a crucial part of the team's plans for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at giving local governments more authority to address homelessness by removing people from public streets. The order seeks to reverse judicial precedents and consent decrees that limit cities' ability to clear encampments, redirecting federal funds toward rehabilitation and treatment programs. This move follows a Supreme Court ruling that permits fining or jailing unhoused individuals for sleeping outside, even without available shelter. While the White House states the goal is to restore public order and provide help, advocates for the unhoused argue that such punitive measures exacerbate the crisis without addressing its root cause.</p>

          <p>A review of Tesla's financial decisions reveals the company missed out on potentially billions of dollars in profit by selling 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in mid-2022. The sale occurred when the cryptocurrency's value was significantly lower than its current near-record highs. Had Tesla retained its full $1.5 billion investment, its digital asset portfolio would be worth an estimated $5 billion today, instead of its current $1.24 billion. This financial misstep comes as the company faces challenges in its core automotive business, with declining revenue and a slumping stock price, highlighting the significant opportunity cost.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, with a formal declaration planned at the UN General Assembly. Macron stated the decision aligns with France's historical commitment to a just peace in the Middle East and emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire, hostage release, and humanitarian aid in Gaza. The move was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israel's Defense Minister, who called it a "capitulation to terrorism." France joins a growing number of over 140 UN member states that recognize Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order designed to prohibit "third-party, pay-for-play" payments to college athletes, targeting the booster-funded collectives that have reshaped college sports. The directive aims to curb the use of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals as recruiting inducements, which the White House describes as creating a "chaotic environment" and competitive imbalance. The order also mandates the protection and expansion of non-revenue and women's sports, directing federal agencies to develop enforcement plans.

          <p>Following an hours-long meeting with a top Department of Justice official, Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell "answered every single question" truthfully and without invoking any privilege, according to her lawyer. The extraordinary meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche took place in a Tallahassee courthouse, where he questioned Maxwell about her knowledge of Epstein's sex trafficking network. The sit-down comes amid intense pressure on the Trump administration to release more information related to the case. While Maxwell's lawyer confirmed her full cooperation, he declined to comment on the substance of the discussion.</p>

          <h2>Report Details a New Form of Family Separation Through Bureaucratic Obstacles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 16:10:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a new, less visible form of family separation by dismantling protections for unaccompanied migrant children, according to an in-depth report. Instead of physical separation at the border, the administration is using bureaucratic and legal tactics to make it harder for sponsors, typically relatives, to claim minors from federal custody. This includes new DNA testing requirements and proof of legal residency for sponsors, which can deter them from coming forward. As a result, children are being held in detention facilities for much longer periods, a strategy critics call "Family Separation 2.0."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional, finding it violates the 2nd Amendment. In its decision, the court stated the law "meaningfully constrains the right to keep operable arms" by creating a recurring burden on gun owners. The ruling, which effectively nullifies a 2016 ballot measure, leans heavily on a 2022 Supreme Court precedent requiring gun laws to be consistent with the nation's historical tradition. Gun rights activists praised the decision, while gun violence prevention groups condemned it as a safety risk.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines saw its shares fall sharply after it reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and significantly cut its profit forecast for 2025. The carrier now expects earnings before taxes of $600 million to $800 million for 2025, down from an earlier forecast of $1.7 billion, citing macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker domestic demand. Despite the negative outlook, CEO Bob Jordan noted that travel demand has recently shown signs of stabilizing. The news comes as Southwest overhauls its business model, moving away from policies like open seating to better compete in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

While the government says it cannot afford to go further on pay, it has offered to negotiate on working conditions and career progression.

          <p>Tesla's shares dropped 8% after the company reported its second straight quarter of declining automotive revenue and missed overall revenue estimates. The electric vehicle maker is facing increased competition and a potential slowdown in demand, with CEO Elon Musk warning of a "few rough quarters" ahead due to the expiration of federal EV tax credits. Automotive revenue fell 16% year-over-year, and the company did not provide official guidance for the rest of the year, signaling continued uncertainty. The poor performance and murky outlook have contributed to the stock's 24% decline so far in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

The clerks, who refused the requests, expressed shock and alarm, noting that providing such unauthorized access would be a felony.
