          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, with some potentially seeing debts written off, due to the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies will pay out over Â£70 million in response to a review by Ofgem, the energy regulator, which found suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. Payments range from Â£40 to Â£1,000, depending on the mistreatment experienced, and will be paid directly into customer accounts. Ofgem suspended forced installations and implemented stricter conditions for prepayment meter installations without customer consent. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Concerns are rising in Japan's bond market as long-dated yields approach record highs, potentially triggering capital flight from the U.S. and an unwinding of carry trades. Higher yields on Japanese government bonds could incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially impacting U.S. tech stocks and global markets due to increased borrowing costs. While some analysts anticipate a gradual unwinding of carry trades due to a depreciating dollar, others warn of a significant market correction if Japanese investors return home en masse. Despite these concerns, some argue that Japan's large holdings of U.S. Treasuries are structurally anchored in the U.S.-Japan alliance, mitigating the risk of divestment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7 million, the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat, for breaching rules related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts. The fine includes Â£104.5 million for sewage operation breaches and an additional Â£18.2 million for "undeserved dividends," marking the first time Ofwat has penalized a water company for this reason. Thames Water, currently in a "cash lock up," cannot make further dividend payments without Ofwat's approval, and the company faces ongoing criticism for sewage discharges and a Â£20 billion debt. The company secured an emergency Â£3 billion loan in March to avoid collapse, serving a quarter of the UK's population.</p>

Discussions are expected to center on continued military assistance, especially the Taurus missile system, as the United States potentially reduces its support.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed US embassies to suspend scheduling new student visa appointments while preparing to broaden social media vetting for applicants. A memo sent to diplomatic posts indicates the pause will remain until further guidance is issued, citing "significant implications" for embassies and consulates due to the enhanced screening. This move follows Trump's criticism of elite colleges, accusing them of enabling antisemitism and discriminatory admissions policies. The State Department's spokesperson emphasized the seriousness of vetting those entering the country, while the administration has already frozen university funding and moved to deport students, actions often challenged in court.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space during its ninth test flight but failed to return to Earth due to a propellant leak. The leak caused the spacecraft to spin out of control, leading to its disintegration upon re-entry into the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean. While the company fixed ascent issues from previous flights, the loss of control prevented planned tests of heat shield variations. Elon Musk stated the next three test flights would occur more rapidly, though past schedules have been unrealistic, and the company still needs major advances to meet NASA's Artemis III lunar lander requirements.</p>

          <p>Getty Images is spending millions to combat what it calls a "world of rhetoric" through its lawsuit against Stability AI, according to CEO Craig Peters. Getty accuses Stability AI and other AI labs of stealing copyright-protected material to train AI models for commercial gain. Peters argues that these firms are using copyrighted material under the guise of innovation and unfairly competing in existing commercial markets. The company is suing Stability AI in the U.K. and U.S., alleging the unauthorized copying of 12 million images.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders have voiced concerns regarding the government's plans for early prisoner release, stating the proposals "could be of net detriment to public safety." In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, police chiefs raised issues about the costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail due to a move away from short sentences. While acknowledging the government's sentencing reforms, the letter aims to offer advice and shape the policy. Signatories included heads of the Metropolitan Police, MI5, and the National Crime Agency, emphasizing their commitment to public safety.</p>

Despite curbing investments, some European businesses are buying more components from Chinese companies, increasing their supply chain dependence on China. The broad fall in prices in China and a weakening currency have made Chinese components more attractive, posing challenges for President Trump's efforts to shield American manufacturing.

Most of the craft was expected to burn up, with remaining pieces falling into the Indian Ocean.
