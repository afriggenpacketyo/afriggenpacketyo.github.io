          <p>According to a Financial Times report, Nvidia and AMD have reached an unprecedented agreement with the White House to give the U.S. government 15% of revenues from specific AI chips sold in China. In return for this revenue sharing, the companies will receive crucial export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export controls. This arrangement highlights the Trump administration's strategy of using tariffs and special exemptions as bargaining tools in its ongoing economic conflict with China. The deal reportedly followed a meeting between Nvidia's CEO and President Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A contentious political battle is escalating in Texas over a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps, a move Democrats have labeled as cheating. To prevent a quorum and block the vote, numerous Democratic lawmakers have fled the state, prompting Governor Greg Abbott to threaten them with arrest upon their return. High-profile Democrats, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and New York Governor Kathy Hochul, have defended the Texas lawmakers' actions, framing the fight as a necessary defense of democracy against a power grab instigated by Donald Trump. The proposed maps could give Republicans a significant advantage in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, stating it is the only way to defeat Hamas and that Israel has "no choice but to finish the job." The plan, which involves dismantling Hamas strongholds while moving civilians to designated safe zones, has drawn sharp criticism at an emergency UN Security Council meeting, with officials warning of a humanitarian catastrophe. Netanyahu asserted that the goal is to "free Gaza," not occupy it, and that a short timetable is in place. The announcement has also sparked fears for the safety of the remaining hostages held by Hamas.</p>

Firefighters, aided by the army and water-bombing planes, are battling the blaze which has consumed over 1,200 acres within the national park. The fire is part of a broader trend of intense wildfires across Europe, fueled by record summer heat linked to climate change. Similar large-scale fires have recently forced evacuations in Spain and required major firefighting efforts in France, highlighting the continent's increasing vulnerability to extreme weather events.</p>

The administration is weighing its options carefully, as the U.S. relationship with China is complex and affects numerous other global issues. This potential action would utilize broad authority granted by an executive order that allows the U.S. to monitor and penalize countries importing Russian oil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts and social media users are raising alarms about the potential dangers of 'Feel Free' tonic drinks, which contain kratom, a substance with opioid-like effects. According to an NBC News report, these products are increasingly available in stores and are being used to self-treat conditions like pain and anxiety, leading to concerns about addiction and withdrawal. The article highlights personal stories of addiction and hospitalization, while noting the FDA has recommended controls on a concentrated kratom byproduct due to its abuse potential. The manufacturer, Botanic Tonics, defended its product's safety, citing a low complaint rate despite settling a class-action lawsuit over its failure to warn users of risks.</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have issued apologies following criticism that a collaborative shoe design constituted cultural appropriation. The footwear, named the 'Oaxaca Slip-On,' was inspired by traditional huarache sandals from Mexico but was reportedly produced without consulting or crediting the Indigenous communities who originated the design. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's President, Claudia Sheinbaum, who criticized large companies for taking ideas from Indigenous communities. In response to the backlash, both Chavarria and Adidas have removed promotional images and expressed commitment to engaging in a respectful dialogue with the affected Oaxacan community.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Dave Ramsey gave rare advice to take on new debt, counseling a recently divorced father to use a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay his ex-wife $150,000 for her share of their house. The caller had an exceptionally low 2.25% mortgage rate, making the decision to keep the home financially complex. Ramsey justified the HELOC as a restructuring of existing debt to his ex-wife, advising him to "get her off your back."

The report details a pattern of rising violence, intimidation, and land dispossession, which critics and human rights groups describe as a systemic effort to expand settlements and undermine prospects for a Palestinian state. Settler leaders, now influential within the Israeli government, view this period as a pivotal moment to assert permanent Jewish control over the land.

Reflecting on the 80th anniversary of the war's end, he stated that China's primary interests today lie in maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region.

          <p>A coalition of top European leaders has publicly stated that Ukraine must be included in any potential peace negotiations between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a joint statement, leaders from France, Germany, the U.K., and the EU welcomed efforts to end the war but emphasized that a path to peace "cannot be decided without Ukraine." Their call comes as Trump and Putin prepare for a potential summit in Alaska. U.S. Vice President JD Vance described the planned meeting as a major diplomatic breakthrough, but it remains unclear if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the gunman who attacked the CDC headquarters in Atlanta as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old man who reportedly blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for causing him personal health issues. The attack resulted in the death of DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose, a Marine veteran. White, who was armed with five guns, was killed during the incident after opening fire on several CDC buildings. His father told police his son had become fixated on his distrust of the vaccine. A union representing CDC workers stated the incident was not random and called for federal officials to condemn vaccine misinformation.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California enacted landmark heat safety regulations, farmworkers across the state continue to suffer and die from preventable heat-related illnesses. A recent state audit and multiple reports highlight systemic failures in enforcement by Cal/OSHA, which is criticized for being understaffed and having outdated procedures. Many agricultural workers, a significant number of whom are undocumented, are hesitant to report unsafe conditions for fear of employer retaliation and deportation. Despite the law requiring water, shade, and rest, advocates argue that without effective enforcement, the protections remain inadequate as climate change intensifies heatwaves.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched through central London to demand the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and to express support for Israel. The protest, led by figures including the UK's chief rabbi, featured Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages. Many attendees voiced anger at the UK government's conditional plan to recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a "reward for Hamas" and urging officials to prioritize the hostages' freedom. The march highlighted concerns over rising antisemitism in Britain and the ongoing emotional toll of the conflict on families of those affected by the October 7th attacks.</p>

          <p>Actor James van der Beek, who was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer, has revealed that his only early warning sign was a subtle change in his bowel movements, which he initially dismissed. The 48-year-old actor emphasized that he felt healthy and had no glaring red flags before his diagnosis, highlighting the importance of screening. Medical experts quoted in the article confirm that changes in bowel habits are a primary symptom, along with fatigue and abdominal discomfort. They stress the importance of screening, especially as the recommended age has dropped to 45, since many colorectal cancers develop silently until they are advanced.</p>

          <p>A new NPR series is set to explore the significant changes and fractures occurring in the post-World War II global system, often called the "liberal international order." For decades, this order was defined by globalization, multilateralism, and U.S. leadership, but it is now being challenged by resurgent authoritarian powers and shifting alliances. The series will examine how U.S. policies, including tariffs and skepticism toward alliances like NATO, are prompting other nations to forge new paths and partnerships. It will delve into the uncertainties of this new dynamic and whether it can sustain the progress seen since 1945.</p>

The decision followed Israel's announcement of plans to take over Gaza City and has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative party.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing turmoil over its handling of drugs for rare diseases, exemplified by the case of Sarepta Therapeutics. The agency granted accelerated approval for Sarepta's expensive gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy despite internal concerns over limited data, a decision initially praised for its flexibility. However, after three patient deaths were linked to the treatments, the FDA suspended the drug's distribution, causing the company's stock to plummet. This incident highlights the profound dilemma the FDA faces in balancing the urgent needs of patients with few options against the potential risks of fast-tracking drugs with incomplete clinical evidence.
