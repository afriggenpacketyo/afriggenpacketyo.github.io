          <p>During a rain delay at a Washington Nationals game against the New York Mets, a member of the Nationals grounds crew narrowly avoided injury when he lost his balance while deploying the tarp. The incident occurred in the first inning of a scoreless game, causing a brief scare as the tarp was rolled over him. Play resumed after less than an hour, with the Mets ultimately taking the lead. The game also marked Juan Soto's return to Nationals Park as a member of the Mets after signing a record-breaking contract. </p>

Scheuer altered prices, added offensive language, and changed allergen information, though none of the modifications reached the public. He pleaded guilty to computer fraud and aggravated identity theft, and was ordered to pay $620,000 in restitution to Disney and $70,000 to the software company that provided the menu creation program.
