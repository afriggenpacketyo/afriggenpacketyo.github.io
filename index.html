This win marks South Africa's fourth consecutive victory in the tournament, placing them just one point behind the leading Australian team.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to request advanced military assets, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, to counter the ongoing Russian invasion. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for international pressure on Vladimir Putin to achieve peace, stating that there is momentum to end the war. However, Trump expressed caution about providing the long-range weapons, citing concerns about depleting the U.S. military's own supply. The leaders agreed to discuss the matter further, with Trump also planning a separate meeting with Putin.</p>

          <p>A potential summit in Budapest between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump faces significant logistical challenges, primarily concerning Putin's travel through EU airspace. Due to a blanket ban on Russian aircraft, Putin's presidential plane would require special permission from individual EU and NATO member states to fly over their territory. The article explores potential circuitous routes and the political complexities involved, noting that while Hungary's Viktor Orban is eager to host, obtaining the necessary clearances remains a major obstacle for the proposed meeting.</p>

          <p>American electricity companies are struggling to determine the actual power demand that will result from the artificial intelligence boom, as tech firms request massive energy allocations for data centers in multiple regions simultaneously. This uncertainty complicates infrastructure planning and risks billions in over-investment, while electricity prices for consumers are already rising. While some executives warn of an AI bubble and overstated load forecasts, others believe the surge in demand is real and requires a long-term national energy policy to ensure grid reliability.

          <p>California's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against three major plastic bag manufacturers, alleging they violated state law by marketing their bags as recyclable when they are not. An investigation found that the vast majority of recycling facilities in the state do not accept these thicker plastic bags, leading them to end up in landfills. Alongside the lawsuit, the state announced a $1.7 million settlement with four other producers who agreed to halt sales of the non-recyclable bags, aiming to address the widespread plastic pollution crisis.</p>

          <p>The recent record-breaking surge in gold prices is prompting some financial strategists to advocate for a shift away from the classic 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio. Citing risks from inflation and geopolitics, they propose a 60/20/20 model, which allocates a significant portion to alternative assets like precious metals and cryptocurrency. Gold has seen massive inflows from investors this year, driven by central bank demand and its perception as a hedge, fundamentally changing its role from a fringe asset to a core portfolio holding.

          <h2>Columnist Argues Trump Foments Domestic Conflict While Portraying Himself as a Global Peacemaker</h2>

          <p>A Guardian columnist argues there is a stark contrast between President Trump's self-proclaimed role as a peacemaker abroad and his actions at home, which the author claims are fomenting civil conflict. The article cites the deployment of U.S. troops to Democrat-run cities and the use of the justice system to target political opponents as evidence of a strategy to intimidate and provoke violence. This domestic behavior, the columnist contends, undermines his international image and suggests a deliberate effort to polarize the nation for political gain.</p>

          <p>In the ongoing trade war with the United States, China is retaliating with strategic economic measures, including imposing counter-tariffs and restricting exports of critical materials like rare earths, for which the U.S. is heavily dependent. Beijing has also halted purchases of American soybeans and is actively redirecting its exports to other global markets in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. These actions demonstrate China's effort to reduce its economic reliance on the U.S. and assert its defiance against Washington's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health officials in Los Angeles County have reported the first confirmed U.S. cases of clade I mpox that appear to have been acquired locally, without any history of recent travel to affected regions. This development is a cause for concern because the clade I strain is known to be more severe and has a higher fatality rate compared to the clade II virus that caused the 2022 global outbreak. While the risk to the general public remains low, officials are urging at-risk groups to get vaccinated to control the spread.</p>
