The outcome of these trade negotiations will likely shape the narrative of Trump's first 100 days and offer insights into his future economic strategies.</p>

          <p>New polls reveal that Americans, including some Republicans, are losing faith in Donald Trump across key issues, with many describing his second term as "scary." The polls show low approval ratings for Trump's handling of the economy and immigration, with a majority believing he is not focused on the right priorities. A significant number of voters disapprove of Trump's performance, tariff policies, and workforce reductions, suggesting growing fatigue after a period of economic uncertainty and controversial deportations.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump questioned Vladimir Putin's desire for peace after meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky at Pope Francis' funeral. Trump suggested Putin might be misleading him, citing recent attacks on Ukrainian cities. The meeting, which took place against the backdrop of the funeral, may signal a potential shift in Trump's perspective on the conflict. However, Trump's mercurial nature and skepticism from some advisors mean the long-term impact remains uncertain.</p>
