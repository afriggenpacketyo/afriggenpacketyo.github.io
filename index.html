          <p>A chaotic incident in Chicago's Brighton Park neighborhood resulted in federal agents shooting a woman after their vehicles were allegedly rammed and boxed in by multiple cars. The Department of Homeland Security reported that the agents, unable to move, opened fire when they saw one of the drivers had a gun. The woman and another man now face federal charges for assaulting an officer. The event triggered tense protests at the scene, prompting DHS to deploy special operations teams to manage the crowd and restore order.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he believes hostages held in Gaza will be freed "very soon" as mediators prepare for talks in Egypt. This follows Hamas's partial agreement to a U.S. peace plan, though key issues like disarmament remain unresolved. Despite Trump's call for a halt to bombing, Israeli strikes have continued in Gaza, which officials describe as defensive measures. The upcoming negotiations are considered highly consequential for potentially ending the nearly two-year conflict and securing the release of the remaining captives.</p>

          <p>A major rescue operation is underway on the Tibetan slopes of Mount Everest after a severe snowstorm trapped approximately 1,000 climbers and hikers. Heavy snowfall, which began Friday, has caused tents to collapse and blocked access roads at high altitudes, creating a perilous situation. Chinese state media reports that local villagers and rescue teams have been deployed to clear the snow, and some tourists have already been brought to safety. The event occurs amid wider extreme weather in the region, including deadly floods in Nepal.</p>

          <p>Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia's attorney general, is facing widespread bipartisan backlash over resurfaced 2022 text messages. In the texts, Jones used inflammatory language, including a hypothetical scenario where he would shoot a Republican political opponent. Jones has since issued a public apology, expressing shame and regret for his words. The controversy has drawn condemnation from figures across the political spectrum, including his own party's gubernatorial nominee and former President Trump, making it a significant issue in the race.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that the release of hostages from Gaza is the most immediate and critical phase of the Trump administration's new peace plan. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rubio stated that upcoming talks in Cairo should focus on the logistics of the release, which must happen quickly and cannot be delayed. He acknowledged that building a stable, Hamas-free Gaza would be a longer, more complex second phase requiring significant international support. Rubio urged regional partners to pressure Hamas to ensure a swift resolution.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has defended her leadership approach, stating she will take her time to develop sound policies rather than rushing out announcements like rival parties. Speaking ahead of her party's conference, she acknowledged this patient strategy might come with a "price to pay" in opinion polls but insisted it would be beneficial in the long run. Badenoch also outlined a plan to remove 750,000 illegal migrants, asserting that those who enter the UK without permission should be sent back, framing her method as a necessary departure from past political missteps.</p>

          <p>As a federal government shutdown continues, President Trump has placed responsibility for potential widespread layoffs on Democrats. He stated that whether furloughed workers are permanently laid off is "up to them," referring to their opposition to a Republican-backed funding bill. The administration has warned that this shutdown could lead to permanent job losses, unlike previous ones where workers received back pay. This situation unfolds as the administration also prepares for a large, pre-planned deferred resignation program affecting over 100,000 federal employees.</p>

          <p>Despite a federal government shutdown, the S&P 500 reached a record high last week, but Wall Street is watching the political stalemate's duration closely. Investors are largely assuming the shutdown will be short-lived, minimizing economic damage, though the lack of government economic data like the jobs report creates uncertainty. Key events for the upcoming week include an investor day for Honeywell's spinoff, Solstice, and corporate earnings reports from major companies like PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines. This corporate commentary will be especially crucial for gauging economic health. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal, announced at the party's annual conference, would ban anyone entering the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum and would handle appeals through the Home Office instead of courts. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch stated that deportees should "go back to where they came from," with a newly empowered "Removals Force" funded by savings from closing asylum hotels.

          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the number one cause of fights among couples is not money or chores, but rather their tone of voice. He explains that nonverbal cues like a sharp tone or a sigh can turn a simple question into an accusation, carrying more emotional weight than the words themselves. The article suggests that partners can de-escalate conflicts by becoming self-aware, apologizing for harsh tones, and rephrasing their statements. When both partners are stuck in a negative loop, using a "reset phrase" can help defuse tension.</p>

Experts credit the gender-neutral vaccination strategy, which includes both boys and girls, for this success.

          <p>Bestselling author and researcher Brené Brown argues that people struggle with communication because it requires vulnerability and a willingness to endure discomfort. In a recent interview, she explained that good communication involves clarity, honesty, and taking accountability, skills that are rarely taught. Brown emphasized that tone is often lost in text messages and that difficult conversations should be handled directly. The article also provides phrases recommended by experts to navigate conflict, such as validating the other person's feelings and seeking to understand their perspective.</p>

          <p>In the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus, detectives faced a critical setback when a minivan believed to be the primary crime scene was inadvertently sold for scrap. Police allege the killer, Dr. Steven Milner, used the "burner" vehicle to abduct and kill Fandrich before it was abandoned and towed. A detective arrived at the scrapyard just in time to see a video of the van being crushed, losing a vital piece of potential forensic evidence, highlighting the challenges of tracking discarded evidence.</p>

          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections since the fall of the Assad dictatorship, but the process is indirect and complex due to the country's fragile state. Instead of a public vote, members of an "electoral college" appointed by subcommittees will choose 121 members of the new People's Assembly. The interim president will directly appoint another 70 members, a point of controversy for critics who fear it gives him too much power.

          <p>The risk premium for options, which is the difference between expected and actual market volatility, is increasing for assets ranging from stocks to gold. This trend is occurring even as implied volatility benchmarks have remained relatively stable, largely because actual market swings have been minimal, making hedging more expensive relative to the realized price action. In equities, low correlation among individual stocks has kept overall S&P 500 index volatility muted. In the oil market, a balance between supply and demand concerns has kept prices within a narrow range. (not investment advice)</p>
