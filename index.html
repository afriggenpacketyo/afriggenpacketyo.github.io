          <p>President Trump met with House Republican leaders and members of the Freedom Caucus at the White House to address the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a legislative package facing significant opposition. Republican hard-liners have expressed concerns about Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deduction caps, creating obstacles for Speaker Mike Johnson in securing enough votes for the bill's passage. Democrats have also criticized the bill, introducing an amendment to strike provisions that they claim would negatively impact healthcare and food assistance for millions of Americans. The House Rules Committee is actively debating the bill's details, with Republicans emphasizing the need to move forward for economic survival. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested an emergency injunction from the Supreme Court to halt proceedings in a Freedom of Information Act case involving the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) sued DOGE earlier this year to gain public access to its records and government overhaul plans. The administration argues that DOGE, as a presidential advisory board, is not subject to FOIA, citing executive privilege.

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The price of Bitcoin reached as high as $109,500, with cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking its price exceeding $40 billion. Upcoming regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments are expected to further drive prices higher, with the number of bitcoins held by public companies growing significantly this year. The Senate is also advancing legislation to create the first regulatory framework in the U.S. for stablecoins. </p>

          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) services have surged in popularity, offering consumers the ability to split purchases into smaller payments, often without interest. However, missed payments can lead to debt collection efforts, similar to traditional credit arrangements. BNPL providers may attempt in-house collection before outsourcing or selling the debt to third-party agencies, which can impact credit scores. Consumers facing BNPL debt in collections should verify the debt, understand their rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and explore options such as negotiating a settlement or seeking debt relief. </p>

The American Heart Association reports that 7 in 10 Americans feel powerless to act during a cardiac emergency, and survival rates drop significantly without immediate CPR.

Judge Brian Murphy ordered the government to maintain custody of anyone deported to South Sudan, ensuring their return if the removals are deemed unlawful. Attorneys for the migrants allege that at least two individuals were improperly deported to South Sudan, despite having orders of removal to their home countries. The U.S. State Department advises against travel to South Sudan due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict. </p>

Stevens seeks to promote his religion, the "Ministry of Chaz the Bropostle and his Bro-Minions," with the motto "Satan loves the First Amendment." He argues for either equal representation of all religions or the removal of all religious banners to maintain separation of church and state. </p>

          <p>The United States and Italy have formalized an agreement aimed at enhancing the recovery efforts for American soldiers missing in action during World War II. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) and Italy's culture ministry signed the pact, focusing on locating and recovering remains in Italy, a site of intense battles during the war. The agreement also emphasizes the protection of archaeological sites involved in the search. Roughly 72,000 American servicemembers remain unaccounted for from World War II worldwide, with forensic experts using DNA and other records to identify remains. </p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of Congressional representatives is advocating for a streamlined visa processing system to ensure international visitors can attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Concerns have been raised that proposed cost-cutting measures by Secretary of State Marco Rubio could hinder visa processing and reduce attendance. The 2026 World Cup is expected to generate significant economic activity, particularly in Southern California, but success depends on efficient visa processing for spectators, athletes, and media. The representatives emphasize that the U.S. has an obligation to put its best foot forward as the host of these games. </p>

          <p>A recent inflation surprise suggests the economic outlook could be more challenging than anticipated. Higher energy and water bills, coupled with rising food and service prices, have contributed to the highest inflation rate in a year. Economists predict inflation could inch up further over the next few months, potentially influencing the Bank of England's interest rate decisions. However, factors such as the US President Donald Trump's trade war and potential deals with the EU could help bring inflation down. This economic uncertainty is acknowledged as painful for households, especially those whose incomes aren't keeping pace. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Sections of the roof collapsed, narrowly missing a number of people. The Drum Tower - reportedly the largest in China - was built in 1375 during the Ming Dynasty but had undergone an extensive rebuild in 1995.
