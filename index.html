          <p>President Trump is seeking a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, despite opposition from some Republicans. He insists Iran must halt uranium enrichment, while Iran maintains its right to enrichment for civilian purposes. Negotiations are ongoing, led by Steve Witkoff, with potential solutions including a long-term freeze on Iranian enrichment and phased removal of sanctions. The outcome will test the Republican Party's stance on Iran. Optimism score is at a 50.</p>
