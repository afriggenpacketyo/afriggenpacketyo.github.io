          <p>Massive youth-led protests, organized under the banner of 'Gen Z,' have erupted across Nepal, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The unrest was initially sparked by a government ban on popular social media platforms but quickly evolved to encompass widespread frustration over government corruption. Protests turned violent, with demonstrators clashing with police, resulting in at least 22 deaths and significant damage to government buildings. Despite the prime minister stepping down and the social media ban being repealed, the country faces an uncertain political future as the leaderless movement continues to demand systemic reforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) fell by 0.4% year-on-year in August, indicating a return to deflationary territory and highlighting persistent economic challenges. The drop was steeper than market expectations and points to weak domestic demand and industrial oversupply weighing on the economy. Concurrently, the producer price index (PPI), which measures factory-gate prices, contracted for the 35th consecutive month, falling by 2.9%. These figures underscore the entrenched deflationary pressures facing Beijing as it struggles to stimulate economic growth and consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A plan to distribute the remaining £25 million fortune of the disbanded Jesus Army cult is generating significant controversy, as individuals accused of child abuse are among the potential beneficiaries. Survivors of the sect, who previously received compensation from a much smaller redress scheme, have expressed disgust that their alleged abusers could receive substantially larger payouts. The trust overseeing the dissolution of the cult's assets states it is legally bound by its trust deed, but critics and former members are calling the proposal unjust. The situation highlights the ongoing struggle for accountability and fair compensation for victims of the abusive organization.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement to resume cooperation, which includes restarting inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, announced after a meeting in Cairo, is seen as a crucial step toward de-escalation, though details remain limited. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi called it "a step in the right direction," while Iran's foreign minister warned the agreement would be terminated if hostile acts, such as the reimposition of UN sanctions, occur. This development comes amid heightened tensions after Western nations threatened new sanctions over Iran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai reveals that a record 47% of U.S. businesses have redirected investments originally planned for China to other regions over the past year. The primary beneficiary of this shift has been Southeast Asia, followed by the Indian subcontinent, as companies navigate ongoing trade tensions and increasing competition within the Chinese market. This trend reflects declining confidence in the five-year business outlook in China, which has hit a record low for the fourth consecutive year.

          <p>President Trump stated he was "not thrilled" and "very unhappy" following an Israeli military strike that targeted senior Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar. The operation, which Israel took full responsibility for, has placed the Trump administration in a delicate position, as both Israel and Qatar are key U.S. allies. While condemning the location of the attack, Trump reiterated his commitment to securing the release of hostages held by Hamas. The White House confirmed it was notified of the strike just before it occurred but was not involved in its planning, highlighting the unilateral nature of the Israeli action.</p>

This proposal escalates the administration's use of secondary sanctions to isolate Russia's economy, targeting major trading partners that have helped sustain Moscow's energy revenues since the conflict began.

The report highlights a "double burden of malnutrition" where obesity and undernutrition coexist, even in poorer nations.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed scrapping the £100 limit on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions via tapping a card. If approved, the change would empower banks and card providers to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move reflects the growing consumer preference for contactless methods, it has raised concerns about fraud and theft. The FCA stated that providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would only permit higher-value payments for transactions deemed low-risk.</p>

          <h2>Apple's New iPhone Air Faces Potential Launch Delays in China Due to eSIM Technology</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's newly unveiled, ultra-thin iPhone Air may face a limited or staggered launch in mainland China due to its adoption of eSIM technology, which replaces physical SIM cards. Currently, only one of China's three major telecom carriers supports eSIMs, and broader regulatory approval is still pending. This technological shift, which allows for thinner devices and easier carrier switching, could create an opening for domestic competitors in one of Apple's most important markets. Analysts suggest Chinese regulators may be proceeding cautiously to avoid disrupting the business models of state-owned telecommunication companies.</p>

          <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is facing growing accusations of authoritarianism as his government continues a crackdown on political opponents, particularly members of the main opposition party, CHP. The arrest of Istanbul's popular mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, on corruption charges that supporters call politically motivated, has sparked widespread protests. Critics argue that Erdoğan is weaponizing the courts to eliminate rivals and consolidate power, turning Turkey into a "Russia-style autocracy." Despite international concern, analysts suggest Erdoğan feels empowered by his key geopolitical role and a lack of pressure from global leaders.</p>

          <p>A top UK planning lawyer has submitted a legal opinion arguing it would be "unlawful" for the government to approve China's plan for a new "mega embassy" near the Tower of London. The challenge, commissioned by local residents, focuses on China's refusal to provide unredacted floor plans, obscuring the intended use of certain rooms. Opponents fear these spaces could be used to interrogate dissidents, while the lawyer argues that planning permission cannot be granted without a full assessment. The legal opinion also highlights security risks related to diplomatic immunity in publicly accessible areas of the proposed site.</p>

          <p>The British horse racing industry is staging a one-day strike, with no fixtures scheduled, to protest a proposed government tax increase on betting. Industry leaders, organized under the British Horseracing Authority (BHA), warn that raising the tax rate could cost the sport millions in revenue and lead to significant job losses. They argue that increased costs for bookmakers would result in less promotion, worse odds for customers, and a potential shift to unregulated black-market betting. The unprecedented strike aims to lobby Members of Parliament and highlight the economic importance of the sport ahead of the government's budget announcement.</p>

          <p>China's largest government-backed research fund is now accepting applications for studies on stablecoins and their cross-border monitoring, signaling Beijing's increasing interest in the digital asset class. The National Natural Science Foundation of China will provide grants for research aimed at developing policy suggestions on how the country should manage the challenges posed by global stablecoins. This move indicates a strategic, albeit cautious, approach from Beijing, which has otherwise maintained a strict ban on decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin since 2021 due to concerns over financial stability and capital flight.</p>

          <p>Despite a general slowdown in corporate share repurchases, investors are continuing to reward companies that aggressively buy back their own stock, according to market analysis. This strategy can provide an edge, as consistent buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can boost earnings per share and signal management's confidence in the company's future. Companies with a long history of reducing their share count, dubbed "buyback aristocrats," have shown a tendency to outperform, particularly when the broader economy is slowing down.

          <p>The conservative majority of the Supreme Court has allowed a lower court ruling to be overturned, effectively permitting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to use racial and ethnic profiling as a basis for stopping and detaining individuals. The case, originating from Los Angeles, concerned whether agents could detain people based on factors like their apparent race, speaking Spanish, or being in a location known for day laborers. This decision removes a previous injunction that had barred ICE from making such stops, raising significant concerns among civil rights advocates about the erosion of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>

          <p>Senator Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona, is introducing legislation to prevent the Pentagon from granting full military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The Pentagon recently reversed its initial denial of the honor after lobbying from a conservative legal group. Gallego, a Marine veteran, argues that Babbitt's actions constituted an attempt to overthrow the government, making her ineligible for an honor reserved for those who defend the Constitution. His resolution aims to force a vote and put lawmakers on record regarding whether they support honoring an individual involved in the insurrection.</p>
