          <p>A Russian drone attack on Kyiv resulted in the deaths of two people, including a one-year-old baby, and injured 13 others, according to local officials. The attack caused partial destruction and fires in multi-story residential buildings in the Svyatoshynkyi and Darnytskyi districts, with officials asserting that Russia deliberately targeted civilian facilities. Russia has not commented on the strikes but claimed to have intercepted 69 Ukrainian drones in various Russian regions. The attack occurred amidst heightened warnings from Vladimir Putin against Western aid to Ukraine, with Russia controlling about 20% of Ukrainian territory. This article underscores the ongoing conflict's impact on civilian populations and infrastructure. Optimism is low considering the tragic loss of life. </p>

The winning ticketholders can choose between a lump sum cash payment of $410.3 million or $893.5 million spread out over 30 annual payments. The odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 24.9. The odds were not in their favor, but these two ticket holders will now share a massive jackpot.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how world leaders who have tried to gain favor with Donald Trump have often been met with disappointment, citing examples such as Narendra Modi, Emmanuel Macron, and Ursula von der Leyen. The author argues that Trump's relationships are personal and impermanent, contrasting this with typical state relationships based on power, policy, and strategic interests. The piece suggests that resistance, not grovelling, is the best way to handle Trump, referencing the approaches of Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The author urges Keir Starmer to reconsider his approach to Trump ahead of a state visit, advocating for a firm stance based on values rather than subservience.</p>

          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy is embarking on his first major tour in 45 years, called "The Road to Us Tour," which will span 50 cities. Cassidy, the son of Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, rose to fame in the 1970s as a pop star and actor, but stepped away from the spotlight to focus on writing and producing for television. In preparation for the tour, Cassidy has been relearning his old hits and taking guitar lessons, opting to play bass instead of guitar. He expresses that the songs feel new to him, and he feels he can sing better now than when he was 20 because he has not burned out his voice.</p>

Despite a late comeback attempt led by quarterback Nico Iamaleava, an interception in the final minute sealed the Bruins' fate, marking UNLV's first win against a Big Ten team since 2003. The loss increases the pressure on UCLA coach DeShaun Foster early in his second season, raising questions about the team's ability to improve.

          <p>A US-China research team has developed a method to launch millimeter-scale robots using the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form vapor bubbles that collapse and release energy. This energy creates a force strong enough to launch the small jumpers 1.5 meters into the air. By controlling the light, scientists can manipulate the launch and even make the materials swim.

          <p>Reform UK is attempting to promote its lesser-known politicians, aiming to increase its presence in councils and parliaments. The party's conference provided an opportunity for hopefuls like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson to gain prominence. However, Nigel Farage remains the party's most recognizable figure, and the party may appoint new peers to key roles in the government. The party is actively seeking 5,000 vetted candidates for upcoming elections, emphasizing a more rigorous selection process to avoid past scandals.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier, advocates for greater recognition and support for women veterans who served in dangerous front-line roles. She co-founded Sisters in Service, a community interest company that supports female military veterans working in healthcare. Bennett believes women face unique challenges due to misconceptions about their military experiences and often avoid traditional veteran spaces. The network provides a supportive community for women to connect and share their experiences, addressing the isolation they may feel after leaving the Armed Forces.</p>

          <p>Mount Sinai, revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is undergoing a transformation into a luxury mega-resort, sparking controversy over its impact on the sacred site and the local Bedouin community. The Great Transfiguration Project includes luxury hotels, villas, and shopping bazaars, raising concerns about the preservation of the UNESCO World Heritage site. The Bedouin Jebeleya tribe has reportedly had their homes and tourist eco-camps demolished with little compensation. Critics argue that the development is imposed on the Bedouin against their will, prioritizing outside interests over the local community.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a new immigration enforcement operation in Massachusetts, targeting immigrants who have been released from custody despite ICE agents' attempts to apprehend them. The operation, dubbed Patriot 2.0, is expected to last several weeks and involves an unspecified number of federal officers. The crackdown has heightened tensions between the administration and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who defends her city's sanctuary policies. The administration's actions are part of a broader effort to target "sanctuary cities" and increase deportations.</p>
