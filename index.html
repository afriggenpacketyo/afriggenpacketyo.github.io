            <p>Small businesses and consumers in Gainesville, Florida, are reacting to President Trump's recently announced tariffs, which include a baseline 10% tariff on nearly every country. While some residents support the tariffs, echoing Trump's message of making America great again, others express concerns about rising prices and potential economic recession. Local businesses, like Sweetwater Organic Coffee Company, anticipate having to raise prices due to increased costs on imported goods. The tariffs are expected to impact household goods, clothing, electronics, and groceries, potentially costing the average U.S. household $3,800 annually.</p>

The Secretary outlined plans to expand market access, hold trading partners accountable, and address the needs of farmers and ranchers at home. The USDA is canceling contracts and grants that don't align with their mission, providing emergency assistance, and working to ease burdens on pork and poultry industries.

            <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Sens. Maria Cantwell and Chuck Grassley, has introduced legislation to limit the president's power to impose tariffs. The bill would require the president to notify Congress of impending tariffs within 48 hours, with Congress having 60 days to approve the action. Sen. Cantwell argues that President Trump has misused his authority on trade, costing consumers money and harming their 401(k) savings. The president has threatened to veto the bill, but Cantwell believes there is a path to passage due to growing constituent concerns about the economic impact of the tariffs.

At 78, Trump is the oldest president to begin a second term, raising public interest in his health and cognitive abilities. While presidents have access to excellent medical care, they are not required to disclose their medical records. In the past, Trump has released limited information, including a doctor's letter stating his cognitive exams were exceptional.

The hatchlings are offspring of a pair of Western Santa Cruz Galápagos tortoises, with the mother considered one of the most genetically valuable tortoises in the Association of Zoos and Aquarium's Species Survival Plan. While the birth of these tortoises may not significantly impact the total population, it raises awareness about the species' conservation and the threats they face, including habitat loss and invasive species.

This unit runs the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program, providing free access to care for roughly 50,000 miners. The program's elimination raises concerns about the monitoring and prevention of Black Lung Disease, especially as miners increasingly work in mines with sandstone, which generates dust more harmful to lungs.

            <p>NPR delves into the history of the word "tariff," tracing its origins from Latin and Arabic roots to its modern-day usage in trade policy. The article explains that the word, meaning "a schedule of duties imposed by a government on imported or exported goods," has been central to U.S. trade policy since the country's founding. It explores how the meaning of the word may be evolving under President Trump, who uses it to describe country-specific taxes and as a general term for economic punishment, rather than simply a rate of tax.</p>

Trump believes tariffs will boost the U.S. economy by encouraging consumers to buy American-made goods and reducing the trade deficit. However, economists warn that tariffs could harm the world economy and increase prices for U.S. consumers.

            <p>Federal prosecutors say Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump, also tried to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to shoot down Trump's plane. Routh allegedly sought to purchase the weapon online from an associate he believed to be a Ukrainian with access to military weapons. Routh is suspected of hiding near Trump International with a gun in September 2024. Routh's attorneys have asked a judge to suppress statements from the eyewitness who identified him as the suspect.</p>

            <p>India's central bank has cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6% to boost slowing growth, marking its lowest level since September 2022. The rate cut comes as new U.S. tariffs on goods from India take effect. The Reserve Bank of India noted that tariffs have increased uncertainties clouding the economic outlook across regions. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said the central bank will shift its stance to accommodative, aiming to stimulate the economy through softer interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Sky News analyzes whether Trump's tariffs could tip the world into recession, with stock markets tumbling and economists raising alarm bells.

While there are no signs of recession currently, the uncertainty caused by the tariffs has the potential to cause the most damage. The article explores what a global recession could mean and how the UK could best prepare for potential economic downturn.</p>
