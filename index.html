          <p>Denmark's foreign minister has summoned the top U.S. diplomat after reports alleged that individuals connected to former President Trump are conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. The national broadcaster DR claimed these operations aim to undermine Greenland's relationship with Denmark and foster a secession movement, aligning with Trump's past interest in purchasing the strategically vital Arctic territory. Danish authorities emphasized that any external interference in the kingdom's internal affairs is unacceptable, while the U.S. embassy and State Department have not yet commented on the serious allegations.</p>

          <p>Google faces a landmark federal ruling that could dismantle its lucrative default search contracts, potentially jeopardizing over $26 billion annually, including a $20 billion deal with Apple. While this poses an immediate financial risk, some analysts believe it could ultimately benefit Google by freeing up capital to accelerate its generative AI and cloud investments, positioning it for significant future growth. The Justice Department is also advocating for restrictions on exclusive AI distribution deals and mandates for search data sharing, shaping the future competitive landscape of the tech giant.

Experts recommend calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center or loan servicers during off-peak hours and utilizing non-profit resources for navigating complex repayment and forgiveness programs.</p>

          <p>India is bracing for a significant economic shock as President Trump's administration implements steep 50% tariffs on a wide array of Indian products. This measure, imposed due to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, is projected to impact $48.2 billion worth of exports, potentially leading to widespread job losses and slower economic growth in labor-intensive sectors. In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is urging national self-reliance and plans to introduce tax cuts to boost domestic consumption. The tariffs have also led to the cancellation of bilateral trade talks, intensifying economic pressures on India. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Rhode Island Special Assistant Attorney General, Devon Flanagan, has been placed on six months of unpaid leave following her arrest for trespassing, during which body camera footage captured her threatening police officers. Flanagan repeatedly invoked her position as an "AG" and warned an officer he would "regret this" for arresting her outside a restaurant. Attorney General Peter Neronha publicly condemned her actions, emphasizing that such conduct falls far below the expected professional and personal standards for his attorneys. Flanagan has since sent apology letters to the officers involved.</p>

          <p>Commercial real estate activity is showing nascent signs of recovery, with JLL's global Bid Intensity Index recording its first improvement in July since December. This index, a key indicator of market liquidity and competitiveness, points to increasing capital inflows and stabilizing bidder dynamics. The positive shift is underpinned by resilient property sector fundamentals and stable asset valuations, despite earlier economic uncertainties. Experts anticipate a gradual market recovery throughout the latter half of the year, driven by stabilizing borrowing costs and a renewed appetite from institutional investors across various property sectors.

          <p>Miriam Toews' new memoir, "A Truce That Is Not Peace," deeply explores her motivations for writing, which are inextricably linked to processing the profound grief and guilt from the suicides of her father and sister. The article highlights Toews' career-long endeavor to channel personal tragedies into her literary work, both fiction and nonfiction. Drawing inspiration from Christian Wiman's concept of finding a "truce" with memories rather than seeking "closure," Toews offers a raw and candid meditation on navigating life after devastating loss, finding a way to "hold on" through her writing.</p>

          <p>Kinloch Castle, a vacant and dilapidated Victorian-era hunting lodge on Scotland's remote Isle of Rum, has been re-listed for sale with offers starting over £750,000, after a previous bid failed due to a dispute. Owned by Scottish government agency NatureScot, the property requires extensive restoration. NatureScot is seeking a buyer who will commit to supporting the island's small community and its natural environment. Islanders largely favor the sale for redevelopment, provided there is active community involvement and respect for land access rights, aiming to revitalize this historically significant landmark.</p>

          <p>A former neo-Nazi leader, now identifying as Marla-Svenja Liebich, has legally changed her gender under Germany's new Self-Determination Act, sparking controversy and accusations of abusing the law to secure a placement in a women's prison. Convicted of incitement to racial hatred, Liebich was ordered to serve an 18-month sentence. This case has prompted Germany's new conservative-led government to consider reevaluating the Self-Determination Act, which was designed to simplify gender changes for trans and non-binary individuals. Activists strongly condemn calls to amend the law as "populist and appalling."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a stark warning to 46 U.S. states and territories, threatening to withhold federal funding for sex education programs unless they eliminate all references to transgender people and "gender ideology" from their curriculums within 60 days. This directive follows the recent termination of a multi-million dollar grant to California for non-compliance. The Administration for Children and Families stated that federal funds would not be used to "poison the minds of the next generation."

The team's struggles, characterized by defensive vulnerabilities and a perceived lack of midfield strength, have been a persistent concern since Potter's arrival, contributing to one of the worst win percentages among Premier League managers. Issues stemming from recruitment post-Declan Rice's departure and internal discord between management are cited as significant contributing factors.
