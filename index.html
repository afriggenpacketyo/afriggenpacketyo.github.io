          <p>Former President Trump withdrew Jared Isaacman's nomination to lead NASA, citing a review of prior associations. Isaacman, a private astronaut with ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX, was initially tapped to head the agency. Trump stated he would announce a new nominee aligned with his "America First" agenda for space exploration, particularly focusing on planting the American flag on Mars. Musk expressed his support for Isaacman, describing him as competent and good-hearted, while Isaacman himself had previously voiced his commitment to advancing humanity's spacefaring capabilities under Trump's leadership.</p>

          <p>Following the death of actor George Wendt, an incident from John Boehner's first congressional race in 1990 has resurfaced, linking the Cheers star to Ohio politics. Wendt, during an appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show, mistakenly conflated Boehner with another candidate embroiled in a scandal, making defamatory statements on national television. Boehner's team responded, accusing Wendt of being misinformed, but Boehner ultimately won the election despite the gaffe. Boehner later stated that Wendt apologized for the incident and that they had a great conversation, remembering him fondly as Norm.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying them overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported 250 million bees escaped but corrected the number after consulting with a beekeeper. The public was advised to avoid the area, while beekeepers worked to recover the hives and save as many bees as possible. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee, and hive boxes from the overturned truck were recovered, restored, and returned to use.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital trip to the edge of space, marking the company's twelfth crewed flight. The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and enjoyed views of space before returning to Earth.

Blue Origin has now launched 68 passengers since its first crewed flight in July 2021, and while the cost per seat is not revealed, it is estimated to be upwards of $500,000.</p>

          <p>Concerns are growing about the future of Hollywood's film and TV industry in California, particularly after the 2023 strikes led to significant job losses. Television production in Los Angeles has decreased by 58% since 2021, with many productions moving to states and countries offering better tax incentives. Governor Newsom proposes more than doubling the state's film and TV tax credits, but some industry experts believe it may be too late to offset the high cost of working in California. Many in Hollywood are struggling to find work, with some even applying for jobs outside the industry.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces tough choices as it finalizes spending plans, with health spending impacting cuts to other areas. Increased funding for transport, net zero, hospitals, schools, and prisons in 2024 will not continue, given the government's commitments. The Spending Review on June 11 will scrutinize government spending, with concerns that plans to increase police numbers and cap bus fares may be underfunded. Chancellor Rachel Reeves' stance on borrowing and taxes has led to speculation about spending cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artists are increasingly using their work to influence climate change policy and make direct interventions in environmental issues. Organizations like the United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC) recognize the essential role of the arts in shaping environmental governance. Artists like Maja Petric aim to evoke the feeling of experiencing pristine nature through light installations, while others remind society of what might be lost due to environmental risk. Art can bridge the gap in understanding climate change by helping people comprehend challenging concepts and imagine alternative futures.</p>

          <p>The US has sent Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal, following a report by the UN nuclear watchdog that Iran has increased its production of enriched uranium. The White House confirmed the proposal, with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff sending a "detailed and acceptable" plan to Iran. The IAEA report stated that Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade levels, which has raised concerns internationally. Iran insists its program is peaceful, while the US maintains that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) is preparing for a leadership election in September but faces a mass-recall campaign by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The recall campaign threatens the KMT's legislative majority and could disrupt the leadership transition. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan indicated he would step down and suggested Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor. The KMT plans to announce the party chair race in July and install a new leader by October, hoping to regain power after years on the political sidelines.</p>

This adaptability reassures swing voters that anything extreme is provisional, as he tests limits but is generally willing to pull back. Trump's recent adjustments on China tariffs, separation from Elon Musk, and complaints about Vladimir Putin have helped his poll numbers recover. This pattern of checking himself and being checked by others is what an important group of voters expect from his presidency.</p>
