        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Protests occurred in multiple UK cities, including London, Manchester, and Bristol, against the government's decision to proscribe the pro-Palestine activist group, Palestine Action, as a terrorist organization. The ban, which criminalizes support for the group, followed a break-in at an RAF base. Police arrested nearly 100 people nationwide, many for displaying placards that read "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action." The demonstrations took place ahead of a High Court challenge to the ban filed by the group's co-founder. Many of those arrested were reportedly elderly individuals participating in the peaceful protests.</p>

          <h2>Bristol Palin Discusses Sudden Onset of Facial Paralysis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 12:32:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bristol Palin has provided an update on her experience with facial paralysis, stating the condition occurred suddenly without any prior warning signs or illness. In an online Q&A, she explained that she woke up one morning to find the left side of her face paralyzed. While doctors have not determined a definitive cause, they suggested it could be a case of Bell's palsy potentially triggered by stress. Palin noted that her face has regained about 70% of its normal function and that her doctor anticipates a full recovery could take another three months, though she admits she finds it difficult to look at photos of herself currently.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced criticism of the R&A's inconsistent enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open Championship. Both golfers were warned about their pace during the third round, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. DeChambeau described the pace in the first two rounds as "out of control," while Stenson expressed frustration after his group was warned for being just a few minutes over the allotted time. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player, arguing it would be fairer and more transparent for everyone involved in the tournament.</p>

The activists engage in conversations about love, relationships, and the negative impacts of social media, framing chastity not as mere abstinence but as a way to foster deeper, more meaningful connections. The piece explores the challenges they face in a culture of hedonism and how they adapt their message for Gen Z, a generation that is having less sex but is also largely secular.

          <p>Ahead of Japan's House of Councilors election, far-right parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

While Japan faces significant labor shortages due to a declining birthrate, these groups advocate against relying on foreign workers and promote a "Japanese First" agenda. This political strategy mirrors populist movements in the U.S. and Europe, tapping into economic anxieties and blaming societal problems on outsiders.</p>

The report found that serious safety concerns, such as workers feeling vibrations, were raised long before the collapse, but work continued. The minister called for criminal accountability for the negligence, as many survivors continue to face trauma and financial hardship. A police investigation is currently underway.</p>

The June consumer price index showed core inflation slightly below expectations, though shelter costs remain elevated. Key earnings reports from companies like Goldman Sachs were strong, while others like Abbott Labs disappointed on guidance but maintained analyst support. The article suggests that early reactions to earnings can be misleading, as stocks like Wells Fargo and BlackRock recovered after initial sell-offs, indicating a complex but manageable economic environment.

It compiles several articles that explore the theme from different angles. One piece discusses the personal realization that a vacation cannot fundamentally change who a person is, while another examines the trend of multi-generational travel and the discoveries it can bring about relatives. A third article offers practical rules for a happier vacation, such as planning ahead and avoiding social media posting. The collection presents a nuanced view of traveling with loved ones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump addressed the growing pressure to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that unsealing grand jury transcripts would not satisfy "troublemakers and radical left lunatics." This statement follows his recent request to the Department of Justice to produce all pertinent grand jury testimony from the criminal cases of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell for court-approved release. The president's comments on social media suggest the pressure campaign from critics, including some supporters, is ongoing. The move comes as Trump is also suing Rupert Murdoch over a Wall Street Journal article concerning a letter allegedly sent to Epstein.</p>

          <p>A federal filing reveals that Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, identified itself as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This designation, which can provide preferential access to federal contracts, is for companies majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The filing was made in April, shortly before a funding round valued Neuralink at $9 billion. A company spokesperson stated the box on the form was checked erroneously and has since been corrected, adding that Neuralink has never applied for or received any federal benefits.</p>

The project has been a source of concern for India, as the river flows downstream into its territory, where it is known as the Brahmaputra. Beijing first revealed its plans for the dam in 2020 as part of its five-year plan to harness the hydropower potential of the Tibetan Plateau, with the plan receiving final approval last December.</p>

          <p>Economists are evaluating the effects of President Trump's tariff policies, noting both some successes and significant risks. The tariffs have generated higher-than-expected tax revenue and prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, analysts caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and could be reversed due to policy fluctuations and legal challenges. A primary concern is that the tariffs are starting to increase consumer prices for certain imported goods, which could fuel inflation, hurt consumers, and potentially disrupt the broader economy if the Federal Reserve is forced to keep interest rates elevated.

          <p>Legal and policy experts are weighing the significant ramifications should President Trump attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Such a move would likely trigger a complex and unprecedented legal battle, as the legal standard for removing a Fed chair requires "cause," a term open to interpretation. Beyond the courtroom, the action could destabilize financial markets and the economy, potentially undermining the Fed's independence and credibility. Some analysts speculate that Trump's threats may be a political strategy to create a scapegoat for any future economic downturn rather than a plan he intends to execute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire and author Scott Galloway argues that "follow your passion" is the worst career advice, often given by those who are already wealthy. Instead, he advises people to find the intersection of what they are good at and what can be financially lucrative. Galloway, who came from a modest background, emphasizes that success comes from enduring rejection and pivoting based on one's actual skills and opportunities, not just blind passion. This sentiment is echoed by Mastercard's CEO, who suggests people should focus on what differentiates them and combine that with their passions to build a successful career.</p>

          <p>This article explores the resurgence of tanning, linking its comeback not just to aesthetics but to a broader ideology skeptical of mainstream health guidance. It notes the pro-sun stance of figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and wellness influencers who question the dangers of sun exposure and the benefits of sunscreen. This perspective aligns with a conspiracist mistrust of institutions like the FDA and "Big Pharma." The trend is visible in pop culture, with celebrities showcasing tans and social media trends glorifying sunburns, despite the well-documented risks of skin cancer and premature aging.</p>
