          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the first G7 nation to take this step. The decision, intended to be formalized at the UN General Assembly, aims to advance a two-state solution and address the urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The move has been welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israel, with the U.S. also expressing its rejection of the plan. This development occurs amid growing international pressure on Israel regarding the ongoing conflict and its impact on civilians.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its "sanctuary city" laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The legal action follows a recent high-profile crime allegedly involving undocumented immigrants and heightened rhetoric from federal officials promising to increase enforcement in such jurisdictions. City officials defend the policies as essential for public safety by ensuring all residents feel secure reporting crimes, while the DOJ argues they obstruct federal law. The suit targets several city leaders and policies that hinder ICE operations.</p>

          <p>A rescue operation is in progress in northern British Columbia, Canada, to free three miners trapped underground following a mine collapse. The workers are located in a refuge chamber with sufficient air, food, and water, but communication was lost after a second cave-in occurred. The mining company, Newmont, is using specialized drones and remote-controlled equipment to assess the debris and plan a safe extraction. The incident occurred at the Red Chris copper and gold mine, where production has been suspended during the rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>Three former Department of Justice officials have filed a lawsuit against the Attorney General, challenging their recent terminations which they claim were arbitrary and unlawful. The plaintiffs, including a veteran prosecutor who worked on January 6th cases, argue that they were fired without cause via brief memos citing presidential authority, violating standard civil service protections. They are seeking immediate reinstatement and back pay, asserting that the firings bypassed proper procedures. The suit highlights a broader wave of dismissals within the DOJ under the current administration.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has, for the first time, directly observed quantum friction between solid surfaces using folded graphene. Their findings, published in Nature Communications, revealed a counterintuitive effect where thicker folds of the material sometimes slid more easily. This phenomenon is attributed to changes in electron movement within the bent material, which reduces the conversion of motion into heat. The discovery could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient nanodevices with minimal wear and tear.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a new program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to immigrant parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing immigration raids. The initiative aims to support vulnerable members of its community, whom the Archbishop described as hardworking contributors now living in fear. The program leverages existing parish networks developed during the COVID-19 pandemic and is funded by donations, including from businessman Rick Caruso. This response comes as thousands of undocumented immigrants have been arrested in the area recently.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, pop star and actress Renée Rapp reflected on her reputation for giving unfiltered and candid answers, a style that has made her a media sensation. She admitted that while she finds standard media training "boring," the intense scrutiny of her personality has sometimes made her feel insecure. Rapp also discussed the pressures of her career, including being overworked and depressed while creating her upcoming second album, "Bite Me." The album's lead single, "Leave Me Alone," was born from the frustration of these professional demands.</p>

          <p>Four traders convicted of rigging the Libor inter-bank lending rate are now appealing to have their convictions overturned. The move follows a UK Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, in a landmark ruling. The four individuals were convicted as part of a Serious Fraud Office investigation into interest rate manipulation linked to the 2008 financial crisis. Their appeal is expected to be more straightforward due to the new legal precedent set by the Supreme Court's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced another bout of severe flash flooding on Thursday due to heavy rainfall, leading to road closures and multiple water rescues. The area is particularly vulnerable to flooding because past wildfires have stripped the surrounding mountainsides of vegetation, preventing the ground from absorbing the rain. This event comes less than three weeks after a massive flood in the same area killed three people and damaged hundreds of homes. Residents shared videos of muddy water destroying property as authorities managed the emergency.</p>

          <p>This article observes that the 2028 Democratic presidential primary has unofficially begun, as potential candidates like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom increase their media appearances on non-traditional platforms. This strategy is seen as an attempt to reach a broader audience beyond the typical liberal base, a lesson learned from the 2024 election. These hopefuls are also beginning to shift their rhetoric, with some taking more moderate stances on cultural issues to appeal to a wider electorate. This activity signals a course correction and an effort to redefine the party's image.</p>

          <p>Finnish Lapland, home to Santa Claus Village, is experiencing a record-breaking heatwave with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for an unprecedented number of days. Scientists attribute the exceptional heat to the accelerating effects of climate change in the Arctic, which is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. The extreme weather is causing distress for local reindeer, who are fleeing to roads to escape insects, and baffling tourists who came expecting cool weather. The event has renewed concerns about the long-term environmental stability of the region.</p>

The FCC's sole Democratic commissioner dissented, calling the deal a blow to press freedom linked to political capitulation.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies are not over-investing in artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and reduced spending would signal a lack of belief in one's ability to win. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditure as evidence, Cramer believes the investments are both urgent and necessary for future profitability. He suggests the company that develops the most accurate AI will secure a near-monopoly and massive profits. (not investment advice)</p>
