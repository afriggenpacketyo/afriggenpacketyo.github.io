            <p>Several colleges across the United States, including Harvard, UCLA, and Stanford, are reporting that international students have had their visas revoked, with over 300 student visas revoked nationwide since the beginning of Trump's second term. These revocations appear to be targeting international students for alleged visa violations, ranging from minor infractions to participation in demonstrations, or for reasons not disclosed by the administration. Universities are actively tracking and reporting the number of students impacted by these actions, raising concerns about the targeting of international students by the Trump administration and the impact on higher education institutions across the country. This crackdown has led to confusion and anxiety among international students and universities alike.</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has voiced strong opposition to President Trump's threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on U.S. imports, stating that it will "fight to the end" to protect its interests. This response comes after Trump's warning that he would escalate tariffs if China does not withdraw the 34% tariff it imposed on American products, which was a retaliatory measure to Trump's initial tariffs. The escalating trade tensions have led to concerns about a potential trade war between the world's two largest economies, with China also implementing export curbs on rare earth elements and adding U.S. firms to its "unreliable entities list."</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods if China does not remove its 34% counter-tariff, escalating trade tensions between the two nations. This threat comes after China retaliated against Trump's decision to impose a 34% tax on Chinese imports, a move that has caused turbulence in global stock markets. The Chinese embassy in the US has accused Washington of "economic bullying," vowing to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests. The potential escalation could lead to a total rate of 104% on Chinese imports, further deepening the trade war and impacting both economies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. would begin direct engagement with Iran, starting Saturday, during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi confirmed talks were set for Saturday in Oman, but referred to them as "indirect high-level talks." The announcement occurred as new tariffs on Israel and other nations were set to take effect, with Netanyahu stating Israel would address its trade deficit with the U.S. Trump also left open the possibility that some countries could reduce their tariffs, while the White House abruptly canceled a scheduled joint news conference.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong's stock index experienced a rise at the open on Tuesday, following intervention from several Chinese state funds aimed at stabilizing the market. This intervention comes amid signs that the recent panicked sell-off in global bourses is beginning to taper off. Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China's sovereign wealth fund, has been actively purchasing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to bolster the market, which has been negatively impacted by reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S. The company expressed a positive outlook on China's capital markets and acknowledged the allocation values of A shares.</p>

Hong Kong, as a gateway between the world and mainland China, is attracting interest from diverse professionals seeking to understand China. This engagement could offer a contingency plan for Europe amid an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship, highlighting the importance of economic considerations over political strategy.</p>

This loss marks the team's third in the last four games, highlighting a concerning trend of defensive struggles. Despite a strong offensive performance from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers were unable to overcome their defensive shortcomings, underscoring the importance of fundamental play in baseball.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted President Trump the authority to continue using the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime powers law, to expedite mass deportations of alleged gang members, but with certain limitations. The 5-4 ruling stipulates that deportees must be given an opportunity to challenge their removal, clarifying that judicial review is required. While the ruling is a win for the administration, it also stipulates that the challenge must be raised in Texas, where the migrants are confined, and not in Washington DC. Rights groups have widely condemned the invocation of the Act, arguing it has only previously been used after the U.S. officially declared war.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has sided with President Trump in a 5-4 decision, allowing his administration to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport individuals, though with certain caveats. The ruling mandates that those targeted for deportation must be given notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. While the Court's decision in Trump v. J.G.G. is a win for Trump, it is not a total victory. The Court does not express an opinion on whether the Alien Enemies Act actually permits Trump to deport anyone. The decision allows deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to resume, but requires individuals to bring a “habeas” proceeding to challenge their detention.</p>

Trump offered few details about the upcoming talks, only saying the meeting will be at "almost the highest level." Netanyahu, who has frequently called the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran an existential threat to Israel, said he and Trump are united in the goal that Tehran will never get nuclear weapons. Trump said it would be in Tehran's best interests to make a deal with his administration, warning that if the talks weren't successful "it will be a very bad day for Iran."</p>

            <p>Navy Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO's military committee, was fired over the weekend by the Trump administration, U.S. officials said Monday. Although no reason was given, officials said it was apparently tied to comments she has made that supported diversity in the force. Chatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as “woke” by the conservative American Accountability Foundation. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said he was “deeply disturbed” by the firing.</p>

The decision has drawn criticism, with the mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, expressing his opposition and a local immigrant advocacy group calling for a boycott of the airline.

            <p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation to create a “turquoise alert” system for missing Native Americans in the state. The effort addresses a troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country. The “turquoise alert” system — taking its name from the blue-green mineral — will allow law enforcement to quickly share information. It will function much like “amber” and “silver” alerts that highlight the disappearance of children and the elderly. Cellphone alerts will be issued when law enforcement finds evidence of imminent danger in the disappearance of a Native American.</p>

The IRS is willing to work with taxpayers, but requires information about their circumstances. Free resources are available to help manage extensions or payment plans, such as Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites and the IRS's Direct File program. Unusual hardships may allow for an account to be placed in a "currently not collectible" status, requiring dialogue and communication with the IRS.</p>

            <p>President Trump's approach to tariffs has created a high-stakes situation, with the global economy uncertain about the outcome. While some nations are attempting to negotiate with the U.S. to avoid the tariffs, China has chosen a path of retaliation. This has led to a tense standoff and questions about whether Trump's actions are a negotiating tactic or a long-term strategy to reshape the global economy. The situation has caused market fluctuations and concern among allies, with the world awaiting the next move in this economic game of chicken. (not investment advice)</p>
