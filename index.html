          <p>China is actively working to cultivate stronger relationships with African nations, presenting itself as a more dependable ally in the face of what it characterizes as American "bullying" under President Trump. Chinese diplomats are engaging in a charm offensive, criticizing US trade policies and urging Global South countries to unite against Washington's tariffs. Experts suggest that the former Biden administration's handling of the Gaza war and Trump's "America First" agenda have created opportunities for China to expand its influence in Africa. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has emphasized China's commitment to sharing modernization opportunities with African nations, particularly in light of the ongoing trade disputes with the United States.</p>

          <p>House Judiciary Committee Democrats are investigating the Trump administration's decision to freeze funding for nearly 400 nonprofit and crime victim support groups. The probe was launched following a CBS News report detailing the funding halt, with Democrats requesting information from the Justice Department by May 19. The committee is questioning whether the cuts were influenced by Elon Musk's Department of Governmental Efficiency and seeking clarification on the criteria used to restore funding to some organizations. The affected programs include initiatives addressing hate crimes, school shootings, offender re-entry, and support for human trafficking victims, prompting protests from impacted groups in Oakland, California.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several major consumer companies, including Coca-Cola, Constellation Brands, and Colgate-Palmolive, have reported a slowdown in sales from Hispanic shoppers in North America. Executives attribute this decline to factors such as concerns about stricter immigration policies and broader economic anxieties. This shift in spending habits is significant because Hispanic consumers represent a substantial portion of the U.S. population and have historically outpaced non-Hispanic consumers in consumer packaged goods spending. Some companies are prioritizing efforts to regain the trust and spending of Hispanic consumers, while others are adjusting their financial outlooks to account for this changing demographic trend.

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to review a case concerning a Maine lawmaker who was censured for criticizing a transgender athlete on social media. The lawmaker, Laurel Libby, was stripped of her voting rights after refusing to apologize for her comments, leading to a First Amendment challenge. The case raises questions about the extent to which a legislature can sanction a member for offensive speech, especially when it impacts the representation of their constituents. The Supreme Court's decision could have significant implications for free speech rights and the ability of legislatures to discipline their members, particularly in cases involving controversial social issues.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a sharp decline after a significant surge, fueling speculation about potential pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. Despite the pullback, the Taiwan dollar remains up against the U.S. dollar for the year, while the U.S. dollar index is down. Experts suggest that the currency's volatility is driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt. While officials deny any formal currency talks with the U.S., analysts believe that exchange rates may be a topic in broader trade discussions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly concluded that the Venezuelan regime does not directly control the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, contradicting claims made by the Trump administration. The report, published by the New York Times, suggests that while Venezuela's environment allows the TdA to operate, there is no evidence of a direct policy of cooperation or control by Maduro's regime. However, the report does note that some FBI analysts believe Venezuelan officials facilitate TdA members' migration to the United States. The Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act to justify deportations of Venezuelan citizens linked to the TdA.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating trade tensions with the United States, China has reportedly refrained from aggressively de-dollarizing its economy, according to an Oxford Economics report. The report suggests that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, and it lacks viable alternatives for its foreign exchange reserves. The report also proposes that China is more likely to weaken the yuan rather than sell U.S. assets in response to trade pressures. The decision reflects a cautious approach to managing its economic interests amid ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, unexpectedly failed to secure a majority in the initial parliament vote to become chancellor, requiring 316 votes but only receiving 310. This is a significant setback for Merz, particularly after winning the federal elections and forming a coalition with the centre-left. The Bundestag will have 14 days to choose a chancellor by absolute majority, or a candidate can be elected by a simple majority. The failure is seen as a humiliation, possibly inflicted by members of the Social Democrat SPD, impacting Merz's hopes to stabilize the government and counter the far-right Alternative for Germany party.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is offering undocumented immigrants $1,000 and paid travel if they voluntarily leave the U.S., aiming to reduce deportation costs. The program relies on the CBP Home app to confirm the person's return to their home country. The administration claims this "self-deportation" is the best and safest way to leave the U.S. to avoid arrest, with those participating not prioritized for detention. The offer is also framed as a dignified route that could lead to a legal pathway back to the U.S. if they are deemed good people, if they're the kind of people that we want in our [country].</p>

          <p>President Trump is renewing his efforts to defund sanctuary cities, prompting a complex response from Democrats who are divided on how to address the issue.

          <p>President Trump's proposal for a $5,000 "baby bonus" to encourage Americans to have more children is unlikely to be effective, according to experts. While the US is seeing declining birthrates, analysts argue that the modest decline in fertility can be attributed to a drop in teen pregnancy rates, as well as more families with two working parents and delaying having children. Experts say the high costs of healthcare, childcare, housing, and basic necessities make raising a family financially challenging, outweighing the impact of a one-time payment. To truly address declining birthrates, more substantial policy changes are needed, such as affordable childcare, accessible healthcare, and paid family leave.</p>
