          <p>Kim Keon Hee, wife of former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, has been indicted on charges of corruption and bribery.

Additionally, Kim is suspected of accepting luxury gifts from the Unification Church in exchange for business favors. Her husband, Yoon Suk Yeol, was previously removed from office and arrested for declaring martial law, facing potential insurrection charges.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Friday, diverging from Wall Street trends as investors evaluated various economic data points. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix declined after Tokyo's core consumer prices rose at a slower pace in August, while South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq also fell following the indictment of the nation's former first lady. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 saw gains. The upcoming meeting between Indian Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit is also a key focus for regional relations.</p>

          <p>The US has ended its decades-old de minimis tariff exemption, which allowed goods valued at $800 or less to enter the country duty-free. As of Friday, all imports are subject to tariffs, with a six-month transition period allowing postal services to pay flat duties ranging from $80 to $200 per package based on origin. Critics argued the exemption harmed US retailers, allowed unchecked unsafe imports, and facilitated drug smuggling. Dozens of foreign postal companies, citing insufficient preparation time, have suspended parcel shipments to the US following President Trump's order to abolish the exemption.</p>

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook. This new referral alleges misrepresentations in Cook's government ethics filings regarding a Cambridge condominium mortgage and two other homes. Pulte's actions are part of President Trump's efforts to remove Cook from the Fed, citing earlier allegations of false claims on mortgage applications. Cook has, in turn, sued Trump to block her unprecedented removal from the central bank, raising legal and political tensions around the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>Investigators have revealed that Robin Westman, the attacker in the Minneapolis church school shooting, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children" and appeared to harbor general hatred, according to Police Chief Brian O'Hara. Westman killed eight-year-old Fletcher Merkel and ten-year-old Harper Moyski, injuring 18 others, before dying by suicide. The 23-year-old attacker, a former student whose mother worked at the school, left a note expressing anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish, and anti-Trump sentiments. Officials are investigating the motive, acknowledging that a definitive reason may never be known for the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal judge to bar top Trump administration officials, including Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi, from making "baseless public attacks" against their client. Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year, was recently redetained by ICE after release, facing criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented immigrants. His legal team argues that officials' public statements, labeling him an MS-13 gang member and child predator, violate his right to a fair trial. A Maryland judge has temporarily blocked his deportation as his case is reviewed.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of new video footage has found that Israel struck Nasser Hospital at least four times during its deadly attack in southern Gaza, not twice as initially reported. The assault reportedly killed at least 20 people, including five journalists, and attracted international condemnation. The analysis indicates two staircases were hit almost simultaneously in the first wave, and a later "double-tap" strike was actually two separate projectiles hitting the same spot milliseconds apart. The IDF has not acknowledged more than one strike, and international legal experts suggest potential violations of international law given the protected status of hospitals.</p>

Microsoft cited "serious violations of established company policies and our code of conduct," emphasizing that such conduct is unacceptable.

          <p>A massive Russian drone and missile attack struck Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, early Thursday, killing at least 15 people, including four children, and wounding 48 others. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the "horrific and deliberate killing of civilians," calling for new, strong sanctions against Russia. Ukraine's Air Force reported shooting down most of the nearly 600 drones and 31 missiles launched across the country, but dozens of civilian buildings were hit, including the European Union Delegation to Ukraine. The attack, the first major combined assault on Kyiv in weeks, complicates US-led peace efforts, with Western leaders accusing Putin of sabotaging peace.</p>

          <p>Robert “Bobby” Salazar, a 63-year-old Fresno restaurant owner, has been charged with arson of commercial property and arson in furtherance of a felony. Prosecutors allege Salazar hired the president of the Screamin’ Demons Motorcycle Club to set fire to his struggling Blackstone Avenue restaurant after increasing its insurance policy by $102,000. Surveillance video and a witness account, who claimed Salazar paid her and another man for the arson, led to the charges.

These "AI slop" images, often fabricated with warped historical details, are distressing survivors and families, with the Auschwitz Memorial condemning them as a "dangerous distortion." The network, primarily based in Pakistan, is gaming Facebook's system by creating high-engagement content for profit, with some accounts claiming earnings of tens of thousands of dollars.
