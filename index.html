Russian officials reported damage to an electrical substation in Rylsk following a Ukrainian attack, which allegedly injured two teenagers.

Ukraine asserted its ongoing military presence in Russia's Kursk region, which it initially entered in August 2024 to establish a buffer zone.

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty and will pay $511 million for conspiring to help wealthy Americans hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts, according to the Department of Justice. The bank admitted to falsifying records to conceal U.S. ownership and control of accounts, processing fictitious paperwork, and maintaining accounts for undeclared clients. This settlement comes after Credit Suisse previously pleaded guilty in 2014 to similar charges, paying $2.6 billion. The Senate Finance Committee had investigated Credit Suisse for ongoing tax evasion by ultra-wealthy Americans. The agreement requires Credit Suisse and UBS to cooperate with ongoing investigations and disclose information about U.S.-related accounts.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are seeking revisions to cryptocurrency legislation due to concerns about potential fraud, money laundering, and the Trump family's involvement in the crypto industry. Senator Chuck Schumer advised colleagues against supporting the GENIUS Act, citing conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's crypto business, World Liberty Financial. World Liberty recently secured a $2 billion deposit deal from an Emirati venture fund. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley have criticized the legislation, arguing it could facilitate corruption and endanger national security. The proposed bill aims to regulate stablecoins, but some Democrats fear it lacks sufficient safeguards against illicit activities.</p>

          <p>India is facing increased pressure from cheaper Chinese imports, particularly in the textiles sector, due to escalating trade tensions between China and the United States. Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods have led Chinese manufacturers to seek alternative markets, resulting in a flood of viscose yarn into India at lower prices. This influx threatens local industries, with many small spinning mills slowing production. Despite assurances from China's ambassador, concerns about dumping persist across various sectors, contributing to India's widening trade deficit with China. The Indian government has established a committee to monitor cheap imports and imposed safeguard duties on certain steel imports.</p>

          <p>A fatal plane crash in Simi Valley involving a kit-built Vans RV-10 aircraft has renewed concerns about the safety and regulation of experimental and amateur-built planes. The crash, which killed two passengers and a dog, occurred after the pilot reported control issues to air traffic control. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, which is the second involving that model in five months. Kit planes are popular due to their lower cost and customization options, but the FAA requires rigorous inspections and test flights before passengers are allowed. The article highlights the safety record of experimental aircraft and the process for obtaining certification.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order restricting federal funding for "gain-of-function" research, a controversial field involving experiments with potentially pandemic-causing pathogens. The White House stated that the order aims to prevent U.S. funding of such research in countries of concern and to enhance oversight of biological research. Supporters of the restriction cite concerns about accidental or deliberate releases of dangerous pathogens, while critics worry that it could hinder crucial research needed to prevent future pandemics. The order empowers American research agencies to identify and end federal funding of biological research that could pose a threat to American public health, public safety, or national security.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is offering undocumented immigrants $1,000 and a flight home if they willingly leave the United States, as part of a broader effort to increase deportations. This "self-deportation" program aims to persuade migrants to leave voluntarily, which officials consider more cost-effective than arrests and government-chartered flights. The money will be paid after migrants confirm their travel home through the CBP Home app. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said this approach is the "best, safest, and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest." President Trump hinted at the program in April, suggesting a possible pathway for return for those who are "good people."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to mifepristone, an abortion pill, aligning with the Biden administration's initial position. The Justice Department argued that the case, filed by conservative attorneys general from Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Northern District of Texas. This request is notable given President Trump's opposition to abortion rights. The lawsuit aims to reverse regulatory changes that expanded access to mifepristone, including allowing it to be prescribed via telemedicine and dispensed by retail pharmacies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's call for steep tariffs on movies "produced in Foreign Lands" has caused confusion and concern in Hollywood, which has already seen a decline in local production due to tax incentives and cheaper labor overseas. The proposal followed a meeting with actor Jon Voight. While some worry about the negative impact of tariffs, others suggest federal tax credits as a better solution to boost domestic film production. Industry groups have endorsed letters encouraging lawmakers to adopt manufacturing and production incentives, but there was no mention of tariffs in those letters.
