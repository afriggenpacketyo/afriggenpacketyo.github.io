          <p>A US Court of International Trade ruling challenged President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, prompting an appeal from the White House and a temporary stay from a federal appeals court. The administration argued that restricting Trump's power would undermine trade negotiations and the ability to respond to national emergencies. Trump has used tariffs as a key economic tool, but his approach has been criticized for its volatility and potential harm to consumers and businesses. Some analysts believe Trump's tariff threats are largely for negotiation leverage, but the court challenge could limit his future options.</p>

There is a reluctance among students to openly discuss political topics, especially regarding President Trump, due to potential risks of exclusion. This concern is heightened by the administration's policies affecting international students, leading to a sense that Harvard is under attack. Despite these challenges, Harvard President Alan Garber emphasized the importance of international students during a commencement speech.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled the world's first AI nuke inspector, a technology developed by researchers at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). This project aims to bolster Chinaâ€™s position in international disarmament talks, but faces hurdles such as training the AI with sensitive nuclear data and convincing military leaders of its security. The technology is built on a protocol jointly proposed by Chinese and American scientists over a decade ago. The classified nature of nuclear warheads limits the disclosure of specific data related to the project.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reorganizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership due to frustrations with arrest and deportation levels. Kenneth Genalo, head of Enforcement and Removal Operations, is retiring, and Robert Hammer, head of Homeland Security Investigations, has been reassigned. The agency aims to increase its operational tempo to meet President Trump's mandate of arresting and deporting criminal unauthorized immigrants. The White House is pushing ICE to make a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day, reflecting the administration's focus on immigration enforcement.</p>
