          <p>The village of Chimney Rock, North Carolina, is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene, which brought mudslides and flash flooding eight months prior, severely impacting homes and infrastructure. The town's remote location and unique geography are making recovery efforts slow and costly, leaving residents without running water and sanitation. Businesses, including the Chimney Rock Inn and Bubba O'Leary's General Store, remain closed, and the mayor emphasizes the stark contrast between the normalcy of nearby towns and the ongoing challenges faced by Chimney Rock. Despite the setbacks, the community remains resilient and determined to rebuild and restore the town to its former state. </p>

          <p>Khaby Lame, the popular TikTok personality, left the U.S. after being detained by immigration agents in Las Vegas for allegedly overstaying his visa. Lame, a Senegalese-Italian influencer, was detained at Harry Reid International Airport and allowed to leave without a deportation order. His departure comes amid increased immigration enforcement, and a voluntary departure allows him to avoid a deportation order on his record. Lame rose to fame during the pandemic for his silent reaction videos and has since signed partnerships with brands like Hugo Boss and was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.</p>

          <p>Serious disorder erupted for a second night in Ballymena, County Antrim, with petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds, water cannon, and riot dogs. The violence followed a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in the town, with a parked car set on fire and roads blocked. One assembly member reported that a family had to barricade themselves in their attic during the attacks, and businesses were damaged. The police described the actions as "racist thuggery," and a 29-year-old man has been charged in connection with the events.</p>

He vowed to "liberate" Los Angeles and called for those who burn the American flag to face jail time.

Despite concerns that the protests could provoke an overreach by the administration, the existence of large demonstrations indicates Trump's vulnerability. The article argues that Trump's reliance on the military to enforce his policies is a sign of his weak public support, and that peaceful protests can be effective at changing policy and public opinion.

Tesla is listed as "testing" on Austin's official website for autonomous vehicles.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has directed U.S. embassies to proceed with firing all remaining staffers at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The State Department will assume control of USAID's foreign assistance programs by the following Monday. This action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to dismantle USAID. A federal judge had temporarily blocked mass firings at federal agencies, but the administration argues this plan was already underway, so there is no violation.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth is facing increased federal scrutiny following reports on whistleblower claims regarding practices within its nursing home partnership programs. Lawmakers are raising concerns about allegations that UnitedHealth paid bonuses to nursing homes to reduce hospital transfers and used improper sales tactics to enroll residents in Medicare Advantage plans. Several investigations are being launched, with some lawmakers calling for the Department of Justice to expand its investigation into the company. UnitedHealth denies the allegations and insists its partnerships ensure better care for seniors.</p>

          <p>China's military-civilian fusion strategy, aimed at integrating military and civilian technology, is encountering challenges due to bureaucratic hurdles. Despite Beijing's efforts to encourage private sector participation in defense orders, state-owned conglomerates continue to dominate the sector. The plan, central to China's military modernization goals, has also become a focal point in the US-China rivalry, leading to sanctions on Chinese companies accused of supporting the People's Liberation Army. These sanctions pose risks for private firms involved in the fusion strategy.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for "repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities" in the occupied West Bank. The sanctions include a ban from entering the UK and a freeze on any UK-based assets. The move is part of a joint effort with Norway, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, but has been condemned by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who urges the nations to reverse the sanctions and states that the US "stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel."</p>

          <p>US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee suggested that Muslim countries should give up some of their land to create a future Palestinian state, stating that "Muslim countries have 644 times the amount of land that are controlled by Israel".

Huckabee's remarks diverge from the traditional US stance supporting a two-state solution and align with positions held by ultranationalist groups in Israel.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to swiftly block President Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. Newsom argues that Trump's action poses an imminent threat to state sovereignty, deprives the state of vital resources, and escalates tensions. Trump's lawyers have countered, asserting that the request is legally meritless and would jeopardize the safety of Homeland Security personnel. The legal battle underscores the escalating conflict between the state and federal government over immigration enforcement and the use of military force.</p>

Cultivating taste requires exposure, curation, and reflection, making it an essential skill for leaders and individuals alike.</p>
