        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has advanced a significant Republican-backed spending bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," following intense negotiations to secure votes from conservative holdouts. Senators Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, Mike Lee, and Cynthia Lummis initially opposed the legislation but flipped their votes after securing promises for amendments related to deficit reduction and Medicaid. Despite the procedural victory, the final passage of the nearly 1,000-page bill remains uncertain, as several key senators have not committed to a final "yes" vote. The process was marked by lengthy delays and high-level discussions involving party leadership.</p>

          <p>Reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley have given their first interview since being released from federal prison after receiving a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. The couple, convicted of bank and tax fraud, described difficult prison conditions and their daughter Savannah's efforts to secure their freedom. They were originally sentenced to 12 and 7 years respectively but served just over two years. Critics have questioned the pardon, which the Chrisleys defended, and the couple now plans to focus on prison reform while preparing for a new television show.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has strongly criticized the decision to host the Club World Cup in the United States, calling a two-hour weather delay during a match a "joke." The game against Benfica in Charlotte was one of several tournament matches suspended due to summer thunderstorms, a recurring issue that has raised concerns a year before the U.S. co-hosts the 2026 World Cup. Maresca argued that such frequent and lengthy interruptions are not normal in football and suggested the U.S. is "probably not the right place" for the competition. FIFA defended the stoppage, citing safety protocols as its primary concern.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart enriching uranium for a potential bomb within "a matter of months." This assessment follows recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi said caused severe but not total damage, contradicting claims that the program was obliterated. Tensions remain high as Iran has refused IAEA inspections of the damaged sites and vowed to respond forcefully if attacked again. The situation underscores the ongoing diplomatic challenge of containing Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>Following their victory at the Euro 2025 tournament, members of England's Under-21 soccer team are now being considered for the senior squad ahead of next year's World Cup. Players like Tino Livramento and Harvey Elliott, who was named player of the tournament, delivered standout performances that could earn them a place in Thomas Tuchel's plans. The success of the U21s, who have now won consecutive European titles, is seen as a testament to the FA's development programs since 2012. However, history shows that progression to the senior team is not guaranteed for all young champions.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have reported that Russia launched its most massive aerial assault of the war, firing over 500 drones and missiles at targets across the country overnight. The attack targeted multiple regions, including areas in western Ukraine far from the front lines, killing at least two people and wounding six others. Ukraine's air force stated it shot down a significant number of the projectiles, but the barrage caused widespread damage, including a fire at an industrial facility. The attack comes as international peace efforts remain stalled, with no end to the conflict in sight.</p>

          <p>A week after the U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from President Trump and his top aides have created ongoing questions about the mission's success. While the president repeatedly claimed Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated," initial intelligence reports, including from the Pentagon, suggested the setback may only be temporary. Officials have also shifted the stated goals of the attack, at times emphasizing that it successfully led to a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than focusing on the destruction of nuclear material. This has led to a confusing and evolving picture of the strike's true impact and strategic objectives.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that California's public and cultural identity systematically erases the authentic and often brutal history of its Indigenous peoples. The author notes that visitor guides, local histories, and even educational institutions like UC Berkeley often present a sanitized version of the past, skipping from ancient tribal life to Spanish colonization without acknowledging the genocide and resistance that occurred. This whitewashed narrative, shaped in the early 20th century, perpetuates fictions of a vanished people and ignores the vibrant presence of over 100 tribes today. The author calls for correcting these ingrained historical inaccuracies to foster a true understanding of the state's origins.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities reflects an evolving but consistent approach to military force, described as a "One-and-Done Doctrine." This strategy favors discrete, high-impact actions over sustained campaigns, as seen in his first term with strikes against ISIS leaders and Qassem Soleimani. While Trump has grown more confident in his military instincts, he remains averse to "endless wars." The Iran attack was framed as a single, decisive blow, but its long-term effectiveness is debated, and it remains to be seen if one strike will be sufficient to achieve lasting diplomatic goals.</p>

          <p>The muted reactions from China and Russia to the recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran suggest that the so-called anti-American axis is weaker than it appears. Despite shared antagonism toward the U.S., neither Beijing nor Moscow offered significant military or diplomatic support to Tehran during the crisis. This indicates that when global stability is threatened, preserving economic ties with the West outweighs their commitment to a partner like Iran. This cautious approach reveals the pragmatic limits of their alliance, which is based more on convenience and shared grievances than on deep-rooted values or mutual defense obligations.</p>

The phrase is used to label everything from a reality TV star's public spiral to a celebrity's erratic behavior, and it is often shared on platforms like TikTok as a form of catharsis. While some see it as a way to validate emotional expression in a stressed-out generation, mental health professionals express concern.

          <p>On the 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake, experts reflect on the lessons it provides for California's ongoing seismic risks. The quake exposed deadly vulnerabilities in brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many cities to address with mandatory retrofitting laws. Seismologists note that even a century later, many structures, including soft-story apartment buildings, remain at risk. The historical event also highlights a recurring reluctance to enforce stricter building codes due to property rights concerns.

          <p>BÃ¤rbel Bas has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), where she will serve alongside Lars Klingbeil. Coming from a working-class background in Duisburg, Bas's rise through the political ranks is seen as a source of hope for the ailing party, which suffered a historic defeat in the last election. As a member of the SPD's left wing, she is expected to provide a counterbalance to the more conservative Klingbeil. In her new dual role as party co-chair and Germany's labor minister, she faces the daunting tasks of reforming social benefits and rebuilding the party's support.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions winger James Lowe has humorously dismissed attempts by a Perth stadium announcer to troll players born in the southern hemisphere. Before a match against Western Force, the announcer singled out several Lions players, including the New Zealand-born Lowe, for their origins, a tactic echoing comments from Australia's coach. Lowe, who previously played for the Maori All Blacks against the Lions, took the jests in stride, suggesting the gag could continue if it leads to more victories. The incident is part of the verbal sparring that has characterized the tour's buildup.</p>

The authors also highlight the critical role of Medicaid, which covers care for over 40% of people with HIV, and advocate for expanding access to preventative medications like PrEP to finally end the epidemic.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has made a public plea for a ceasefire deal in Gaza, urging the parties to "GET THE HOSTAGES BACK." His call comes as an Israeli official indicated that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may soon travel to Washington, suggesting potential movement in negotiations. In separate social media posts, Trump also strongly criticized the ongoing corruption trial against Netanyahu, calling it a "POLITICAL WITCH HUNT" that interferes with his ability to negotiate. Meanwhile, the Israeli military ordered new mass evacuations in northern Gaza as it expands its offensive in the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>In a satirical opinion column, writer Rex Huppke uses the logic of a recent Supreme Court ruling to argue he should be able to prevent his children from learning about Donald Trump. The ruling, which allows parents to opt children out of lessons with LGBTQ+ material on religious grounds, is humorously applied to the author's "deeply held religious conviction" that lying and bullying are immoral. He contends that teaching about Trump as president normalizes behavior contrary to his faith. The piece highlights what critics see as the chaotic potential of the court's decision, which could allow parents to object to any subject matter they dislike.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has developed a national, searchable citizenship data system by expanding a Department of Homeland Security tool called SAVE. This system allows state and local election officials to check voter rolls against federal Social Security and immigration databases to verify citizenship status. While intended to ensure only citizens are voting, the tool was developed without a public process, raising significant concerns among privacy advocates and legal experts.

          <p>Couples planning weddings are facing unexpected costs and uncertainty due to U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods, which heavily impact the bridal industry. With an estimated 90% of U.S. wedding dresses manufactured in China, new tariffs have forced designers and boutiques to add surcharges or raise prices, sometimes by as much as 30%. This has introduced financial stress and hesitation for brides, who now face a volatile market for a major purchase. The situation is complicated by the lack of a domestic manufacturing base to serve as an alternative, leaving the industry and its customers in a difficult position.</p>

The call for a major military buildup comes as German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt visited Israel and offered unconditional support for its recent strikes on Iran.
