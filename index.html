          <p>A judge has scheduled a hearing for Friday regarding Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit against President Donald Trump, who is attempting to remove her from the board. Cook's lawsuit challenges Trump's authority to fire her, arguing that the allegations of mortgage fraud are unsubstantiated and do not constitute sufficient cause for removal. Cook, the first Black woman on the Federal Reserve Board, asserts that Trump's actions undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve. The White House maintains that Trump has the lawful authority to remove a governor credibly accused of lying in financial documents, but Cook's attorney argues that the alleged conduct occurred before she joined the board, making it insufficient cause for removal. </p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed removing tariffs on American industrial goods, a key part of the U.S.-EU trade agreement, which ensures lower automobile tariffs retroactive to August 1st. The European Commission stated that removing duties on industrial goods and providing market access for some U.S. seafood and agricultural goods would ensure tariff relief for the EU automotive sector. This proposal needs approval from the European Parliament and Council, and it follows a joint statement from the trade partners. The U.S. and EU reached a trade deal in late July, where President Trump indicated a 15% tariff on most European goods, including cars, would be imposed. </p>

          <p>Mexico is reportedly considering raising tariffs on Chinese imports of automobiles, textiles, and plastics, as part of the 2026 budget proposal to Congress, according to Bloomberg News. This increase would mark a significant trade shift for Mexico, prompted by Washington's urging to build a "Fortress North America" and reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains. President Trump has criticized trade "loopholes" in the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that allow Chinese goods to enter the US. During his election campaign, he warned against Chinese carmakers building plants in Mexico to export cars to the US, threatening tariffs of 200-250%. </p>

Consumer spending increased by 1.6%, contributing to the stronger growth, while final sales to private domestic purchasers jumped 1.9%, a metric closely watched by Federal Reserve officials. The GDP number reflected the impact of tariffs on trade, with imports tumbling 29.8% and exports falling 1.3%, resulting in net exports adding nearly 5 percentage points to the Q2 total. For the first half of the year, GDP grew about 2.1%, and the economy is projected to grow at a 2.2% pace in the third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock experienced fluctuations as investors assessed the latest earnings report, which indicated strong AI demand but provided limited clarity on the company's future in China. Sales surged 56% to $46.74 billion, aligning with Wall Street's projections, and adjusted earnings per share slightly exceeded estimates. Concerns linger over Nvidia's prospects in China, particularly after the Trump administration blocked sales of its H20 chip, but CEO Jensen Huang struck a deal with President Trump to restart sales by giving 15% of sales in the region to the government. Despite data center revenue falling short of estimates, Huang remains optimistic about AI infrastructure spend, projecting trillions in investment by the end of the decade. </p>

Syracuse University professor Devashish Mitra suggests India's ties with China could deepen, potentially leading it to join a China-led Asian free trade agreement.

          <p>A Hong Kong court has concluded the trial of pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai, but a verdict date has yet to be set. Lai, arrested in 2020 under Beijing's national security law, faces charges of "colluding with foreign forces" and "publishing seditious materials." Prosecutors cited articles from Lai's Apple Daily, accusing him of soliciting foreign sanctions against China and Hong Kong. Defense lawyers argued that the articles reflected widespread public concern over the extradition bill and that Lai's actions were exercises of free speech. The trial highlights an erosion of press freedom in Hong Kong, with Beijing tightening its control over the former British colony.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has initiated legal action against the Trump administration, challenging her firing, arguing that it violates federal law. Cook claims that Trump's decision, based on allegations of improper mortgage funds, lacks sufficient cause for removal, as the allegations occurred before she assumed her position at the Fed. The lawsuit accuses Trump of violating her right to due process by firing her without notice or a hearing. Cook's sudden dismissal has raised concerns about the Fed's independence from the White House. </p>

          <p>Google has reduced the number of managers overseeing small teams by 35% in the past year, as part of its efficiency efforts. The company aims to reduce bureaucracy and operate more efficiently, according to VP Brian Welle. The reduction refers to managers overseeing fewer than three people, with many remaining as individual contributors. CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated the need for Google to be more efficient and avoid relying solely on headcount for scaling. The company has also implemented voluntary exit programs in several product areas, with 3% to 5% of employees accepting buyouts.</p>

          <p>The US Open, known for its boisterous atmosphere, has a new distraction: the pervasive smell of marijuana, with players and fans noting the aroma on Court 17. Despite the USTA's no-smoking policy, the legalization of recreational cannabis in New York has made the smell commonplace. Players like Casper Ruud and Maria Sakkari have voiced frustration, comparing the atmosphere to "Snoop Dogg's living room." While officials maintain a smoke-free environment within the grounds, the proximity to Corona Park, where smoking is legal, makes it difficult to control. </p>

          <p>A statewide poll reveals strong bipartisan support for the University of California system among California voters, who recognize the value of UC education, research, and medical centers. Despite political divisions, majorities of both Democrats and Republicans agree that UC produces important research and benefits communities in California. However, a significant gap exists between the parties regarding taxpayer funding for UC, with Democrats more likely to support increased funding. The poll results come as the UC system faces challenges from the Trump administration, including research funding cuts and allegations of discrimination.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced the first electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for a £3,750 discount under its grant scheme, aimed at encouraging drivers to switch from petrol and diesel vehicles. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier are the first models to qualify for the maximum discount, with another 26 models eligible for £1,500 discounts. The grant scheme, funded through a £650m initiative, will be available for three years and aims to reduce EV prices to match petrol and diesel counterparts. The government has pledged to ban the sale of new fully petrol or diesel cars from 2030.</p>

          <p>The Welsh government is proposing changes to controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, shifting from a requirement of 252 days availability and 182 days let to an average of 182 days let over several years. The Welsh government said it had "listened" to feedback and was proposing "small changes" to the rules. The Welsh-language society Cymdeithas yr Iaith criticized the changes, while the Professional Association of Self-Caterers called it a "token gesture." The new proposals would also allow up to 14 days of free holidays donated to charity to count towards the 182-day target.</p>

          <p>American and European officials believed they had an opportunity to end the war in Ukraine following President Trump's outreach to Vladimir Putin, but confusion has emerged regarding the details of Russia's offers. European officials are mystified by what Putin promised behind closed doors and whether U.S. officials understood him properly. The confusion stems from a meeting between Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Putin, where details regarding Russia's willingness to withdraw from parts of Ukraine appear to have been lost in translation. European officials warn that if Russia isn’t required to withdraw from Ukrainian territory, it will almost certainly launch more attacks. </p>

          <p>An injunction temporarily blocking asylum seekers from being housed at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, could spark further protests, the Court of Appeal has been told. Lawyers for the Home Office and the hotel are challenging a High Court ruling that ordered the removal of 138 asylum seekers by September 12th. Barristers argued that the "extremely high-profile nature of the issue" could be damaging for the asylum accommodation program. Epping Forest District Council successfully argued that the hotel's use breached planning laws, leading other councils to consider similar injunctions. </p>

          <p>Florida's immigration detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to be empty "within a few days," according to the state's Department of Emergency Management. The decision follows a U.S. District Judge's order to stop bringing new detainees to the facility and wind down operations within 60 days. The judge issued the preliminary injunction in response to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe, citing violations of federal law requiring public input and environmental impact statements. DHS says it is moving detainees to other facilities to comply with the judge's order. </p>
