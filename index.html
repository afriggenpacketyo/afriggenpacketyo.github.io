          <p>Russia launched a significant overnight attack involving nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles across 14 Ukrainian regions, resulting in at least one death and numerous injuries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the barrage and called for stronger international sanctions against Moscow. In retaliation, Ukraine's military targeted and struck two major Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran, causing substantial fires and damage. The exchange of fire occurs amidst ongoing but stalled diplomatic efforts to end the war.</p>

          <p>A review of the "Sarabande Africaine" concert at the Hollywood Bowl highlights the collaboration between cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo. The performance explored the African origins of Baroque-era dances like the sarabande, blending them with works from Bach, Handel, and Philip Glass. While Kidjo's powerful vocals transformed classics like "Summertime" and Ravel's "Bolero," Ma's cello provided a complementary, often background, texture. The event celebrated cultural synthesis and mutual understanding through music, creating a unique and moving experience for the audience.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, even after a Court of Appeal ruling overturned an injunction. Epping Forest District Council is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that the use of The Bell Hotel breaches planning laws and poses a public safety risk. The government maintains that using hotels is a necessary, though not sustainable, measure to manage asylum claims, while the issue continues to fuel protests and political debate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Donald Trump's "reciprocal tariffs," which impose a flat 10% rate on imports from most countries, are an illegal use of his emergency powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the authority to impose such taxes, a power reserved for Congress. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for an appeal to the Supreme Court, a step Trump has indicated he will take.

          <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has initiated a nationwide review aimed at removing undocumented immigrants from public housing. Secretary Scott Turner announced that all Public Housing Authorities have 30 days to conduct an audit to verify the citizenship or eligible immigration status of residents. Turner stated that the move is intended to prioritize American citizens, citing that HUD currently serves only a fraction of eligible families. The policy follows a memorandum signed with the Department of Homeland Security to scrutinize public benefits and has drawn both praise from Republicans and skepticism from critics.</p>

          <p>A landmark study on Iowa's water quality, which identified agricultural pollution as a major contributor to contamination and health risks, has had its public promotion funds withdrawn by officials. The two-year, $1 million report by 16 scientists detailed how pollutants from the state's powerful farm industry affect drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people. After the report's completion, over $400,000 remaining in the budget, partly earmarked for public awareness campaigns, was "zeroed out" without explanation. This move has raised concerns among environmental advocates that politically influential agricultural interests are suppressing the findings.</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has stayed the execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, 67, who was scheduled to die by firing squad for a 1986 murder. His attorneys successfully argued that his severe dementia renders him incompetent to be executed, as he cannot understand the reason for his punishment, a protection supported by U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The state's high court has ordered a lower court to re-evaluate his competency, acknowledging that while the delay causes suffering for the victim's family, they are bound by the rule of law.

The project critiques how society creates these illusions to reassure itself that nature still exists, even as it is being destroyed.

The author argues that Palestinian dehumanization is a deliberate and essential part of the colonial project, which renders their suffering less credible to outside observers. The piece criticizes the media's framing of the conflict, which often strips away historical context and forces Palestinians to condemn Hamas before their grief is acknowledged. It concludes that the recent shift in discourse is not due to a moral awakening but because Palestinian suffering has reached a form, like starvation, that Western consciences can more easily process.</p>

          <p>After a nearly 50-year career covering 12 elections and eight presidencies for The Washington Post, veteran political correspondent Dan Balz is retiring. In a recent interview, Balz identified the most significant shift he has witnessed in American politics as its transformation into a "tougher, coarser, and meaner" arena. He noted that public trust in government plummeted during the Vietnam and Watergate eras and has remained low ever since. Balz's reflection provides a long-term perspective on the current state of political discourse and division in the United States.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Investment Management has acquired a significant position in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT focused on the Southern California market. Rexford's stock has underperformed recently, trading at a discount to its net asset value despite holding a premium portfolio. The article suggests Elliott will likely push for changes to address perceived poor corporate governance, misaligned management interests, and bloated expenses. This move could lead to a reconstitution of the board, better capital allocation, or even a potential sale of the company to maximize shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is seen by financial experts and legal scholars as a significant threat to the central bank's political independence. A politicized Fed could undermine the credibility it has built over decades, potentially leading to higher inflation and instability in the U.S. financial system. While the administration frames its actions as necessary reform, critics argue that gaining control over the Fed's board would give the president influence over monetary policy, bank regulation, and the integrity of the U.S. dollar, risking economic consequences similar to those in countries where dictators set monetary policy.

          <p>Las Vegas experienced a 12% year-over-year drop in visitor numbers in July, marking the sixth straight month of decline. Despite the downturn, the city's top tourism official, Steve Hill, insists that Las Vegas has not priced out travelers and remains a competitive value destination. While social media complaints about rising costs and fees are prevalent, Nevada's gaming revenue remains strong, indicating that those who do visit are still spending significantly. Officials are promoting budget-friendly options and are optimistic about a rebound in the fall due to a strong events calendar.</p>

          <p>An Israeli official announced plans to slow or halt humanitarian aid, including airdrops and truck deliveries, into parts of northern Gaza. This reduction is in preparation for an expanded military offensive aimed at crippling Hamas and will coincide with the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents from the area. Aid organizations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have warned that a mass evacuation is impossible to conduct safely and will worsen the dire humanitarian crisis, where famine has already been declared. The move comes as the death toll in Gaza continues to rise and residents express fear that there is nowhere safe to go.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two civilian workers, John Floyd and Nelson Wu, in connection with the 2021 jet fuel spill at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii. The indictment alleges they provided false information to the Navy, causing it to mislead regulators about the amount of fuel spilled, which later contaminated drinking water and sickened 6,000 people. This is the first indictment resulting from the incident, which a Navy investigation attributed to shoddy management and human error. The case brings a measure of accountability to an environmental disaster that angered residents and military families.</p>

The airline plans to continue normal operations, honoring tickets and loyalty points, while it restructures its finances. CEO Dave Davis stated that more work is needed to position the company for the future, as it struggles with rising operational costs and significant long-term debt. The move comes amid intense pressure from larger airlines and poor demand for domestic leisure travel, creating uncertainty for the budget carrier's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pastor Kelvis Reid suffered a major cardiac arrest due to AL amyloidosis, a rare and often misdiagnosed disease where abnormal proteins build up on organs. His heart had become "hard as cement," and he was placed on life support before his doctors successfully advocated for him to receive a dual heart and kidney transplant. After a difficult recovery involving months of isolation and intensive rehabilitation, Reid has made remarkable progress. Eighteen months post-transplant, he has returned to his pulpit and recently participated in a 5K run, inspiring his caregivers and congregation with his story of survival and resilience.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the University of California system should take legal action against the Trump administration for illegally freezing hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants, rather than seeking a negotiated settlement. The author, who is co-counsel in a similar successful lawsuit brought by Harvard, contends that the administration's actions are a form of high-level extortion using antisemitism as a pretext. Capitulating, the article warns, would set a dangerous precedent, betray the university's values, and harm its educational and research missions by diverting funds to a settlement. The author urges the university to fight in court for its principles and the interests of its faculty and students.</p>
