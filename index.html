        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" signed by President Trump overhauls the federal student loan system, streamlining repayment plans from seven to two and introducing new borrowing caps. Current SAVE plan enrollees face interest resumption, while new borrowers will choose between standard or income-driven repayment. The act also tightens Pell Grant eligibility for some while expanding it for workforce training. Advocacy groups express concern over longer repayment timelines and potential financial barriers, particularly for medical students, while proponents highlight simplification and promoting responsibility.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is piloting Devin, an autonomous AI software engineer from startup Cognition, marking a significant AI milestone for Wall Street. The bank plans to integrate hundreds, potentially thousands, of these AI agents to augment its 12,000 human developers, boosting productivity by three to four times. This adoption reflects the rapid integration of advanced AI in the corporate world, capable of executing complex multi-step tasks. While promising increased efficiency, the move also raises anxieties about potential job cuts across the financial sector, with predictions of significant workforce reductions in the coming years.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are visiting Kerrville, Texas, in the aftermath of devastating floods that claimed over 120 lives and left more than 160 missing. The visit comes amidst scrutiny of the administration's disaster response, particularly a new Department of Homeland Security policy requiring Secretary approval for expenses over $100,000, which critics link to delayed FEMA deployment. Trump defended his administration's swift action, while also reiterating his desire to reform and potentially "wean off" FEMA, shifting more responsibility to state levels.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is grappling with a billion-dollar backlog of delayed grants, a situation exacerbated by new bureaucratic hurdles implemented under the Trump administration's "Defend the Spend initiative." This has led to staff layoffs and a rush to process critical funding, potentially compromising review standards. Programs aiding unaccompanied migrant children, domestic violence victims, and homeless youth are among those affected, with some funding already lapsed. Critics argue these changes, including a now-removed email approval process, have stalled progress and impacted vital services.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of $10,000 deposits in long-term versus short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs), noting a current reversal where short-term rates are higher. Despite this, long-term CDs ultimately yield significantly more interest due to their extended duration, with a 5-year CD earning nearly $2,300 compared to $440 for a 1-year CD. The decision depends on individual financial goals and liquidity needs, as rates are predicted to decline later in the year.

          <p>The Unite union has suspended Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's membership amidst an escalating dispute over long-running bin strikes in Birmingham. Rayner has urged striking workers to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council, drawing the union's ire. Unite also threatened to re-examine its affiliation with the Labour Party if the council proceeds with redundancies, a move that would inflict a significant financial blow to Labour, which receives £1.2 million annually in affiliation fees from Unite. This public rift highlights broader discontent between the union and the government on issues beyond the strike.</p>

However, tax professionals warn of a "SALT torpedo" effect for high earners, where a 30% phaseout between $500,000 and $600,000 in modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) could result in an effective federal tax rate of 45.5% on income within that bracket.

          <p>NFL star Patrick Mahomes has become the second-largest investor in Throne Sport Coffee, also serving as the brand's lead pitchman and product tester. Mahomes, a daily coffee drinker, was drawn to the ready-to-drink option for its healthier profile, offering 10 grams of protein and 40% less sugar than competitors. This investment aligns with the rapidly growing ready-to-drink coffee market, which saw Americans spend $17.7 billion in 2023. Mahomes aims to put something "clean" into his body, noting the product's added electrolytes and B vitamins, while also expressing disinterest in an 18-game NFL season.</p>

          <p>In the "suitcase trial," Yostin Mosquera, accused of murdering and dismembering two men, claims one victim, Albert Alfonso, threatened his family, coercing him into extreme sexual acts against his will. Mosquera testified he felt "empty" and trapped, fearing for his relatives in Colombia if he left. He admitted to Alfonso's manslaughter by way of loss of self-control, but accused Alfonso of killing his partner, Paul Longworth, earlier the same day. Mosquera then dismembered both bodies and attempted to dispose of the remains at Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol.</p>

          <p>Trump's budget chief, Russell Vought, has escalated criticism against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, vowing an investigation into alleged $2.5 billion cost overruns for the Fed's building renovations, which Vought labeled a "palace." Vought accuses Powell of "systemic mismanagement" and misleading Congress about the project's scope. This move intensifies President Trump's ongoing feud with Powell, whom he has urged to resign over the Fed's interest rate policies.

It advocates for shifting towards policies that address socioeconomic disadvantage rather than relying on reductive racial classifications, asserting that the original intent was to redress discrimination, not promote nebulous interpretations of diversity.</p>

The cryptocurrency market's ascent is partly attributed to speculation about a more dovish Federal Reserve leadership and the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which is anticipated to increase the federal deficit, often seen as a positive catalyst for bitcoin. This rally triggered substantial short liquidations, further propelling prices upward.
