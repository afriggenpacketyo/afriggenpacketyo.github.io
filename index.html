          <p>Iran launched a retaliatory missile attack on Israel following Israeli airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and military commanders. Israel's Iron Dome defense system intercepted most of the missiles, but some hits on structures resulted in injuries. The IDF reported that 21 people were injured. The strikes have heightened concerns about escalating regional conflict, with the U.S. urging de-escalation and ordering troops in the Middle East into bunkers during the attacks. The U.S. was not involved in the Israeli strikes, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests or personnel.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse faced backlash after comparing Senator Alex Padilla's removal from a press conference during anti-ICE rioting to John Lewis's experiences in the Civil Rights Movement. Critics, including Republican Congressman Burgess Owens, deemed the comparison a "cheap, woke insult." The incident occurred when Senator Padilla was forcibly removed and handcuffed during a press conference held by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. Democratic lawmakers condemned the force used, while some Republicans questioned Padilla's actions and attendance at Senate votes. The controversy highlights the charged political atmosphere surrounding immigration and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley attributed a temporary factory shutdown to a shortage of rare earth minerals, crucial components in automobile production, particularly for features like windshield wipers and seat belts. About 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals come from China, which has recently imposed export controls. Following trade discussions, the U.S. and China reached an agreement for Beijing to resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S. Ford is awaiting approval of applications with China's Ministry of Commerce to export more rare earths.</p>

          <p>As gold prices reach record highs, investors are considering strategic moves in the precious metals market. For beginners, the recommendation is to invest now rather than waiting for a dip that may not materialize, exploring fractional gold options to make the investment more accessible. Veteran investors are advised to hold steady, considering buying more to reach the recommended 10% portfolio allocation, and remembering the initial reasons for investing in gold, such as inflation protection. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to tailor strategies to individual budgets and retirement plans (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment saw an unexpected improvement in June, fueled by optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs. This surge in positive attitudes ended six months of declining sentiment. Year-ahead inflation expectations also decreased, although they remain significantly higher than current inflation levels. The improvement was observed across various demographics, including age, income, political affiliation, and geographic location. However, retailers like Walmart and Best Buy have voiced concerns about potential price increases due to remaining tariffs, and the OECD projects U.S. inflation to rise by the end of 2025 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The article examines the potential for the U.S. to be drawn into the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. While President Trump initially opposed the Israeli strike on Iran, he later seemed more enthusiastic, raising questions about the extent of U.S. support. The conventional wisdom has been that a military strike to significantly degrade Iran's nuclear enrichment capability would require U.S. involvement. Iran's response to the Israeli strikes, which targeted military leadership and nuclear scientists, could also influence the U.S.'s role in the conflict.</p>

The article questions whether the U.S. will assist Israel in the event of an Iranian counterattack.

          <p>As part of a broad strike on Iran, Israel has attacked several of the country's key nuclear facilities. By Friday afternoon, there were additional reports of Israeli strikes near Iran's other main enrichment facility at Fordow, and at Isfahan, which is also home to a nuclear research complex. Preliminary analysis of satellite imagery at the site suggests the damage from the first wave of attacks was actually limited, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who has tracked Iran's program. In a statement shortly after the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel believed Iran had recently restarted its program to build a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, maps have emerged detailing the locations of the targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, military commanders, and scientists. The initial strikes focused on sites in Tehran and Natanz, a key uranium enrichment location. Israel stated that the operation aimed to dismantle Iran's capacity to produce metallic uranium and other infrastructure related to nuclear weapons development. In response, Iran launched over 100 drones at Israel, with some intercepted by Israeli air defenses. The U.S. clarified that it was not involved in the Israeli strikes.</p>
