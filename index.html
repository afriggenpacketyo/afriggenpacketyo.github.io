          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 03:21:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least three people, including two children, died after being swept away by flash floods in Ruidoso, New Mexico. The area, recently devastated by wildfires, experienced torrential rains that caused the Rio Ruidoso to rise to a record-breaking 20 feet, leading to dozens of water rescues and at least one house being carried away by the current. The flooding was exacerbated by "burn scars" from last year's fires, which made the soil more water-repellent and increased the risk of such disasters. New Mexico's governor has requested an emergency declaration for federal assistance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding firms have agreed to pay £100 million towards affordable housing to resolve an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The regulator was probing whether the companies illegally shared commercially sensitive information, such as sales prices and buyer incentives, which could have inflated house prices. While the firms do not admit any wrongdoing, the settlement allows the CMA to conclude the case without a formal legal decision on whether competition law was broken. The agreement also includes a commitment from the companies to cease sharing such information in the future.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 03:12:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended "fundamental" reforms to the UK criminal justice system to prevent its potential collapse under a massive case backlog. The proposals suggest that certain offenses, like fraud and bribery, be tried by a judge alone, and that defendants in other cases would no longer be able to choose a jury trial. The goal is to reduce the backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in England and Wales, which has left some victims and defendants waiting years for justice. While some legal professionals support the changes, others argue it erodes the fundamental right to a trial by one's peers.</p>

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has issued a stark warning about the "pivotal moment" facing the UK's financial sector as companies increasingly leave the London Stock Exchange. The business group noted that 213 firms have departed since 2016, citing the need for lighter regulation and better investment incentives to reverse the trend. CBI chair Rupert Soames suggested potential tax law changes, such as altering allowances for cash ISAs, to encourage more investment into productive UK companies. The warning comes as concerns grow over London's competitiveness, with high-profile companies choosing to list in the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An additional 50 people have come forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior against British TV presenter Gregg Wallace, which he denies. The claims, primarily of inappropriate sexual comments and in some cases groping, follow an initial investigation that led to his departure from the show "MasterChef." Baroness Helena Kennedy, who chairs an industry watchdog, publicly advised Wallace not to dismiss the women's claims as fabricated, suggesting it would harm any chance of a future comeback. The new allegations span multiple shows and settings, with one woman accusing Wallace of predatory behavior in a dressing room.</p>

This decision follows charges against a 26-year-old employee for over 70 offenses, including child sexual assault, allegedly committed against eight children at one of its Melbourne facilities. The company has apologized for the pain caused and will also allow parents to choose who handles nappy changes and toilet visits for their children.

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Donald Trump announced his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, directly criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions. This U-turn comes after the Pentagon had recently frozen some munitions shipments to Kyiv, and Trump himself had previously resisted Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's requests for more support. During a cabinet meeting, Trump stated the weapons were necessary because Putin is "not treating human beings right." The meeting also included discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and comments from Trump about potentially taking over the governance of Washington, D.C.</p>

The alert came after an impostor used AI-driven text, Signal messages, and voicemails to contact at least three foreign ministers, a U.S. senator, and a governor. While officials described the attempts as "not very sophisticated" and unsuccessful, the incident highlights the growing threat of deepfake technology being used for malicious purposes.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's aggressive and widespread immigration raids are undermining the significant gains he had previously made with Latino voters. The author points to data showing Trump's increased support among Latinos in the 2024 election, suggesting they were tired of the Democratic status quo. However, the piece contends that the administration's current tactics, which are seen as cruel and indiscriminate, are now alienating this same demographic by targeting long-term residents instead of just recent arrivals or criminals. The author draws a parallel to California Republicans in the 1990s, who lost Latino support for a generation after embracing xenophobic policies.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Labour government proceeds with renationalizing passenger train services, a new conflict is emerging over the role of private "open access" operators. These private companies, which compete with state-run services and bear their own financial risks, are credited with improving service and lowering fares on lines like the East Coast Main Line. However, the Department for Transport has expressed concerns that these operators could divert revenue from the newly nationalized system, costing taxpayers. This has led to fears that the government may be trying to stifle competition, a move that could harm regions that benefit from it. (not investment advice)</p>

LACA, an organization representing school food providers, stated that schools are increasingly forced to subsidize the cost of free school meals themselves. A recent 3p increase in the government's meal rate, to £2.61, has been called "inadequate," with caterers estimating the true cost is closer to £3.45.

          <p>AI server maker Super Micro is planning to increase its investment in Europe, including expanding its manufacturing capabilities in the region to meet surging demand. CEO Charles Liang stated that the company, which has facilities in the Netherlands, is developing plans for further investment as the European market for AI hardware grows rapidly. Super Micro, a key partner of Nvidia, provides the essential servers used for training and deploying large-scale artificial intelligence models.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kerr County, the epicenter of the deadly Texas floods, has a long history of discussing but failing to implement a modern flood warning system, according to meeting minutes. The topic was reportedly raised at least 20 times in commissioners' meetings since 2016, with officials acknowledging their systems were less advanced than those in neighboring counties. Despite repeated discussions and a failure to secure FEMA grant funding, the project never moved forward, with some officials in 2016 calling the idea "extravagant." Instead, the county relied on an informal "river calling" phone tree, a system that proved tragically insufficient.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie phenom Jacob Misiorowski delivered a stunning performance, striking out 12 batters over six innings to lead his team to a 3-1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Despite an early leadoff home run by Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' lineup was unable to generate further offense against the 23-year-old right-hander, who consistently threw over 100 mph. The loss marked the fifth consecutive defeat for the Dodgers, a season-long losing streak. Misiorowski's dominant outing, in just his fifth MLB start, drew praise from players and managers on both sides for its impressive velocity and command.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new tariff threats against Japan and South Korea are raising concerns of a sharper economic downturn for the two key U.S. allies. The proposed 25% tariffs target major exports like automobiles and steel, which are critical to both nations' export-dependent economies. Both countries are already experiencing sluggish growth, with Japan potentially facing a technical recession. While Trump has suggested he might reconsider if the countries open their markets further, economists warn the tariffs could significantly reduce GDP and create considerable headwinds for already struggling economies.

The BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and other emerging economies, seeks to increase the influence of the Global South.
