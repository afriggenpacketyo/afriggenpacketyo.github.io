          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders announced he was diagnosed with and successfully treated for an aggressive form of bladder cancer. After undergoing surgery to remove his bladder, his oncologist has declared him cured, and he plans to coach the upcoming season without needing chemotherapy or radiation. Sanders, who has previously dealt with significant health issues including the amputation of two toes, emphasized the importance of early detection, as his cancer was found during a routine scan. He maintained a positive outlook throughout the ordeal and is now back with the team preparing for their season opener.</p>

          <h2>European Leaders Express Dismay Over New US Trade Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 16:42:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leaders from France and Germany have voiced strong criticism of the new trade deal brokered between the EU and the US, with some calling it a "submission." The agreement imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the US in exchange for Europe increasing its purchases of American energy. While the deal averts the threat of even higher 30% tariffs, many European officials view it as unbalanced and damaging to their economies. Despite the widespread discontent, member states are not expected to block the agreement, acknowledging it as a form of damage control under difficult negotiating circumstances.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 16:39:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic experts are analyzing the new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union, with some concluding it is an "asymmetric and unbalanced deal." The pact will raise the average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU to 17.5%, which is projected to slightly reduce the EU's annual GDP. In return, the EU has agreed to eliminate tariffs on certain American goods and significantly increase its purchases of U.S. energy. While the deal avoids a threatened 30% tariff, industry groups like Italian winemakers and German automakers have expressed concerns over the negative financial impact on their sectors.

          <p>A tragic collision between a sailboat and a barge off the coast of Miami Beach has resulted in the deaths of two children and injuries to four other individuals. The incident occurred near Hibiscus Island when the sailboat, carrying five children and an adult counselor from the Miami Youth Sailing Foundation, was struck by the barge and sank. A multi-agency rescue effort was launched, pulling all six people from the water. Two of the children were later pronounced dead at a hospital, while the others sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The U.S. Coast Guard is currently leading the investigation into the cause of the fatal crash.</p>

He cited conversations with local business owners who reported significant losses due to theft and a feeling of powerlessness.

          <p>The "4% rule" is a long-standing guideline suggesting retirees can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually without depleting their savings over 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream from an annuity against potential investment withdrawals. For instance, if an annuity offers a payout rate higher than 4%, it may provide more value and protection against outliving one's savings, a risk not covered by the rule alone. However, retirees must also consider that many fixed annuity payments do not adjust for inflation, unlike the 4% rule's methodology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares for its July monetary policy meeting, the price of gold is holding firm, with experts suggesting little change is likely this week. A rate cut is considered highly unlikely, which typically would temper gold demand, but persistent inflation and geopolitical concerns have kept the metal's price elevated. Investors are watching for any post-meeting commentary from the Fed that might hint at future policy, as this could influence gold's trajectory more than the meeting's immediate outcome. With the price currently below recent highs, some analysts suggest it may be a strategic time for interested investors to act. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Severe downpours across several Chinese provinces, including the areas surrounding Beijing, have caused extensive flooding and landslides, resulting in "heavy casualties." In response, Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for maximum flood control and disaster relief efforts to be implemented immediately. The mountainous Miyun district in Beijing has been particularly hard-hit, with thousands of residents evacuated from their homes. Premier Li Qiang emphasized the need for all-out search and rescue operations and to do everything possible to minimize the number of casualties from the ongoing natural disaster.</p>

          <p>President Trump's effort to keep his former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey is now facing a legal challenge. An attorney for a defendant in a federal case has argued that Habba's appointment is unlawful, violating the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The challenge follows a complex series of maneuvers where the White House effectively circumvented a federal court's decision to replace Habba at the end of her initial term. The motion asks a judge to bar Habba's office from prosecuting the case, claiming the executive branch has unconstitutionally usurped judicial authority.</p>

          <p>In his lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump's legal team has requested an expedited deposition of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, citing his advanced age of 94 and alleged health concerns. Trump is suing the newspaper, which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp, over an article about a purported "bawdy" letter sent to Jeffrey Epstein. The filing argues that Murdoch's age and health make it likely he would be unavailable to testify in person at a future trial. The lawsuit claims the article was a malicious attempt to harm the president's reputation, which the newspaper's publisher has vowed to defend.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue allowing Planned Parenthood clinics to receive Medicaid reimbursements for their services nationwide. The ruling is a victory for the reproductive health organization, which sued after a provision in a recent tax bill sought to block its Medicaid funding for one year. The judge's order protects funding while the litigation continues, noting that restricting access to Planned Parenthood's services would likely lead to adverse health consequences for patients. The organization had argued that losing Medicaid funds would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics across 24 states.</p>

The author describes how the war and siege have destroyed not just physical existence but also the social fabric, forcing people into a desperate struggle for survival that erodes their sense of self. The piece contends that the world is watching a "live-streamed" bloodshed, where Gazans are deprived even of the right to grieve.

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing criticism for using a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to promote his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland. While answering a question, Trump delivered a lengthy praise of the resort's "opulent and beautiful" renovation, blurring the lines between his official duties and personal business interests. The incident comes as his trip is already under scrutiny, with the Scottish government reportedly in talks to provide public funding for a golf tournament at another of his resorts. Ethics experts have previously raised concerns that such actions could violate the U.S. constitution's emoluments clause.</p>

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that Beijing is prepared to work with Brazil and other nations to uphold the multilateral trade framework. The statement specifically noted China's interest in expanding cooperation in the aviation sector with Brazil, home to aircraft manufacturer Embraer, which relies heavily on the U.S. market. This diplomatic support from Beijing signals a potential shift in trade alliances as U.S. protectionist policies create new global economic pressures.</p>

          <p>The only felony case stemming from the violent mob attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA last year has concluded with a plea deal. The defendant, charged with assault with a deadly weapon and a hate crime, entered a diversionary program that requires him to attend therapy and anti-bias training to avoid jail time. If he complies, the charges will be dismissed. This outcome has drawn criticism from victims who believe the punishment is too lenient, comparing the lack of consequences to the broader conflict in Gaza.

The two-year study of over 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s found that participants in an intensive lifestyle program achieved cognitive scores similar to people one to two years younger. These results suggest that such interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline. The Alzheimer's Association, which funded the study, now plans to focus on implementing these findings to promote better brain health in the community.</p>

Speaking during his visit to the UK, Trump expressed impatience with the lack of progress in negotiations, stating, "There's no reason in waiting." This statement reflects a tougher stance from the president, who recently expressed disappointment in Vladimir Putin's actions and backed a new round of sanctions if a ceasefire was not reached. The new, much shorter deadline puts immense pressure on both sides to find a resolution to the long-running conflict.</p>

Despite some negotiated reductions, sharply elevated tariffs remain on imports from major manufacturing hubs, affecting products like clothing, footwear, and food items such as coffee and olive oil. The article also points to potential price increases for imported cars, alcoholic beverages, and even new homes, due to tariffs on building materials like steel and lumber. While President Trump claims the tariffs will boost domestic manufacturing, economists warn of the direct impact on household budgets. (not investment advice)</p>
