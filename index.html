          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has stated that Columbia University has failed to meet accreditation standards due to alleged violations of federal antidiscrimination laws for purportedly tolerating harassment of Jewish students on campus. The department's Office for Civil Rights notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Columbia's accrediting institution, of the alleged violation. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students following the Hamas attack on Israel. Accreditors determine which institutions are eligible for federal student loans and Pell Grants.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50% with the intention of bolstering the American steel industry. Critics argue that this move could harm steel producers outside the U.S., trigger retaliatory measures from trade partners, and increase costs for American consumers of these metals. Some businesses are already putting investments on hold and raising prices due to uncertainty. The UK has been granted a carve-out, maintaining its duties at 25%, reflecting ongoing trade discussions with the U.S. Economists estimate that previous tariffs created jobs in the steel industry but cost more jobs in other sectors.

GOP lawmakers, previously supportive of Muskâ€™s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts, are trying to avoid conflict as Musk calls for scrapping months of work on the budget reconciliation bill. The bill aims to advance Trumpâ€™s priorities on taxes, immigration, energy, defense, and the national debt. Speaker Mike Johnson defended the bill, while some fiscal hawks expressed concerns about Musk's influence on the GOP base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon testified before House and Senate committees to discuss the Trump administration's proposed 15% budget cut for the Education Department. Key points of contention included the administration's decision to halt $1 billion in grants for mental health professionals in schools, citing concerns about DEI ideology. McMahon also suggested colleges should have "skin in the game" regarding student loans, proposing they repay a portion of unpaid loans. The proposed budget would eliminate TRIO programs, which help low-income and first-generation students access college, despite bipartisan support for these programs. The administration's approach involves stripping regulations and sending funds to states via block grants.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent pardons, including those for political allies convicted of tax evasion and individuals involved in the January 6th riot, have raised concerns about the abuse of presidential power. Critics argue that Trump is using pardons as a form of patronage, rewarding loyalty and undermining the rule of law. This practice is seen as a way to make regime loyalists less responsive to criminal punishment. The ongoing pardon spree has led to fears that it could incentivize criminal interference with official functions.</p>
