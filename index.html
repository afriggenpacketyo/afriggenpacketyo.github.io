          <p>Following violent confrontations between protesters and federal agents during a raid on a California cannabis farm, former President Trump has granted "Total Authorization" for ICE to use necessary force to make arrests. The clashes, which involved protesters throwing rocks and bricks, occurred during an operation investigating alleged child labor violations. The directive, announced on Truth Social, instructs law enforcement to arrest individuals who assault them, aiming to show zero tolerance for attacks on federal officers and uphold law and order. A farm worker reportedly died from injuries sustained during the chaos.</p>

          <p>British soft toy company Jellycat has unexpectedly terminated its supply agreements with approximately 100 independent retailers across the UK, causing significant distress for small business owners who relied on the brand. The company cited a "brand elevation strategy" in its identical emails to the shops but provided no specific reasons, leaving owners feeling undervalued. This move comes after the brand's popularity surged on TikTok, which also led to stock shortages for smaller stores, fueling speculation that Jellycat is prioritizing larger retailers and its own immersive brand experiences.</p>

          <p>Narciso Barranco, an undocumented immigrant and father of three U.S. Marines, is set to be released on bond after being held for 20 days in a federal facility. Video of his violent arrest in Orange County, where masked federal agents beat and pepper-sprayed him, went viral and drew public outcry. Barranco, who has lived in the U.S. for decades and has no criminal record, had applied for parole-in-place. His family plans to seek immediate medical attention for his injuries upon his release.</p>

          <p>King Charles recently hosted his inaugural "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, gathering Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and activists to promote his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The event featured a ceremonial fire and discussions centered on the interconnectedness of all life, a core tenet of the King's long-held beliefs. This philosophy underpins his work on climate change, sustainable farming, and interfaith dialogue, which he has described as a "call to revolution" against modern consumer culture. The summit aimed to draw on the wisdom of Indigenous peoples to find sustainable solutions.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Perris, California, has issued a public warning advising residents to stay home and avoid opening their doors to strangers due to ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the region. This cautionary message reflects a growing climate of fear within Southern California's immigrant communities as the Trump administration intensifies enforcement actions. The mayor emphasized the city's commitment to protecting all residents' dignity while acknowledging its limited jurisdiction over federal matters. This follows similar guidance from a local Catholic bishop, who permitted parishioners to miss Sunday Mass over safety concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a significant reduction-in-force, laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a broader Trump administration reorganization plan. The cuts, which are part of a plan to eliminate nearly 3,000 positions in total, are aimed at streamlining the department and removing what officials call redundant offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the layoffs will weaken U.S. diplomacy and harm national security, with notable cuts hitting bureaus focused on human rights, refugee assistance, and Afghan relocation efforts.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the Air India crash that killed 270 people has found that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were activated within one second of each other shortly after takeoff. This action caused the engines to lose thrust, leading to the crash just 32 seconds into the flight. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other denying he had done so. The report does not determine whether the action was intentional or accidental, but it suggests the cause was human intervention rather than a mechanical failure.</p>

The heat can lead to mass mortality events for critical species like seagrasses and trigger knock-on effects for fisheries.

The OBR warned that Britain's public finances are on an unsustainable path, with debt levels potentially soaring, and criticized a pattern of policy U-turns. With high debt, borrowing, and borrowing costs compared to other advanced economies, the clear message is that continued borrowing is not a viable long-term solution.

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is bolstering its security protocols with new technology and procedures. The agency has introduced a fleet of military-grade drones for aerial surveillance and mobile command posts that ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement, addressing key failures from the 2024 incident. During the Butler rally, the shooter flew a drone undetected for 11 minutes, and communication breakdowns prevented warnings from reaching agents. These changes aim to prevent a repeat of the security lapses that day.</p>

          <p>Actor Derek Dixon, who filed a $260 million lawsuit against media mogul Tyler Perry for sexual harassment and assault, has stated he "couldn't stay silent anymore." In his first interview, Dixon detailed allegations that Perry engaged in a pattern of workplace sexual misconduct from 2020 to 2024, using his industry power to create a coercive dynamic. Dixon claims Perry made unwanted sexual advances and assaulted him on multiple occasions after he refused. Perry's attorney has denied the allegations, calling them a "scam," but Dixon hopes his lawsuit will help protect future actors from similar exploitation.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media giant knowingly uses a defective and dangerously addictive design to exploit young users for commercial gain. New Hampshire's Attorney General argues these manipulative features are intended to maximize engagement, thereby increasing children's exposure to ads and driving purchases. This case is part of a broader trend where states are targeting the design and safety policies of tech platforms rather than user-generated content.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who won an election promising to stand up to U.S. trade pressure, is now facing questions about whether he is backing down in negotiations with the Trump administration. After Canada scrapped a planned digital services tax and Trump responded with a new threat of 35% tariffs, some commentators and analysts are questioning Carney's strategy. While his government maintains strong public support, critics argue that recent concessions have yielded little benefit. Experts note that the ultimate success of his approach will depend on the final trade agreement reached with the unpredictable U.S. administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Justice Department and FBI review of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation has reportedly caused a significant clash between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. The conflict, which allegedly erupted during a White House meeting, stems from the public rollout of the review's findings, which concluded Epstein died by suicide and that no "client list" was found. Amid fallout and skepticism from some of the former president's supporters, Bongino was absent from work, and sources suggest he is considering resignation.

The piece highlights the recent layoff of over 2,000 senior NASA employees, arguing that such moves cripple the agency's expertise.

The decision reverses a military judge's ruling and means the long-stalled cases will likely proceed toward a full military commission trial.
