The Russian space agency Roscosmos reported that the spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere and landed in the Indian Ocean, west of Jakarta, Indonesia. NASA and the European Space Agency provided similar details regarding the reentry time and location. Due to its design to withstand Venus's harsh atmosphere, there were predictions that parts of Kosmos 482 may have survived reentry, though any remnants would be difficult to locate in the ocean.</p>

Jackson alleges that the NFL violated antitrust and consumer protection laws, arguing that the league colluded to prevent Sanders from being drafted higher. Jackson, who has no formal legal background, insists that his lawsuit is not a joke and that he is suing the NFL as a consumer of their product, not as a fan.

          <p>Following the agreement between the U.S. and China to temporarily reduce tariffs, Jim Cramer identified several stocks in the CNBC Investing Club portfolio that benefited from the news.

Eaton and Dover, derivative AI plays, also performed well due to their essential products for energy-intensive data centers. Cramer noted that Meta Platforms rose despite having no direct business with China, likely due to revenue from China-related advertisers.

          <p>Many millennials and Gen Zers are finding financial security increasingly out of reach, despite earning more on paper. Experts suggest that younger generations are living in a separate economy where the middle class is harder to attain, with rising costs of housing, health care, and insurance contributing to the challenge. Unlike previous generations, young Americans bear more responsibility for funding their own retirement, making it difficult to save for traditional markers of success like homeownership. As a result, many young adults are adapting by living with their parents longer, sharing child care, and seeking new ways to build community.</p>

Trump criticized the current pricing system, stating that pharmaceutical companies make more than two-thirds of their profits in the U.S. while charging significantly less in other countries. The "most favored nation" policy would force pharmaceutical companies to match the lowest global prices, a move that is expected to face strong opposition from the industry.

China has also halted non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US.

          <p>The first group of white South Africans granted refugee status by the US has arrived in the country under a plan initiated by President Trump, who has previously stated that members of the Afrikaner minority are victims of racial discrimination. South Africa's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola dismissed these claims, stating that there is no persecution of white Afrikaner South Africans. The BBC has contacted the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, which confirmed it was not involved in this resettlement scheme, showing how much the white Afrikaners have been fast-tracked and in a way that has not been done for others.</p>

          <p>President Trump called on drugmakers to lower their prices within the next month to be closer to those charged in other high-income countries, threatening to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they fail to do so. Mr. Trump told reporters that some prescription drug and pharmaceutical drug prices will be reduced almost immediately by 50% to 80% to 90%. He said his move marks an expansion of the "most favored nation" idea from his first term, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services set steep price caps tied to the prices charged in other developed countries for how much it would pay for some prescription drugs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's willingness to accept a lavish jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar has sparked criticism over the legalities of what would mark the largest foreign gift ever received by U.S. government. Trump is preparing to accept a Boeing 747-8 which he will then use as Air Force One, four sources familiar with the plan told NBC News. The ownership of the gift is expected to be transferred to the Trump presidential library foundation once Trump ends his second term. Democratic lawmakers and Trump allies have sharply criticized the reported move, saying the lavish nature of the gift raises serious legal and ethical concerns.</p>

In a joint statement, the United States and China said they would suspend their respective tariffs for 90 days and continue negotiations they started this weekend.

The entry of Feenstra could set up a possible high-profile Republican primary that may come to include Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird—widely regarded within GOP circles as President Trump's preferred choice, if she decides to jump into the fray. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Iowa state auditor Rob Sand entered the race for governor.</p>
