          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has reportedly increased its position in Equinix, a leading data center real estate investment trust. The move follows a drop in Equinix's stock price after it announced higher-than-expected capital expenditures and a downgraded forecast, which concerned short-term investors. Leveraging its extensive experience with data center businesses, including a successful campaign at Switch, Elliott may push for improved market communication, cost optimization, and financial strategies to enhance long-term shareholder value. The firm could pursue these changes as an active shareholder or potentially seek a board seat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just hours after the agency released disappointing employment figures. The report showed the creation of only 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations, and revised previous months' figures downward. President Trump alleged the numbers were "rigged" to make him look bad, a move that has drawn widespread condemnation for politicizing a vital government agency. Critics, including former officials and economists, likened the action to those taken in authoritarian countries, fearing an erosion of public trust in economic data.</p>

          <p>A growing educational consulting industry in China is offering students a controversial shortcut to improve their applications for graduate programs. For a significant fee, these agencies guide undergraduates through a process to produce a research paper and secure its publication in an academic journal. This practice aims to give students a competitive edge in the increasingly crowded field of admissions for top universities in China and abroad. The trend raises questions about academic integrity and the fairness of the application process, as students leverage these commercial services to bolster their credentials.</p>

          <p>An investigation by The Guardian has identified Michigan resident Johnathan "Chris" Booth as the creator of a fast-growing, openly neo-Nazi YouTube channel that accumulated over 50,000 subscribers. The channel, which featured antisemitic and racist content, was reportedly monetized through YouTube's partner program before being terminated by the platform following the inquiry. The report highlights how extremist content can proliferate and generate revenue on mainstream platforms despite hate speech policies. Booth is married to a local Republican official, who has stated she does not share her husband's views.</p>

          <p>Indigenous leaders and activists are strongly opposing the Trump administration's proposal to reopen the former Alcatraz prison, arguing the plan disrespects the island's crucial role in Native American history. After the federal prison closed in 1963, Alcatraz became the site of a landmark 19-month occupation by Indigenous activists, a pivotal event that galvanized the Native American rights movement. Critics state that turning the island back into a detention facility, particularly for immigrants, not only erases this legacy of resistance but also echoes the historical trauma of displacement and incarceration experienced by Indigenous peoples.</p>

While elite status or premium fare classes typically grant priority boarding, those in economy can often buy the perk as an add-on. Co-branded airline credit cards may also offer early boarding benefits, providing an alternative to paying for the upgrade on each flight or purchasing a more expensive ticket.</p>

          <p>Following a bladder cancer diagnosis, football coach Deion Sanders underwent a neobladder reconstruction, a complex surgical procedure detailed by medical experts. The operation involves removing the diseased bladder and constructing a new one from a segment of the patient's own small intestine. This method avoids immune system rejection, as the new organ is made from the body's own tissue. While the procedure is innovative, patients must retrain themselves to use the neobladder, and Sanders has publicly discussed the challenges, such as incontinence, to destigmatize the experience for others.</p>

          <p>Russia has shown a notably subdued official response after President Trump announced he had ordered two nuclear submarines to be moved closer to the country. The move was a reaction to social media posts by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, which Trump deemed threatening. Russian media outlets have largely dismissed the announcement as a "temper tantrum," and official bodies like the Kremlin and the defense ministry have remained silent. This lack of an escalatory reaction suggests Moscow may not be taking the submarine deployment as a serious military threat, but rather as part of Trump's unpredictable political style.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Panamanian officials report a dramatic decrease in migrant crossings through the treacherous Darién Gap, with numbers falling by over 99% compared to their peak. In June, only 10 migrants were recorded crossing the jungle route connecting Colombia and Panama, down from over 82,000 in a single month in 2023. The Department of Homeland Security attributes this sharp decline to President Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown and a coordinated effort with Panama's president to secure the passage. The White House states these policies are effectively deterring migrants from attempting the perilous journey to the U.S. border.</p>

          <p>In an interview with Vox, philosopher Mark C. Taylor explores the changing concept of what it means to be human in an age of climate change and advanced technology. He argues that the modern, anthropocentric view, which separates human consciousness from nature, is at the root of our current environmental crisis. Taylor advocates for a new understanding of humanity based on interconnectedness and relationality, seeing all systems—from biological to ecological—as information-processing networks. He suggests that surviving the future requires moving beyond a mindset of mastery and control and embracing a new, more integrated way of being in the world.</p>

This marks the first time a K-pop single has reached number one in the UK since 2012, signaling the genre's growing mainstream popularity and the potential for "Golden" to become a song of the summer.</p>

          <h2>Starvation Worsens in Gaza as Residents Report Aid Efforts Are Ineffective</h2>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza report that a severe hunger crisis is continuing to worsen, with international aid efforts described as insufficient and ineffective. Despite air drops and deliveries from the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, residents say the aid is symbolic and does not meet the overwhelming need, calling the challenge of finding food a "death journey." The UN reports that over 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while trying to access aid since May. For Gazans on the ground, diplomatic debates over statehood are meaningless as they struggle daily with starvation and the loss of a dignified life.</p>

          <p>A new report from Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office reveals that cases of domestic violence reached a record high last year, with nearly 257,000 victims registered. This figure translates to an average of one person suffering mistreatment from a partner, ex-partner, or family member approximately every two minutes. In response to the rising numbers, Germany's Justice Minister is planning to introduce new regulations to better protect victims. The proposed measures, based on a Spanish model, could include the use of electronic ankle tags to monitor offenders' proximity to their victims.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese official has urged the southern city of Foshan to intensify efforts to control an outbreak of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne virus. As of late July, the province of Guangdong had reported over 4,800 cases, with the manufacturing hub of Foshan accounting for about 60% of them. Vice-Premier Liu Guozhong called on local authorities to implement strict quarantine measures, improve prevention protocols, and eliminate mosquito breeding grounds to cut off transmission channels. While all reported cases have been mild with no fatalities, the rising numbers have prompted a high-level response to contain the spread.</p>

          <p>A growing number of professionals are choosing to live in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen while commuting daily to their jobs in Hong Kong. This cross-border lifestyle is driven by the significant difference in living costs, particularly the high price of rent in Hong Kong. Commuters are trading long travel times, often 90 minutes or more each way, for the ability to afford more spacious living arrangements. This trend is gaining visibility on social media platforms, where individuals share tips on navigating the commute, finding housing in Shenzhen, and managing the daily border crossing.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets reacted negatively following President Trump's announcement of steep new tariffs on a wide range of countries, including Canada, India, and Switzerland. The executive order, set to take effect on August 7, caused stock markets in Europe, Asia, and the United States to fall amid concerns over escalating trade tensions and economic uncertainty. Several key trading partners, including France's wine industry and Switzerland, expressed alarm over the potential impact. The move has prompted affected nations to seek negotiations to avert the duties, while the White House continues its aggressive trade strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a temporary order that blocks the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration enforcement sweeps in Southern California. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision, which found a "mountain of evidence" that federal tactics were unconstitutional. The original order prohibited agents from using factors like race, speaking Spanish, or being in certain locations as the sole basis for detaining someone. The case was brought by immigrant advocacy groups who accused the administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned individuals, a claim the government's lawyers argued was based on insufficient evidence.</p>

          <p>Two state-owned Chinese firms are investing a combined US$350 million to develop large-scale agriculture projects in Angola, part of China's broader strategy to enhance its food security. SinoHydro Group will invest over $100 million to create a grain base, with about 60% of the output designated for shipment back to China. Separately, the conglomerate Citic has committed $250 million to develop vast areas for soybean and corn production. These deals underscore China's increasing focus on securing food supplies through overseas agricultural investments, particularly in African nations with significant undeveloped arable land.</p>
