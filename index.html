          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecasted to make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., potentially reaching as far south as northern California and Alabama. The storm, spurred by a coronal mass ejection, could disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. Space weather officials detected a solar flare associated with the storm, which is expected to last through late Monday. The northern lights are caused by solar wind hitting Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere and are best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>

Delegates expressed concerns about the weaponization of California’s liberal policies and questioned whether the state’s brand of liberalism would sell on the national stage.

          <p>According to Angela Zhang, US tariffs can affect the Chinese tech sector in two main ways: direct and indirect effects. Higher tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, but modest tariffs may be absorbed by Chinese suppliers. As Chinese companies face more trade barriers, they'll need to work harder on cutting costs and scaling up, which could lead to more innovation. Chinese companies are expected to look more aggressively to other markets and deepen trade with Europe, offering technology transfers in exchange for market access.</p>

Clinton stated that he had never seen Biden in a state where he thought he couldn't do the job and that Biden was always on top of his briefs. He also mentioned that he hadn't read a book claiming cognitive decline because he believes some people are using it as a "way to blame" Biden for Trump's reelection.

          <p>Ukraine launched an audacious drone attack on Russian airbases, an operation said to have taken 18 months to prepare. The attack, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," involved smuggling drones into Russia and launching them remotely. While the extent of the damage is debated, the operation is seen as a propaganda victory and a message to both Russia and Ukraine's Western allies that Ukraine is still in the fight. The operation aims to counter the perception that Ukraine has already lost the war and to encourage continued support.</p>
