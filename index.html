          <p>Israeli airstrikes across Gaza have reportedly killed at least 24 Palestinians, according to medics and officials. One strike hit a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City, resulting in numerous fatalities, including children. The Israeli military claims the targeted area was a command and control center for Hamas and Islamic Jihad, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields. Local reports indicate that a Hamas police official and his family were among the dead; the Red Cross reported two of its staff were killed in a separate strike.

His departure followed reports questioning the foundation's autonomy and connections to Israel.

The foundation aims to distribute food to over a million Palestinians, but critics argue it could displace civilians and benefit from the status quo. Wood had previously pledged not to participate in any program leading to displacement and urged Israel to expand aid provision through all mechanisms.</p>

The proposed zone would encompass most of Ukraine, excluding a small area along the Polish border. Medvedev's proposal aims to shield Belgorod from long-range weapons supplied to Ukraine, but the scale of the required territorial gains makes it an unlikely near-term objective.</p>
