          <p>A Southern California family, seeking a supportive "village" for their twin boys, found Janet Firestein Daw through Surrogate Grandparents USA, a Facebook group. Daw, who desired grandchildren and wanted to engage in activities like playing Legos, connected immediately with the Turners, affectionately becoming "Nana J" and a full part of their family. This unique arrangement has brought immense relief and a sense of completion to the Turners, while also filling a lifelong void for Daw, who later welcomed a biological grandchild but whose love for the boys remained unchanged. The article highlights the growing trend of such unconventional family formations, emphasizing the importance of parental discretion and safety when meeting online.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's moral dilemma about caring for an aging, previously unkind stepfather who lives nearby and has no other family. The columnist, James Parker, despite admitting his own jaundiced nature, advocates for rising above "petty grievances" and showing kindness. He suggests viewing this act as a "rebalancing of the scales," portraying it as a form of "revenge" served graciously through a casserole. The article emphasizes that actively ignoring someone is stressful and that showing generosity can be liberating, especially when the former antagonist has lost their power and cannot pluck "deep bass strings of neurosis."</p>

England bowlers Sophie Ecclestone and Lauren Filer were instrumental in restricting the Rockets, taking 2-12 and 3-23 respectively.

          <p>Epping Forest District Council successfully obtained a temporary High Court injunction to prevent The Bell Hotel from housing asylum seekers, a ruling that requires all asylum seekers to be moved by September 12. This decision follows significant local protests, which intensified after an asylum seeker residing there was charged with sexual assault. Mr. Justice Eyre upheld the council's argument that the hotel's use constituted an unauthorized material change, despite the Home Office's warning that the ruling would substantially impact its ability to house asylum seekers nationally. Council leader Chris Whitbread urged residents to avoid over-celebration, noting this is just the beginning of the process.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the Trump administration intends to convert CHIPS Act grants to Intel into a non-voting equity stake for the U.S. government, a move that caused Intel's shares to climb. This initiative aims to ensure American taxpayers benefit from the substantial funding previously committed by the Biden administration, which Lutnick criticized as "free money" given without return. The decision aligns with President Trump's broader goal of reshoring U.S. manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign chip producers, especially as Intel has struggled to capitalize on the AI boom despite heavy spending on new factories like the "Silicon Heartland" in Ohio. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that this stake would not obligate U.S. businesses to purchase Intel chips (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing national security concerns and congressional attempts to ban it, TikTok is proving to be an unexpected and effective tool for U.S. military recruitment, particularly among young American women. This development is significant given the persistent challenges in attracting enough recruits in a tight labor market. The article highlights an irony where an app deemed a security risk is aiding military personnel acquisition. It also notes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who once questioned women's combat roles, has since moderated his views, with all combat positions now open to women, underscoring the military's pragmatic approach to recruitment.</p>

          <p>Silicon Valley's artificial intelligence sector is seeing a new trend where major tech companies like Meta and Google are acquiring AI startups primarily by poaching their founders and top researchers through high-priced licensing deals, leaving behind "zombie companies." These deals, often structured to skirt regulatory scrutiny, result in significant payouts for the founders but leave investors and remaining employees in limbo, effectively "hollowing out the organization." The article highlights examples like Windsurf, Scale AI, Inflection AI, and Covariant, where such talent acquisitions have disrupted traditional venture capital models and raised concerns about stifling innovation. This trend represents a significant shift in the M&A landscape for AI startups (not investment advice).</p>

The Miami Championship, a $20 million Signature Event, will be the first PGA Tour event held at the venue since 2016, when the WGC-Cadillac Championship was relocated amid Trump's polarizing political rise. While the previous departure was framed as a sponsorship issue, the return now expands the Tour's Signature Events roster.

          <p>Israel is demanding the release of all 50 hostages held in Gaza, casting doubt on its acceptance of a new 60-day ceasefire proposal agreed upon by Hamas. While Qatar stated the proposal is "almost identical" to a prior U.S. plan Israel had accepted, Israel's stance aligns with its cabinet principles to end the war, not explicitly rejecting but indicating a desire for further negotiation. The proposal outlines a phased release of hostages and prisoners, with Israeli forces withdrawing slightly during the truce. This development comes as Prime Minister Netanyahu faces pressure from both far-right coalition partners to continue the war and hostage families urging a deal.</p>

          <p>Shares of Viking Therapeutics plummeted by 40% after the company released midstage trial data for its obesity pill, VK2735, which disappointed investors. The results, showing patients lost up to 12.2% of their weight at three months with a 28% discontinuation rate due to side effects, were deemed "inferior" to competitors like Eli Lilly's oral drug. This outcome is a significant blow to Viking, once considered a prime M&A target in the booming obesity drug market, and reinforces the dominance of established players Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

          <p>The UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) has delayed the release of its latest monthly retail sales figures by two weeks, citing concerns over data quality and a need for "further quality assurance." This marks another setback for the ONS, which has faced recent criticism regarding the reliability of its official statistics, particularly jobs market figures. The delay raises questions about the integrity of data used by the Bank of England for interest rate decisions and by the Chancellor for tax and public spending policies. Economists express concern that such errors undermine confidence in all ONS data, calling for urgent improvements.</p>

This contrasts with the CDC's stance under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which does not recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children but suggests consultation with physicians. The AAP emphasizes its recommendations are "rooted in science" for children's health, amidst a statement from HHS questioning the AAP's conflict-of-interest safeguards.</p>

The lawsuit argues that the condition, which denies funding to programs that don't cooperate with DHS agents or honor their requests, is illegal and forces states to choose between critical victim services and unlawful federal conscription into immigration enforcement. Mostly Democratic states, which collectively receive over $500 million annually, contend that such policies undermine trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities, hindering crime prevention and response.</p>
