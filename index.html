          <p>Authorities searching for Brian Tarrence, a New Yorker who went missing in Turks and Caicos on June 25, have discovered a deceased male's body. The body, found in a decomposed state in Grace Bay, has not yet been positively identified as Tarrence, and police have not yet established a cause of death. The Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force has urged the public to avoid speculation while the investigation continues into the tragic discovery. A private investigator noted that so far, there is no evidence to suggest any criminal activity was involved in the man's disappearance.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid defeated Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in a dramatic match to advance to the Club World Cup semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain. Goals from Gonzalo García and Fran García gave Madrid a comfortable lead, but a chaotic final 10 minutes saw Dortmund score twice, requiring a last-minute save to secure the win. The match also featured a spectacular acrobatic goal from Kylian Mbappé and a red card for new defender Dean Huijsen, who will miss the upcoming semi-final.

The development comes as President Trump expressed optimism about a potential deal, while significant disagreements appear to remain between the two sides.

However, analysts and industry insiders suggest that removing Chinese products, particularly from world-leading firms, from global supply chains will be difficult and costly. One US-based drone firm manager noted the limited number of non-Chinese drone manufacturers and expressed concern that a ban would primarily serve as a negotiation tactic while raising costs for businesses.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that his country has finalized agreements with a major U.S. defense company and European partners to significantly increase its drone supply. The deals will provide Ukraine with "hundreds of thousands of additional drones" this year to aid in its defense against the full-scale Russian invasion. Zelensky also noted a separate agreement with Denmark for the co-production of weapons. The announcement follows a productive conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump and underscores Ukraine's strategy of leveraging drone technology and international partnerships in the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>The Independence Day holiday in the United States was marked by widespread violence, including multiple mass shootings and fatal accidents. A shooting in downtown Indianapolis left at least two dead and five wounded, prompting the police chief to express frustration over the "unacceptable" violence. Mass shootings were also reported in Chicago and Philadelphia, continuing a trend of deadly July 4th weekends. Other tragic incidents included a fatal stabbing in New York City and two separate boat explosions on lakes in Georgia, highlighting a day of celebration overshadowed by tragedy.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reported to have unilaterally halted a shipment of military aid to Ukraine, citing concerns that US weapon stockpiles are too low. This marks the third time Hegseth has paused supplies, delaying air defense missiles and other munitions promised to Kyiv. Democratic lawmakers, such as Rep. Adam Smith, have refuted the claim, stating there is no evidence of a weapons shortage and that the decision was not justified. The move has surprised allies and is seen as painful for Ukraine as it faces intensified Russian bombardment.</p>

          <p>Sonay Kartal, at 5ft 4in, is the shortest player in the women's singles draw at Wimbledon but has reached the fourth round for the first time. The 23-year-old British player says she is a "proud short person" and has compensated for her lack of height by focusing on her speed and power. After overcoming injuries and a period of being self-funded, Kartal has seen a rapid rise in the world rankings to 51st. She draws inspiration from other shorter players like Jasmine Paolini and is set to make her Centre Court debut, viewing her successful run as a major confidence boost.</p>

          <p>Facing a seemingly impossible final-day chase of 536 runs against India, the England cricket team may be reconsidering its aggressive "Bazball" philosophy that shuns draws. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick suggested that the team is not "stupid enough" to ignore the possibility of batting for a draw to preserve their 1-0 series lead. This marks a potential shift from the team's defiant mantra of always playing for a win, regardless of the situation. The final day's play will be a major test of whether England will adapt its strategy when victory is out of reach.</p>

          <p>This article presents an excerpt from "Mark Twain," a new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow. The selected passage details Twain's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, which he undertook to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling with his publisher, Twain found the river and its towns much changed, a poignant experience that contrasted with the timeless feeling of being back in a steamboat's pilot house. The excerpt captures Twain's deep nostalgia for his youth and the freedom he associated with his early career as a river pilot.</p>

          <p>Mark Twain's full autobiography was published a century after his death, as per his specific instructions, revealing his uncensored thoughts on everything from politics to personal relationships. The work is highly unconventional, composed of daily dictations rather than a linear narrative, making it feel like a modern blog. Twain chose to delay its publication to speak freely without hurting those he criticized and as a brilliant marketing ploy. The release offers a raw, unfiltered look at the mind of one of America's greatest literary figures and first global superstars.</p>
