          <p>On the second anniversary of the Hamas terror attack, Rachel Goldberg-Polin, mother of slain Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, made an emotional plea for leaders to secure a deal to release all remaining captives. Her 23-year-old son was killed by his captors in August 2024 after more than 300 days in captivity. Goldberg-Polin continues to campaign tirelessly, expressing hope that a deal is close, especially with President Trump's recent peace proposal. She emphasized the immense suffering of both hostages and innocent civilians in Gaza, calling on decision-makers on both sides to end the pain and bring everyone home.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of drivers affected by the mis-selling of car finance deals. The regulator estimates that the average payout could be around £700 per person, with a total compensation bill for lenders potentially reaching £8.2 billion. The issue stems from discretionary commission arrangements where dealers were incentivized to charge higher interest rates. This scheme covers 14 million motor finance agreements made between April 2007 and November 2024, aiming to provide fair compensation for customers who were overcharged or given inaccurate information.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising consumer debt and default rates, it is crucial for borrowers to understand their rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). This federal law provides significant protections, including the right to be treated fairly and without harassment, prohibiting abusive language or threats from collectors. Borrowers also have the right to demand and dispute information, requiring collectors to provide proof of the debt before continuing collection efforts. Furthermore, consumers can control how and when they are contacted, and can even demand that communication cease entirely, offering them space to manage their financial situation without undue pressure.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Trump's Government Shutdown Disproportionately Harms Working Americans</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the current government shutdown, driven by President Trump, benefits billionaires while inflicting economic hardship on working-class Americans, particularly through threats to Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits. The author cites polling data, including from Trump's own pollster, indicating that a majority of voters, including many Trump supporters, oppose cuts that would raise healthcare premiums. The piece contends this action is part of a pattern where the administration's policies, such as tax breaks for the wealthy and tariffs, consistently favor powerful interests over the promises made to everyday citizens, thereby increasing their financial burden.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has announced plans to double its steel tariffs to 50% and slash duty-free import quotas, a move largely aimed at countering a glut of cheap Chinese steel. This decision follows similar protectionist measures by the U.S. under President Trump and is described as an "existential threat" by the UK steel industry, which sends 80% of its exports to the EU. Industry leaders and unions are urgently calling on the UK government to implement its own defensive measures to prevent a flood of diverted steel from overwhelming the domestic market.

          <p>The World Trade Organization has significantly increased its global trade growth forecast for 2025 to 2.4%, citing strong demand for AI-related goods and robust economic conditions in the first half of the year. However, the outlook for 2026 has been downgraded to a mere 0.5% growth, with the WTO warning that the global economy is expected to cool and feel the full impact of higher trade tariffs. The report noted that AI-related spending was a major driver of trade expansion, particularly in Asia. A key downside risk remains the potential spread of trade-restrictive measures and policy uncertainty across more economies and sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock fell by 5% after a report from The Information suggested the company is experiencing thin profit margins on its cloud business involving Nvidia chips. According to internal documents cited in the report, Oracle's Nvidia cloud business had a gross margin of only 14% on $900 million in sales for the three months ending in August, far below the company's overall margin of around 70%. This has raised concerns about the profitability of Oracle's significant investment in expensive Nvidia hardware, which it rents to clients like OpenAI for artificial intelligence workloads, despite forecasting massive growth in cloud infrastructure revenue.

          <p>According to psychology and finance author Morgan Housel, true happiness is derived from contentment rather than the endless pursuit of wealth. He posits that happiness is simply the gap between one's expectations and their circumstances, meaning a person with little who wants nothing more can feel richer than a billionaire who always desires more. The article outlines five rules for achieving this state of psychological wealth, including appreciating the beauty in ordinary life and managing expectations. Ultimately, the key is to reach a point of satisfaction with what one has, regardless of income or lifestyle, to realize that happiness is a state where nothing feels missing.</p>

The plaintiff, a Christian counselor named Kaley Chiles, argues the ban infringes on her free speech rights by censoring conversations about sexual orientation and gender identity with young clients who wish to align with their biological sex. Colorado defends the law as a regulation of professional conduct designed to protect minors from a practice widely deemed harmful and ineffective by major medical associations.

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is purchasing additional shares of GE Vernova, expressing strong conviction in the power equipment maker's long-term prospects. The move is based on the increasing demand for energy infrastructure needed to support the expansion of artificial intelligence data centers, which require massive amounts of power. The club views GE Vernova, which produces gas turbines and grid solutions, as a key beneficiary of this trend. While acknowledging softness in the company's onshore wind business, the analysis suggests this weakness is already priced into the stock and is outweighed by the significant growth potential in its other segments.

          <p>The attorney for a woman shot by federal agents in Chicago claims that body-camera footage shows an officer taunting her with the words, "Do something, bitch," just before opening fire. The 30-year-old woman, Marimar Martinez, was shot after allegedly ramming a Customs and Border Protection vehicle during a chase. Federal prosecutors allege she was part of a convoy that aggressively pursued and boxed in the agents' vehicle. However, her defense attorney challenges this account, arguing the footage shows the agent abruptly turning the vehicle, jumping out, and immediately shooting, leaving Martinez with seven bullet holes.</p>

          <p>The Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) has announced it will appeal a decision by FIFA's Disciplinary Committee that accused it of "cheating" by fielding seven ineligible foreign-born players in an Asia Cup qualifying match. FIFA suspended the players for 12 months and fined the FAM $438,000, alleging that forged documents were used to prove the players had Malaysian heritage. The FAM vehemently denies the allegations, stating that there is no evidence of forgery and that the players acted in good faith. The case is unprecedented in scope and has sparked a public backlash in Malaysia over the damage to the country's reputation.</p>

          <p>During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi repeatedly deflected questions from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse regarding an alleged FBI sting operation involving former border czar Tom Homan. Whitehouse pressed Bondi on reports that Homan accepted a $50,000 cash payment from undercover agents, asking what became of the money. Instead of providing a direct answer, Bondi cited a Justice Department review that found no evidence of wrongdoing and accused the senator of working with "dark money groups." The exchange grew tense as Whitehouse stated he was not getting a straight answer to his questions about the alleged incident.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham has been found guilty of stalking television and radio presenter Myleene Klass over a four-year period. The man, Peter Windsor, sent numerous unwanted and disturbing items to Klass and her Classic FM colleague, including a will-writing kit, handcuffs, and an air pistol. During the trial, Klass described her "sheer terror" upon learning the extent of the stalking, which she called a huge violation. The jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict after hearing evidence of the prolonged campaign of harassment, which caused both women serious alarm and distress.</p>

          <p>In a stunning development, David Norris, one of the men convicted of the racist murder of Black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993, has publicly admitted his involvement for the first time. During a parole hearing, Norris confessed to being part of the gang that attacked Lawrence but refused to name the other killers, citing risks to his family. Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, argued that Norris remains a danger to the public and should not be released, as he has not shown true remorse or taken full responsibility by identifying his accomplices. The admission comes over three decades after the landmark murder that exposed institutional racism in UK policing.</p>

The lawsuit, filed in the UK's High Court, cites copyright and design right concerns after a 'Spitting Image' sketch portrayed Paddington as a foul-mouthed podcast host who swears, advertises guns, and admits to drug use. The sketch, titled "The Rest is Bullsh*t!", is a stark contrast to the gentle and polite character known to generations of children and adults. The legal action seeks to protect the integrity of the iconic character.</p>

          <p>Recent drone sightings that twice suspended flights at Munich Airport have sparked a debate within the German government over who holds primary responsibility for drone defense. A key issue is the constitutional restriction that prevents the German military from shooting down drones in domestic airspace, as its role is limited to defense against external military attacks. This leaves regional and federal police forces, which lack the necessary equipment like fighter jets, to handle such threats. Senior politicians are now discussing whether federal authorities should be given greater responsibility to protect critical infrastructure from the growing threat posed by unauthorized drones.</p>

          <p>A new analysis suggests that Ukraine may be turning the tables on Russia by effectively compensating for its own manpower shortage through superior technology and tactical innovation. Ukrainian commanders are increasingly relying on sophisticated drone operations for surveillance and strikes, allowing them to inflict losses on Russian forces while minimizing direct contact and casualties for their own troops. The strategy also involves more careful use of artillery, precise troop movements, and better rotation plans to conserve their limited number of soldiers. This adaptation for a long war of attrition may be shifting the conflict's momentum in Ukraine's favor.</p>
