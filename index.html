        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has signaled a willingness to engage in direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marking a potential shift since the early stages of the war. This comes as Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities persist, causing casualties and injuries. Zelensky has proposed a 30-day ceasefire on civilian targets, to which Putin responded that the Kremlin would "analyse" the idea. The situation remains tense, with both sides trading accusations of breaches and continuing military actions, while Ukraine is due to participate in talks with US and European countries in London on Wednesday, following a meeting in Paris last week where leaders discussed pathways to end the war. Optimism surrounding the talks is guarded. Optimism score: 35</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Education Department will restart collecting defaulted student loans next month, potentially impacting millions of borrowers. This marks the end of pandemic-era leniency, with the department resuming involuntary collections through treasury offsets and wage garnishments. Advocates criticize the decision, citing borrower confusion and economic hardship. Borrowers who don’t make payments for nine months go into default, which is reported on their credit scores and can go to collections. The change comes after multiple attempts by the Biden administration to provide broad loan forgiveness were blocked by courts, and as borrowers grapple with changing policies and questions about income-driven repayment programs.

          <p>China's Politburo is expected to address the intensified tariff war with the US at its upcoming meeting, prioritizing the implementation of existing policy tools over new stimulus measures. Urgent problems arising from the trade conflict are likely to be at the top of the agenda, along with expectations for further monetary easing in the second quarter. Analysts suggest the focus will be on swiftly implementing current stimulus measures, given decent first-quarter data and the potential for significant developments in the second quarter.
