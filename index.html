          <p>Kenyan opposition activists claim they were detained and tortured in Tanzania, sparking controversy and testing East African relations. Kenyan economist James Shikwati suggests the Tanzanian government fears protests similar to those in Kenya last year. Human rights activists, including Kenya's former justice minister Martha Karua, were prevented from entering Tanzania to support imprisoned opposition leader Tundu Lissu, with Karua stating that "human rights have no borders". The Bishop of a revivalist church, Josephat Gwajima, criticized the Tanzanian government, after which his church was closed and he went missing, adding to the tension.</p>

Tougher challenges lie ahead, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened Elon Musk with "serious consequences" if he funds Democratic candidates in upcoming elections, signaling a further deterioration of their relationship. Trump stated he has no intention of rebuilding his relationship with Musk after the billionaire criticized the budget bill passed by House lawmakers last month. The conflict escalated after Musk suggested Trump could not have won the presidency without him, leading to personal attacks and threats to cancel Musk's government contracts. Vice President JD Vance attempted to downplay the feud, suggesting Musk was simply frustrated.</p>

          <p>The public falling out between President Trump and Elon Musk has raised concerns among some Republicans about potential divisions within the party ahead of the midterm elections. Musk's criticisms of Trump's "big, beautiful bill" and subsequent social media posts taking credit for Trump's election victory have fueled the dispute. Republican lawmakers worry that Musk's departure from Trump's inner circle could create uncertainty and undermine the party's agenda.

          <p>California leaders have strongly condemned ICE raids conducted across Los Angeles, denouncing them as cruel and terrorizing to the community. Masked agents were recorded making arrests at various locations, including Home Depot stores and Ambiance Apparel, leading to clashes with protesters. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the sweeps as reckless and cruel, while Mayor Karen Bass expressed anger and vowed to coordinate with immigrant rights organizations. Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, defended the raids, asserting that federal law would be enforced.</p>

          <p>Cardiologists are warning that excessive phone scrolling, particularly doomscrolling, can negatively impact heart health by increasing anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior. Doomscrolling, especially in the morning or before bed, can disrupt sleep, disconnect individuals from hunger cues, and promote the absorption of misinformation. Cardiologists recommend setting time limits, avoiding scrolling in bed, and replacing the habit with healthier alternatives like exercise or face-to-face interactions. The article emphasizes that consistent scrolling can lead to neglecting heart-healthy habits such as exercise and stress regulation.</p>

          <p>Tommy Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was asked to leave a London Hawksmoor steakhouse after staff expressed feeling uncomfortable serving him. The restaurant stated that the decision was not based on politics or belief and that the group left politely. Robinson accused the restaurant of "discriminatory behaviour" due to his political views. Tripadvisor has temporarily suspended reviews on some Hawksmoor restaurants due to an influx of reviews “that do not describe a first-hand experience”.</p>

          <p>A professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Rupa Marya, is suing the university for suspending her over online comments about Israel’s war in Gaza, alleging a violation of her freedom of speech rights. Marya, an expert in decolonial theory, was placed on leave after questioning the impacts of Zionism on healthcare. The university condemned her comments as antisemitic, and she was subsequently fired. Marya's attorney argues that her posts never impeded her duties and that her firing threatens free speech.</p>

          <p>A new image from NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter shows a 12-mile-high volcano, Arsia Mons, poking through clouds at dawn on Mars. The image marks the first time one of the volcanoes has been imaged on the planet's horizon. Arsia Mons is twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Loa. The image provides scientists with new insights into changes in Mars' atmosphere over the seasons.</p>
