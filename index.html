          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reversed the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, reinstating Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players posthumously, making them eligible for Hall of Fame consideration. Rose, banned in 1989 for betting on baseball, and Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, can be considered as early as 2028. Hall of Fame Chairman Jane Forbes Clark stated that anyone removed from the permanently ineligible list will be considered. Rose holds the record for hits (4,256), games (3,562), at-bats (14,053), plate appearances (15,890) and singles (3,215).</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that on Monday night, as few as three radar controllers were monitoring Newark's airspace, despite a target of 14, leading to scores of cancellations and delays. The FAA cited a national shortage of air traffic controllers as a contributing factor. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that safety is the priority, even if it means reducing the number of flights. The management of flight traffic at Newark was moved from Long Island to Philadelphia last summer, and the FAA is working to overhaul the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat's New York Times article delves into the concept of successful right-wing art, questioning whether it's a category error or a meaningful description. He references Jonathan Keeperman's views on art that tells the whole truth and Christopher Scalia's book on novels conservatives will love. Douthat argues that both right-wing and left-wing perspectives can capture aspects of reality in a non-propagandistic way. He uses examples like V.S. Naipaul's novels and the "Star Wars" series "Andor" to illustrate how ideological art can succeed through unsettlement and unexpected sympathy, rather than conversion.</p>

          <p>Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is sidelined for the remainder of the playoffs after undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured right achilles tendon. The injury casts doubt on the Celtics' title defense and Tatum's playing status for next season. The Celtics face a 3-1 deficit against the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. Tatum's injury may prompt changes to the team's payroll and roster, considering their luxury-tax status and potential financial implications.

          <p>The FDA and CDC have issued a safety notice recommending that adults over 60 years old pause use of the Ixchiq chikungunya vaccine due to reports of serious adverse events, including neurologic and cardiac events, with two resulting in death. The FDA warns that Ixchiq, which contains a live, weakened version of chikungunya, may cause symptoms similar to the virus. The FDA plans to conduct an "updated benefit-risk assessment" for Ixchiq use in those over 60 years of age. At the time of the vaccine's approval, the FDA described chikungunya as an "emerging global health threat," with at least five million cases reported over the past 15 years.</p>

An ex-guerrilla fighter, he gave away much of his salary while in office to charity. Mujica had been under treatment for cancer of the esophagus since spring 2024, when the affliction was diagnosed. Mujica oversaw the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world's most socially liberal democracies, legalizing marijuana and same-sex marriage, enacting the region's first sweeping abortion rights law and establishing Uruguay as a leader in alternative energy.</p>

          <p>A bill to legalize assisted dying in Scotland has passed an initial vote at Holyrood, allowing terminally ill, mentally competent adults to seek medical help to end their lives. The bill would need to clear two more phases of parliamentary scrutiny before it could become law. Supporters describe the bill as a progressive move to ease the suffering of dying Scots, while opponents raise concerns about safeguards for vulnerable people. The Scottish government is officially neutral on the matter. The vote on the bill's general principles passed by 70 votes to 56.</p>

          <p>Privacy advocates are urging states not to comply with USDA requests for food stamp data, citing concerns over unlawful data demands and potential government surveillance. The USDA is seeking sensitive personal data from SNAP applicants and recipients, including names, dates of birth, addresses, and Social Security numbers, going back to January 1, 2020. The agency plans to request the data through third-party payment processors that contract with states. Civil liberties and privacy advocates say the USDA's directive could set an alarming precedent and allow the federal government access to states' data while making an end run around states.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria during a state visit to Saudi Arabia, throwing an economic lifeline to the war-torn country. Trump said he made the decision after speaking with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The decision represents a sea change for Syria, breaking the economic stranglehold on a country seen as critical to the stability of the Middle East. The move was met with cheers and standing ovations at a business forum in Riyadh and celebrations in Syrian cities.</p>

          <p>Two former Shen Yun dancers have filed a lawsuit alleging forced child labor and brutal conditions within the performing arts group, which is known for its ties to Falun Gong and its contentious relationship with the Chinese government. The suit claims that children as young as 13 worked grueling 15-hour training schedules at least six days a week, in exchange for little pay and inadequate education. Shen Yun has denied the allegations, stating that it operates "with integrity" and is "committed to upholding the highest artistic and ethical standards." The lawsuit follows a New York Times investigation into Shen Yun's treatment of young performers.</p>

          <p>In a unique twist, three women swap mothers for a candid conversation about their choice to be child-free in “M/other.” The filmmaker, Iris Zaki, is a woman who has never wanted children and the person who had the hardest time accepting that was her mother. Zaki made this film to put that experience onscreen in a world where the right of women to make decisions about their bodies and life choices is still questioned, where child-free women are often seen as broken or selfish. The film captures a deeply personal and ongoing conversation and may help us all be better understood.</p>

          <p>Despite the stock market's recovery to pre-tariff levels, investors remain cautious due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies. The 10-year government bond yield is in line with the start of the year, and recent inflation data was lower than expected. Investors are trying to understand the effects of existing tariffs on consumer spending and corporate profits. The Federal Reserve is also adopting a wait-and-see approach, holding off on further interest rate cuts until the inflationary impact of tariffs is clearer. Uncertainty is slowing economic growth, as businesses delay investment decisions and consumers reduce spending. (not investment advice)</p>

The project aims to create a flu shot that doesn't require annual updates and protects against other respiratory viruses. Experts are surprised by the plan to use a whole killed virus approach, which is considered antiquated. The project's $500 million price tag and the selection of a technology developed by NIH scientists without independent review are also raising eyebrows. Experts believe that newer, more advanced technologies are showing more promise with fewer side effects.</p>

          <p>California's ethnic studies mandate, set to take effect this fall, is facing uncertainty as Governor Newsom withholds state funding, delaying the requirement. The funding pause has left school districts in limbo, while the course is also facing renewed controversy. Some religious and political conservatives view the state’s guidelines for ethnic studies as “woke” ideologies in education. The mandate requires students entering 9th grade to pass a one-semester class at some point during their high school years, but it does not take effect unless the state provides more money to pay for the course.</p>
