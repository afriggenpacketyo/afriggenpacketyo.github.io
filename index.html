          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering selling or giving away his red Model S Tesla after his relationship with Elon Musk soured. Trump initially purchased the electric vehicle to show support for Tesla and Musk's involvement in the administration's efforts to cut government spending. The decision to possibly part with the Tesla comes after a public fallout between Trump and Musk over policy disagreements. This marks a significant shift from their previously aligned stance. </p>

Financial professionals suggest that diversifying portfolios with foreign stocks is a savvy move over the long term. Adding foreign stocks can help guarantee exposure to different economic cycles and growth drivers. (not investment advice)</p>
