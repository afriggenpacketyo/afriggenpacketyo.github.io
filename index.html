          <p>Russian forces launched drone strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, injuring nearly 50 people and damaging residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, according to local officials. The attacks occurred hours after a separate strike in Zaporizhzhia wounded over 20. President Zelenskyy criticized the slow pace of allied support in bolstering Ukraine's air defenses, emphasizing that the strikes targeted civilian areas. Russia announced a three-day ceasefire coinciding with Moscow's World War Two commemorations, which Kyiv denounced as a manipulative gesture timed for a parade. Relevant context: The city of Kharkiv has remained a repeated target of Russian attacks since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
