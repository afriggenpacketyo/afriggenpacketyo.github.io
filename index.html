          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for international cooperation to establish a global consensus on AI governance, emphasizing the need to balance development with security. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Li criticized monopolistic control over AI technology, implicitly targeting US restrictions on chip exports. He announced a Chinese-led initiative to promote open access and collaboration, ensuring AI benefits all nations rather than a select few. The call comes amid an intensifying tech rivalry between the US and China.</p>

          <p>The Welsh women's rugby team achieved a significant victory over Australia in Brisbane, marking their first win under head coach Sean Lynn. After a challenging Six Nations campaign where they lost all five games, this win provides a crucial morale boost ahead of the Rugby World Cup. Despite an early lead by Australia and a weather delay, Wales rallied with key tries from Nel Metcalfe. The team's strong defensive performance in the second half secured the hard-fought win.</p>

          <p>A prominent pro-life group is hailing the upcoming closure of two Planned Parenthood facilities in Houston, Texas, as a major victory. The closures include what the group describes as the largest abortion facility in the Western Hemisphere. Planned Parenthood cited rising operational costs, staffing shortages, and low reimbursement rates as reasons for the decision. This development occurs in the context of ongoing Republican efforts to restrict abortion access and defund the organization following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p>

          <p>Spain's women's national football team is set to face England in the Euro 2025 final, marking a significant transformation for the squad. Their 2023 World Cup victory was overshadowed by a sexism scandal involving former federation president Luis Rubiales. Since then, the team has undergone "profound changes," allowing players to focus solely on football and fostering a more unified, relaxed environment. This final offers La Roja a chance to win their first European crown and celebrate a major achievement without controversy.</p>

To offset costs, many European luxury houses are planning price increases. The market also shows divergence, with certain product categories like jewelry and leather goods performing better than others, highlighting brand-specific appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier scientific and engineering talent, partly due to challenges these individuals face in the United States. Stricter US visa policies and university funding cuts have made it difficult for some international PhD students to complete their studies, creating an opportunity for Chinese firms. Companies like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract this talent, aiming to harness advancements in AI and fuel their expansion into global markets. This trend supports the rapid growth of China's quant fund sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Democratic congressmen have formally requested that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a copy of a "birthday book" reportedly compiled for the late sex offender. The book is said to contain messages from powerful figures, including a crude poem allegedly written by Donald Trump. The lawmakers argue the book's contents are essential for congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation. The request follows a report that the book is in the possession of the estate's executors.</p>

          <p>Following Elon Musk's tease of expanding Tesla's robotaxi service, California regulators have clarified the company's limitations within the state. The California Public Utilities Commission stated that while Tesla can operate a private car service for "friends and family," it must use non-autonomous vehicles with human drivers. Tesla is not authorized to transport the public in autonomous vehicles, with or without a safety driver, for a fee. This clarification comes as the DMV separately accuses Tesla of misleading consumers about its "Full Self-Driving" capabilities.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former New York congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to begin his seven-year prison sentence. Santos was sentenced for a wide range of fraud-related crimes, including wire fraud and identity theft, after fabricating his biography to defraud voters and donors. Prosecutors stated he used his campaign for personal enrichment, spending funds on luxury goods and personal expenses. Following his sentencing, Santos appealed to President Trump for a chance to prove he is "more than the mistakes I've made."</p>
