          <p>Prince Andrew faces renewed scrutiny after newspaper reports revealed an email suggesting continued contact with Jeffrey Epstein in February 2011, contradicting his prior claims of severing ties. The email, with an intimate tone, undermines his defense and has led to calls for further royal sanctions, including removal from Royal Lodge and stripping of titles. The King has reportedly cut Andrew's funding, and his exclusion from royal events is expected to continue.

Home runs from Andrew Vaughn, William Contreras, and Brice Turang powered the Brewers' offense, while a combined pitching effort held the Cubs to just one run. This victory sets up an NLCS rematch with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who previously eliminated Milwaukee in 2018. The win was particularly sweet for Brewers fans, coming against their rival and former manager Craig Counsell, as they look to continue their playoff run.</p>

          <p>Alison Davis was found not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, whose death from multiple skull fractures was initially deemed an accident. Prosecutors argued Alison beat Kevin to death, citing her inconsistent statements and "unnatural" behavior, while the defense maintained he fell down steep stairs, hitting his head on a banister post. Expert medical witnesses presented radically different conclusions regarding the cause of death and the nature of his injuries. The jury ultimately sided with the defense's expert, highlighting the prosecution's lack of a murder weapon and holes in their theory, leading to Alison's release after 17 months in jail.</p>

          <p>William Bordsen, accused of beating Robert Murphy to death, has been returned to jail after a judge revoked his $400,000 bond due to new evidence.

The victim's family expressed relief, attributing the bond revocation partly to increased scrutiny on the criminal justice system.

The administration's move to lay off workers, an unprecedented step during a shutdown, aims to pressure Democrats, while unions have filed lawsuits to block the firings, highlighting significant political and economic instability.</p>

The article argues that leaders must develop stronger mechanisms to protect climate policy from political cycles, as populist narratives exploit the disconnect between immediate costs and deferred benefits. It emphasizes that the greatest threat to net-zero ambitions is the systematic dismantling of viable policy frameworks, rather than technological or capital challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has laid off more than 100 employees at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the nation's primary mental health agency, amidst a government shutdown. These cuts are part of a broader reduction in force across federal agencies, with sources expressing shock and confusion over the rationale. SAMHSA, responsible for the 988 suicide prevention hotline and billions in grants, has seen its workforce nearly halved under the current administration.

          <p>The traditional autumn climbing season in the Himalayas is becoming increasingly perilous due to unpredictable weather patterns, with the monsoon now extending into October. Meteorologists report almost annual extreme rainfall episodes during this period, leading to dangerous blizzards and landslides. A recent shock blizzard stranded hundreds near Mount Everest, resulting in one death, while another mountaineer died on Mera Peak. Scientists attribute these changes to increased moisture in the air from global warming, which turbocharges weather systems, making conditions more severe and challenging for trekkers and mountaineers. The article highlights the growing risks and impact on mountain tourism.</p>

          <p>An appeals court has ruled that National Guard troops sent by President Trump to Illinois can remain in federal control but cannot be deployed, pausing their use for federal property protection or patrols. This decision follows a federal judge's temporary block, which found no substantial evidence of a 'danger of rebellion' justifying the deployment. Democratic senators criticized the administration for stonewalling their attempts to inspect an immigration facility and deliver supplies to protesters. The article highlights the ongoing legal and political battle over federal versus state authority in deploying military forces domestically, with courts affirming states' sovereignty.</p>
