          <p>Germany is grappling with a significant labor market paradox, as new data reveals a "hidden reserve" of 3.1 million people who wish to work but are inactive. Key barriers include childcare shortages for women and health concerns for men, creating a disconnect with businesses that are simultaneously lamenting severe staff shortages. In a separate national issue, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is defending a legal framework for potential military conscription, arguing for preparedness while stressing that voluntary service currently remains the priority due to logistical constraints. These discussions highlight Germany's concurrent challenges in workforce utilization and national security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is set to publish a new rule that removes the 30-day warning period before levying fines on individuals in the U.S. illegally. This change, proposed by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, allows for the immediate imposition of financial penalties for offenses like illegal entry or failure to comply with removal orders. Fines can range up to $1,000 per day for non-compliance with a removal order. The administration frames this as a necessary consequence for breaking immigration laws, while also offering to waive fines for those who self-deport using the CBP Home app.</p>

          <p>Leicester City has confirmed the departure of manager Ruud van Nistelrooy by mutual agreement, over two months after the club's relegation from the Premier League. The 48-year-old Dutchman's tenure saw the team win only five of 27 matches, leading to their drop into the Championship division. The prolonged nature of his exit, which occurred well after the season's conclusion, had been described as baffling by some club observers. His departure finalizes a period of significant difficulty for the East Midlands club following a challenging season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the University of California, Davis, indicates that illegal disposable e-cigarettes may pose a greater health risk than traditional cigarettes due to high levels of toxic heavy metals. Researchers tested popular, non-FDA-authorized vape brands and found hazardous concentrations of lead, nickel, and antimony, all of which are classified as carcinogens. The levels of these metals, particularly lead and nickel, were found to exceed cancer risk limits, with one brand exposing users to as much lead as smoking 19 packs of cigarettes. The findings raise significant public health concerns, especially given the popularity of these devices among adolescents and young adults.</p>

          <p>Guangdong province, a major economic hub in southern China, plans to create a domestic version of the renowned Canton Fair to help its export-focused companies pivot to the internal market. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to strengthen China's economic self-reliance amid weakening external demand and global trade friction. The plan aims to involve around 20,000 enterprises in promotional activities and includes measures like encouraging e-commerce platforms to feature sections for domestic sales of export goods. However, some industry insiders are skeptical, noting that numerous similar events have failed to address the core challenges of sluggish consumer demand.</p>

          <p>The discussion around privatizing the U.S. air traffic control (ATC) system has re-emerged, although the current administration is focused on a multi-billion dollar investment to modernize the Federal Aviation Administration. Proponents of privatization point to models like Canada's NAV CANADA, arguing it allows for more flexible investment in technology, while opponents raise concerns about safety, complexity, and potential disadvantages for smaller airports. Despite past pushes for privatization, many aviation industry groups are now unifying behind the government's plan to upgrade equipment and hire more controllers, viewing a fight over privatization as a distraction from needed modernization.</p>

          <p>Health policy researchers are expressing concern that the number of uninsured Americans could significantly increase if the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is passed. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation, which prioritizes tax cuts, could result in 10.9 million people losing health insurance by 2034. The bill proposes major reductions in federal support for Medicaid and could make it harder for individuals to qualify for coverage, potentially forcing more people to pay for care out-of-pocket. This development comes as the U.S. continues to grapple with a complex and fragmented healthcare system where many already fall through coverage gaps.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a critical trade summit, the European Commission is reportedly frustrated with China's negotiation tactics, metaphorically referring to them as dealing with a "stinking fish." The analogy highlights the EU's annoyance that its primary demands involve asking Beijing to remove retaliatory measures it imposed in the first place, such as tariffs on EU brandy. Brussels is also seeking an end to Chinese probes into dairy and pork products, which are seen as punitive actions. This sentiment reflects the increasingly tense and challenging nature of the EU-China trade relationship as both sides prepare for high-level talks.</p>

          <p>A growing number of working people in Germany are finding their wages insufficient to cover living costs, leading to an increased reliance on state welfare benefits. In 2024, approximately 826,000 employed individuals depended on the "BÃ¼rgergeld" benefit, an increase of 30,000 from the previous year. Critics argue this trend indicates that the national minimum wage, currently â‚¬12.82 per hour, is too low to keep up with rising costs, particularly rent. While economists point out that most recipients work part-time, advocates argue this is often due to a lack of childcare, highlighting a systemic issue where work does not always pay enough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's car production plummeted in May to its lowest level for that month since 1949, excluding the pandemic lockdown period. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), output fell by nearly a third compared to the previous year, with only 49,810 units produced. The sharp decline is largely attributed to new 25% U.S. tariffs, which caused exports to the American market to halve as manufacturers like Jaguar Land Rover halted shipments. An upcoming deal to reduce these tariffs is providing some optimism, though factory retooling for electric vehicles also contributed to the production slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>International legal efforts to hold Russia accountable for its war in Ukraine are advancing with the establishment of a new special tribunal. The Council of Europe and the Ukrainian government have signed an agreement to create this court, which will focus specifically on the "crime of aggression," aiming to prosecute high-ranking Russian leaders for the decision to wage war. This tribunal, likely to be based in The Hague, is designed to close a jurisdictional gap left by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which cannot directly prosecute Russian officials for aggression. The move is seen as a crucial step toward ensuring there is no impunity for the war's instigators.</p>

Market sentiment was boosted by a White House announcement that President Trump might extend a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which was set to expire. The positive market performance was also supported by a reduction in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, contributing to a broad-based rally across various sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

Journalists visiting countries like Eswatini and Lesotho have documented the devastating on-the-ground effects of the suspended program.

          <p>Businesses across the United States are growing concerned that the Trump administration's intensified crackdown on immigrants could choke off a critical supply of labor for the U.S. economy.

The administration's efforts, which include workplace raids and revoking temporary work permits, are creating fear and instability among immigrant communities.

          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a significant 9.1% year-on-year drop in May, marking the largest monthly decline since October of the previous year.

Despite a recovery in retail sales, intense price wars are eroding profit margins for businesses as they compete for market share.

          <p>Japan has carried out its first execution since 2022, hanging Takahiro Shiraishi, who was convicted of murdering nine people in 2017. Shiraishi, dubbed the "Twitter killer," contacted his victims, eight women and one man aged 15 to 26, on the social media platform X after they had posted about suicidal thoughts. He lured them with promises to help them die before strangling and dismembering them. The execution took place amid ongoing debate in Japan over capital punishment, a practice for which public support remains high despite criticism from international human rights groups.</p>

          <p>A Japanese court has sentenced a 23-year-old South Korean woman to a three-year prison term, suspended for four years, for injuring eight students in a hammer attack. The incident occurred in January at Hosei University's campus in a suburb of Tokyo. The court found Yoo Ju Hyun guilty but determined that her actions were significantly influenced by a mental disorder, including an obsessive-compulsive disorder. The presiding judge noted that while the attacks were dangerous, there was no evidence the victims had bullied her as she had claimed.</p>

          <p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer Honor has taken a significant step toward an initial public offering (IPO) by completing its pre-IPO guidance filing with China's securities regulator. This move positions the company for a potential listing on the mainland's A-share market. The decision comes as the A-share market shows signs of recovery in the second quarter after a slow start to the year. According to consulting firm Deloitte, regulators' efforts to restore market confidence and improve the quality of IPO candidates are beginning to show success, fostering a more active market environment for companies like Honor.
