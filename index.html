          <h2>Trump Administration Pauses Social Security Benefit Cuts for Student Loan Defaults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 20:26:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has temporarily halted its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision marks a reversal in policy, as the administration had previously announced the resumption of collection activities on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio after a nearly half-decade pause due to Covid-era policies. The government possesses the authority to seize borrowers' tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits, potentially reducing checks by up to 15%. This reprieve provides older student borrowers with additional time to rectify their debt and avoid reduced benefits, addressing concerns that such reductions could leave retirees without sufficient funds for basic necessities. </p>

          <p>Following a Molotov cocktail attack on a crowd of Jewish Americans in Boulder, Colorado, the Jewish community is experiencing heightened fear and concern.

Experts note a rise in anti-Jewish hate crimes in recent years, with attacks becoming more frequent and intense.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering allowing Iran to continue low-level uranium enrichment for an unspecified period as part of a proposed nuclear deal. While the White House insists the terms of the deal are "very tough" and prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, this proposal could potentially anger Republicans and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who advocate for zero nuclear enrichment. According to reports, Iran would be restricted from building new enrichment facilities, would have to dismantle critical infrastructure, and would be forced to halt new research on nuclear centrifuges.

          <p>A judge in California, appointed by President Trump, has blocked the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area. The judge ruled that the government has not provided adequate due process to those facing deportation under the act. This ruling adds to the legal challenges surrounding the administration's use of the wartime law to deport individuals accused of gang membership. The Supreme Court has also weighed in, stating that the government must provide individuals with an opportunity to challenge their deportation under the act.</p>
