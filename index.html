          <p>Greece continues to battle five major wildfires across the country as a severe heatwave persists, with temperatures forecasted to reach up to 44°C (111°F). Firefighters are concentrating their efforts on large blazes on the islands of Kythira and Evia, where evacuations have been ordered and significant damage to property and land has occurred. The government has formally requested additional firefighting aircraft from the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism to combat the fires, which have been intensified by high winds and scorching temperatures. Officials have described the situation as extremely dangerous, with a high risk of new fires breaking out.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza during his upcoming meeting with US President Donald Trump. Starmer will likely welcome American efforts to secure a ceasefire and explore what more can be done to achieve one urgently, as previous talks have stalled. The discussion comes amid dire warnings from aid agencies about mass starvation in Gaza, with Israel facing mounting international pressure over the crisis. The UK government has been working with Jordan on aid drops and is accelerating efforts to evacuate critically ill children.</p>

          <h2>The Historical and Economic Origins of Tipping Culture in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping in the United States has roots in the post-Civil War era, where it emerged as a method for employers to avoid paying fair wages to formerly enslaved Black workers in service jobs. This system was later solidified by the lobbying efforts of groups like the National Restaurant Association. The federal tipped minimum wage has been frozen at $2.13 per hour since 1991, meaning customers' tips are essential for workers to reach the standard federal minimum wage. This article explains how this history shapes the current, often contentious, debate around tipping and worker compensation.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men deported from the United States to El Salvador's notorious CECOT mega-prison have described experiencing brutal abuse, including beatings, sexual assault, and inhumane living conditions. The men were sent to the maximum-security facility, built for accused gang members, under a controversial Trump administration policy after being accused of gang affiliation without evidence. Recently freed as part of a prisoner exchange, these former detainees are among the first to speak publicly about their time inside CECOT, which one described as "hell on Earth." Human rights groups have condemned the deportations as a violation of due process and international law.</p>

While both countries thanked him for his concern, and Cambodia accepted the ceasefire request, shelling reportedly continued overnight. Thailand has maintained its position that dialogue must precede a ceasefire. Trump's intervention comes a week before US tariffs on both nations are set to increase, and he has linked the resumption of trade talks to an end to the fighting.</p>

          <p>Mainland China has condemned a failed recall vote against Beijing-friendly Kuomintang lawmakers in Taiwan, labeling it an unpopular act of "political manipulation" by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). A spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office accused the DPP of provoking political strife and attempting to suppress dissent. The statement reflects the ongoing tensions across the Taiwan Strait, which have intensified since the election of the DPP's William Lai Ching-te, whom Beijing views as a separatist. The recall attempt's failure is being framed by Beijing as a rejection of the DPP's agenda by the Taiwanese people.</p>

          <p>In states like Georgia, which have some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the U.S., community organizers are encountering significant obstacles in their efforts to open freestanding birth centers. These centers, staffed primarily by midwives, are intended to provide a safe, home-like alternative to hospitals for low-risk pregnancies. However, advocates report that resistance from local hospitals, who are reluctant to lose potential revenue or partner on patient transfers, and doctors' fears of malpractice liability are stalling these much-needed projects.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientific research suggests that climate change is contributing to an increase in the frequency of sinkholes around the world. The intensification of extreme weather events, particularly cycles of severe drought followed by heavy rainfall, is a key factor. Droughts lower the water table and weaken subterranean support, and subsequent intense rain adds sudden weight that can cause the ground to collapse. This phenomenon is becoming more common in susceptible regions with soluble bedrock, known as "karst terrain," posing growing risks to homes and infrastructure in places like Turkey, the US, and Brazil.</p>

          <p>Residents in Gaza have responded to reports of a temporary humanitarian pause with a mix of cautious optimism and deep-seated fear that it will not be enough. While any relief is welcomed, many Gazans feel that a few aid convoys are merely a painkiller for a crisis that requires a permanent cure: an end to the war. They describe extreme shortages of fresh food, clean water, and medicine, with malnutrition becoming widespread, especially among children. The sentiment on the ground is that without a lasting political solution, they will remain trapped in a cycle of hope and despair.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A wave of prominent comedians has recently pushed back hard against what they perceive as politically motivated corporate pressure, particularly following CBS's cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." Jon Stewart on "The Daily Show" and the creators of "South Park" delivered blistering, high-profile satires targeting media companies, censorship, and the Trump administration. This coordinated comedic response demonstrates that satirists are leveraging their platforms to show they will not be intimidated, turning the controversy into a powerful statement on free expression and corporate accountability.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread concern over President Trump's threatened tariffs, U.S. stock markets like the S&P 500 have been surging to record highs. This article explores the disconnect, attributing the market's strength to a surprisingly resilient economy, a solid labor market, and corporate profits that have held up better than feared. Additionally, many investors seem to believe the president's bark is worse than his bite, a theory dubbed the "Trump Always Chickens Out" trade. However, fears remain that the full economic impact of tariffs has not yet been felt and that markets are priced for a perfection that may not last. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China have selected Stockholm, Sweden, as the neutral location for their upcoming third round of trade negotiations. This move to neutral European territory, following talks in Geneva and London, marks a significant shift from the bilateral meetings held during President Trump's first term. Analysts suggest the choice of a third country indicates a desire for a more level playing field between the two economic superpowers. The selection of Stockholm is also seen as a reflection of Sweden's international reputation as a trusted facilitator of dialogue and cooperation.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has revealed that a planned 45,000-capacity music festival in Wales, named Monmouth Rising, was an elaborate fiction created by a convicted fraudster named James Kenny. He falsely claimed to have booked major headliners like The Killers and Pulp, secured millions in funding, and received government backing. Kenny managed to deceive employees, suppliers, and industry insiders before the scheme unraveled when payments failed to materialize and documents were flagged as potential forgeries. The festival, billed as the world's first hydrogen-powered music event, was ultimately a "festival made of paper."</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering changes to planning and licensing regulations in England and Wales to better protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints. Under the proposed reforms, developers building new homes near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, and permissions for new bars and outdoor dining would be streamlined. The initiative aims to reverse the long-term decline in the pub industry and bring vibrancy to struggling town centers. The move comes after several beloved venues faced closure threats due to complaints from newly arrived residents.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian President John Mahama has launched an ambitious "24-Hour Plus Program" aimed at transforming the nation's economy and creating widespread employment. The policy envisions key industries, such as manufacturing and agriculture, operating around the clock in three eight-hour shifts, a significant departure from the current standard. While the government hopes this will shift Ghana from an import-based economy to self-sufficiency and create 1.7 million jobs, economists raise concerns. They point to significant hurdles, including the need for billions in funding, infrastructure deficits like reliable power, and the challenge of securing private sector buy-in.</p>

She claims she shot him in self-defense after a tumultuous four-year relationship that began just 13 days before they married. The story traces their chaotic history, which included a failed ballet company, mutual accusations of abuse and poisoning, and a contentious custody battle over their daughter. The narrative culminated in the fatal shooting, with forensics suggesting Doug was not facing Ashley when he was shot, challenging her self-defense claim.</p>
