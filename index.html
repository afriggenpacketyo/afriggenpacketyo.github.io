          <p>Renowned musician Billy Joel, 76, is closing his Long Island motorcycle shop, 20th Century Cycles, and auctioning his personal collection. This decision follows his recent diagnosis with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his balance, vision, and hearing. The condition, which involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the skull, has also led him to cancel all tour dates for the next two years to focus on recovery and physical therapy. The shop had been a passion project for Joel, intended to showcase vintage motorcycle aesthetics and support the local Oyster Bay community.</p>

          <p>The states of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are sending hundreds of National Guard members to Washington D.C. at the request of the Trump administration. This deployment is intended to support a federal initiative aimed at overhauling policing and addressing crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. The move has been framed by the administration as a necessary response to a public order emergency, though city officials note that violent crime is lower than during President Trump's first term. The increased federal presence has sparked protests from residents concerned about a military occupation and federal overreach.</p>

          <p>More than 2,500 migrants have successfully crossed the English Channel in small boats within the first 11 days of a new UK-France migrant deal taking effect. The "one in, one out" pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one person with a strong asylum case. However, with removals to France not yet underway, the crossings have continued unabated, bringing this year's total to around 28,000. Concerns are also rising about the use of larger, more dangerous dinghies by smuggling gangs, potentially capable of carrying over 100 people at once.</p>

          <h2>A Personal Reflection on How Life Experience Deepens the Appreciation of Art</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 03:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on how her perception of Renaissance art transformed from youthful indifference to profound connection through life experiences. Initially dismissing classical art as unrelatable, she found new meaning in its themes after facing personal trauma, contemplating motherhood, and simply growing older. The article contrasts her early cynicism with a later ability to connect with the emotional depth in works by artists like Piero della Francesca and Raphael. This evolution highlights how significant life events can unlock a deeper understanding and emotional resonance with art that once seemed distant or uninteresting.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Palestinians are fleeing Gaza City's Zeitoun neighborhood due to intense and continuous Israeli bombardment, which the local municipality describes as "catastrophic." At least 40 people were reported killed across Gaza on Saturday, while the UN warns of widespread malnutrition and unfolding famine. In a related development, a general strike is planned in Israel to protest the government's plan to occupy Gaza City, with demonstrators arguing the move endangers the lives of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The Israeli military has indicated it will resume allowing tents into Gaza for displaced populations ahead of its planned operation.</p>

          <p>British fighter Lerone Murphy has positioned himself as a top contender for the UFC featherweight title after a spectacular first-round knockout of Aaron Pico at UFC 319. Taking the fight on just three weeks' notice, Murphy landed a stunning spinning back elbow to secure the win and extend his undefeated career record to 17-0. Following the victory, he called for a championship bout against current titleholder Alexander Volkanovski. The event also saw Khamzat Chimaev dominate Dricus du Plessis to win the middleweight title, landing a record-breaking 529 strikes in a lopsided decision.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has forced an end to the Air Canada flight attendants' strike, ordering both parties into binding arbitration less than 12 hours after the work stoppage began. The strike, which had already stranded over 100,000 travelers, prompted Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu to intervene, citing risks to the national economy. The union, CUPE, criticized the move as a violation of their constitutional right to strike and accused the government of siding with the airline. While flight attendants will return to work, full service restoration could take days, and the core contract disputes over pay and unpaid work will now be settled by a third-party arbitrator.</p>

          <p>Cold case detectives captured Bryan Patrick Miller, the "canal killer" responsible for two murders in the 1990s, through an elaborate undercover sting at a Phoenix restaurant. After genetic genealogy linked the crime scene DNA to the Miller surname, a detective posed as a security consultant and met Miller for a meal to covertly obtain his DNA from a water glass. Despite the detective's initial skepticism that the mild-mannered Miller could be the killer, the DNA proved to be a direct match. Miller, known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona, was arrested 11 days later and ultimately convicted.</p>

Critics also question the legality of the arrangement, which some view as an unconstitutional tax on exports, while the administration is still finalizing the legal framework.

          <p>A long-standing principle for setting speed limits in the U.S., known as the "85% rule," is now being reconsidered by some states amid rising traffic fatalities. The rule suggests that a road's speed limit should be set at the speed that 85% of drivers travel at or below, assuming most people drive at a safe speed. However, critics argue this creates a feedback loop where speeding drivers cause limits to be raised, ignoring the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. In response to a spike in road deaths, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that this is a guideline, not a mandate, encouraging communities to also consider factors like pedestrian activity and crash history.</p>

The protests were initially sparked by a deadly railway station collapse last year, which critics blame on government corruption, but have since grown into widespread demands for early elections. President Aleksandar Vučić has condemned the violence as a foreign plot, while his ally Russia has pledged its support for his government.</p>

          <h2>China Develops Hypersonic Drone Carrier Concept with Innovative Rotating Wing</h2>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a revolutionary single, rotating "scissor wing" design, an idea once explored by NASA. The design allows the aircraft to optimize performance across different speed regimes, from takeoff to hypersonic flight at Mach 5. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as the aircraft accelerates, it pivots to align parallel with the fuselage. This configuration transforms the entire vehicle into a "waverider," reducing drag and enabling efficient flight at extreme speeds, overcoming a major challenge in aerospace engineering.</p>

          <h2>Colorado Dentist Accused of Murdering Wife with Poisoned Protein Shakes</h2>

          <p>Colorado dentist James Craig has been charged with the first-degree murder of his wife, Angela, whom prosecutors allege he killed by poisoning her protein shakes. An autopsy revealed Angela Craig died from lethal concentrations of cyanide and other toxins, including arsenic. Investigators claim that in the weeks before her death, her husband researched undetectable poisons online, created a secret email alias to purchase arsenic and potassium cyanide, and was allegedly motivated by an affair and financial troubles. Craig has pleaded not guilty, with his defense suggesting he has a history of depression and may have purchased the poisons for his own suicide.</p>
