          <p>NPR's 'Consider This' examines Vladimir Putin's objectives three years into the war in Ukraine, a question global leaders are grappling with as Trump seeks a deal to end the conflict. Despite Putin's claims of wanting peace talks, Russia has intensified aerial attacks on Ukraine, leading to increased criticism from Trump. Angela Stent, a Georgetown University professor and Brookings Institution fellow, provides insights into Putin's worldview and strategic goals, drawing from her book 'Putin's World: Russia Against the West and With the Rest.' The discussion aims to clarify Putin's true intentions amidst conflicting signals and escalating violence.</p>

          <p>Investors are increasingly favoring short-term Treasury investments due to concerns and volatility in the bond market, with ultrashort opportunities attracting the most capital. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) are among the top ETFs in investor flows this year. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has also significantly increased its holdings of T-bills, now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the trade dispute between the U.S. and China would be resolved during a conversation between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. This comes after President Trump accused China of violating their trade agreement by withholding critical exports like rare earth minerals. Bessent acknowledged that China is holding back products essential for industrial supply chains, characterizing this as unreliable behavior, but maintained that the administration's goal is to "de-risk," not "decouple," from China. Bessent also addressed concerns about potential price hikes for American consumers, suggesting that some companies will absorb the tariff costs while others may not. (not investment advice)</p>

He voiced disappointment with the GOP's multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, deeming it detrimental to DOGE's efforts, and this statement reflects a complex relationship with the administration and its fiscal policies.</p>

The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) stated that it delivered aid without incident and dismissed reports of casualties as false, though previous GHF distributions have been marred by chaos and allegations of Israeli troops firing on crowds.

Despite early struggles and multiple dropped catches by England, Root's partnership with Will Jacks put the team within reach of victory. Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope set up West Indies' total, but England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid, contained the lower order.</p>

          <p>Netflix's Tudum live event at the Kia Forum in Inglewood gathered over 9,500 fans to promote upcoming series, movies, and franchises, including "Squid Game," "Wednesday," and "Stranger Things."

Netflix's Chief Marketing Officer Marian Lee emphasized the event's focus on celebrating fans and giving back to them, while also promoting the company's upcoming content. The event drew comparisons to Disney's D23 fan convention, raising questions about whether Netflix has the same level of fandom as Disney.</p>

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick emphasized that the tariffs are not going away, while National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence in the Supreme Court's support.

          <p>The White House has withdrawn the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA, days before a Senate confirmation vote, with President Trump stating he will announce a new nominee. The White House spokeswoman Elizabeth Huston stated that the next administrator for NASA will “help lead humanity into space and execute President Trump’s bold mission of planting the American flag on the planet Mars”. According to OpenSecrets, Isaacman donated to Democrats throughout his career, dating from 2009 through the 2024 election.</p>

          <p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg and 11 other activists have set sail for the Gaza Strip on a ship carrying aid to "break Israel's siege" of the territory. "Game of Thrones" actor Liam Cunningham and French MEP Rima Hassan are also on board the Madleen, and the activists hope their trip will raise "international awareness" over the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Thunberg expressed deep concern over the situation in Gaza, and the mission follows a previous attempt to reach Gaza that failed after a ship was attacked by alleged drones.</p>
