        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases beyond April of next year, but at a slower pace than initially planned, while keeping its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 0.5%. The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen, with the total amount of purchases declining to about 2 trillion yen in early 2027. This decision reflects the BOJ's cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid economic uncertainties, especially concerning potential impacts from U.S. trade policies. The BOJ aims to balance reducing its balance sheet with supporting economic stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, some shipping companies are choosing to avoid the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial waterway for oil and container trade. The Strait's importance stems from its role as a gateway for oil and a vital entry point for container ships heading to Dubai's Jebel Ali Port. This caution mirrors the industry's unease, reminiscent of the Red Sea disruptions caused by Houthi rebels. Freight rates have already increased, and insurance rates could rise depending on further escalation. Optimism remains tempered due to the uncertainty surrounding maritime risks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump left the G7 summit early, citing matters "much bigger" than ceasefire planning between Israel and Iran, and urged Iranians to evacuate Tehran. G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel while calling for de-escalation in the Middle East, condemning Iran as a source of regional instability. Trump's departure followed French President Emmanuel Macron's comments about a potential ceasefire offer, which Trump refuted. The G7 also addressed global trade concerns amid Trump's tariff policies, with the UK securing a trade deal but Japan still in negotiations. The situation underscores the complex geopolitical landscape and economic tensions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, implementing portions of a tariff agreement reached last month. The deal, announced at the G7 summit, includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and does not address the removal of charges on steel imports. The order allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year, and removes tariffs on certain aerospace products. While some tariffs remain, the agreement is viewed as a positive step for UK businesses.</p>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also returned to Washington, while U.S. officials affirmed that the U.S. is not joining Israel's military offensive. Trump has urged Iran to sign a deal limiting its nuclear program, amid ongoing exchanges of airstrikes and missile attacks between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made little progress in bridging gaps over tariffs during their summit, raising doubts about a quick, mutually beneficial deal to protect Japan's auto sector. After a 30-minute meeting, Ishiba emphasized the need for any agreement to serve both countries' interests, with bilateral talks continuing. The U.S. granted a 90-day tariff reprieve, but Ishiba did not confirm extension discussions. Japan is urging the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy, particularly the 25% tariff on autos, a critical sector for the Japanese economy. This impasse underscores the challenges in trade negotiations amidst Trump's "America First" agenda.</p>

          <p>Following the dismissal of one juror and concerns about another in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial, legal expert David S. Seltzer suggests that sequestering the jury from the trial's outset could have prevented these issues. Seltzer argues that jury problems arise when jurors discuss case facts outside the jury's presence, violating court instructions. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani emphasized that jurors must adhere to court rules or face removal. The concerns stem from possible communications between a juror and a former colleague regarding jury service, highlighting the challenges in maintaining an impartial jury.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 01:08:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold has surpassed traditional safe havens like Treasurys, the yen, and the Swiss franc, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference attribute this to gold's independence from government liabilities. Concerns about fiscal sustainability and geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, have fueled gold's demand. The dollar index has weakened, and U.S. Treasurys faced a sell-off after tariff rollouts and credit rating downgrades, compromising their safe-haven status. Gold's appeal lies in its stability amidst volatile policymaking and unchecked debt growth.</p>
