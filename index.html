          <p>Elon Musk announced the end of his 130-day appointment as a "special government employee," thanking President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. Musk, who led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), stated that the DOGE mission would continue to strengthen throughout the government. A White House official confirmed Musk's departure, stating that his off-boarding would commence Wednesday night. Musk also expressed concern that the new spending bill undermines the work of his DOGE team. The role was limited to 130 days as a special government employee, and the end date was set for this week.</p>

          <p>A partial glacier collapse in Switzerland triggered a landslide that buried 90% of the village of Blatten, prompting a search and rescue operation for a missing 64-year-old man. Authorities had evacuated the village earlier in the month as a precaution due to concerns about the glacier's stability. The landslide sent mud and rocks into the valley, submerging homes and raising the risk of an ice jam that could flood downstream villages. Swiss glaciologists have expressed concerns about accelerated glacier retreat due to global warming, with Switzerland losing 4% of its glacier volume in 2023.</p>

          <p>A recent US court ruling blocking some of Donald Trump's trade tariffs has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. Tariffs on UK car exports, which attract 27.5% duties, and steel and aluminum, at 25%, remain unchanged as they were not included in the ruling. While the UK has a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, it has not yet been implemented. The government is working to implement the deal quickly, but the White House intends to appeal the court's decision, creating uncertainty for businesses.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported strong fiscal first-quarter earnings, driven by continued sales growth in its data center division, which is fueled by demand for GPUs for artificial intelligence software. However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's sales in China, a potential $50 billion market, with the company missing out on $2.5 billion in sales during the April quarter. Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Nvidia is focusing on AI inference, where its GPUs serve AI models to millions of customers, and its latest Blackwell chips are designed to improve AI answers through reasoning.

          <p>An episode of the "Interesting Times" podcast explores the declining fertility rate and the failure of men and women to couple off, suggesting technology plays a significant role. The discussion highlights the rise in singles, with over half of people between 18 and 34 being single in the U.S., China, and South Korea. The podcast suggests that increased personal online entertainment, like Netflix, sports betting, and social media, distracts from personal interactions. The conversation also touches on the importance of male-female friendships and the impact of economic forces on relationships.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration would "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields."

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced its third failed test flight, ending in a fiery failure minutes after separating from the Super Heavy booster. Despite achieving its greatest progress to date, the unmanned spacecraft began spinning out of control, and the company later confirmed a "rapid unscheduled disassembly." While the mission successfully used a previously flown booster, problems with the booster, loss of contact, and inability to maintain attitude during orbital coast led to the failure. Some observers question whether SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" approach will pay off, given the repeated costly failures.</p>

          <p>A South African woman, Kelly Smith, received a life sentence for selling her 6-year-old daughter, Joshlin, who has been missing since February 2024. Smith's boyfriend and another man also received life sentences for kidnapping and human trafficking. During the trial, a witness testified that Smith had sold Joshlin for around $1,000 to a traditional healer for her body parts. The judge said she had been sold for slavery or practices similar to slavery.</p>
