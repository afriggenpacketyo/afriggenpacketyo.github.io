          <p>Casey Michel's article in the New York Times discusses the ongoing concerns about the Trump family's financial dealings with foreign entities, drawing parallels to past administrations, including the Clinton Foundation and Hunter Biden's activities. The article suggests that while Trump's actions may seem unprecedented, they are part of a larger pattern of politicians profiting from their positions, highlighting the need for stricter regulations to prevent such corruption. Michel emphasizes that Trump has dismantled key weapons against illicit finance and damaged the nation's reputation as a global leader in combating dirty money. The piece advocates for legislation to prevent family members of high-ranking officials from engaging in foreign lobbying and investments.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards' New York Times article compares the diverging paths of night train travel in Europe and the United States. While Europe is experiencing a renaissance in sleeper train travel, driven by environmental concerns and investment in infrastructure, the United States continues to prioritize cars and air travel, neglecting its rail system. The article argues that America's car dependence has negatively impacted mental health and that investment in rail networks could offer a more sustainable and communal mode of transportation. Richards contrasts Europe's commitment to rail infrastructure with America's focus on niche, unproven transit projects.</p>
