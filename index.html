        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs, despite beating Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The company plans to offset $1 billion of these costs through remediation actions, expecting a net impact of $1.5 billion. Ford cited near-term risks such as potential supply chain disruptions and future tariffs as reasons for pulling the guidance. The tariff impact is notably less than the $4 billion to $5 billion that General Motors said it expected to incur as a result of Trump's tariffs, as Ford imports fewer vehicles than its crosstown rival.</p>

Despite this growth, the company has not yet shared a price range for its IPO, which was initially filed in March. Hinge's attempt to go public occurs during a period of economic uncertainty and market volatility, prompting other companies like Klarna and StubHub to delay their IPOs.

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at incentivizing prescription drug manufacturing in the U.S. by streamlining the approval process for pharmaceutical companies to build new production sites. The order directs the FDA to reduce approval times, raise inspection fees for foreign plants, and improve enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting. The White House estimates current timelines of five to ten years for building new manufacturing capacity are unacceptable for national security. Trump stated the goal is to bring medical supply chains back home, especially in light of potential tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, though some companies like Pfizer are pushing back against these tariff plans.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 17 state attorneys general and Washington, D.C., are suing the Trump administration over an executive order that halts approvals, permits, and loans for wind energy projects. The states argue that Trump lacks the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process and is jeopardizing the development of a power source critical to their economic and climate goals. The lawsuit challenges the order, which paused approvals for both onshore and offshore wind energy projects, and asks a federal judge to declare it unlawful. The administration has also suspended federal funding for floating offshore wind research in Maine and revoked a permit for a proposed offshore wind project in New Jersey.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA following ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport. Schumer cited a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, old technology, and cuts at the FAA as contributing factors to the chaos.

The problems at Newark began a week prior, escalating due to a shortage of air traffic controllers and equipment outages, compounded by runway construction.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport temporarily lost radar and communications with aircraft due to an equipment failure, according to their union. The incident, which occurred on April 28, resulted in massive flight delays and raised concerns about aging U.S. aviation infrastructure and staffing shortages. Following the incident, some controllers took time off to recover from the stress, exacerbating the staffing shortage. United Airlines announced it would cut 35 flights a day from its Newark hub to ease disruptions, with CEO Scott Kirby citing technology issues and a significant number of FAA controllers walking off the job.</p>

The lawsuit aims to reverse regulatory changes made by the FDA since 2016 that expanded access to mifepristone, and seeks to outlaw the medication for anyone under 18 and restrict telemedicine prescriptions.</p>

Cuomo's website page includes polling data, pre-edited video clips, and detailed spending instructions for the Fix the City super PAC.

          <p>A shooting at El Camaron Gigante restaurant in Glendale, Arizona, resulted in three deaths and five injuries after a fight broke out between at least two groups of people. The incident occurred during a Cinco de Mayo event, and police believe multiple shooters were involved. The individuals killed were identified as three men aged 17, 21, and 29, with the teenager and 21-year-old being brothers. Police consider the shooting an isolated incident between individuals known to one another, and have said there does not appear to be any lingering danger to members of the public.</p>

Farmers are concerned about a potential third consecutive year of losses, with lenders becoming more cautious and machinery sellers feeling the impact.
