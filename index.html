          <p>Since arriving at Villa Park in 2022, Unai Emery has significantly reshaped Aston Villa, bringing in new staff and supported by Monchi, with whom he previously achieved Europa League success at Sevilla. The club invested approximately £295m in 23 signings, including loan acquisitions of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio. Despite facing financial constraints due to Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules, Emery has maintained a clear recruitment strategy, focusing on players who share his vision for a cultured, measured passing game. Emery's meticulous attention to detail and tactical acumen have earned him praise from players and established him as one of the club's greatest managers.</p>

          <h2>Economists Question Trump's Tariff Formula, Cite Inflated Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-05 14:41:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are challenging the formula behind President Trump's "reciprocal" tariff plan, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions and results in inflated tariff rates. They contend that the elasticity rate used in the formula is lower than it should be, leading to tariff rates that are significantly higher than justified. If the assumptions are adjusted, the economists say, no country's tariff would exceed 14%, and most would be at the baseline rate of 10%.</p>
