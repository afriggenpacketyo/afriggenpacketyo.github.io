          <p>Moderna has announced plans to lay off approximately 10% of its global workforce by the end of the year, a move aimed at cutting costs as sales of its COVID-19 vaccine continue to decline. The company's CEO, Stephane Bancel, stated the decision is essential for financial discipline while continuing to invest in future products, with up to eight new products potentially launching in the next three years. This restructuring follows a significant drop in the company's stock value and a first-quarter sales report that missed Wall Street estimates. The company is also reducing annual operating expenses by about $1.5 billion by 2027 to align with current business realities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comcast has exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter expectations for both revenue and earnings, driven by the sale of its Hulu stake and strong performance from its film studios and theme parks. Despite this, the company continues to struggle with a declining broadband customer base, losing 226,000 subscribers in the quarter. To offset these losses, Comcast is focusing on its mobile services, which added a record 378,000 new lines. The streaming service Peacock saw its subscriber numbers hold steady at 41 million while its financial losses narrowed significantly compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is warning the UK government of potential strike action if improvements are not made to nurse compensation and career progression. A survey of over 170,000 RCN members revealed that 91% believe the recent 3.6% pay increase is insufficient. The union's primary focus is on reforming the NHS contract, known as Agenda for Change, to prevent experienced nurses from being stuck on lower pay bands. If the government fails to engage in meaningful negotiations over the summer, the RCN plans to hold a ballot for industrial action in the autumn, signaling widespread dissatisfaction within the profession.</p>

          <p>Once united by their pioneering mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, Moderna and BioNTech are now pursuing distinctly different business strategies, leading to a stark divergence in their stock performance. Moderna has doubled down on its mRNA pipeline, investing its pandemic earnings into developing more vaccines, but faces a 72% stock slide over the past year. In contrast, BioNTech has used its windfall to diversify through acquisitions, notably in the promising field of cancer treatments, resulting in a 29% stock gain. This strategic split highlights differing visions for the future, with Moderna focusing on its core technology while BioNTech broadens its portfolio to mitigate risk beyond vaccines.

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is traveling to Israel to push for a ceasefire and address the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The visit comes as international pressure on Israel mounts, with several European nations, including Canada, now planning to recognize a Palestinian state. This diplomatic shift has drawn a sharp rebuke from U.S. President Trump, who suggested it could jeopardize a trade deal with Canada. Wadephul stated that Germany cannot remain passive due to its historic responsibility, as the suffering in Gaza has reached an "unimaginable scale" and Hamas continues to hold hostages while refusing a ceasefire.</p>

The company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy business and operational improvements in its Aetna insurance division. While the insurance unit is still managing higher medical costs, particularly in Medicare Advantage plans, its medical benefit ratio was better than anticipated. The positive results mark a successful quarter under CEO David Joyner, who is leading a multi-year turnaround plan that includes significant cost-cutting measures and strategic investments.

          <p>President Trump has announced new 25% tariffs on Indian goods and warned of further penalties due to India's significant purchases of energy and military equipment from Russia. The move is part of a broader U.S. strategy to pressure nations trading with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, with threats of "secondary tariffs" up to 100% or more. Indian officials have criticized the policy, citing "double standards," as many Western nations also continue to import Russian fuel. The situation creates a diplomatic and economic challenge for India, which maintains a trade surplus with the U.S., its largest export market, and relies on Russia for over a third of its crude oil imports.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Trump to implement a cut. The 9-2 vote reflects the central bank's cautious approach as it assesses the economic impact of the administration's tariff policies. In separate news, Texas lawmakers have unveiled a proposed congressional redistricting map designed to create up to five new Republican-leaning districts. The move, initiated by Governor Greg Abbott, follows Justice Department concerns about the constitutionality of four existing districts and is expected to face significant legal challenges from Democrats who view it as partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>An NHS England report has concluded that healthcare providers repeatedly failed to acknowledge the concerns of a mother whose five-year-old son, Yusuf Nazir, died from a severe lung infection. Yusuf, who had asthma, was sent home from Rotherham General Hospital and died eight days later from multiple organ failure. The investigation identified 13 missed opportunities to escalate his care, highlighting a reliance on clinical metrics over caregiver insight. The boy's family is demanding a full inquest and accountability, stating that Yusuf was left to die in pain while they trusted the NHS to protect him. Health officials have accepted the report's findings and recommendations.</p>

          <p>Following another deadly wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukrainian cities that killed at least eight people, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for tougher international action, including a change of regime in Moscow. He argued that the current Russian leadership is mentally stuck in a past century of violence and will continue to destabilize neighboring countries even after the war. Meanwhile, Russia claimed to have captured the key frontline town of Chasiv Yar, though Ukrainian officials disputed this. The attacks, which injured 88 people, were described by Zelenskyy as "showcase killings" in response to global calls for peace.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his country intends to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, following similar declarations by the UK and France. The move, which is conditional on democratic reforms within the Palestinian Authority, marks a significant shift in Canadian foreign policy. The decision was met with criticism from Israel, which called it a "reward for Hamas," and a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump, who stated it would make a trade deal between the two nations "very hard." This development further isolates the U.S. among its key allies on the issue of Palestinian statehood amid the ongoing crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Hospital officials in Gaza report that more than 50 Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured after Israeli forces allegedly fired on crowds waiting for aid trucks near the Zikim crossing in northern Gaza. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency accused Israeli troops of shooting at the civilians, while the Israeli military stated it fired only "warning shots" and was unaware of casualties from its fire. The incident occurred as U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Israel for talks amid stalled ceasefire negotiations and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with the UN warning that famine is now actively unfolding in the besieged territory.</p>

The attack, which killed six people and injured over 100, was allegedly carried out to incite religious tensions. The judge ruled that the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to convict the accused on terrorism and criminal conspiracy charges.

          <p>An issue with the UK's air traffic control system caused significant disruption on Wednesday, leading to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounding thousands more. The provider, NATS, apologized for the "radar-related" problem, which it said was resolved within an hour by switching to a backup system. However, the knock-on effects are expected to last for days as airlines struggle to reposition aircraft, crew, and stranded passengers during the peak summer travel season. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander confirmed the incident was isolated and not the result of malicious activity, while urging passengers to check with their airlines before traveling.</p>

          <p>A significant shift in public opinion shows that Democratic voters are increasingly sympathetic toward Palestinians, creating a widening gap with the party's establishment, which has largely maintained its pro-Israel stance. Recent polls indicate a majority of Democrats now sympathize more with Palestinians, a dramatic reversal from just a few years ago. Despite this, Democratic leaders in Congress continue to provide substantial military aid to Israel and engage with its leadership, influenced by powerful lobbying groups like AIPAC. This disconnect highlights a major challenge for the party as it struggles to align its policies with the evolving views of its base, particularly younger voters.</p>

The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, and the case has been dismissed. Sharpe confirmed the news on his podcast, stating he had learned of ESPN's decision earlier in the week and expressing regret that the news might overshadow his brother's induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of tariffs, explaining them as taxes on imported goods used by governments to influence trade and protect domestic industries. President Trump has employed tariffs extensively, arguing they reduce the U.S. trade deficit and encourage American manufacturing, though many economists warn they can lead to higher consumer prices and slow economic growth. The administration has imposed various tariffs on specific goods and countries, often using them as a negotiating tactic to secure more favorable trade deals. Recent agreements have been reached with the UK and EU, while negotiations with China and threats against countries like Canada and India continue to create global economic uncertainty.

The targeted companies have a combined total of over nine million monthly visitors and were prioritized based on user numbers and the potential risk of harm.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's second withdrawal from UNESCO is part of a broader assault on democratic values, free expression, and human rights. The authors contend that targeting cultural institutions is a common tactic of authoritarian regimes seeking to control historical narratives and erase diversity, drawing parallels to actions by Russia and the Taliban. By dismissing UNESCO's work, which includes global Holocaust education and protecting artistic freedom, the U.S. forfeits its moral leadership. The authors urge Congress to oppose the move and call on funders to increase support for artists and cultural institutions to counteract the administration's isolationist policies.</p>
