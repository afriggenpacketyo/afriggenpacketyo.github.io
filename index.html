          <h2>Mass Shooting in Philadelphia Leaves Three Dead and Nine Injured</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries early Monday. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel reported that the incident occurred just before 1 a.m., with victims ranging in age from 15 to 24. Investigators recovered nearly 140 pieces of ballistic evidence, suggesting an exchange of gunfire involving a weapon modified for automatic fire. One person has been taken into custody, but multiple shooters are believed to be at large, marking a violent holiday weekend for the city despite an overall year-over-year decrease in shootings.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose significant new tariffs on more than a dozen countries, with levies set to take effect by August 1. Japan and South Korea will face a 25% tariff, while other nations including Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand will see rates as high as 40%. The White House stated the move is part of a strategy to create fair global trade, extending a previous tariff freeze to allow for these new rates to be implemented. Economists have expressed concern that these broad tariffs could reignite inflation and slow economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following his acquittal on federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges, Sean “Diddy” Combs received a standing ovation from fellow inmates, according to his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo. The attorney detailed a defense strategy that acknowledged Combs's history of domestic abuse while arguing it did not constitute trafficking, a tactic that proved successful with the jury. While acquitted of the most serious charges, Combs remains incarcerated after being found guilty on lesser prostitution-related offenses and awaits sentencing. His legal team is now focused on his personal rehabilitation, including re-entering a program for domestic abusers.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a landmark Los Angeles restaurant operating since 1908, has announced it will permanently close on August 3. The owner cited a combination of factors crippling independent restaurants, including the pandemic's lingering effects, rising costs, high rent, and local crime. Known as one of the originators of the French dip sandwich, the establishment's closure has been met with an outpouring of support and nostalgia from the community. The ownership group hopes the closure serves as a wake-up call to address the challenges facing small, historic businesses in the city's downtown core.</p>

As the only major Republican candidate officially in the 2026 race, Carr's early fundraising is a strategic move to build momentum against potential wealthy rivals like Lt. Gov. Burt Jones. The race is set to be a key battleground, with Republicans aiming to maintain control and Democrats seeking to build on recent statewide victories. Carr, who has aligned with Governor Brian Kemp, previously faced opposition from Donald Trump in the 2022 primary.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price dropped by 6.8% on Monday after CEO Elon Musk announced the formation of a new political entity, the "America Party." The announcement followed President Trump signing a major policy and spending bill, a move Musk had opposed. Musk's deeper dive into politics has reignited investor concerns about the potential impact on the Tesla brand, which previously faced scrutiny during his involvement with the Trump administration. Analysts suggest that many investors are exhausted by Musk's political activities, especially as the company navigates a period of declining sales and increased market challenges in both the U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city particularly vulnerable to the urban heat island effect, a local environmental group is pioneering solutions on a single "cool block." The project by GreenRoots involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat rather than absorb it. Research shows such interventions can significantly lower peak temperatures in dense urban areas, which are experiencing more extreme heat days due to climate change. This initiative, developed in partnership with the city, serves as a potential template for other urban communities looking to combat life-threatening heat waves.</p>

While the Fed has kept its key interest rate steady, other factors like the 10-year Treasury yield also impact mortgage rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the rules surrounding wage garnishment, a legal tool creditors use to collect unpaid debts directly from a person's paycheck. For most consumer debts, garnishment can continue until the entire debt, including interest and fees, is fully paid, which could take years. Federal law generally limits the amount garnished to 25% of disposable income, though rules differ for federal student loans and tax debts, which can be more aggressive. Individuals facing garnishment can challenge it in court, negotiate with the creditor, or seek protection through bankruptcy, but acting quickly is crucial to mitigate the financial impact.</p>

          <p>The White House and Senator Ted Cruz are defending the National Weather Service against criticism that federal cuts may have contributed to the devastating floods in Texas. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called accusations from Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer a "depraved lie," detailing a timeline of alerts issued by the NWS. Schumer had called for an investigation into whether staffing shortages impacted forecasting abilities. While officials emphasized that warnings were issued, questions remain about their timing and effectiveness, as many were sent when people were likely asleep, contributing to the catastrophic loss of life.</p>

          <p>Russia's former Minister of Transport, Roman Starovoy, has died from a suspected suicide just hours after being dismissed from his post by President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian state media. The 53-year-old reportedly shot himself in his car west of Moscow. His dismissal followed a weekend of major air traffic disruptions caused by Ukrainian drone attacks. Shortly after, another senior transport official, Andrei Korneichuk, also died suddenly of a reported cardiac arrest during a meeting. These deaths are the latest in a series of sudden, often suspicious, fatalities among high-profile Russian officials and business leaders.</p>

          <p>As it faces a September 17 deadline to sell its U.S. operations or face a ban, TikTok is reportedly preparing to release a new, separate app for its American users. According to reports, the new app could launch by September 5, with the existing app potentially ceasing to function in 2026. This move is seen as an attempt to address U.S. government security concerns over the company's Chinese ownership and data privacy. The potential sale of TikTok's U.S. arm has attracted interest from several buyers, though any deal would require approval from both the U.S. and Chinese governments.</p>

          <p>AI-focused cloud company CoreWeave has announced it will acquire data center infrastructure provider Core Scientific in a $9 billion all-stock deal. The acquisition will give CoreWeave ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of power capacity across Core Scientific's U.S. data centers, eliminating future lease obligations and expanding its infrastructure to better compete with major cloud providers. Core Scientific, which emerged from bankruptcy earlier this year, has increasingly focused on high-performance computing. The transaction is expected to close in late 2025, after which CoreWeave may choose to divest or convert Core Scientific's existing cryptocurrency mining operations.</p>

          <p>This article examines the surge of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric directed at Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor. It highlights attacks from national political figures, including calls for his deportation despite his U.S. citizenship, and connects this to several broader trends. The author argues that Trump-era politics have normalized cruelty and xenophobia, that Mamdani is a target of anti-Palestinian racism due to his advocacy, and that Islamophobia remains a broadly acceptable form of bigotry in American politics. The piece suggests this rhetoric will likely intensify as the election approaches, further toxifying the political environment.</p>

          <p>AC Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri has confirmed that Croatian midfielder Luka Modrić will join the Italian club in August. The 39-year-old football star announced in May that he would be leaving Real Madrid after a decorated 13-year tenure with the Spanish powerhouse. His departure will follow Real Madrid's participation in the Club World Cup in the United States. During his time with Real Madrid, Modrić, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner, secured an impressive 28 trophies, including six Champions League titles and four La Liga championships, cementing his legacy as one of the game's greats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Social Security Administration communication described President Trump's new spending bill as providing major tax relief, but tax experts say this is misleading. The legislation does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients as claimed. It does, however, introduce an additional senior deduction of up to $6,000, which could indirectly lower the tax liability for some middle-income seniors by reducing their adjusted gross income. Critics note this change will also reduce tax revenue for the Social Security program, potentially accelerating its projected insolvency date by a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly defended former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, calling the coup-attempt case against him a "WITCH HUNT" and urging prosecutors to drop it. In a social media post, Trump compared Bolsonaro's legal troubles to his own, framing it as a political attack. This prompted a sharp rebuke from current Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who stated that Brazil is a sovereign nation and will not accept foreign interference in its judicial process. Bolsonaro is currently on trial for allegedly plotting a coup against Lula after his 2021 election loss.</p>

          <p>This satirical article humorously critiques the media's framing of normal workplace activities as new "Gen Z trends." It recounts a typical workday using exaggerated, trend-focused language, describing sleep as a "Microdeath" and taking a bathroom break as visiting a "Microspa." The piece pokes fun at terms like "quiet quitting" and "micro-retirement" by applying the same style of analysis to mundane actions like breathing ("Lung Bathing") or commuting without internet ("Tiny Detox"). The author uses this satirical lens to comment on the often-alarmist tone of reporting on generational differences in the modern workforce and their supposed new habits.</p>

          <p>At least 10 people have been killed in Kenya during widespread anti-government protests, according to the national human rights commission. The demonstrations, held on the anniversary of the historic "Saba Saba" protests that called for multiparty democracy 35 years ago, saw police close off roads in the capital, Nairobi. Today's protesters are demanding President William Ruto's resignation over issues including corruption, the high cost of living, and police brutality. Clashes erupted as demonstrators threw stones and police responded with tear gas and, reportedly, live rounds, leading to hundreds of arrests and dozens of injuries.</p>
