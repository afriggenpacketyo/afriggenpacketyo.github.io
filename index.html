          <p>Porsche is facing significant challenges due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, declining sales in China, and a struggling electric vehicle strategy. The company's CEO, Oliver Blume, described the situation as a "violent storm," leading to a scaled-back forecast for the year and expected drops in profit margins. Porsche is also consolidating production and eliminating jobs to lower overhead costs, while reassessing its electric vehicle goals and reintroducing combustion engine models. Despite these challenges, Porsche's strong brand reputation and history of adaptation provide some resilience in navigating these turbulent times. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge appointed by Obama has allowed a lawsuit targeting Elon Musk's involvement with the DOGE cost-cutting initiative to move forward, while dismissing claims against President Donald Trump. The lawsuit, brought by over a dozen states, challenges Musk's authority to issue orders within the Executive Branch outside of DOGE. Musk, who had heavily focused on the initiative, recently stated he would reduce his time spent on it to focus on other business ventures, acknowledging the difficulty of improving the federal bureaucracy.

          <p>The Trump administration has relaxed barriers in 401(k) plans to buying cryptocurrency and related digital assets. The Labor Department rescinded guidance put in place by the Biden administration that cautioned employers to exercise "extreme care" before offering crypto investments to workers. Some observers view this move as an olive branch to the pro-crypto community, while others remain concerned about the prudence of exposing retirement savings to the risks associated with digital assets.
