          <p>A federal court hearing has commenced regarding Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to prevent President Trump from firing her. Trump's legal team argues the president has the discretion to determine "cause" for removal, citing allegations of mortgage fraud as sufficient grounds. Cook's lawsuit contends her termination is illegal and lacks the necessary cause, highlighting a significant legal battle over the independence of the Federal Reserve. The case raises unprecedented questions about presidential power over the central bank's board.</p>

          <p>Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has become a significant tool for India's cultural diplomacy and global influence, often referred to as its "soft power." Promoted heavily by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the United Nations declared June 21st as the International Day of Yoga, cementing its status as a symbol of Indian national identity. While the practice fosters people-to-people connections and projects a non-threatening image of India, its global expansion has also faced criticism for over-commercialization and cultural appropriation in the West. The article explores how this cultural export has become a multi-billion dollar global industry.</p>

          <p>Matt Wright, star of the "Wild Croc Territory" television series, has been found guilty by an Australian jury on two counts of perverting the course of justice. The charges stemmed from a 2022 helicopter crash that killed his co-star, Chris Wilson, during a crocodile egg collection expedition. Wright was convicted of lying to police about the helicopter's fuel level and encouraging the injured pilot to falsify records. The verdict marks a significant moment in a painful legal journey for the victim's family.</p>

          <p>Widespread protests have broken out across major Indonesian cities after a 21-year-old ride-sharing driver, Affan Kurniawan, was killed after being hit by a police vehicle. Demonstrators are expressing frustration over cost-of-living issues and housing perks for politicians, leading to clashes with police who have deployed tear gas and water cannons. President Prabowo Subianto has issued an apology for the "excessive actions of the officers," and seven officers have been found to have violated the police code of ethics. The unrest represents a significant challenge for the government amid growing public discontent.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Proposes Rule to Ban Abortions at VA Facilities, Including for Sexual Assault and Incest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 10:30:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations that would prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from performing or counseling on abortions, even in cases of sexual assault and incest. The only exception would be if the mother's life is endangered, a standard that critics argue is too narrow and could lead to preventable deaths. This move reverses a 2022 Biden administration policy that expanded abortion access for veterans following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The proposal has drawn significant backlash from veterans' groups and abortion rights advocates, who highlight the high rates of sexual assault experienced by female veterans.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has blocked $4.9 billion in foreign aid previously approved by Congress by using a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission." This tactic, last used nearly 50 years ago, involves the president proposing to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that Congress does not have the 45 days required to act, causing the funding to lapse. The cuts will affect the State Department and USAID, aligning with the administration's broader policy of reducing foreign assistance.

          <p>The Trump administration's AI Action Plan, which prioritizes deregulation and bans "ideological dogmas such as DEI," could embed and automate existing health inequities into medical practice for decades. The policy incentivizes developers to use data sets that avoid political scrutiny, potentially excluding information on marginalized communities. This article argues that as AI becomes integral to medical diagnostics and treatment, using biased or incomplete data will calcify health disparities into clinical tools and standards of care. This mirrors historical instances where flawed, race-based assumptions were encoded into medical calculators, leading to widespread harm.</p>

          <p>Full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold faces a challenging period after being dropped from the England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. This decision by coach Thomas Tuchel comes as Alexander-Arnold experiences a difficult start to his career at Real Madrid, where he was recently benched after a subdued debut. Tuchel has previously expressed reservations about the player's defensive abilities, and his exclusion now suggests a significant battle to secure a place in the national team. The setback compounds the pressure on the 26-year-old as he also competes for a starting position at his new club.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled the Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, revoking a directive signed by Joe Biden that had extended her security detail for an additional year. By law, former vice presidents are entitled to six months of protection after leaving office, which for Harris expired in July. The move has been condemned by some as an act of political retaliation, coming just before Harris is set to begin a national book tour. A White House official stated that a recent threat assessment found no cause to warrant extending the protection beyond the legally mandated period.</p>

The expansion of the war comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the bodies of two hostages, including Ilan Weiss, had been recovered from the enclave. The move has drawn international condemnation and protests within Israel from hostage families who fear for the safety of those still held captive.

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD reported a nearly 30% drop in profits for the second quarter compared to the previous year, despite a surge in overseas sales. The decline is attributed to an intense price war in its domestic market, where increased EV adoption has led to aggressive competition and marketing. While the company's revenue grew 14%, its earnings fell short of analyst forecasts. The results highlight the challenging conditions within China's EV market, where even dominant players like BYD are feeling the pressure on their profit margins from fierce local competition.

          <p>While the median price of condominiums in the U.S. has fallen recently, they may not be the bargain they appear to be due to rising associated costs. Factors such as increasing HOA dues, higher insurance premiums, and new building reserve requirements are adding significant monthly expenses for owners, often offsetting the lower purchase price. The price drop is largely driven by an oversupply of condos, particularly in states like Florida and Texas. Experts advise potential buyers to look beyond the sticker price and carefully analyze a building's financials to understand the true long-term cost of ownership. (not investment advice)</p>

However, savers can still find attractive rates around 4.50% by employing specific strategies. The article recommends considering online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead costs. It also suggests using online marketplace sites to easily compare offers and focusing on short-term CDs of one year or less, as they currently tend to provide the highest annual percentage yields.

A ministry spokesman urged Washington to cease all official exchanges with the island, which Beijing considers a rogue province that must be reunified with the mainland. The visit, which included a meeting with Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te, comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-China relations. The U.S. does not officially recognize Taiwan but is legally bound to provide it with arms for self-defense.</p>
