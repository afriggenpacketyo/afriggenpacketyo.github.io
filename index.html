            <h2>Trump's Tariffs Raise Concerns of China Joining CPTPP</h2>

            <p>President Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on numerous countries, styled as America’s “Liberation Day,” has triggered market instability and recession fears. Analysts suggest this move could inadvertently pave the way for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), as nations seek to counterbalance American trade policies. The CPTPP, a successor to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, includes countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, and the UK. China applied to join in 2021, and the global backlash against Trump's tariffs might bolster its application. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have reached an agreement allowing ICE to access taxpayer information for locating illegal immigrants subject to deportation. This memorandum of understanding establishes a process for ICE to request taxpayer data from the IRS to aid investigations of criminal illegal immigrants who have failed to leave the US after a judge's removal order. While the Treasury Department emphasizes protecting law-abiding taxpayers' privacy, a criminal exception obligates the agency to assist law enforcement. Some IRS officials worry the policy will hinder tax collection from illegal immigrants who are still subject to federal taxes.</p>

            <p>The Florida Gators secured their third NCAA men's basketball championship by defeating the Houston Cougars 65-63 in a closely contested game. Walter Clayton Jr.'s late-game defensive play prevented Houston from taking a game-winning shot at the buzzer, capping off a comeback victory. The Gators, who trailed by double digits earlier in the game, were led by Will Richard's 18 points and a strong defensive effort in the final minute. This win marks Florida's first championship since 2007 and solidifies coach Todd Golden as the youngest coach to win the title since 1983.</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced significant volatility as President Trump threatened additional tariffs on China, exacerbating concerns about a potential U.S. recession. Leading indexes initially fell sharply, briefly rebounded on a false report of a tariff freeze, and then declined again in the afternoon. Economists at Goldman Sachs have raised the odds of a recession to 45% due to the tariffs, citing policy uncertainty and declining business confidence. Overseas markets also suffered steep losses, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index plunging 13.2%. (not investment advice)</p>

Many CEOs (37%) anticipate cutting jobs, and nearly all whose companies sell goods and services foresee price hikes ranging from 5% to 20%. Concerns extend to potential boycotts of American brands and rising anti-American sentiment overseas. CEOs are signaling that building plans are being downsized, and few believe the administration's priorities will lead to new domestic manufacturing.</p>

            <p>Amid global trade tensions instigated by President Trump's tariffs, engagement between Europe and China has increased. Despite past turmoil and calls for de-risking, European diplomats and officials are visiting Beijing, and interest in China is rising. The author argues that increased European engagement with China could offer a contingency plan for an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship. Economists view tariffs as a sales tax on local consumers that can spark inflation, highlighting the conflict between political strategy and economic principles.</p>

            <p>Defensive miscues and missed opportunities plagued the Los Angeles Dodgers in their 6-4 loss to the Washington Nationals, highlighting a growing concern in the early season. Errors by Mookie Betts and Miguel Rojas led to unearned runs, while stellar defense from the Nationals prevented potential Dodgers rallies. Despite a strong offensive performance from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' inability to play clean baseball proved costly. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the team's need to improve defensively and on the bases.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing the use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations, but mandates that individuals must be given notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. The decision overturns a district court order that temporarily blocked all deportations under the Act, allowing them to resume. Justice Sotomayor warns that individuals unable to secure counsel may face deportation to perilous conditions. The court's decision stands on dubious legal grounds, as the Act may only be used against citizens of a country the US is at war with.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the United States will hold direct talks with Iran on its nuclear program, starting Saturday, with a meeting at "almost the highest level." Trump offered few details about the upcoming talks but said that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious. Netanyahu said he and Trump are united in the goal that Tehran will never get nuclear weapons. Trump said it would be in Tehran's best interests to make a deal with his administration, warning that if the talks weren't successful "it will be a very bad day for Iran."</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump may continue using a 1798 law to deport alleged gang members, but with certain limits. Any challenges to the wartime law, called the Alien Enemies Act, must take place in Texas, where the migrants were held, and not in Washington DC. The court granted the Trump administration’s request to lift a Washington DC-based judge’s order temporarily blocking the deportations. Despite siding with the administration, the court’s majority emphasized that judicial review is required.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to assemble a task force to change the CDC's guidance to stop recommending adding fluoride. His comments came during a press conference in Utah, which just became the first state to ban fluoride from drinking water systems. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin also announced that the EPA is reviewing "new science" on fluoride, specifically citing a report from the National Toxicology Program that found lower IQ in children with higher levels of fluoride exposure. The American Dental Association said fluoride in water was necessary for good oral health and at U.S.-recommended levels "does not negatively impact IQ levels."</p>

            <p>China has vowed to take countermeasures against any move by the United States to further raise tariffs and pledged to take firm action to stabilize the markets. China’s Ministry of Commerce said that China “firmly opposes” any moves to increase tariffs by the US and vowed to “resolutely respond” if it does so. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said it would “provide relending support if necessary to resolutely defend the stability of the capital market”.

Observers caution that diplomatic talk aside, there appears to have been few actual gains on contentious sticking points, with core disputes lingering over enforcement mechanisms, geographic scope, legal status and the role of external powers. The Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations issued an unusually tough statement last month, accusing China of “illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions” endangering maritime security.</p>
