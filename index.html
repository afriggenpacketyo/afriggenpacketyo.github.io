          <p>Apple has announced a plan to increase its spending with U.S. companies by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion. The investment includes a $2.5 billion expansion with Corning, which manufactures iPhone glass in Kentucky, ensuring all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches is U.S.-made. This announcement comes as Apple navigates increased tariffs on Chinese imports and shifts some assembly operations to other countries like India to mitigate costs. CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to discuss the plans with President Trump, continuing a pattern of U.S. investment announcements under political pressure.</p>

          <p>An active-duty sergeant, identified as 28-year-old Quornelius Radford, allegedly opened fire on his colleagues at Fort Stewart, Georgia, wounding five soldiers before being subdued by other service members. The suspect used a personal weapon, and all victims are reported to be in stable condition and expected to recover. Investigators are still determining the motive for the attack, but have indicated there is no link to terrorism or extremist beliefs. The quick actions of fellow soldiers who tackled the shooter were praised for preventing further casualties at the largest Army installation east of the Mississippi River.</p>

          <p>DoorDash reported strong second-quarter financial results, surpassing analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue, which caused its stock to rise in extended trading. The company announced revenue of $3.28 billion and a net income of $285 million, a significant turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. Total orders grew by 20% year-over-year, indicating sustained consumer demand for food delivery services. The positive report also reflects the company's recent strategic acquisitions, including British delivery service Deliveroo, as it continues to invest in new categories and international markets.

          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking boot on the shore of Utah's Fish Lake has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing in 1997. Investigators used the manufacturing date of the boot to link the discovery to the cold case, and DNA testing confirmed the identity with 99.9994% certainty. White had disappeared after going fishing alone when plans with friends fell through; his boat was found empty at the time. The discovery provides long-awaited closure for his family and the search and rescue members involved in the original search nearly three decades ago.</p>

          <p>This article outlines several strategies for homeowners looking to secure a lower interest rate on a home equity loan amidst a landscape of relatively high borrowing costs. It suggests improving personal financial health by boosting credit scores and lowering debt-to-income ratios to become a more attractive borrower. The article also recommends monitoring economic data release dates, as market fluctuations can create brief opportunities to lock in better rates. Finally, it advises homeowners to shop around and encourage lenders to compete for their business to find the best possible terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House's decision to prevent Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te from making a transit stop in New York has drawn criticism from Democrats but has been met with unusual silence from Republicans. This muted response is a significant shift for the Republican party, which has historically been a vocal supporter of high-profile engagement with Taiwan. The article notes that this change in posture may be linked to ongoing high-stakes trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. Democratic lawmakers have formally expressed "grave concern" that this move signals a concerning concession to Beijing regarding U.S. strategic interests.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic finish in The Hundred cricket tournament, the Southern Brave clinched a one-wicket victory against the Manchester Originals with just one ball to spare. Chasing a target of 132, the Brave were in a difficult position before late-game heroics from tailenders Tymal Mills and Craig Overton turned the tide. After Mills was dismissed with three runs needed, last-man Reece Topley hit a boundary on his first ball to win the match. Earlier in the game, Mills had also excelled with the ball, taking three key wickets to help restrict the Originals' total.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences indicates that fraudulent scientific research is being produced and published at an industrial scale. Researchers found evidence of "paper mills" that sell fabricated articles, and identified collusive networks of unethical authors and journal editors who expedite the publication process. The study highlights how a small number of editors at one journal handled a disproportionate number of retracted articles. This proliferation of fake literature pollutes the scientific record, making it difficult for honest researchers to build upon reliable work and potentially eroding public trust in science.</p>

While the new rule permits repairs and the replacement of existing homes to their original size, it faces opposition from some landowners.

          <p>Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is facing a severe electricity crisis, with over a third of its residents having no access to power and those connected to the grid experiencing constant unreliability.

          <p>Apple has announced it will increase its investment in the U.S. by an additional $100 billion, a move that comes amid significant pressure from President Donald Trump to onshore more of its manufacturing. This pledge is expected to encourage more of Apple's suppliers to produce components domestically. The announcement follows Trump's threats to impose higher tariffs on Apple products if the company did not shift its production away from China. While analysts note that a major supply chain overhaul will take time, the commitment may help Apple receive more favorable treatment from the White House on trade issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped over 6% after the company reported earnings that fell short of analyst expectations and provided a cautious outlook. CEO Lisa Su attributed a decline in AI business revenue to U.S. export restrictions that have halted sales of its MI308 AI chip to China. The company's guidance for the next quarter does not account for any potential revenue from these chips, as the timing for receiving the necessary licenses to resume shipments remains uncertain. This ambiguity, coupled with concerns about datacenter growth, has created unease among investors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's recent trade deals include commitments for large future purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG), but these export goals may be hindered by a new domestic policy. A U.S. Trade Representative mandate requires a growing percentage of LNG exports, eventually reaching 15%, to be transported on U.S.-built ships. However, the U.S. has not built a commercial ocean-going LNG carrier in decades, and its current shipbuilding capacity is focused on naval and domestic vessels. Experts warn this creates a significant bottleneck that could undermine the promised energy exports.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the state of the public defender system in New Orleans, reflecting on how Hurricane Katrina in 2005, while a catastrophe, ultimately became a catalyst for desperately needed reforms. In the storm's aftermath, the city's court system collapsed, leaving incarcerated individuals in a state of limbo and exposing the deep flaws in public defense. However, the destruction also cleared the way for a complete overhaul. Two decades later, the report finds a system that has been vastly improved, transforming from one of the nation's worst into a more functional and just model.</p>

          <p>President Trump is defending his firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner by claiming the agency "rigged" jobs reports, but his argument is based on a factually incorrect timeline. Trump alleged that the BLS released strong numbers before the 2024 election and then revised them sharply downward afterward. In reality, a major downward revision occurred in August 2024, months before the election, while the final report before the election actually showed a sharp slowdown in hiring. The move to fire the BLS chief has drawn widespread criticism over fears of politicizing essential, non-partisan economic data.</p>
