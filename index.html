          <p>Following US military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, American leaders, including President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have urged Iran to engage diplomatically rather than retaliate. Trump emphasized the need for peace, warning of dire consequences for Iran if it continues on its current path. Hegseth clarified that the strikes were intentionally limited to nuclear facilities and were not aimed at regime change, with Vance adding that the US is at war with Iran's nuclear program, not Iran itself. US officials are sending direct messages to Iran, offering opportunities for peaceful negotiations, and are prepared for potential Iranian responses. This is a calculated attempt to de-escalate the conflict. </p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by lowering energy costs for businesses. The plan, described by Prime Minister Starmer as a turning point for the British economy, includes scrapping green levies to reduce energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK firms. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027, exempting manufacturers from levies on bills, while the most energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges. The strategy also focuses on upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and increasing research and development spending to £22.6bn per year by 2029-30. This initiative aims to create over one million new well-paid jobs over the next decade. </p>

          <p>New satellite imagery shows the aftermath of the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, including the Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan sites. The images, taken by Maxar Technologies, reveal extensive damage, such as craters and ash, at the Fordo underground nuclear site, with tunnel entrances appearing blocked. At Isfahan, buildings related to the uranium conversion process have been significantly damaged, while Natanz shows a large crater directly over part of the underground complex. The IAEA reported no increase in off-site radiation levels, but emphasized the need for dialogue and diplomacy to prevent further escalation. These images provide a visual assessment of the impact of the strikes. </p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil trade route. This appeal comes after Iran's foreign minister warned of potential actions to defend its sovereignty following U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. Rubio emphasized that China, as Iran's major oil customer, has a vested interest in maintaining the strait's openness. Closing the Strait of Hormuz could severely impact the global economy, potentially driving oil prices above $100 per barrel, although some analysts believe the U.S. Navy would swiftly counter any Iranian attempt to block the waterway. The US retains options to deal with Iran trying to close the strait. </p>

The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch condemned the attack and urged Syria's interim authorities to ensure the protection of all citizens, while UN and US envoys also condemned the violence.

          <p>Following the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, there are concerns about potential escalation scenarios. The initial strikes may not have completely destroyed the targets, potentially leading to further bombing campaigns. Iran could also retaliate against U.S. forces or international shipping lanes, prompting American counter-escalation. The situation is further complicated by the lack of understanding of the second-order consequences, reminiscent of the 2003 Iraq War, highlighting the risk of unforeseen events causing further U.S. involvement. The worst-case scenario could involve a full-scale war aimed at regime change, leading to prolonged instability. </p>

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could increase the threat of cyberattacks, violence, and antisemitic hate crimes. The bulletin also cautions that violent extremists in the Homeland might mobilize in response to the conflict, particularly if Iranian leadership calls for retaliatory violence.

The U.S. is concerned about potential military actions against its interests in the Persian Gulf and the remnants of Iran's nuclear program. Despite the strikes, few in Washington desire a prolonged U.S. war with Iran, with Vice President Vance denying that the U.S. is at war with Iran, but rather with its nuclear program. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending its recent precision strike on Iranian nuclear sites, which was carried out without Congressional approval or prior notification to top Democratic lawmakers. Pentagon officials described the operation as the largest B-2 bomber strike in U.S. history, aimed at disrupting Iranian nuclear capabilities. While administration officials maintain it was a limited engagement, some lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, argue that the strikes lacked Congressional authorization and violated the War Powers Act. The debate centers on whether the President has the authority to act without Congressional approval in matters of national security. </p>

          <p>The United States used a series of deceptive tactics to carry out its bombardment of Iranian nuclear sites without detection. B-2 stealth bombers flew westward as decoys while the actual strike force traveled eastward, maintaining minimal communication. The operation, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, involved 75 precision-guided weapons, including bunker-buster bombs and cruise missiles. The mission also included 125 aircraft, including fighter jets and refueling planes. The US claims that Iran neither detected the inbound fusillade, nor mustered a shot at the stealthy American jets. </p>

Vance declined to confirm the complete destruction of Iran’s nuclear sites but believes the US has substantially delayed Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon. An Iranian member of parliament claimed the Fordo enrichment plant was not seriously damaged, while satellite images showed new craters but no conclusive evidence that the 40-meter-deep nuclear engineering site had been breached. The chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Dan Caine, said initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction. </p>
