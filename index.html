          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war commenced with further strikes on an Iranian nuclear research facility, prompting Iran's foreign minister to caution the United States against joining the conflict. Israel targeted centrifuge production sites in Isfahan, following earlier attacks aimed at dismantling Iran's nuclear program. An Israeli military official reported the elimination of three senior Iranian commanders, including one who allegedly funded Hamas, while Iran launched drones and missiles at Israel, resulting in minor injuries to U.S. citizens. President Trump is considering U.S. intervention, with B-2 bombers deployed to Guam, as the conflict intensifies and spreads to Gaza, where hospitals report numerous casualties from Israeli strikes, and the Israeli military continues its operations on multiple fronts. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing conflict and the potential for further escalation.</p>

The U.S. intervention defies Iran's warnings and is expected to escalate violence in the region, potentially leading to Iranian action against American military bases. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei previously warned of irreparable consequences should the U.S. engage militarily. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling prevents a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities, potentially stripping them of millions of dollars in research funding. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful, siding with universities that argued the cuts would threaten critical work in areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Similar caps on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health have also been blocked by judges.</p>

          <p>Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, located deep within a mountain, has been a significant concern for international monitors due to suspicions of clandestine nuclear weapons development. Despite Iran's denials, the facility's underground location and advanced equipment have raised concerns about its true purpose. Experts believe that destroying Fordo would require the U.S.-produced GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, carried by the B-2 bomber. The IAEA has expressed concerns about the lack of transparency at Fordo, particularly since Iran reduced cooperation with international inspectors.</p>

          <p>President Trump's public disagreement with his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities has drawn criticism. Sen. Jack Reed described Trump's rebuke as "shocking" and suggested it was politically motivated, especially as Trump contemplates military action against Iran. Trump stated that Gabbard and the intelligence community are "wrong" in their assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. This disagreement raises questions about the administration's rationale for potential military intervention in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Multiple U.S. B-2 stealth bombers have been deployed to Guam, with no further orders at this time, as tensions between Iran and the West escalate. The deployment coincides with the Trump administration weighing its options regarding Iran's nuclear program. The B-2 bomber is the only U.S. Air Force bomber capable of carrying the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a 30,000-pound bomb potentially used to target Iranâ€™s underground uranium enrichment facility. The movement of these aircraft does not necessarily indicate a final decision has been made.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a new law requiring all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, making it the largest state to impose such a mandate. The law is expected to face legal challenges based on arguments that it violates the separation of church and state. The measure requires schools to post a 16 x 20-inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents, including religious leaders, contend it infringes on religious freedom.</p>

          <p>NPR's Frank Langfitt reflects on covering both a military parade and a "No Kings" rally on the same day, noting how these events highlight America's political and cultural divisions. The military parade, featuring tanks and armored vehicles, contrasted sharply with the "No Kings" protests against the politicization of the armed forces. Langfitt suggests that these events serve as a Rorschach test, revealing the stark differences in perspectives and values within American society. By attending both events, he gained a unique perspective on the nation's complex and often conflicting ideologies.</p>

          <p>The band South Arcade discusses the inspiration behind their music, which is rooted in Y2K core, a cultural movement reflecting nostalgia for the late 1990s and early 2000s. The band members, born around the turn of the millennium, draw inspiration from artists like Rihanna, Korn, and Justice, aiming to capture the energy of that era. The Y2K hashtag has gained traction on TikTok, with millions of posts showcasing artists like Pitbull and Avril Lavigne. The appeal of Y2K core lies in its escapism and the feeling of a time when personal expression was more tangible and less reliant on digital minimalism.</p>
