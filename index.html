          <p>A major heat wave is gripping Western Europe, with health warnings issued across several countries and temperatures in Paris forecast to reach 40Â°C (104Â°F). The extreme heat has led to school closures in France and heightened wildfire risks due to drought conditions. Climate experts warn that such events are becoming more common and intense, with projections indicating that France could see a tenfold increase in heat wave days by the end of the century.</p>

          <p>A new research report published in The Lancet medical journal projects that the Trump administration's deep cuts to U.S. foreign humanitarian aid could result in over 14 million additional deaths by 2030. The study models the impact of an 83% funding reduction to USAID, which researchers say risks reversing decades of progress in global health, particularly affecting children and vulnerable populations. The cuts have been widely condemned by humanitarian organizations, with UN officials already observing severe consequences like reduced food rations in refugee camps.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the victory of socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary serves as a cautionary tale for right-wing populism. The author contends that when conservatives adopt populist tactics like advocating for state intervention in the economy, they inadvertently legitimize the more extreme promises of left-wing populists. The piece suggests that this shift away from traditional conservative principles of limited government ultimately paves the way for radical candidates like Mamdani to succeed.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces killed at least 74 people in Gaza on Monday, according to health officials and witnesses. One airstrike hit a crowded cafe in Gaza City, killing at least 30 people, including women and children. In separate incidents, Israeli gunfire reportedly killed 23 Palestinians as they were attempting to access or return from humanitarian aid distribution sites. The attacks occurred as Israel intensified its bombardment across northern Gaza, with residents describing a "scorched earth" campaign targeting remaining infrastructure.</p>
