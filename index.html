            <p>A U.S. man, identified as Akinyela Taylor, hijacked a small plane in Belize, stabbing two passengers and the pilot. Fortunately, one of the passengers, licensed to carry a firearm, fatally shot the hijacker, preventing a potential mass casualty event. Belize police have hailed the passenger as a hero, and the U.S. State Department is working with Belizean authorities to investigate the motive behind the hijacking. The plane, carrying 14 passengers and 2 crew members, landed safely after circling for two hours following the incident, averting what could have been a much larger tragedy.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The dynamics of Premier League shirt sponsorships have shifted due to globalization and technological advancements, with companies now seeking broader influence beyond local fan bases. Economic changes in countries like Japan have led to a decline in sponsorships from those regions, while emerging financial powerhouses like the Middle East are increasingly investing in these deals. Sponsorships provide companies with advertising, access to private boxes for client hosting, and relationships that can be leveraged for political influence. Experts suggest the Premier League should prioritize local community connections alongside economic sustainability.</p>

            <p>A coroner's inquest into four deaths caused by drivers with impaired vision has prompted a call for stricter eyesight regulations for motorists in the UK. The coroner's report highlights that the UK relies on self-reporting of visual conditions, unlike most European countries, leading to drivers with known vision problems causing fatal accidents. The families of the victims emphasize that these tragedies were avoidable and call for measures to prevent selfish drivers from endangering others. The coroner has labeled the current system as ineffective and unsafe, urging the Department for Transport to take action.</p>

            <p>A recent earthquake in Myanmar may have disrupted the production of rare earth minerals crucial for manufacturing in China, potentially impacting global supply chains. The earthquake could have damaged mining equipment, compromised mine safety, and obstructed transportation routes in Myanmar, a key supplier of rare earth elements to China. Analysts suggest that this disruption could lead to increased price volatility and force China to diversify its sources of these critical minerals. China relies heavily on Myanmar for dysprosium and terbium, essential for high-temperature magnets used in various technologies.</p>

            <p>New research suggests that Zheng He's Ming dynasty Treasure Fleet may have played a role in spreading domesticated brown rats around the world. Ancient silk paintings from China's Ming dynasty provide early evidence of brown rat domestication. Researchers propose that domesticated brown rats may have stowed away on Zheng He's ships, which traveled extensively across the globe. Brown rats, originating in northern China and Mongolia, have become widespread and are used in biological research.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has blocked Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive Social Security records, citing privacy concerns. The judge stated that unlimited access to personal information, including medical and financial records, would betray the government's commitment to citizens. The order prohibits DOGE from accessing records containing personally identifiable information and installing software on SSA computer systems.
