The study found that GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are associated with a 41% relative risk reduction for ORC compared to bariatric metabolic surgery (BMS). Researchers suggest GLP-1 RAs may have anti-inflammatory and metabolic regulation properties that contribute to the decreased cancer risk.
