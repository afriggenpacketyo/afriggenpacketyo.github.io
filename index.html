          <p>Joey Chestnut has won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, reclaiming his title after being banned from the previous year's event. He consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes, comfortably beating the defending champion. Despite falling short of his 2021 world record of 76, Chestnut expressed his excitement to be back and vowed to return next year. In the women's competition, Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs, continuing her long-standing dominance in the event.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, stating its readiness to enter negotiations. The proposed deal, announced by President Trump, involves a potential two-month ceasefire, though Israel has not yet publicly confirmed its formal agreement. A Palestinian official indicated that Hamas is seeking guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the truce. The ongoing conflict, which began after the October 7th attack, has resulted in a significant number of casualties in Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new spending bill does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits, despite claims suggesting it does. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65 with incomes below certain thresholds. Policy experts clarify that this provides some relief but is far from a full repeal of the tax, and it does not change the fundamental taxation of Social Security payments. The deduction, which expires in 2028, will primarily benefit higher-income seniors and will not affect low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's newly passed spending bill will create a new federal tax deduction for tipped workers, effectively eliminating their federal income tax liability on tips. The White House has promoted this as a major benefit for the working class, estimating it will increase average take-home pay by over $1,600 annually. However, critics note the tax break is temporary, expiring in 2028, and will not benefit the lowest-wage workers who earn too little to have a federal tax liability. The specifics of the deduction cap vary between the House and Senate versions of the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested hosting a UFC fight on the White House grounds as part of the celebrations for America's 250th anniversary next year. During a speech in Iowa, Trump floated the idea of building a temporary venue for 20,000 to 25,000 people to watch a championship fight on July 4, 2026. He mentioned that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would handle the event. The proposal is unprecedented, as the White House has never hosted a professional sporting event of this nature in its history.</p>

Abrego Garcia claimed in a legal filing that he endured severe beatings and psychological torture in El Salvador's notorious CECOT supermax prison. President Bukele responded on social media, posting photos and videos of Abrego Garcia in detention and questioning why he looked well if he had been starved and tortured.

The growth is particularly notable as other G7 nations have recently imposed substantial tariffs on Chinese auto imports, a measure the UK has so far avoided. Industry experts note that Chinese manufacturers are producing innovative and competitively priced cars, leading some to suggest that the UK may need to encourage local production to compete.

Polling suggests a Corbyn-led party could capture around 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters.
