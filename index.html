          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested by London police on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life, following a fire at a house in north London previously occupied by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The arrest is also connected to two other nearby fires, including a vehicle fire and another at a property also linked to Starmer. Counterterrorism police are leading the investigation due to the property's prior association with a high-profile public figure, though Starmer no longer resides there, having moved to Downing Street after becoming Prime Minister. The fires are being treated as suspicious, and investigations are ongoing to determine their cause and any potential links.</p>

          <p>Fintech companies like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo, which previously benefited from rising interest rates that boosted their net interest income, now face a challenge as interest rates decline. Lower rates raise questions about the sustainability of their business models, particularly for those heavily reliant on net interest income. Some fintechs are diversifying their revenue streams by offering services like crypto trading and mobile plans to mitigate the impact of falling rates. ClearBank, a payments infrastructure startup, experienced a pre-tax loss due to the shift from interest income to fee-based income, highlighting the potential impact of lower rates on the sector.</p>

          <p>French actor Gérard Depardieu has been convicted in a Paris court on charges of sexual assault against two women who worked on the set of a film in 2021, receiving an 18-month suspended sentence.

Depardieu denied the accusations, but the court found him guilty, adding his name to a list of sex offenders. This trial is considered a significant moment in France's reckoning with the #MeToo movement, amidst prior public support for Depardieu from prominent figures.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls declining in the first few months of the year.

While wage growth remains relatively strong, analysts believe that the recent increases in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage may be contributing to the slowdown in hiring. The Bank of England is expected to remain cautious about future interest rate cuts due to concerns about inflationary pressures from sticky wage growth.</p>

          <p>India, a powerhouse in cricket, struggles to achieve similar success in football, highlighting disparities in talent development and infrastructure. While cricket boasts young stars and a well-structured system, football faces a shortage of skilled players and lacks role models. The Indian Super League (ISL), though growing, lags behind the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) in terms of financial resources and opportunities for young players. Experts emphasize the need for grassroots investment, improved infrastructure, and a national strategy focused on youth development to elevate Indian football.</p>

          <p>China's leader, Xi Jinping, has expressed interest in expanding trade cooperation with Latin American countries beyond commodities, focusing on emerging areas like clean energy, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence. Speaking in Beijing, Xi emphasized China's role as a reliable partner amidst global turbulence, indirectly referencing trade tensions with the United States. Lula da Silva of Brazil highlighted Chinese investments in Brazilian manufacturing and renewable energy, as well as a proposed partnership for low-orbit satellites to expand internet access. This initiative aims to counter U.S. influence and promote multilateralism.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been debated in Scotland. The bill requires two doctors to assess a patient's mental fitness and confirm their terminal illness before they can request medical assistance to end their life. The vote is expected to be close, with MSPs holding a free vote, meaning they are not instructed by their parties on how to vote. Supporters argue it's a progressive move to ease suffering, while opponents raise concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister has banned the far-right "Kingdom of Germany" group, a faction within the "Reichsbürger" movement, accusing it of attempting to establish a "counter-state" within Germany. Police raids on the properties of key members resulted in arrests, including the group's self-declared monarch, Peter Fitzek. The group, with approximately 6,000 members, denies the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic and has been known to print its own passports and licenses. Security authorities have been monitoring the movement due to concerns about its potential for violence.</p>

          <p>NHS excess weight clinics in England are treating children with severely high body mass indexes (BMIs), some exceeding 50, and a disproportionate number of these children come from deprived areas. A study found that many children attending these clinics also have neurodevelopmental conditions or other health issues, prompting the clinics to offer mental health support and address underlying conditions alongside dietary advice. Digital technology, such as 'smart scales' that hide the weight number, are being used to support weight loss in children.</p>

The Army Futures Command, established in 2018, will merge its tech innovation mission into a larger entity to accelerate weapons acquisition and training, aiming to equip soldiers with the necessary tools sooner.</p>

Cities like Jakarta and Paris are implementing measures like designated bus lanes, improved public transport amenities, and disincentives for car ownership to promote public transport usage.</p>
