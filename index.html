          <p>Former President Donald Trump voiced strong support for Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has faced criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to focus on what he considers more important issues, like his claims of a rigged 2020 election. He dismissed the relevance of the Epstein case, stating that "nobody cares about" it and that Bondi should be allowed to do her job without distraction.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team claimed a 2-0 series victory against Argentina with a thrilling 22-17 win in San Juan, sealed by a last-minute try from Jack van Poortvliet. The match was tightly contested, with the score tied at 17-17 for a large portion of the second half. Despite Argentina's improved performance compared to the first Test, England's late-game execution secured their sixth consecutive Test win. The victory marks a successful tour for Steve Borthwick's team, continuing their winning streak from the Six Nations tournament.</p>

          <p>After weeks of requests and a lawsuit, Florida lawmakers were granted a tour of the "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades. Democratic lawmakers reported "appalling" conditions, including extreme heat and inadequate food, though they were not allowed to take photos. In stark contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site expressed satisfaction with the conditions, with one senator claiming the beds were more comfortable than his own at home. State officials have consistently denied the allegations of inhumane treatment.</p>

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence in China is being linked to the country's declining birth rate, as AI begins to fulfill roles traditionally met through family, such as emotional companionship and elderly care. Many young Chinese citizens feel less pressure to marry and have children, believing future technology will support a solitary lifestyle. While this trend is often viewed as exacerbating demographic challenges, some experts argue it may not be entirely bad news, suggesting the AI revolution could redefine societal structures around life and family.</p>

          <p>A Gaza hospital reported that 24 people were killed near an aid distribution point, with Palestinian witnesses claiming Israeli troops opened fire on the crowd. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated there were "no known injured individuals" from their fire, though an official mentioned warning shots were fired to disperse a perceived threat. This incident is part of a pattern of deadly events at aid sites amid a severe humanitarian crisis, with the UN reporting hundreds of such killings since March. Both sides' claims have not been independently verified due to media access restrictions in Gaza.</p>

The incident has drawn further scrutiny to the chatbot, which Musk has previously promoted as an "anti-woke" AI.</p>

          <p>Police across the United Kingdom have arrested 71 people at protests against the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The arrests, primarily for showing support for a banned group, occurred in London, Cardiff, and Manchester. The government's ban, which makes membership or support for the group a criminal offense, followed an incident where activists damaged aircraft at an RAF base. Critics, including the group's legal team, have accused the government of an "authoritarian abuse" of power and misusing anti-terror legislation.</p>

          <h2>Iga Swiatek Discusses Surprise Wimbledon Victory on Her Weakest Surface</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iga Swiatek expressed her own surprise after winning her first Wimbledon title, a victory she described as surreal on what has historically been her weakest surface. The 24-year-old, known as the 'Queen of Clay,' had never won a tour-level title on grass before her dominant 6-0, 6-0 final victory. Swiatek attributed her improved performance to having more time to practice on grass this year and focusing on her movement. Her win marks her sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces.</p>

          <p>The White Sage Fire in Arizona, located northwest of the Grand Canyon, has exploded in size, forcing the evacuation of residents and the closure of the park's North Rim. Sparked by lightning, the blaze has grown to over 19,000 acres and remains 0% contained, fueled by high temperatures, strong winds, and dry conditions. Officials have issued an extreme heat warning and successfully evacuated approximately 500 guests from the North Rim area. The dangerous conditions also contributed to the death of a 67-year-old hiker elsewhere in the canyon earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the fatal Air India crash has led one aviation analyst to believe a chip malfunction, rather than pilot error, was the likely cause. The report indicated the Boeing 787's engine fuel switches moved to the "cut-off" position almost simultaneously, starving the engines. An aviation expert pointed to a known issue with a chip in the engine's control system, for which a service bulletin had been issued, that could lead to a signal loss. This theory suggests an equipment failure caused the tragic crash that killed 260 people near Ahmedabad, India.</p>
