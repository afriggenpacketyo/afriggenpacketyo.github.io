            <p>Needham analyst Laura Martin responded to President Trump's suggestion that Apple should manufacture iPhones in the United States to avoid tariffs, stating that it's not feasible. Martin argued that Apple's costs would significantly increase if it moved production to the U.S., echoing concerns from other analysts who estimate an iPhone could cost $3,500. She added that relocating the supply chain would take years, with most experts deeming it impossible. The comments come amid investor concerns about Apple's exposure to China, which faces high tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on U.S. trading partners continued to cause market disruption, with Trump dismissing the idea of pausing tariffs for negotiations. He threatened to veto a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for tariffs and suggested additional tariffs on China for retaliatory measures. A White House official indicated a potential cumulative tariff rate of 104% on Chinese goods. Senator Thom Tillis expressed frustration, questioning who would be held accountable if the tariffs proved ineffective. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Dutch parliament has voted to ban the purchase and use of fireworks by the public, a long-standing New Year's tradition, but the ban will not take effect until after next New Year's Eve. The decision was made due to the high number of injuries and damage caused by fireworks each year, with the last New Year's Eve resulting in two deaths and over 1,100 injuries. The delay is intended to mitigate potential compensation claims from fireworks suppliers. Concerns have been raised that the final legal New Year's Eve could result in increased mayhem.</p>

            <p>The U.S. will impose a 104% tariff on Chinese goods starting Wednesday, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. This follows President Trump's threat to increase tariffs after China announced retaliatory tariffs on American products. Leavitt stated that the tariffs are designed to open negotiations with the U.S.'s trade partners, and 70 nations have already approached the White House to begin negotiations. She reiterated Trump's commitment to bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Financial advisors suggest that tax-loss harvesting can be a beneficial strategy amid stock market volatility caused by tariff concerns. This strategy involves selling losing assets to offset investing gains and lower taxes. Losses can offset gains, and up to $3,000 can be subtracted from regular income, with excess losses carried into future tax years. Investors should consider tax-loss harvesting opportunities whenever there is stock market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

Whipple sees parallels between Biden's reelection campaign and a Shakespearean tragedy, stating there was an abdication of leadership within Biden's inner circle. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts say symbols touted by federal officials as proof of gang membership are common among many Venezuelans. The U.S. Supreme Court recently backed the Trump administration's effort to deport accused members of the gang.</p>
