          <p>A recent survey across 24 countries indicates that opinions of the United States have declined in the past year, with only a third expressing confidence in President Trump's global leadership. The survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center, found that most respondents describe Trump as "arrogant" and "dangerous," with relatively few viewing him as "honest." Negative opinions of the US were particularly high in Mexico, Sweden, and Germany, while confidence in Trump's handling of specific issues, such as climate change and the Russia-Ukraine war, remains low. The findings highlight a shift in global perceptions of the US under the current administration. </p>

          <p>A coalition of 42 state attorneys general, led by New York's Letitia James, is pressuring Meta to address the proliferation of investment scams on Facebook. These scams fraudulently use images of famous figures like Warren Buffett to lure retail investors into pump-and-dump schemes, resulting in significant financial losses. The attorneys general are calling on Meta to enhance its review processes to prevent fraudulent ads from running on its platforms. The effort aims to protect social media users from deceptive investment schemes. </p>

          <p>A Pew Research Center study reveals a decline in the popularity of the United States in many countries during President Trump's second term. The survey, conducted across 24 nations, shows that overall ratings of the US have fallen in 15 countries since last spring, with Mexico, Sweden, Poland, and Canada experiencing the most significant drops. The study also highlights generational and ideological divides in opinions of the US, with younger people and those on the right of the political spectrum holding more positive views. The findings suggest a widespread erosion of the US's global image under the current administration. </p>

The consumer price index rose 2.4% over the past 12 months, up from 2.3% in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists expect President Trump's tariff policy to increase consumer prices in the coming months, with some evidence of their impact already apparent. Lower energy prices, healing supply chains, and a weakening labor market have helped to rein in inflation, but tariffs complicate the outlook. </p>
