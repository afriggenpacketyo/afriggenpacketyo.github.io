          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a preliminary ruling that European pork and its by-products are being dumped into the Chinese market, causing significant harm to the domestic industry. Effective September 10, importers will be required to provide deposits to customs, with the deposit margin determined for each specific company. This move signals escalating trade tensions and protective measures from Beijing to shield its agricultural sector from what it deems unfair competition from European Union exporters.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has strongly rejected a Western proposal for a post-ceasefire "reassurance force" in Ukraine, stating any foreign troops would be viewed as "legitimate targets." His comments came after a Paris summit where 26 allied nations, led by France, committed to deploying forces to provide security guarantees once fighting stops. Putin framed the initiative as a threat to Russian security, reiterating his long-held objections to NATO's presence near Russia's borders.</p>

          <p>The UK's retail sales volumes saw a surprising 0.6% increase in July, exceeding analyst expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This growth was largely driven by strong sales in clothing, footwear, and online retail, with businesses attributing the boost to favorable weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament. Despite the monthly rise, the ONS noted that sales over the three-month period to July were down, and it acknowledged recent errors in its data collection and reporting.</p>

          <p>Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the outgoing head of the British armed forces, has stated that the UK's national security is secure "for now and for the next few years." In an interview, he attributed his confidence to the UK's status as a nuclear power and its membership in NATO, which he described as the strongest military alliance in history. He also praised the UK's decisive support for Ukraine following the 2022 invasion, contrasting it with the more muted response to Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to impose "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not move their manufacturing operations to the United States. Speaking at a dinner with tech leaders, he indicated that firms like Apple, which have expanded domestic investments, would likely be spared from the new levies. The move is part of a broader administration effort to onshore the critical semiconductor supply chain, although specific details about the tariff rates and exemption criteria remain unclear.

          <p>According to sources familiar with the matter, most potential buyers for a stake in Starbucks' China operations have submitted bids that value the business at up to US$5 billion. This valuation, which is around 10 times the unit's expected 2025 earnings, would make a potential sale one of the largest divestments by a global consumer brand in China recently. The process is moving forward as Starbucks navigates a challenging market characterized by slower growth and intense competition from local coffee chains like Luckin Coffee.</p>

The game's most notable moment occurred just six seconds in, when Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. The contest was also interrupted by a 65-minute lightning delay in the third quarter, after which neither team was able to score again, sealing the win for the defending champions.</p>

Meanwhile, Dorries' move is being described as a "seismic blow" to the Conservative party, potentially signaling a further fracturing of the political right ahead of an election.</p>

The move comes amid reports that the White House is exploring ways to consolidate the opposition to Mamdani by encouraging other candidates, including incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, to drop out. Mamdani's challenge aims to frame Cuomo as a puppet of the president and bring national political tensions into the local race.</p>
