          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple who were being deported despite having Temporary Protected Status (TPS), criticizing the government's lack of evidence linking them to a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Judge David Briones barred the administration from removing anyone under the Alien Enemies Act in the Western District of Texas without 21 days' notice. The couple had fled Venezuela in 2022 and were granted TPS in 2024, but their status was revoked based on alleged gang association. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term has been marked by disruptive trade policies, including tariff increases on goods from both rivals and allies. After initially escalating tariffs, Trump paused some levies and called for bilateral negotiations to address the U.S. trade deficit. However, continued trade tensions between the U.S. and China have unsettled investors and raised concerns about the global economy. The outcome of these trade disputes will likely shape perceptions of Trump's first 100 days and provide insights into his future policies.</p>

Critics are outraged by the revelation that the Bar used artificial intelligence to draft questions without proper oversight.

          <p>Recent polls suggest a decline in American confidence in Donald Trump across various issues, with a majority describing his second term as "scary." The surveys reveal poor ratings on the economy, immigration policy, and overall presidential performance. Even Republicans are not overwhelmingly convinced that Trump is focused on the right priorities. The polls also indicate disapproval of Trump's trade policies and concerns about a potential recession, reflecting widespread unease about the direction of the country under his leadership.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's attendance at Pope Francis's funeral led to a potential shift in his perspective on Russia, as he questioned Vladimir Putin's commitment to peace after meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump expressed concern over recent Russian missile strikes on civilian areas, suggesting Putin may not be sincere about ending the war. This revelation could signal a new approach to the conflict, although Trump's views remain subject to change. The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Vatican holds symbolic importance, with the potential to influence future policy.</p>

          <p>A pilot in Alaska has been forced to forfeit his $95,000 plane after attempting to fly alcohol into a dry community. Kenneth J. Jouppi, 82, was stopped by a state trooper before takeoff in 2012 after the trooper observed him handling boxes containing beer. The Alaska Supreme Court upheld the forfeiture of his plane as a penalty for violating the community's ban on importing, selling, or possessing alcohol. The ruling underscores the strict enforcement of alcohol restrictions in certain Alaskan communities.</p>
