        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kansas City Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Schmid has indicated hesitation regarding a potential interest rate cut in September, challenging strong market expectations. Speaking from the annual Jackson Hole symposium, Schmid argued that policymakers require more definitive data before altering the policy rate, noting that the final stage of controlling inflation appears difficult. His remarks introduce a degree of uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions, particularly as the central bank faces political pressure to lower rates to stimulate economic activity. This highlights the ongoing internal debate over the timing of monetary policy shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York appeals court has nullified the more than $454 million judgment against Donald Trump, his family, and his company in their civil fraud case. The court deemed the financial penalty, originally imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron for inflating asset values to secure better business deals, to be excessive. The original ruling had found Trump and his co-defendants liable for a decade of business fraud, which they have consistently denied, claiming the case was politically motivated. This decision reverses a significant financial and legal blow to the former president, though the case may be subject to further appeals.</p>

          <p>Walmart has increased its full-year sales and earnings forecast, driven by another quarter of strong double-digit growth in its e-commerce division. Despite topping Wall Street's sales estimates, the company's earnings per share fell short for the first time since 2022, citing one-time expenses and rising costs from tariffs. Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey stated that while the company is absorbing some tariff costs, others are being passed to consumers, though customer spending has remained resilient. The retailer's performance provides a key insight into consumer health amid economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leaders in Easton, Pennsylvania, have canceled a scheduled vote on a "Welcoming City" ordinance, which would limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The decision was driven by concerns over President Donald Trump's crackdown on so-called "sanctuary cities" and threats from Attorney General Pam Bondi to withhold federal funding from non-compliant municipalities. The city's Democratic mayor, Sal Panto Jr., argued that Easton is already welcoming in practice and that the formal designation would unnecessarily attract negative attention from the federal government. This move reflects the growing pressure local governments are facing regarding federal immigration policies.</p>

Dobson became a prominent figure in the 1970s, offering parenting advice that emphasized traditional family values and discipline, and he authored numerous books on the subject. Through Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council, he advocated for conservative positions on social issues, including opposition to abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights. His work significantly shaped the views of a generation of evangelical Christians in the United States.</p>

          <h2>New Research Questions the Efficacy of Wolf Hunting in Protecting Livestock</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Science Advances suggests that public wolf hunting in the Western U.S. has a minimal impact on reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers analyzed data from Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington and found that killing a wolf saved only a small fraction of a single cow, meaning roughly 14 wolves would need to be killed to prevent one livestock death. The study also found that hunting did not decrease the number of government-led removals of problematic wolves. These findings challenge the long-held assumption that reducing wolf populations directly and effectively mitigates human-wildlife conflict for ranchers.</p>

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic posits that Donald Trump's primary motivation for brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is his desire to win a Nobel Peace Prize. The author argues that this ambition makes a complete sellout of Ukraine unlikely, as Trump would need the cooperation of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders for the deal to be perceived as legitimate by the Nobel committee. The article suggests that historical analogies like Munich or Yalta are misplaced, as Ukraine is in a stronger position and Russia is weaker than those comparisons imply. Trump's focus on personal accolades, rather than geopolitical strategy, is presented as the key driver of his diplomatic efforts.</p>

A key factor in the decision was reportedly Eze's childhood connection to Arsenal, having played in their academy.

With home equity at record levels and interest rates on credit cards near all-time highs, a fixed-rate home equity loan can offer a lower-cost borrowing alternative. Using the loan for debt consolidation can reduce monthly payments and interest costs, while using it for renovations can increase a home's value and potentially offer tax deductions.

          <h2>Tesco Increases Price of Popular Meal Deal for Second Time in Two Years</h2>

          <p>Tesco has raised the price of its lunchtime meal deal, a popular option for UK shoppers. For customers with a Clubcard, the price of a main, snack, and drink will increase from £3.60 to £3.85, while non-members will see a rise from £4.00 to £4.25. This follows a price hike in 2022, which ended a decade of the deal being priced at £3.00. The change reflects ongoing food price inflation and the increasing use of loyalty card schemes by supermarkets to offer differentiated pricing and gather customer data in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>Israel has given final approval for the E1 settlement project, a controversial plan to build homes in the occupied West Bank that critics argue would effectively sever the territory in two. The project, located between Jerusalem and the settlement of Maale Adumim, could undermine the viability of a future contiguous Palestinian state by cutting off the connection between northern and southern West Bank cities. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich framed the approval as a direct response to countries recognizing a Palestinian state. The international community largely considers Israeli settlements illegal and an obstacle to peace.</p>

          <p>Author and professor Walter Isaacson has described President Donald Trump's recent dealings with chipmakers Intel and Nvidia as a "scattershot method of crony capitalism." Isaacson argued that this approach, where the government favors specific companies and industries, is a recipe for corruption and will not be successful in reviving American manufacturing. His comments follow the administration's push for a stake in Intel and its policy requiring Nvidia and AMD to pay a percentage of their China revenues to the government for export licenses. This reflects growing concern over the administration's direct influence on corporate operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The RMT union has announced a seven-day period of rolling strike action across the London Underground, set to begin on Friday, September 5. The union states the industrial action is due to unresolved disputes with transport bosses over pay, fatigue management, and extreme shift patterns. RMT General Secretary Eddie Dempsey highlighted that staff health and wellbeing are being impacted by these long-standing issues. Transport for London (TfL) has urged the union to accept its pay offer and continue discussions, but the planned walkouts by various staff grades are expected to cause significant disruption to Tube services.</p>

        </div>

          <p>The average interest rate for a five-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen to 4.99%, marking the first time it has dipped below the 5% threshold since May 2023. This decline is seen as a symbolic turning point that could boost buyer confidence and increase competition among lenders. The average two-year fixed rate also continued to fall, reaching 4.97%. While the immediate financial savings for borrowers may be small, the steady downward trend in borrowing costs is welcome news for homebuyers and those looking to remortgage in a market still recovering from previous rate shocks.

          <p>Despite suggestions from Russia that China could be involved, analysts believe it is unlikely that Beijing will become a security guarantor for Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov mentioned that Moscow had agreed to a system of guarantees involving UN Security Council permanent members, including China, during early talks in 2022. However, experts suggest that China's resource constraints and historical precedent in such matters make a high-profile role improbable. It remains unclear what form of "guarantee" was discussed, but Beijing is not expected to take a leading position in future security arrangements for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>The recent termination of a Texas law that granted in-state tuition to undocumented college students is causing confusion and disruption as the fall semester begins. The 2001 Texas Dream Act was effectively ended by a court agreement between the state and the Trump administration, forcing many students to face out-of-state tuition rates that are thousands of dollars higher. This has led some students to withdraw or change their plans, while colleges struggle with unclear guidance on how to implement the new policy. Advocates worry this will harm both students and the state's future workforce by creating barriers to higher education.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, defying analyst expectations of a slight decline. The increase is attributed to a dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Concurrently, the inventory of homes for sale grew by nearly 16% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020. This increase in supply is beginning to temper price growth, with the median home price showing only a marginal 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point.

The most reliable data, from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, is only available through 2023.

          <p>The ACLU has filed a federal petition arguing that the continued detention of Atlanta-area journalist Mario Guevara by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is an act of retaliation intended to silence him. Guevara, a Salvadoran immigrant, was arrested in June while covering a protest and has remained in detention for nearly two months despite having all charges dropped. The ACLU contends that Guevara, who founded a Spanish-language news outlet known for covering ICE activities, is being detained in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments.
