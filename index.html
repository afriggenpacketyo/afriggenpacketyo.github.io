          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird native to the southern Great Plains. These birds, numbering around 30,000, were granted protection in 2023, but the administration argues the Interior Department made an error in listing them. This move aligns with President Trump's prioritization of oil and gas drilling over environmental safeguards, potentially jeopardizing the bird's survival. Critics argue that delisting the prairie-chicken would set a precedent, endangering other species in fossil fuel-rich areas, despite the bird's important role in grassland ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Eleven inmates, considered "armed and dangerous," escaped from the Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans, prompting a large-scale manhunt. One inmate, Kendall Myles, was quickly apprehended in downtown New Orleans using facial recognition technology after attempting to flee on foot. Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick believes the escapees likely had assistance and may have changed out of their jail attire. The New Orleans police, along with the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and Louisiana State Police, are involved in the search, with some victims of the escapees being moved to safety.</p>

Lawyers representing the families expressed deep disappointment, arguing that Boeing has never faced trial for its admitted crimes and should not be allowed to avoid accountability with just a financial penalty.</p>

          <p>Staff employees at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., intend to unionize due to job uncertainty and changes under the Trump administration. More than 150 employees are seeking collective bargaining rights, citing layoffs and a lack of communication from leadership. The effort follows President Trump's installation as chairman and dismissal of key executives, leading to concerns about the institution's mission. Staff hope unionization will restore security, improve transparency, and protect the Kennedy Center's non-partisan legacy.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are attempting to include a provision in their budget bill that would grant the Trump administration unilateral authority to label nonprofits as supporting terrorism. This would allow the treasury secretary to revoke a nonprofit's tax-exempt status with limited due process. Critics argue this measure could be weaponized against groups across the political spectrum, particularly those critical of the administration. The provision, which failed initially in the House Budget Committee, is set for reconsideration after weekend negotiations.</p>

          <p>Despite a historically poor start to the season, the LA Galaxy have extended head coach Greg Vanney's contract through 2028, making him one of the highest-paid coaches in MLS. The club cited Vanney's "vision" as the reason for the extension, despite the team's 0-10-3 record. The Galaxy won the MLS Cup last season, triggering a one-year extension for Vanney. The club also hired Ravi Ramineni as director of quantitative analysis and promoted Juninho to senior advisor to the general manager.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team plans to argue "mutual violence" in his sexual assault trial, claiming his relationship with accuser Cassie Ventura involved hitting on both sides. Legal experts argue that "mutual abuse" is not a legal defense, as abuse is about power and control, not just physical violence. The defense may attempt to reframe the violence as consensual, similar to strategies used in other high-profile cases. However, this approach faces scrutiny as it risks minimizing the severity of the allegations and potentially blaming the victim.</p>

The reduction will involve consolidating functions, modernizing practices, and offering voluntary deferred resignation to eligible employees. This move comes amid pressure for cost cuts across civil service agencies from the Trump administration. The central bank's 2023 annual report indicated nearly 24,000 employees, meaning a 10% reduction would bring the number below 22,000.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trip to the Middle East focused on securing deals and investments for the U.S., but it was overshadowed by Qatar's gift of a Boeing 747.

While Trump secured financial agreements, the acceptance of the plane raised ethical concerns and drew criticism, even from Republicans.
