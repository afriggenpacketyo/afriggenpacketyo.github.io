          <p>Democratic State Representative Nicole Collier of Fort Worth is protesting new surveillance protocols by remaining inside the Texas Capitol building. After returning from a two-week walkout intended to block a Republican-led redistricting effort, Democratic lawmakers were told they must be accompanied by a Department of Public Safety escort to ensure their attendance at the next session. Collier has refused to sign the authorization for this escort, which she calls a Republican "permission slip" to control her movements, and has vowed to stay in her office or the House chambers until the session reconvenes.</p>

While not expected to make a direct landfall, the storm is already bringing heavy rainfall to the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos, causing power outages in Puerto Rico. Authorities in North Carolina's Outer Banks have issued mandatory evacuation orders for Hatteras Island due to the impending dangerous conditions.

          <p>Japanese investment firm SoftBank has announced a $2 billion investment in U.S. chipmaker Intel, causing the company's shares to rise over 5% in after-hours trading. The deal, priced at $23 per share, is seen as a vote of confidence in Intel's ongoing turnaround efforts amid stiff competition from rivals like Samsung and TSMC. This investment comes as the Trump administration is also reportedly considering taking a stake in Intel to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and secure the national supply chain.

          <p>A new report from S&P indicates that China's exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with growth accelerating significantly after the U.S.-China trade war began. Chinese exports to developing nations now total approximately $1.6 trillion, which is over 50% more than its combined exports to the United States and Western Europe. Analysts suggest that ongoing trade uncertainties and China's domestic economic slowdown will continue to drive Chinese firms to expand their presence in these emerging markets. This shift could potentially re-center global commerce around South-South trade relationships.</p>

The announcement followed a meeting at the White House where European leaders and Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss paths to ending the war in Ukraine. Merz stated that Trump had spoken with Putin by phone and secured an agreement for the bilateral talks, though a location has not yet been determined.

          <p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey has been appointed to serve as the FBI's co-deputy director, joining current second-in-command Dan Bongino. Bailey, who will resign from his state position on September 8, thanked President Trump for the opportunity to help "Make America Safe Again." This appointment continues a trend of placing individuals without prior FBI career experience in top leadership roles, as Bailey's background is in the Army and as a state prosecutor. The move was confirmed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and welcomed by Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel.</p>

          <p>Indian sailors constitute the largest group of abandoned seafarers globally, with 899 individuals stranded on 312 ships in 2024, according to the International Transport Workers' Federation. These sailors are often left without pay, provisions, or a way home when shipowners sever ties, a problem exacerbated by the use of "flags of convenience" that obscure ownership and weaken regulatory oversight. Many seafarers are unable to leave their vessels without forfeiting months of wages, trapping them in precarious situations, sometimes in conflict zones like Ukrainian waters. The globalized nature of the shipping industry complicates resolutions for these stranded crews.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is unofficially outsourcing its healthcare to mainland China, a trend that threatens to undermine its own well-established system. While mainland facilities in cities like Shenzhen offer quicker appointments and clearer pricing, this convenience comes at a long-term cost. The author warns that if a significant number of patients and medical professionals migrate north for healthcare, Hong Kong risks losing its capacity for medical innovation, clinical trials, and talent development. The piece suggests that relying on external systems is not a sustainable solution for the city's strained public healthcare infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis posits that President Trump's recent diplomatic efforts regarding Ukraine, including a meeting with President Putin and arranging talks, may serve more to buy time for Russia than to secure a lasting peace. Following a secretive summit in Alaska, Trump initially seemed to endorse a Russian proposal to freeze the conflict, alarming European allies who quickly flew to Washington to consult with him. While the European delegation appears to have steered Trump away from a land-for-peace deal, the resulting plan for direct Putin-Zelenskyy talks lacks a clear foundation or ceasefire, potentially allowing the conflict to continue unabated.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia is suing the U.S. Justice Department over a new rule that ties federal grants for crime victims to cooperation with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is illegally forcing states to choose between forfeiting critical funding for victim services and compelling local officials to enforce federal immigration law. The rule affects over $1 billion in annual grants from the Office for Victims of Crime. The states, mostly Democratic-led, claim the condition destroys trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities, undermining public safety.</p>

          <p>The opening of Camp East Montana, a new large-scale migrant detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, was met with protests from immigration advocates over the weekend. The facility, which can eventually hold up to 5,000 migrants, is part of the Trump administration's plan for mass deportations. Critics, including Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar, argue the funds could be better spent on community services and that detainees lack proper access to legal counsel. In contrast, Republican Sen. John Cornyn defended the center, stating that the detainees have no legal right to be in the country and have missed court-ordered hearings.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to realign teams geographically into Eastern and Western conferences, similar to the NBA. Speaking during a broadcast, Manfred suggested that such a move could reduce travel wear and tear on players and create more appealing postseason television schedules. While the idea would likely face resistance from traditionalists, it could foster regional rivalries and better cater to West Coast audiences. Manfred hopes to have the expansion process approved by 2029, with Nashville and Salt Lake City considered leading candidate cities.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers is studying long tubes of mud extracted from the Antarctic seabed to understand centuries of environmental changes in the Southern Ocean. By analyzing the distinct layers of sediment, scientists can reconstruct a history of marine life, pollution levels, and the impact of human activities like industrial whaling. A key part of the research involves using environmental DNA to measure how the massive reduction in whale populations affected the ocean's ability to store carbon. This data will help create a more accurate picture of the ocean's role in regulating the global climate.</p>

          <p>A 113-year-old wooden church in Kiruna, Sweden, is being moved intact to a new location 5km away to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The 672-tonne structure has been lifted onto giant transporters for the two-day journey to the city's relocated center. This complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a wider project to move the city, which is funded by the state-owned mining company LKAB. Delicate treasures, including a large altar painting and a 1,000-pipe organ, will remain inside the church during its carefully planned relocation.</p>

The decisive moment came late in the game when Lukas Nmecha converted a penalty awarded for a handball against Everton's James Tarkowski, a call that drew protests from the visiting team. Despite dominating the first half, Leeds struggled to convert their chances but ultimately secured the win through defensive resilience and the late penalty. The energetic atmosphere at their home stadium is seen as a crucial factor for Leeds' campaign to remain in the top flight this season.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug commonly known as "designer Xanax." The action immediately classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, empowering law enforcement to make arrests for its sale or possession. This state-level ban comes as Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman leads a coalition of 21 attorneys general urging the federal DEA to take similar emergency action nationwide. The unregulated drug, which has been linked to nearly 50 overdose deaths in Kentucky last year, poses a significant public health threat.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to "lead a movement" to eliminate mail-in ballots and certain voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted. Citing unsubstantiated claims of corruption and inaccuracy, Trump asserted that he has the authority to mandate how states conduct federal elections. However, legal experts counter that the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the power to regulate federal elections, and any such executive order would almost certainly face immediate and significant legal challenges. The move is seen by critics as an attempt to undermine confidence in the electoral process.</p>

          <p>A report from Kabul reveals that many women in Afghanistan's largest mental health facility are effectively trapped, unable to leave even after their condition improves. Due to strict Taliban regulations and patriarchal traditions, women cannot live independently and are often abandoned by their families, leaving them with nowhere to go upon discharge. The facility is severely overcrowded, with a long waiting list, as years of conflict and the recent crackdown on women's rights have fueled a worsening mental health crisis. Staff report that some patients have been abandoned at the center for decades, ultimately living and dying within its walls.</p>
