          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher and Indian national, was released from an immigration detention center in Texas after a federal judge ruled the government lacked evidence to support his detention. Suri, who was never charged with a crime, had been detained for two months following his arrest by masked federal agents, who claimed he spread Hamas propaganda and promoted antisemitism on social media, claims his lawyers deny. Judge Patricia Giles stated the government failed to demonstrate Suri posed a threat to U.S. interests and ordered his immediate release. Suri will return home to Virginia while his legal challenge against deportation continues, marking the latest instance of scholars targeted by the Trump administration being freed from detention.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense after years of alleged physical, sexual assault, and emotional abuse. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the resentencing, while the brothers' attorney, Mark Geragos, praised the decision as a victory for justice and redemption. The California Board of Parole Hearings will conduct separate hearings in June to determine if the brothers should receive clemency, with Governor Gavin Newsom making the final decision.</p>

          <p>President Trump, speaking in Saudi Arabia, denounced Western intervention and nation-building, declaring the U.S. would no longer lecture other nations on how to live, a statement met with applause. He urged Middle Eastern countries to chart their own destinies, reflecting long-standing grievances over American policy in the region, particularly the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. While some praised Trump's stance on sovereignty, others expressed concern about the potential impact on human rights and the evaporation of American pressure over human rights violations. Trump also met with the new leader of Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, a former jihadist, sparking controversy.</p>

Thanedar, who filed seven articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump in April, decided to add to his articles and seek broader support. Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin explained that consensus and strategy are necessary for impeachment, while Democratic caucus chair Rep. Pete Aguilar called the move impractical due to Republican control of Congress.

          <p>Anti-abortion activists have launched “Rolling Thunder,” a coordinated campaign to pressure the FDA to restore restrictions on mifepristone, a drug used in most abortions in the US. The campaign includes new lawsuits against doctors who prescribe abortion medication and lobbying to remove the drug from the market. The effort relies on a new report claiming mifepristone causes high rates of health complications, contradicting decades of safety testing. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals, with some officials expressing openness to restricting mifepristone based on safety data, while the Department of Justice has asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the medication.</p>

          <p>Three wildfires in northern Minnesota have burned nearly 37,000 acres, with none of the fires contained, prompting the activation of the Minnesota National Guard. The Jenkins Creek Fire grew to roughly 20,600 acres, while the Camp House Fire destroyed dozens of structures. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is investigating suspects accused of starting the Camp House Fire, with investigations for all three fires ongoing. Weather conditions are expected to improve slightly, with storms predicted to bring about an inch of rain, easing the dry conditions firefighters are facing.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are dismissing the House's massive package encompassing President Trump's agenda, even before it is finalized, raising concerns about its prospects in the upper chamber. Senators like Ron Johnson and Rand Paul have criticized the bill's spending cuts as insufficient and "wimpy". The House package aims for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset tax cuts, but faces opposition over Medicaid program changes and the restoration of a tax break. Some Republicans worry about voting for a package that the Senate will disregard.</p>

This measure aims to address a budget deficit and is driven by the program's higher-than-expected costs and economic uncertainty. Under Newsom’s plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program, and those already enrolled will have to pay a $100 monthly premium.</p>
