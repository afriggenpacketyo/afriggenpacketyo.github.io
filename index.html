          <h2>Nissan Considers Closing Two Plants in Restructuring Effort</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating the closure of two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans following a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The plants in question are the Oppama plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka, which together account for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The closures are being considered due to lower operating rates at these facilities, though Nissan has stated that the news is speculative and no official decision has been made yet. The company also plans to shut seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally by fiscal 2027.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a major offensive, "Operation Gideon's Chariots," aimed at defeating Hamas and securing the release of hostages in Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces have mobilized troops to seize strategic areas, while the Hamas-run health ministry reports that Israeli attacks have resulted in numerous deaths. Despite international pressure to resume ceasefire talks and end the blockade, Israel has intensified its bombardment and armored forces along the border. The operation's launch suggests a breakdown in all previous efforts to negotiate a truce, as the IDF aims to take and control territory, move civilians south, attack Hamas, and prevent them from controlling aid supplies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>GLP-1 receptor agonists, used for weight loss and diabetes, may have mental health implications, with studies showing potential links to anxiety and depression. A recent study suggested that mood changes were related to genetic variations, indicating that behavioral changes are likely not a direct result of the medications. Doctors suggest that individuals with obesity or type 2 diabetes are often already depressed, and the medications may improve mood as weight loss and blood sugar stabilize. It is important for doctors prescribing these drugs to be aware of the patient's history and for patients to communicate any mood changes to their healthcare providers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former White House lawyers and foreign affairs experts are expressing concerns over Donald Trump's acceptance of overseas gifts and targeted investments, describing it as "unprecedented." The openness to foreign incentives raises questions about potential conflicts of interest and the influence of foreign entities on U.S. foreign policy. Incidents such as Qatar offering a $400 million Boeing 747-8 to the U.S. Department of Defense and a $2 billion investment from UAE-controlled funds into a Trump-linked stablecoin have drawn criticism. Experts suggest that these actions send a message that American foreign policy is being sold to the highest bidder, potentially jeopardizing national security and ethical governance.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's ambitious plan to impose tariffs on the world, dubbed "liberation day," lasted only 40 days, causing global stock market turmoil and business leader opposition. The measures included a 10% tariff on all imported goods and higher rates on specific markets. After initial implementation, Trump announced a 90-day pause, only to later impose a 125% tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing's retaliation. Despite officials' claims of a master strategy, the reversal prompted criticism and concern over potential shortages and price increases, highlighting the instability and economic risks associated with Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is attempting to extend its reach beyond Cabinet agencies, even targeting entities outside the executive branch, including the Government Accountability Office (GAO). GAO, as a legislative branch agency, has rebuffed DOGE's requests to embed staffers and review its operations. NPR has identified nearly 40 entities where DOGE has focused its attention, often dispatching young staffers with limited government experience to conduct meetings. Some targeted agencies have been dismantled, while others, like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, have rejected DOGE's involvement, raising concerns about the initiative's scope and methods.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between President Trump's current budget reconciliation efforts and Ronald Reagan's "Reaganomics" in 1981, highlighting the use of budget reconciliation to enact sweeping policy changes. Both presidents aimed to quickly implement their agendas, featuring tax cuts and increased military spending. Reagan's program promised economic stimulus through tax cuts, while Trump's plan includes tax and spending cuts alongside a Pentagon boost. The article also notes the presence of an unelected official wielding significant power, drawing a comparison between David Stockman in Reagan's administration and Elon Musk in Trump's, who runs the Department of Government Efficiency initiative.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump is increasing its focus on voter fraud, with assistance from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk. This comes after Trump signed an executive order to add new document checks to voter registration. Several individuals have been charged with illegal voting, but these cases do not indicate a widespread conspiracy. The Civil Rights Division is shifting its focus to enforcing the president's executive orders, raising concerns about potential restrictions on voting access. Initial cases relate to work done by DOGE, comparing Social Security data with state voter data to identify potential noncitizens who had illegally voted.</p>

          <p>Two drug smugglers, Bruce Knowles and Ferhat Gumrukguoglu, have been sentenced to prison for attempting to import £37m worth of cocaine into the UK. They were apprehended by the National Crime Agency (NCA) near Benacre Broad with 350kg of cocaine hidden under a tarpaulin on their inflatable boat. The court heard that the pair had conducted a dry run before attempting the actual smuggling operation. Border Force officers intercepted their boat, and Gumrukguoglu was later found wandering barefoot in Beccles.

It proposes the idea of an "extreme wealth line" to curb the excesses of wealth inequality. The author suggests that there is a point at which wealth gives an individual too much power to shape politics and cause environmental harm, undermining economic competition and tearing at the social fabric. They call for a democratic way of defining an extreme wealth line to give politicians the mandate to tackle inequality before it is too late.</p>

          <p>Nine people were killed in a Russian drone attack on a civilian minibus in north-eastern Ukraine, according to local officials. The attack occurred in Bilopillia, Sumy, as the bus traveled to the regional capital near the Russian border, injuring seven others. This report emerged shortly after Russia and Ukraine engaged in their first direct peace talks since 2022, where they agreed to a prisoner of war swap. Ukraine's president, Volodymr Zelensky, condemned the attack as a deliberate killing of civilians, while Russian state media claimed forces had hit a military staging area in Sumy.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen who "accidentally defected" to South Korea have spent an unprecedented amount of time in limbo after their boat drifted south of the maritime boundary. Despite their repeated requests to return home, Pyongyang has refused to communicate with Seoul, leaving the men stranded. This situation reflects the deteriorating relationship between North and South Korea, with Pyongyang designating the South as a "hostile state" and severing all communication channels. The men's repatriation may depend on future improvements in inter-Korean relations, particularly after South Korea's upcoming presidential election.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from Asia, dating back 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study highlights that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups, allowing them to study patterns of population history, migration, and adaptation. The study found that after arriving in South America, the early settlers split into distinct groups, each becoming isolated in different environments, leading to unique genetic traits and adaptations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has implemented a series of tariffs on specific countries and industries, but many of the harshest measures have been paused or exempted. Currently, a 10% universal tariff, a 25% tariff on cars and auto parts, and a 30% tariff on Chinese imports are active. However, "reciprocal" tariffs and higher tariffs on Chinese goods have been paused. Key exemptions have been made for goods covered under the USMCA with Canada and Mexico, as well as for smartphones, computers, and other electronics imported from China. Trump continues to threaten more tariffs on specific industries, but the future of these plans remains uncertain.</p>

The ruling indicated that a majority of the justices were skeptical of whether the migrants had been afforded enough due process protections. The case has been sent back to an appeals court to examine claims by the migrants that they could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The justices called for the lower court to consider how much notice the government should be required to provide migrants so they have an opportunity to challenge their deportations.</p>
