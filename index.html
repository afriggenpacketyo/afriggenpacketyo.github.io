          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, currently facing International Criminal Court charges for crimes against humanity related to his brutal antidrug campaign, remains a popular figure in the Philippines. His arrest and extradition to The Hague have sharply divided the nation, influencing the upcoming midterm elections where his family's political dynasty is being challenged. Despite the legal battles, Duterte's supporters rally for his return, viewing him as a victim of political persecution, while his daughter, Sara Duterte, sees her approval rating rise, positioning her as a potential future presidential candidate. The article also details Duterte's life in detention, including accommodations for his dietary needs and health monitoring.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reported making substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation of the ongoing trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng described the discussions as productive, with expectations of a joint statement detailing the agreements. These talks represent the first face-to-face meetings since significant tariffs were imposed by both countries, causing market turmoil and recession fears. While some experts anticipate tariff cuts, others remain cautious, predicting a commitment to continued dialogue rather than immediate resolution of all trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Britain is significantly increasing its defense budget, aiming to revitalize local economies and create jobs, with Barrow-in-Furness serving as a potential model. BAE Systems, a major defense contractor, is expanding its operations in Barrow, spurred by increased military spending, which is driving local business growth. The government plans to invest £200 million in Barrow to improve infrastructure, education, and healthcare, making the town more attractive to workers and families. This initiative seeks to distribute the benefits of higher military spending across the country, rather than concentrating it in wealthier regions, with the goal of fostering sustainable economic development.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. to pay the same prices for some drugs as other nations, an attempt to revive a previously blocked policy. The order would tie Medicare payments for medications administered in doctors' offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to strongly oppose the move, arguing it would stifle innovation. The proposal aims to address the high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S., but faces legal and political challenges.</p>
