          <p>U.S. employers added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding economists' forecasts and indicating a steady labor market despite tariff-induced economic headwinds. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2% for the third consecutive month, aligning with economists' expectations. While job growth was slightly weaker than in previous months, health care and leisure/hospitality sectors saw the largest gains, whereas federal employment declined. Experts caution that economic challenges may still lie ahead, with concerns about stagflation and a weakening employment picture, but the numbers suggest the job market is holding up.

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's fire insurer of last resort, faces scrutiny for its lack of transparency compared to other insurers. The FAIR plan operates as an independent non-profit run by a governing committee, primarily composed of insurance industry representatives, and it is able to withhold more information than even the private companies that run it. Recent rule changes mean that all property insurance ratepayers will now cover the FAIR Plan's debts, raising concerns about accountability. The plan's secrecy, including undisclosed financial data and closed-door meetings, has prompted calls for increased transparency and public access to information, especially as the plan grows in size and influence.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio's absence from preparations for a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as subsequent trade talk announcements, has sparked questions about his influence on U.S.-China relations. The call, which followed a 90-day truce, has renewed hopes of easing tensions over tariffs and rare earth minerals. Some observers suggest a shift in Washington's approach to China, driven by economic pragmatism and Trump's preference for direct deal-making. This shift may indicate a diminished role for Rubio in shaping bilateral ties, as past engagements involved top diplomats and national security advisors.</p>

          <p>A House Republican megabill proposing significant Medicaid cuts could result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance. The bill includes work requirements for Medicaid eligibility, which the CBO estimates would cause 5.2 million adults to lose federal Medicaid coverage. The proposal would also create funding challenges for states by restricting their ability to use health-care provider taxes to fund Medicaid. Additionally, the bill would reduce ACA enrollment due to expiring subsidies and increased administrative burdens, potentially leaving millions more uninsured.</p>

Critics point out that the policy is capricious and targets countries with relatively powerless populations. The ban is seen as part of a broader effort to restrict immigration and stave off the demographic shift towards a "majority minority" country.</p>

The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, marking solid growth but a slowdown from 177,000 jobs added in the previous month. Federal government employment declined by 22,000 jobs in May, bringing total losses in the federal government to 59,000 since January. The fresh data revealed the performance of a key measure of economic health as Trump rolled back some of the "Liberation Day" tariffs imposed a month earlier.</p>
