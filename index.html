          <p>Tarek Bazrouk, a 20-year-old New York man, has been charged with federal hate crimes for allegedly assaulting Jewish counterprotesters at multiple anti-Israel protests in New York City between 2024 and 2025. According to the Department of Justice, Bazrouk allegedly wore a Hamas headband during one protest and kicked a Jewish college student. He is also accused of punching another Jewish student and stealing an Israeli flag from him. Law enforcement found antisemitic messages and pro-Hamas propaganda on Bazrouk's phone, and if convicted on all charges, he faces a maximum of 30 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported better-than-expected first-quarter operating profits but cautioned that U.S.-China trade tensions could limit global container market volumes. The company's underlying EBITDA rose 70% year-over-year, reaching $2.71 billion. Maersk maintained its 2025 profit guidance between $6 billion and $9 billion but revised its global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4%, citing increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The revised outlook reflects concerns over the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S. and retaliatory measures from China on global trade flows.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is anticipated to announce a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, potentially easing investor concerns about global tariffs. The UK government has suggested lowering tariffs on US cars and cutting digital sales tax affecting US tech companies to secure the deal. Since taking office, the Trump administration has expanded US tariff policies, including a 145% levy on Chinese imports. The UK, eager for post-Brexit trade deals, sees an agreement with the US as crucial, while officials from the US and China are set to meet in Switzerland to address their trade war.</p>

The article also points out the omission of influential non-fighters like Alan Hopper, Cedric Kushner, and Al Haymon.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has spent months nurturing his relationship with President Trump. The news of an imminent trade agreement with the United States is a much-needed political victory, as well as vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. The details of the agreement were not yet clear and could prove contentious with farmers and other interest groups in Britain. Britain, even under a center-left Labour government, has escaped the harsh criticism that Mr. Trump has trained on the European Union and China, both of which he accuses of ‚Äúripping off‚Äù the United States in their trade relationships.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since the imposition of stiff tariffs on numerous trading partners. The agreement aims to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries, with potential reductions in British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and the removal of British taxes on U.S. technology companies. The deal is seen as a significant win for both nations, particularly for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has cultivated a relationship with Trump. The Trump administration is also pursuing trade agreements with other countries, including India and Israel.</p>

          <p>Britain is reportedly poised to sign a trade deal with the U.S., making it the first nation to do so after the U.S. announced "reciprocal" tariffs.

The UK's Department for Business and Trade stated that discussions are ongoing and aim to ease pressure on UK businesses and consumers. It is unclear whether the deal will be a finalized agreement or a framework for future negotiations. The UK was spared higher tariffs but still faces a baseline 10% levy, and officials are working to secure a beneficial resolution.</p>

          <p>A study indicates that the historic four-day storm in the central Mississippi valley, which resulted in death and destruction, was made more likely and severe by burning fossil fuels.
