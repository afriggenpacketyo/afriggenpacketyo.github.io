          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reported "substantial progress" in tariff discussions with Chinese officials in Switzerland, though specifics were scarce, as both sides aim to de-escalate trade tensions. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested an agreement was reached, emphasizing the priority of closing the U.S. trade deficit with China, which reached $263 billion the previous year. President Trump hinted at potentially lowering tariffs on China, while Chinese officials urged the U.S. to first drop its "unilateral" tariffs. The talks occurred amidst ongoing trade disputes, including tariffs on goods exceeding $660 billion, with hopes for a resolution to relieve financial markets and companies reliant on U.S.-China trade.</p>

          <p>The United States has temporarily suspended imports of live cattle from Mexico through southern border ports to address the spread of the screwworm, a parasite harmful to warm-blooded animals. Secretary Brooke Rollins cited recent detections of the parasite in farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, prompting the need for increased surveillance and eradication efforts. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio BerdeguÃ© expressed disagreement with the measure but remained optimistic about reaching a swift resolution. The suspension follows previous restrictions lifted in February after implementing evaluation protocols, however, the 'unacceptable northward advancement' of the screwworm prompted additional action.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court uncovered documentation related to the Nazi regime among its archives, including propaganda materials used to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II. The discovery occurred during preparations for a museum showcasing historical documents, revealing postcards, photographs, and propaganda from the German regime. The boxes are believed to be linked to a shipment of 83 packages sent by the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941. Argentina, home to Latin America's largest Jewish population, served as a refuge for Nazis after the war, including Adolf Eichmann.</p>

          <p>Researchers are making strides in helping individuals with severe spinal cord injuries regain mobility and other bodily functions through innovative technologies. A French neuroscientist, Gregoire Courtine, and a Swiss neurosurgeon, Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, have developed a "digital bridge" that wirelessly sends signals from the brain to the spinal cord, bypassing the injury. This technology has shown potential in restoring movement, bladder control, blood pressure regulation, and sexual function. Spinal cord stimulation may also benefit individuals with Parkinson's disease by improving mobility, although further research is needed before widespread accessibility.</p>

          <p>Biologist and geneticist Silvana Santos identified and named Spoan syndrome, a rare genetic condition, in the isolated town of Serrinha dos Pintos, Brazil, where cousin marriages are common. The syndrome, caused by a genetic mutation inherited from both parents, affects the nervous system and gradually weakens the body. Santos's research provided families with a diagnosis and led to increased support and resources for affected individuals. The town's isolation and limited migration have resulted in a high rate of consanguinity, increasing the risk of recessive genetic disorders.</p>

          <p>Transnational crime rings are exploiting stolen identities to defraud U.S. government programs, costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars annually. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the surge in online applications for relief programs created opportunities for scammers to cash in, often impersonating Americans using stolen personal data. Linda Miller, a fraud expert, estimates that over a trillion dollars in pandemic relief money was lost to fraud, with a significant portion going to foreign adversarial nations. The FBI is actively combating these digital gangs, but the complexity of the schemes and the availability of stolen data make it challenging to recover the funds.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Americans with Caremark insurance will be forced to switch from Zepbound, a weight-loss drug, to Wegovy, despite studies showing Zepbound results in more weight loss. CVS Health's Caremark made the decision to exclude Zepbound, citing efforts to lower drug prices, but critics argue this limits doctors' ability to tailor prescriptions to individual needs. The decision underscores the influence of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and secret deals between drugmakers and middlemen, leading to restricted access to medications. Patients and doctors express frustration, highlighting the disruption of effective treatments and the prioritization of cost over patient care.</p>

The decision comes before President Trump's visit to the Middle East, and aims to facilitate humanitarian aid. A senior Hamas official reported direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar. The Israeli prime minister's office acknowledged the US informing them of Hamas's intention to release Alexander, but stated that negotiations will continue amidst fighting.</p>

          <p>After a record-breaking heat wave, Southern California is bracing for a significant drop in temperatures and the return of "May gray" conditions, including low clouds, drizzle, and even some light rain. Temperatures are expected to decrease by more than 20 degrees, with highs along the beaches in the mid-60s and the valleys around 70 degrees. The cooler respite follows a surge in temperatures that shattered records and led to numerous heat-related rescues on hiking trails. Meteorologists anticipate the "May gray" conditions to persist, bringing moist grounds and potential drizzle to the region.</p>
