          <p>Senator Marco Rubio criticizes a federal court order that prevents the U.S. government from deporting individuals to South Sudan, arguing that it severely undermines U.S. foreign policy. Rubio asserts that the order has already complicated diplomatic relations with Libya, South Sudan, and Djibouti, posing a significant threat to the President's authority in conducting foreign affairs. The Justice Department echoes these concerns, seeking judicial intervention to restore the President's power to manage foreign relations and immigration. The administration emphasizes that the deportees have undergone due process and pose a threat to the United States, as the flight included migrants from various countries who have committed crimes.</p>

          <p>Jon Worrell has been arrested and charged with the murder of his wife, Doris Worrell, who was fatally shot in 2006 at their family business in Georgia. Initially, authorities suspected a robbery gone wrong or retaliation, but the investigation went cold until the family's former live-in nanny in Costa Rica provided crucial information. The nanny's cooperation corroborated existing evidence, leading to Worrell's arrest in Missouri. Investigators learned that Worrell had an inappropriate relationship with the nanny and feared losing access to his children in a divorce, which prompted him to seek someone to kill his wife. The nanny is not considered a suspect in the case.</p>

          <p>Daniel Noboa was sworn in as Ecuador's President for a second term, vowing to fight corruption, drug trafficking, and violent crime while fostering job creation and investment through private sector collaboration. The inauguration ceremony was attended by international delegates, including representatives from the U.S. and various South American countries. Noboa, who first assumed the presidency in November 2023, faces significant challenges including violence and high unemployment, necessitating political alliances to advance his agenda. Analysts suggest that maintaining a congressional majority will be crucial for passing legislation, especially concerning crime-fighting measures, while also emphasizing the need to address social issues like jobs, healthcare, and education.</p>

The Sunday Express highlights warnings that the government will face backlash if it fails to restore the winter fuel allowance to all pensioners.

          <p>The UK government is proposing new rules that could allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to meet construction deadlines. Under these plans, housebuilders would be required to commit to specific delivery time frames and submit annual progress reports to councils. Those who repeatedly miss targets could face penalties, including the loss of land and fines, with the goal of building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029. Housing charity Shelter supports the plans, accusing developers of deliberately delaying construction to inflate prices.</p>

          <p>A pediatrician in Gaza lost nine of her ten children after an Israeli airstrike hit their home near Khan Younis, according to hospital officials. Dr. Alaa al-Najjar's husband, also a doctor, was severely wounded and is in intensive care, while their only surviving child was injured. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that their aircraft struck suspects operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area and that the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review. The World Food Programme reported that aid trucks were looted in southern Gaza, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, presented as neutral, was conceived and largely developed by Israelis to undermine Hamas, transferring responsibility from experienced aid agencies like the U.N. to private organizations. The project, initially proposed by Israeli officials, involves hiring private contractors, primarily American, to distribute food in Gaza, circumventing the United Nations. While supporters describe it as an independent initiative, critics warn it could restrict aid to limited areas and facilitate displacement, with the U.N. contending that it could endanger civilians by forcing them to travel long distances for food.</p>
