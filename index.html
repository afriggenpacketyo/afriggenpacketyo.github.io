          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed criticisms regarding the court's perceived rightward shift and its role in checking executive power. She emphasized that her decisions are based on legal questions rather than political leanings, declining to comment on specific pending cases like those concerning presidential tariffs. Barrett also discussed her new book, "Listening to the Law," and reflected on the personal challenges and responsibilities of serving on the nation's highest court, including the landmark Dobbs decision which she contends returned the issue of abortion to the democratic process.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen won the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, while McLaren's race strategy created controversy between its drivers. The team ordered Oscar Piastri to allow Lando Norris to pass him for second place, a decision made after a slow pit stop for Norris dropped him behind his teammate. Piastri expressed his disagreement but complied with the order, which the team justified by referencing a previous race where Norris had similarly aided Piastri. The outcome narrowed Piastri's championship lead over Norris to 31 points with eight races remaining in the season.</p>

          <p>Jarvis McKenzie, a Black man in South Carolina, is advocating for the state to enact a hate crime law after he was the victim of a racially motivated shooting. The alleged attacker, Jonathan Felkel, was arrested and reportedly admitted to police that he fired a rifle over McKenzie's head because of his race. South Carolina is one of only two states without a statewide hate crime law, though the suspect was charged under a local county ordinance. The incident has renewed calls from activists and business leaders for the state's Republican-led senate to pass legislation that would impose harsher penalties for such crimes.</p>

In an interview, she confirmed that military leadership has not indicated plans for troop deployment, only for providing office space to ICE. Duckworth also criticized the administration's lack of cooperation with local officials and raised concerns about a recent U.S. military strike on an alleged drug boat in international waters, arguing it sets a dangerous precedent. She asserted that such actions by the president serve as distractions from other pressing national and international issues.</p>

          <p>In an open commentary, Dr. Timothy Johnson, a longtime medical editor, publicly pleads with Republican Senator Bill Cassidy to challenge the actions of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Johnson reminds Cassidy of his promise to ensure HHS policies are based on scientific evidence, a promise he believes Kennedy has broken. The plea highlights Kennedy's firing of CDC vaccine advisors and his decision to cut nearly $500 million in funding for mRNA vaccine research.

          <p>Four senior physicians who recently resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have spoken out against the policies of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. They express deep concern that changes, such as new COVID vaccine recommendations for children and the firing of the CDC's director, are not based on scientific evidence and jeopardize the nation's public health infrastructure. The former officials warn that these actions erode trust in the CDC and could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases. The Trump administration has defended Kennedy's changes as necessary to reform a broken public health system.</p>

          <p>An economic analysis suggests that while the Trump administration's elimination of the "de minimis" tariff exemption will affect some small businesses, widespread panic is unwarranted. The article argues that the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly impacted by the change, which primarily affects those importing goods under $800. While acknowledging that tariffs lead to price increases, the author contends that the economy can likely absorb these costs as long as income and wealth continue to grow. Businesses are advised to adapt by diversifying suppliers and exploring alternative financing options for customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to end the war in Gaza and secure a deal for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. The demonstrations, some of the largest in recent months, included emotional appeals from the families of hostages who fear that an expanded military offensive will further endanger their loved ones. Despite growing domestic and international pressure, the Israeli government has shown no signs of halting its military campaign, vowing to achieve total victory over Hamas and gain full control of the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, he confirmed reports that he has banned scouts from the New England Patriots, his former team, from attending his team's practices. Belichick stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome at his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship since his departure. The win provided a much-needed positive result for the Tar Heels after an embarrassing season-opening loss to TCU earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>London Underground staff have begun a five-day strike over pay and working conditions, causing significant disruption across the city's transport network. The rolling action by members of the RMT union, who are demanding a 32-hour work week and protesting fatigue, will result in little to no service on most Tube lines through Thursday. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but rejected the shorter work week as unaffordable. The strike has also forced the rescheduling of two concerts by the artist Post Malone, as the venue's license requires adequate public transportation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that China's recent ramp-up of coal power does not signify a reversal of its climate policy but rather serves as a practical support system for its massive expansion of renewable energy. With solar capacity more than doubling in the first half of the year, the existing grid struggles with "curtailment," where clean energy is generated but cannot be used. Coal plants act as a shock absorber, ensuring grid stability and preventing blackouts during peak demand or when hydropower is reduced by drought. This backup capacity allows China to continue its aggressive build-out of renewables without risking energy security.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is facing criticism for its decision to ask television partners not to show any crowd disruptions or negative reactions directed at Donald Trump during the US Open men's final. An opinion article argues this move is a cowardly and hypocritical act of censorship that contradicts the tournament's brand of being rowdy and unfiltered. The author contends that crowd dissent is a form of democratic expression and that shielding a political figure from it sanitizes the event's authenticity. This decision is seen as a capitulation that undermines the tournament's progressive history and integrity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's extensive portfolio of luxury golf courses generated $354 million in revenue in 2024, according to ethics filings. A recent five-day trip to Scotland highlighted how he combines promoting his family's properties with official duties, as he opened a new course while also arranging trade talks with the European Union Commission president. The article notes that while his family manages his businesses, taxpayers still cover significant costs for such trips, including security and transportation on Air Force One. Critics from ethics organizations point to his frequent visits to his own properties as a way he has profited from his presidency. (not investment advice)</p>

The company, which became Lithuania's first tech "unicorn," faced a major crisis in 2016 after introducing a commission fee that nearly halted its growth. After scrapping the fee and investing in TV advertising, Vinted rebounded to become a dominant player in the second-hand fashion market.</p>

This move coincides with discussions in the Trump administration about potentially using private contractors in a post-war Ukraine.

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is actively encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, a Christian invocation, following the implementation of a new state law allowing time for prayer and religious texts. This stance is in sharp contrast to his actions in 2017, when his office raised concerns about Muslim students using a classroom for prayer, suggesting it was exclusionary. Critics, including civil rights groups, accuse Paxton of promoting Christian nationalism and violating the constitutional separation of church and state by favoring one religion over others.

The referral, which accuses Cook of misrepresenting her primary residence on loan applications, is seen by many as politically motivated, as it provides President Trump with a basis to try and remove her from the Federal Reserve board.</p>

          <p>A rare human case of New World screwworm in a Maryland traveler highlights a growing threat to the United States after being eradicated over 50 years ago. The parasitic fly, which lays eggs in the wounds of warm-blooded animals, is resurging through Central America and Mexico, threatening to cross the U.S. border and devastate the multi-billion dollar livestock industry. For decades, a biological barrier using sterile flies has kept the parasite contained in Panama, but this defense has recently been breached. The U.S. is now investing millions to ramp up sterile fly production, but experts warn that climate change and reduced agricultural staff could complicate efforts.</p>

Rayner's departure has led to a major cabinet reorganization, with David Lammy becoming Deputy Prime Minister and Yvette Cooper taking the role of Foreign Secretary.
