          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed over two dozen civilians. India has blamed Pakistan for the attack and conducted strikes on what it claims were terrorist infrastructure sites within Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, though no military facilities were targeted. Pakistan has responded by calling the strikes an act of war and initiated its own forceful response, stating that civilians were killed in the Indian strikes, which India denies. The international community, including President Trump and the UN, has urged restraint, fearing a larger military confrontation between the two nuclear-armed countries.</p>

          <p>Montana Governor Greg Gianforte has vetoed House Bill 477, which would have phased out the use of Styrofoam containers in the state, particularly within the hospitality industry. Gianforte, a Republican, described the bill as government overreach and argued that it would impose unnecessary costs on businesses and taxpayers. Proponents of the bill contended that Styrofoam poses environmental and health risks. The governor stated that he enjoys hot coffee in a Styrofoam cup, illustrating his disagreement with the bill's premise, and further noted that the bill inconsistently targets restaurants and food-service establishments while ignoring other industries that use Styrofoam.</p>

          <p>Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) has issued disappointing guidance, attributing it to macroeconomic conditions and the impact of new tariffs. The company's Q3 earnings fell short of expectations, and its Q4 outlook is also below analyst predictions. CEO Charles Liang noted that customers are delaying commitments due to uncertainty surrounding AI platforms. Despite a 19% year-over-year revenue growth, Super Micro is refraining from providing fiscal 2026 guidance because of tariff-related uncertainties. The company experienced a tumultuous year, including a short seller report and auditor resignation, but has since filed its annual report and regained compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements.</p>

Some analysts question how the Houthis will justify dealing with an American administration that does not restrain Israel's actions in Gaza.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston is considering whether noncitizens in the United States have the same constitutional right to free speech as U.S. citizens. The question arose during a court hearing related to the Trump administration's revocation of foreign student visas. Judge William Young suggested it is "not clear" that noncitizens have the "full rights to free speech" that citizens have, as the Trump administration attempts to use the speech of some international students to justify their deportations. The case is expected to proceed to a trial in July.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can enforce its ban on transgender troops while legal challenges to the policy move forward. Lower courts had blocked the ban, saying it was not supported by evidence and violated equal protection principles. The ruling was unsigned and offered no reasoning, with all three of the court’s liberal justices dissenting. The Pentagon began enforcing a ban on transgender troops in February, and about 4,200 service members are transgender. This is a developing story.</p>

          <p>A couple visiting Boston claims they were forced out of the Liberty Hotel after a security guard confronted one of them in the women’s restroom, alleging she was a man. The hotel initially accused the women of sharing a stall, which is not permitted, and stated that they were removed after one of them touched a security team member. However, after an investigation, the hotel suspended the security officer involved and is conducting mandatory retraining for staff on inclusive practices. The hotel also plans to make a donation to a local LGBTQ+ organization. The incident comes amid heightened tensions between the administration and the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first fiscal-quarter earnings that topped expectations and provided a strong forecast for current-quarter revenue, according to the article. However, the company will take a $1.5 billion hit to revenue from chip restrictions to China. CEO Lisa Su said that the company achieved its first-quarter results despite grappling regulations on advanced AI chip exports. The company's forecast included $800 million in costs that the company said it would incur because the U.S. limited the export of some of the company's artificial intelligence chips during the quarter.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a $7.5 billion federal tax incentive to keep more film and television productions in the U.S. Despite public enmity between Newsom and President Trump, the Governor has reached out to the White House in hopes of working together on the creation of a federal tax incentive program. While Hollywood insiders have wanted a federal tax incentive program all along, the initiative faces significant obstacles, including convincing taxpayers to support an industry viewed as wealthy and politically liberal. Even if passed, there's no guarantee that filming would automatically flow back to the U.S.</p>

          <p>A US think tank, the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, is urging the Trump administration to adopt a pragmatic approach towards North Korea, taking a “slow and paced” tack on denuclearisation and engaging regional stakeholders such as China.

During his first term, Trump held a series of historic talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on the issue.

          <p>Donald Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency ventures, particularly through his company World Liberty Financial Inc., is raising significant ethical and legal concerns. Experts argue that Trump is using his position to profit from the promotion of meme coins and stablecoins, potentially violating constitutional prohibitions against bribery and corruption. These ventures have drawn criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, with concerns that they could undermine the cryptocurrency industry's reputation and jeopardize pending legislation. Some elite law firms are declining pro bono work on lawsuits challenging the administration’s policies, fearing Trump’s wrath.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with President Trump, Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney, employed an “elbows-up” defense strategy to protect Canada's interests and avoid a public fight. Despite tensions stemming from Trump's remarks about Canada becoming the 51st state and new tariffs, both leaders sought to play it cool. Carney firmly stated that Canada was “not for sale,” while Trump signaled he would maintain a hard line on trade deals. The meeting highlighted the potential effects of Trump's trade war, which can repel voters abroad and lead to the election of leaders who will stand up to the U.S.</p>

          <p>India's strikes on Pakistan have intensified the conflict over Kashmir, a territory claimed by both nations, as reported by the New York Times. The attacks followed a deadly terrorist incident in Indian-administered Kashmir, which prompted India to conduct strikes on sites it claims were linked to terrorist activities. Pakistan, however, condemned the strikes as an act of war, raising fears of further escalation between the two nuclear powers. The origins of the dispute trace back to the 1947 partition of British India, and the region remains one of the most militarized areas in the world.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reportedly planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a popular energy efficiency certification for home appliances. According to agency documents and a recording of an internal meeting, divisions overseeing climate change and energy efficiency, including the Energy Star program, will be eliminated as part of an agency reorganization. The Energy Star program has been credited with saving households and businesses billions of dollars in energy costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The move is part of a broader restructuring that will shrink the agency's staffing to levels last seen during the Reagan administration.</p>

The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks at least $50 million in damages for the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024. The lawsuit also names Robinson's wife, Frances Robinson, as a defendant, alleging that she enabled his behavior and created a hostile work environment. The women, who are withholding their legal names, cite fears of retaliation and public shame as reasons for not coming forward sooner.</p>
