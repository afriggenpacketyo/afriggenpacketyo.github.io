          <p>South African police have arrested nearly 1,000 undocumented foreign nationals for illegal mining activities at the historic Sheba Gold Mine in Mpumalanga province. The week-long operation, titled "Vala Umgodi," targeted individuals working deep underground, many of whom are believed to be from neighboring countries like Mozambique and Eswatini. This major crackdown highlights the nation's persistent and dangerous issue of "zama-zamas," or illegal miners, who often risk their lives in abandoned or active mines following the decline of the formal mining sector. The mine's owner welcomed the arrests, emphasizing that illegal mining poses a severe threat to safety and will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>According to Gaza's Health Ministry, at least 325 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces over the past week while attempting to access desperately needed food aid. These deadly incidents occurred despite Israeli assurances of a humanitarian pause, as a UN-backed report warns that a full-blown famine is now unfolding across the war-torn territory. While Israel's military states its troops only fired warning shots to control crowds in some cases, aid agencies report that severe restrictions and chaotic conditions have made safe distribution nearly impossible. The crisis has drawn sharp international condemnation and urgent calls for unimpeded humanitarian access to prevent further deaths from starvation.</p>

          <p>Mel Owens, the new star of "The Golden Bachelor," is performing damage control after facing public criticism for his stated dating preferences. The 66-year-old former NFL linebacker revealed he had asked producers for female contestants between the ages of 45 and 60, sparking backlash. Owens has since explained his preference was based on his personal frame of reference from when he last dated and was unaware of the show's typical age range. He apologized directly to the contestants on the first day of filming, calling his remarks "unfair" and "insensitive," and hopes to earn back their trust as the season progresses.</p>

          <p>The 2026 race for California governor has been thrown into uncertainty following former Vice President Kamala Harris's decision not to run, resetting the political landscape. With no clear front-runner, several Democratic candidates, including former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter and U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, are now vying for the top position. Political analysts note that none of the current contenders possess broad statewide name recognition, making fundraising, endorsements from figures like Nancy Pelosi, and overall campaign strategy crucial in the now wide-open field. The latest financial disclosures show a competitive race, but candidates must significantly ramp up spending to build their profiles across the vast state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of nursing home care in Germany has surged to an average of €3,248 per month, a sum that is increasingly unaffordable for many retirees whose average pension is around €1,100. This growing gap between income and care expenses has prompted urgent calls for reform of the country's long-term care insurance system, which is described as being on the verge of collapse. The rising costs are attributed to higher wages for nursing staff and increased staffing levels, but residents also bear the expenses of facility maintenance and staff training. Officials are exploring solutions like tax subsidies or higher contributions from wealthy individuals to address the crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating whether former Special Counsel Jack Smith violated the Hatch Act during his tenure. The probe was initiated following a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to interfere with the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent agency that enforces restrictions on partisan political activities by government employees and is distinct from the Department of Justice role Smith held. Since Smith is no longer a federal employee, the potential repercussions of a violation are unclear, though the OSC could refer its findings to the DOJ.</p>

During the war, Romania's pro-Nazi regime deported over 25,000 Roma to Transnistria, where many perished from starvation and disease. Officials and activists are now pushing for better enforcement of anti-racism laws and greater historical education to ensure the victims are remembered and to fight modern-day discrimination.</p>

          <p>Police officers in England and Wales will receive a 4.2% pay increase, a figure slightly above the current inflation rate but one that has drawn criticism from the Police Federation. The association, which represents over 145,000 officers, described the raise as "barely treading water" and insufficient to address long-term pay erosion or crises in officer retention and mental health. In contrast, the Home Secretary framed the award as a "clear signal of our gratitude," and the National Police Chiefs' Council called it a deserved reflection of officers' work. The pay award will be supported by an additional £120 million from the Home Office to help police forces manage the cost.</p>

Earlier, India built a commanding lead by posting a total of 396, largely thanks to a brilliant century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and surprise half-centuries from Akash Deep and Washington Sundar.

The move comes as Dončić has reportedly dedicated his offseason to improving his physical conditioning, signaling his commitment to leading the team to success.</p>

          <p>A report from Gothamist has uncovered dozens of allegedly fraudulent signatures on New York City Mayor Eric Adams' petition to appear on the November ballot as an independent candidate. The investigation found over 50 instances where individuals claimed their names were forged, including three who were deceased, while others said they were deceived into signing. Although the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far exceeding the 7,500 required, the findings raise questions about the petitioning process. An attorney for the mayor stated that the campaign did not direct anyone to break the law and would conduct its own review.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team secured a dominant 97-7 victory over Spain, running in 15 tries in a one-sided match at Welford Road. The comprehensive win, however, was marred by a red card for captain Marlie Packer in the second half for a clumsy clearout. The incident means Packer may miss some of England's initial pool-stage matches at the upcoming Rugby World Cup, pending a disciplinary review. Before the dismissal, England showcased its formidable power, with Helena Rowland scoring a hat-trick and numerous other players crossing for tries in what became a glorified training session against the outmatched Spanish side.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military has reported successful strikes on key infrastructure targets deep inside Russia, including a major oil refinery in Ryazan and an oil storage facility in the Voronezh region. The attacks, carried out by Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, reportedly caused a fire at the refinery. Additionally, the SBU intelligence agency claimed its drones hit the Primorsko-Akhtarsk military airfield, which has been used to launch drone attacks on Ukraine, as well as an electronics factory in Penza that supplies Russia's military. These long-range strikes represent a significant strategic effort by Kyiv to disrupt Russia's war-making capabilities on its own territory.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have exposed a significant graft scheme involving the procurement of military drones and signal-jamming systems at inflated prices. Investigators announced that a sitting lawmaker, local officials, and national guard personnel were caught taking kickbacks of up to 30% on state contracts with suppliers. The revelation came just two days after the agencies' independence was restored by parliament, a reversal of a government move that had sparked the largest protests since Russia's 2022 invasion. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who met with agency heads, affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption and praised the teamwork that exposed the scheme.</p>

Founder Paulana Lamonier started the organization to teach more Black people to swim, aiming to create a ripple effect of more instructors and lifeguards from the community. Statistics show a stark racial disparity in swimming ability and drowning rates, with Black children being significantly more likely to drown than their white peers.

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity, a surge driven primarily by economic factors rather than state climate policy. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leading the expansion, capitalizing on streamlined regulations for projects under 75 megawatts and the falling cost of solar energy compared to natural gas. However, the industry faces headwinds from the federal rollback of tax credits, which is expected to slow rooftop solar installations significantly. To maintain momentum, the state must address growing grid constraints and invest in storage and infrastructure to support its burgeoning solar market. (not investment advice)</p>
