          <p>Amid recent announcements from major drug companies pausing or scrapping UK projects, science minister Lord Patrick Vallance has stated that price increases for medicines are necessary. He argued that raising the prices the National Health Service (NHS) pays is essential to prevent a wave of pharmaceutical investment from leaving the country. This comes as industry critics cite low drug prices and a lack of government investment as key factors pushing firms away from the UK, a situation the government is now actively discussing with the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

          <p>Premiership Rugby is in discussions to stage a league game at the iconic Wrigley Field in Chicago, home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The proposed match, potentially for the 2026-27 season, aims to boost the sport's profile in the United States ahead of the country hosting the 2031 Rugby World Cup. The plan aligns with the league's strategy to attract American investment and would coincide with the 100th anniversary of its Chicago-based title sponsor, Gallagher, which has strong ties to the Cubs.</p>

          <p>A report from S&P has warned that China's banking sector could be facing a 'Japanification moment,' characterized by a prolonged period of low growth and weak profitability. This situation mirrors the economic stagnation Japan experienced after its asset bubble burst in the 1990s. The report suggests that Beijing's efforts to stimulate the economy by cutting prime loan rates to historic lows are further squeezing the profitability of mainland banks, which may have limited options to counteract the trend.

          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into ticket sales for the Oasis reunion tour, Ticketmaster has agreed to improve its price transparency. The company will now have to provide fans with 24 hours' advance notice if a tiered pricing system is in use and give more accurate information about ticket prices during online queues. The CMA had raised concerns that Ticketmaster may have misled fans with unclear pricing, though it found no evidence of algorithmic 'dynamic pricing' being used.</p>

          <p>The British government is exploring options to financially support suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a cyber-attack forced the carmaker to suspend production. With JLR's factories shut until at least October, there are growing fears that smaller firms in the supply chain, which rely heavily on JLR's business, could go bankrupt. One potential measure being considered is for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts from these suppliers to ensure their survival until JLR's production lines resume.</p>

          <p>Cleanup operations are underway in southern China's Guangdong province following the impact of Super Typhoon Ragasa, which was the world's strongest typhoon so far this year. Despite the storm's intensity, no typhoon-related casualties were reported in the province as of Thursday. The main priorities for officials are assessing the damage and restoring essential services and infrastructure, as the storm brought down over 50,000 trees and caused flooding and power outages in cities like Yangjiang.</p>

          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has ordered all agency facilities to be on a higher state of alert following a deadly shooting in Dallas.

          <p>The term 'lavender marriage,' which historically referred to marriages of convenience between a man and a woman to conceal the homosexuality of one or both partners, has been reimagined by Gen Z on TikTok. In its modern interpretation, the trend involves young people proposing platonic marriages to friends for practical benefits like shared financial burdens, stability, and companionship, rather than for love or sex.

          <p>England's head coach John Mitchell has named an unchanged starting fifteen and bench for the Women's Rugby World Cup final against Canada. The match will be held at a sold-out, 82,000-capacity Twickenham stadium, setting a new attendance record for a women's rugby match. The professional English side, currently on a record 32-Test winning streak, are the favorites to win their first World Cup since 2014, but face a formidable and in-form Canadian team.</p>

          <p>British boxer Chantelle Cameron has been upgraded from 'interim' to full WBC light-welterweight world champion.

Cameron, who handed Taylor her first professional defeat in 2023 before losing the rematch, has now been ordered to make a mandatory defense of her new title against fellow Briton Sandy Ryan.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has installed a new 'Presidential Walk of Fame' at the White House, but instead of a traditional portrait for his predecessor, Joe Biden, he has used a photo of an autopen signing Biden's name. This act is a direct reference to Trump's frequent and unsubstantiated allegations that Biden was not mentally fit during his term and that decisions were made without his full awareness. The snub is the latest in a series of efforts by Trump to delegitimize his predecessor.</p>
