        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is experiencing one of its driest springs in a century, impacting agriculture, groundwater levels, and consumer prices. The lack of rainfall since February has led to increased wildfire risks and low water levels in the Rhine, hindering cargo ship transport and potentially raising consumer costs. Experts warn that the dry soil repels water, making it difficult for rain to replenish groundwater, especially during heavy rainfall events. Environmental organizations emphasize the urgent need for rain to support plant growth and prevent long-term damage to ecosystems, while the energy sector is exploring renewable sources to reduce water consumption for cooling power stations. The situation highlights the growing challenges of water management in the face of climate change. Optimism for the overall situation is low due to the lack of immediate solutions.</p>

          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has departed from his role as the Doctor in 'Doctor Who' after two series, regenerating into Billie Piper, who previously played the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler. The BBC's press release acknowledges the regeneration but teases the mystery surrounding Piper's return. Piper initially appeared in the show in 2005 alongside Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant, and has since enjoyed a successful acting career on TV and stage. Gatwa's 18-month tenure as the Doctor is the shortest since Christopher Eccleston's departure after one series in 2005, marking a surprising turn for the beloved science fiction series. The circumstances surrounding this regeneration remain unclear to fans.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst faced a hostile crowd at a town hall meeting, where constituents questioned her support for President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The tension escalated when Ernst defended proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP by stating that those removed from the programs would be ineligible individuals, leading to shouts from the crowd. In response to concerns that people would die due to the cuts, Ernst remarked, "Well, we all are going to die," which triggered further outrage. The bill includes significant tax cuts for the wealthy and slashes funding for social programs, sparking debate and concern over its potential impact on the nation's debt and vulnerable populations. The senator's perspective did not align with the tone of the crowd.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Bulgarians protested in Sofia and other cities against the country's plans to adopt the euro, demanding a referendum on the issue. Concerns that the euro will harm Bulgaria's economy, combined with a mistrust of institutions, have fueled opposition to the currency switch. Disinformation campaigns have also stoked fears that the economic changes will lead to increased poverty. Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has proposed a referendum, citing public concerns over inflation and purchasing power, but parliament rejected the proposal, accusing Radev of acting on behalf of Russia.

          <p>Recent Supreme Court decisions have made legal immigrants more vulnerable to deportation, marking a shift for a population that entered the country legally and shared personal information with the government. The court's rulings have narrowed the scope of protections previously afforded to legal immigrants, raising concerns about due process and the potential for unjust deportations. This development has sparked debate among legal experts and immigrant rights advocates, who argue that the decisions undermine the principles of fairness and predictability in immigration law. The rulings could have far-reaching consequences for the lives of many immigrants who have built their lives in the United States.</p>

The U.S. envoy to the Middle East deemed Hamas' response "totally unacceptable." The proposal involves the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and humanitarian aid, but disagreements persist over key terms, hindering progress towards a ceasefire agreement.

          <p>The Independent reports that obese patients are being denied hip and knee replacements by the NHS in England and Wales based on their body mass index (BMI), despite NICE guidelines advising against using BMI to restrict access. Patients are required to lose weight before being eligible, but NHS weight loss programs have long waiting lists or have been shut down due to demand. The Royal College of Surgeons criticizes the policy, warning it could worsen patients' health, while a former health minister calls for more government action to address obesity. This decision has sparked controversy due to the challenges in providing adequate weight management support.</p>

China responded by accusing the U.S. of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace.

          <p>Inflation has hit New York City's iconic bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, with bodegas like El Vacilon Grocery in Brooklyn raising prices for the first time since 2019. The price increase is driven by soaring costs of eggs, bacon, cheese, and bread, as well as rising labor and utility expenses. Bodegas, which serve as both convenience stores and delis, face challenges due to their limited storage and inability to buy in bulk. Despite declining revenue, El Vacilon has managed to stay afloat due to owning its building and collecting rent from apartments above the store, reflecting the financial pressures faced by small businesses in the city.</p>

          <p>As the nation's top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to find environmental toxins responsible for its rise. However, many autism scientists argue that Kennedy is misdirected, as genetics are the most significant driver of autism's development, not a single environmental toxin. Experts say the increase in US autism rates is mostly explained by expanding definitions, more awareness, and better screening. Researchers fear Kennedy's fixation on outside toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of exciting new therapies for those with profound autism.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis that has forced school closures and inspections, but the city's request for federal support was denied by the Trump administration. The CDC's lead exposure team was laid off, leaving Milwaukee without the necessary expertise to navigate the crisis. The city is conducting its own inspections and blood testing clinics, but lacks the federal guidance needed for effective epidemiological investigations. The situation highlights the consequences of federal budget and staffing cuts on local governments' ability to respond to public health emergencies, leaving communities to fend for themselves amid dangerous health threats.</p>

The announcement came after the bodies of five Mexican musicians were found in Reynosa along the Texas border. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico cited confidentiality laws and couldn't provide more information, but the suspension reflects the Trump administration's targeting of Mexican artists who glorify criminal groups, though Grupo Firme has recently distanced itself from such music.</p>
