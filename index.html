        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave with temperatures expected to reach 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow thunderstorm warning for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The warning is in effect from Saturday afternoon into Sunday, with potential for flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert is also in place until Monday, raising concerns about pressures on health and social care services and a potential rise in deaths, particularly among the elderly and those with health conditions. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and scientists attribute the increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves to climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several towns and cities in eastern Germany are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation, with Guben being one such example. The "trial living" scheme provides people with the opportunity to stay for up to four weeks without charge, aiming to encourage long-term relocation. Guben, like many eastern German cities, has experienced significant demographic changes since reunification, including declining birth rates and emigration of young people. The city is also investing in new industries such as battery production, hoping to fill around 300 job vacancies.</p>

          <p>Protests broke out in southeast Los Angeles County following an immigration raid at a car wash in Bell, where federal agents detained at least three people. Masked men in fatigues were seen chasing and detaining car wash employees, leading to confrontations with protesters who confronted the agents. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Border Patrol vehicles were violently targeted during lawful operations, with one vehicle rammed and tires slashed. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass questioned the identity and lack of identification of the armed individuals, while protesters waved Mexican flags and chanted against the agents.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their 2025 tour with a defeat against Argentina, highlighting issues with cohesion in the newly formed side. While the Lions demonstrated ambition in their attacking shape and created opportunities, their execution was lacking, with offloads going to ground and passes missing their targets. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed his frustration, emphasizing the need for sharper play as they head to Australia. Despite the loss, there were encouraging signs in their ball-handling, but Farrell will demand better.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's property sector is facing a prolonged downturn, compounded by a shrinking population, which is further suppressing demand for new homes. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain below 5 million units per year, a significant drop from the 20 million units seen in 2017. The country's population is projected to decline to below 1.39 billion by 2035, leading to a decrease in demographic demand for housing. Despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, stagnant incomes and job instability continue to discourage young people from having more children.</p>

          <p>The head of China's United Front Work Department has cautioned religious organizations to guard against "hidden dangers" and resist foreign infiltration. This warning, delivered by Li Ganjie, follows similar calls from President Xi Jinping for the "sinicisation of religion." The increased scrutiny comes ahead of the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday, adding to existing tensions between the Chinese government and Tibetan Buddhism. Top security officials have also called for the defeat of "separatism" in Qinghai province, the birthplace of the exiled Dalai Lama.</p>

However, critics view the attack as politically motivated and a distraction from his domestic troubles, including his ongoing corruption trial. Despite the widespread support for the military action, it remains uncertain whether it will translate into increased political capital for Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Job Garcia, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, was arrested after filming federal agents at a Home Depot and held for over an hour near Dodger Stadium, where he overheard agents boasting about the number of immigrants they arrested. Garcia said agents referred to those arrested as "bodies," which he found deeply disturbing. He recounted being tackled and arrested after questioning the agents' actions, despite being a U.S. citizen. Garcia's experience highlights concerns about potential civil rights violations during immigration enforcement operations.</p>

A 42-year-old woman was shot in the leg during the game, leading to a lawsuit accusing the team of negligence and recklessness. The shooting, which remains shrouded in mystery, prompted panic among some patrons and the cancellation of a postgame concert. It remains unclear how a weapon was able to get into the stadium, given the ballpark's prohibition on weapons.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has passed legislation banning the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who supports such bans, and if signed, Rhode Island will join 10 other states with similar prohibitions. The legislation only applies to the sale and manufacturing, not possession, making it the second state after Washington with such a law. Critics argue the ban will not curb mass shootings and punishes law-abiding citizens, with some predicting the U.S. Supreme Court will deem it unconstitutional.</p>

The clash, which resulted in one Cambodian soldier's death, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula.
