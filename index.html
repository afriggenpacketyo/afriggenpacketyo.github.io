          <p>The European Union has formally adopted its 17th package of sanctions against Russia as EU defense and foreign ministers convene in Brussels, according to DW reporting. This action occurs amidst ongoing discussions regarding a potential ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, prompted by a phone call between Presidents Trump and Putin. However, the conditions for these talks remain unclear, with Russia seeking "compromises" from Ukraine, while Kyiv rejects any withdrawal of its forces from annexed territories. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has called for Washington to impose consequences if Moscow does not agree to an unconditional ceasefire, emphasizing the need for a firm stance against Russian aggression.

          <p>While President Trump's approval ratings have declined, Democrats are not necessarily benefiting, as many voters remain distrustful of both parties, according to a recent Vox article. Polls indicate that voters disillusioned with Trump are not flocking to the Democratic Party, with many feeling that the party is out of touch with average Americans. The article notes that young voters and voters of color who supported Trump in 2024 are showing signs of dissatisfaction, but are not necessarily returning to the Democratic fold. This presents a challenge for Democrats who hope to capitalize on Trump's unpopularity in upcoming elections, as they need to find ways to connect with these disaffected voters. ()</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, has lost her appeal against a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred after posting a racist message on X following the Southport attacks last year, according to the BBC. Connolly's post called for "mass deportation now" and urged her followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers. The Court of Appeal judges ruled that the sentence was not manifestly excessive, given the wide reach of the post, which had been viewed 310,000 times before it was deleted. Her husband, Ray Connolly, subsequently lost his seat in local elections. ()</p>

Home Depot's sales patterns improved throughout the first quarter, with a positive response to its spring Black Friday event and strong sales in certain departments, while sales have been softer in areas related to larger renovation projects.

          <p>Major League Soccer (MLS) is undermining its own publicity by editing out Lionel Messi's ire over refereeing decisions, according to The Guardian. Despite Messi's complaints driving headlines and attention to the league, MLS has chosen to bury the controversial play and Messi's criticism. This approach does a disservice to fans and the media, who want a fuller understanding of the story. The author argues that the chaos and controversy are enticing entry points for new fans and that the league should embrace the drama rather than trying to create a false impression of sober proceduralism.

          <p>Sidney Blumenthal argues that President Trump's economic policies are creating a mess he cannot fix, including rising inflation, higher unemployment, shortages, and lower growth, in an op-ed for The Guardian. Trump's attempts to blame others and intimidate corporations are failing to address the underlying issues. The tariffs and tax cuts are creating a stagflationary environment, with small businesses, family farms, and large corporations all suffering. The uncertainty created by Trump's policies has frozen planning and distorted supply chains. ()</p>
