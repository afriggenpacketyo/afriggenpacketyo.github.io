          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman criticized President Trump's tariff policies, warning of a potential "economic nuclear winter" due to the impact on global trade and business confidence. Ackman, who previously endorsed Trump, expressed concern over the disproportionate tariffs on both allies and adversaries, predicting severe negative consequences for low-income consumers already under economic stress. He suggested Trump should consider a timeout for negotiations to resolve unfair tariff deals, highlighting the risk of an economic downturn. The article also mentions U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and his firm's potential conflict of interest.

A group of crypto industry veterans acquired majority ownership of Janover and plans to rename it DeFi Development Corporation. The company raised $42 million through convertible notes and warrants to acquire SOL, emphasizing Solana's potential for powering decentralized finance applications. While Bitcoin is seen as a store of value, Solana is optimized for speed, usability, and programmability, according to the new chairman and CEO Joseph Onorati.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 08:45:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the possibility of a global recession triggered by President Trump's tariffs, emphasizing that stock market performance doesn't always mirror the overall economy. Increased tariffs are expected to raise costs and reduce profits for companies, increasing the risk of a recession. An economy is technically in recession when spending and exports shrink for two consecutive quarters. The article uses the UK economy as an example, showing it is too early to determine if it has entered a recession.

China accused the U.S. of economic bullying but expressed confidence in its ability to manage the situation. Malaysia will lead ASEAN in discussing the trade war's impact, while Indonesia plans to increase imports of U.S. goods to mitigate trade imbalances.

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices fell below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, due to concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession. OPEC+ producers' decision to increase production also contributed to the downward pressure on prices. Trump touted the lower oil prices, while analysts warn that tariffs could increase business costs, slow economic activity, and ultimately reduce demand for oil. JPMorgan has increased its odds of a recession this year to 60% following the tariff rollout.

          <p>Bitcoin's price dipped below $77,000 as cryptocurrencies joined a broader market rout fueled by President Trump's global tariffs and resulting recession fears. Investors dumped crypto holdings over the weekend in anticipation of further market volatility. Other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana's token also experienced significant losses. Analysts suggest Bitcoin is viewed as a risk-on asset and will likely move in tandem with equities until global recession fears subside, although some believe Bitcoin could benefit from long-term deglobalization trends.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields declined as President Trump's tariffs fueled fears of an economic slowdown, leading traders to expect further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

The tariffs, impacting over 180 countries, have raised concerns about a global trade war as countries retaliate with their own tariffs.

          <p>Despite the Myanmar military junta and a rebel group alliance announcing temporary ceasefires to aid earthquake relief, fighting has continued. The UN Human Rights office reports at least 14 military attacks since the ceasefire. The military accuses rebel groups of initiating attacks, while one group claims fighting was a response to military offensives. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights urged a halt to all military operations to focus on earthquake relief.

          <p>Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and the Toronto Blue Jays have reportedly agreed to a $500 million, 14-year contract extension starting in 2026, preventing him from entering free agency next offseason. The deal does not include any deferred money. Guerrero, a four-time All-Star, had previously agreed to a $28.5 million, one-year contract to avoid arbitration. This long-term commitment solidifies Guerrero's place as a cornerstone of the Blue Jays franchise as they seek their first World Series title since 1993.

          <p>British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover announced it would suspend shipments to the U.S. for a month to assess the impact of President Trump's new tariffs on vehicle imports. The U.S. has implemented a 25% tariff on foreign cars, effective Thursday, with potential tariffs on auto parts to follow. Jaguar Land Rover considers the U.S. an important market but is taking short-term actions, including pausing shipments, while developing longer-term plans. The escalating trade war is expected to significantly impact the global car industry.

          <p>A second unvaccinated child in Texas has died from complications related to measles, amidst an ongoing outbreak in West Texas.

Kennedy Jr., despite his history of vaccine skepticism, has voiced support for the measles vaccine and deployed CDC teams to Texas. Experts emphasize the importance of vaccination to prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease.

          <p>Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller clarified his position on tariffs, stating that he does not support tariffs exceeding 10%, distancing himself from President Trump's sweeping tariff plan. Druckenmiller has previously expressed a more nuanced view on tariffs, seeing them as a consumption tax with potential benefits, but only within a limited range. His statement comes as stock prices have sharply declined following Trump's tariff announcement, reflecting market concerns about the potential economic impact.

          <p>This article explores the complex issue of repressed memories, prompted by the popularity of Amy Griffin's memoir, "The Tell," which details her recovery of repressed memories of sexual abuse. It examines the science behind memory, highlighting that most researchers and psychologists believe that repressed memories are not real, and that traumatic events are more likely to be remembered accurately. The article also discusses the role of therapy, particularly psychedelic therapy, in memory recall, and the ethical considerations of working with patients who believe they have recovered repressed memories. It also discusses the importance of balancing scientific accuracy with validating the experiences of survivors.

Hamas stated the rocket fire was retaliation for Israeli "massacres of civilians in Gaza."

          <p>The UK government is relaxing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry, which is facing new trade tariffs from the US. While the ban on new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 remains, manufacturers will have more flexibility in meeting annual targets and face lower fines. The government has sped up these changes in response to the US tariffs, with transport secretary Heidi Alexander mentioning that this is not a "silver bullet" but part of the solution to respond to the US tariffs. The UK is also confirming a ban on hybrid vehicles from 2035.
