          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 13:24:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is initiating a program to offer undocumented immigrants $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to return to their home countries voluntarily. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that 'self-deportation' is the safest and most cost-effective option, estimating a 70% savings for taxpayers compared to the cost of arrest, detention, and removal, which averages $17,121 per person. The program utilizes the CBP's 'Home' app, with stipends disbursed upon confirmed arrival in the immigrant's country of origin, and participants will be deprioritized for detention and removal while preparing to depart, potentially improving chances for future legal immigration. The article mentions the program has already been employed by one person who left Chicago to return to Honduras.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alpine is reportedly planning to replace Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto after just six races into the Formula 1 season, a decision influenced by Colapinto's signing from Williams and financial backing from Latin American sponsors. Doohan's seat has been at risk despite out-qualifying teammate Pierre Gasly in Miami, due to previous incidents, including crashes in Australia and Japan. Colapinto, who raced for Williams in nine grands prix last year, showed promise with points in Azerbaijan and the US, but had crashes in Brazil and Las Vegas, and Alpine signed Colapinto over the winter, leading to speculation he would replace Doohan, although Williams retains the option to bring him back.</p>

          <h2>Netanyahu Announces Plans for 'Forceful Entry' into Gaza</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel is 'on the eve of a forceful entry to Gaza' after the security cabinet approved a plan to seize and hold territory in the embattled enclave and relocate Palestinians to the south. The military is calling up tens of thousands of reservists for an expanded assault, which Netanyahu said would help bring home the hostages still being held in Gaza. Critics argue the offensive would endanger the remaining hostages' lives, while Israeli officials state the operation will start slowly in anticipation of cease-fire negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff exemption will likely result in higher prices for U.S. consumers on goods from China, as retailers like Shein and Temu will no longer be able to ship low-value parcels duty-free. The end of the exemption, which previously allowed packages worth up to $800 to enter the country without import levies, is expected to create administrative challenges for importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, potentially causing shipment delays. President Trump eliminated the exemption due to concerns about fentanyl flow from China, leading to new tariffs on Chinese goods and retaliatory tariffs from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Israel's government has reportedly approved plans for its forces to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory for an unspecified amount of time, which would push hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into southern Gaza.

Ciolacu stated that the coalition had failed to meet its objective and has no credibility after the Romanian vote, leading to his proposal for the PSD to leave the coalition.</p>
