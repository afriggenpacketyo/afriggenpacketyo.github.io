          <p>A husband and wife from Middletown, Rhode Island, were killed when their single-engine plane crashed on Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The aircraft, which had departed from New Bedford Regional Airport, went down in the highway median and caught fire. A driver on the highway sustained non-life-threatening injuries after their car was struck by a piece of the aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash, with weather being considered a potential factor due to a nor'easter in the area.</p>

          <p>In the contentious New Jersey gubernatorial election, Republican Jack Ciattarelli's campaign is strongly refuting claims made by his Democratic opponent, Rep. Mikie Sherrill. Sherrill has accused Ciattarelli of profiting from the opioid crisis through a medical publishing company he founded, alleging his work downplayed the dangers of opioids. Ciattarelli's team has labeled the accusations "slanderous" and threatened legal action, while Sherrill has doubled down, asserting that he was complicit in thousands of deaths. The dispute marks a significant escalation in the final days of the campaign.</p>

The blast, which occurred on Friday, destroyed a building on the campus, leaving no survivors from the incident. Authorities are using rapid DNA testing to formally identify the remains, a process described as slow and methodical due to the scene's hazardous conditions. The tight-knit community has been holding vigils to mourn the victims as the investigation into the cause of the explosion continues.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace are concerned about significant premium hikes if pandemic-era tax credits are not renewed. These federal subsidies, set to expire at the end of the year, have saved many families hundreds of dollars per month, making their coverage affordable. Health policy experts warn that without an extension, many people, particularly in states that have not expanded Medicaid, could be forced to drop their insurance coverage altogether. The issue has become a central point of contention in government spending negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several prominent U.S. news organizations, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and CNN, have refused to sign a new Pentagon policy that restricts their reporting methods. The new rules require journalists to pledge not to obtain unauthorized information and limit their access to certain areas without an official escort. Media outlets argue these restrictions undermine First Amendment protections and are designed to stifle a free press by intimidating sources within the Department of Defense. The Pentagon has defended the policy as necessary for national security.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has commented on the career of forward Marcus Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona from Manchester United. Tuchel stated that while Rashford has "no limits" to his potential, he warned the 27-year-old to avoid future regrets by consistently performing at the highest level for both his club and country. Rashford has had a promising start in Spain, but his career has been at a crossroads after falling out of favor at Manchester United. The manager emphasized that reaching one's personal best regularly is the key challenge for a player with his level of talent.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old woman from Palmdale, California, is facing murder and child abuse charges following the death of her two-year-old son from a fentanyl overdose in November 2023. Prosecutors allege that the toddler, Angel, died after ingesting fentanyl that his mother, Anaie Flores, had left accessible in their home. This case is part of a growing, though still rare, trend of prosecutors filing murder charges against parents in accidental overdose deaths involving children. The prosecutor in the case has compared leaving fentanyl accessible to leaving a loaded gun within a child's reach.</p>

The article suggests the order, building on a previous designation of antifa, could be used to weaponize federal law enforcement against political opponents in Democratic-led cities. It raises concerns that Joint Terrorism Task Forces could be turned inward to investigate protest organizers and critics of the administration, chilling free speech and eroding civil liberties.

          <p>Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, has been found guilty of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and solicitation in the 2014 killing of her former son-in-law, Daniel Markel. Markel, a Florida State University law professor, was in a bitter custody dispute with Adelson's daughter at the time of his death. Prosecutors successfully argued that Donna Adelson orchestrated the murder-for-hire plot after Markel prevented his ex-wife from moving their children closer to her family. Adelson is the fifth person to be convicted in connection with the killing.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Supply Chain Faces New Tariffs on Chinese-Made Port Equipment</h2>

          <p>Importers and port authorities are bracing for new U.S. government fees and tariffs on Chinese-made freight vessels and port machinery, set to take effect this week. The U.S. Trade Representative announced additional 150% tariffs on equipment like cranes and terminal tractors, which could raise the total tariff rate to as high as 270%. Industry groups warn that these measures will increase costs throughout the supply chain, making imports more expensive and potentially harming the competitiveness of U.S. exports. The move is part of a broader trade strategy targeting China's maritime practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Evolution of Cumbia Music in Ecuador Blends Andean and Tropical Rhythms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 15:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the unique development of cumbia music in Ecuador, which began in the late 1960s by blending traditional Andean sounds with Colombian tropical rhythms. Pioneers like Polibio Mayorga created a new musical identity by "tropicalizing" the often-stigmatized music of the Ecuadorian highlands. Later, orchestra leaders such as Medardo Luzuriaga popularized the genre nationwide, creating a lasting cultural legacy. The genre continues to evolve with forms like tecnocumbia, performed by popular all-female groups that mix Indigenous rhythms from Ecuador and Peru into a danceable format.</p>
