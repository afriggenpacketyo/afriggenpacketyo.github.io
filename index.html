          <p>Following Mark Carney's historic election victory, he now faces a divided Canada, including a generational divide in voting patterns. Young voters, concerned about housing affordability, crime, and the cost of living, coalesced around the Conservatives, reversing the trend from 2015 when youth support helped elect Justin Trudeau. Polls indicated significant support for the Conservatives among 18 to 34-year-olds, driven by frustration with Liberal policies. A key challenge for Carney and the Liberals will be regaining the confidence of these younger voters who feel let down and frustrated by the current system.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Cabinet Meeting Features Maga Hats and Conspiracy Theories</h2>

          <p>President Trump's cabinet meeting commemorating his first 100 days of his second term was marked by displays of loyalty and the promotion of conspiracy theories. Cabinet members wore "Gulf of America" hats, and Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr repeated a debunked claim about missing migrant children. Trump attempted to distance himself from negative economic data but insisted that Americans might have to accept fewer goods due to his tariff policies. The meeting highlighted the administration's focus on perceived accomplishments and its combative stance on trade.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appeared open to allowing Oklahoma to use government money to run the nation’s first religious charter school. The main question is whether the First Amendment permits states to sponsor and finance religious charter schools, deciding whether charter schools are fundamentally public or private. Conservative justices were largely sympathetic to the school, while liberal ones were wary. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself without explanation, leaving Chief Justice John Roberts with the likely deciding vote.</p>

          <p>Fox News has filed a motion for summary judgment in Smartmatic's defamation suit, arguing that its coverage of Trump's false election fraud allegations did not harm Smartmatic's business. Fox News claims that Smartmatic already had a poor reputation due to providing election services to a "corrupt regime in Venezuela." Smartmatic counters that Fox News' conduct has cost the company jobs and billions in asset value. The filing suggests that Fox News will present evidence of Smartmatic's other legal problems if the case goes to trial.</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed that egg prices are falling, disputing criticism over high egg prices and blaming his predecessor for the price hike. However, food economists say this claim is misleading, as retail egg prices have increased since Trump took office. While wholesale egg prices have dropped, it's unclear when this will translate into relief for consumers. Economists also dispute the idea that a president has significant control over egg prices, attributing changes to factors like bird flu and market demand.</p>

          <p>In the first 100 days of Trump's term, Congress has largely acquiesced to his executive actions, enacting few laws and ceding authority on fiscal matters. While GOP leaders have defended Trump's actions, some members have expressed concerns about retaliation for dissenting. Experts note a long-term trend of Congress ceding power to the executive branch, but the upcoming spending bills for fiscal year 2026 will test Congress's ability to assert its authority. Potential conflicts loom over tax cuts, border security, and energy policy, with Democrats warning against undermining Senate rules.</p>
