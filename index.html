          <p>Canada has rescinded its digital services tax just one day before the first payments were due, following a move by U.S. President Trump to halt all trade talks. The tax, a 3% levy on large tech firms like Google and Amazon, was retroactive to 2022 and drew strong opposition from the U.S. for being discriminatory against American companies. With the tax now withdrawn, Canadian officials announced that negotiations for a new economic and security relationship can resume, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.</p>

          <p>A new UK-US trade deal has reduced a 25% tariff on British cars to 10%, allowing manufacturers like Aston Martin and JLR to resume large-scale shipments to the American market. The deal, however, has drawn criticism from British farmers who feel their sector was used as a bargaining chip, citing concessions on US beef and ethanol imports. While the auto industry welcomes the relief, the new 10% duty is limited to a quota of 100,000 cars annually, offering little room for future export growth.</p>

Economists suggest that weaker export growth and a fading fiscal tailwind are likely to slow activity in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision follows international monitoring and independent sampling by China that "showed no abnormalities." While the move is seen as an effort to improve bilateral ties, China will maintain import restrictions on food from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima.

          <p>The arrest of two elementary school teachers in Japan for allegedly taking and sharing indecent photos of girls in a private social media group has raised serious concerns about child safety. The group chat, which included around eight other educators, reportedly circulated approximately 70 voyeuristic videos and photos. The case has prompted calls for better safety measures in schools, as it highlights a disturbing trend of educators exploiting their positions, following a similar high-profile case involving a cram school teacher in 2024.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests Electric Vehicles Are More Likely to Cause Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, studies are revealing they are more likely to induce motion sickness than traditional combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this to the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly the regenerative braking systems. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power, can cause low-frequency deceleration that provokes queasiness and discomfort in passengers. The findings highlight a challenge for automakers as they continue to refine the EV driving and riding experience for consumers.</p>

It will also scrutinize issues like blanket "do not resuscitate" orders and restrictive visiting policies that prevented families from seeing their loved ones, with nearly 46,000 care home residents having died with Covid in England and Wales.</p>
