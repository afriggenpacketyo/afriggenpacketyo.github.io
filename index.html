            <p>A homeowner in Eagle Rock, California, was shot by police after she allegedly fired at a group of people fleeing the scene of a freeway accident who then attempted to break into her residence. The incident began with a crash on the 134 Freeway, prompting three suspects to run into a nearby neighborhood. Police, searching for the suspects, encountered Jillian Shriner, who reportedly refused to drop her weapon and pointed it at the officers, leading to the shooting. Shriner, later identified as an author and the wife of Weezer's bassist, claimed she was defending her home. She was subsequently booked on suspicion of attempted murder while the search for the remaining suspects continued. Optimism score: 10</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must assist in the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man wrongly deported to El Salvador, even though the government acknowledged the deportation was an error. The court upheld a lower court order requiring the administration to "facilitate" his return. However, the Supreme Court directed a Maryland federal district court judge to clarify his order last week that the administration "effectuate" the return of Abrego Garcia, indicating some reservations about the extent of the lower court's authority over foreign affairs. The ruling is a rebuke to the administration's deportation policies, especially concerning alleged gang members.</p>

            <p>Cesar Hernandez, a convicted murderer who escaped from custody in California in December 2024, is now wanted for the killing of Abigail Esparza Reyes, a Mexican police commander in Tijuana.

Hernandez allegedly engaged in a shootout with the unit while they were attempting to arrest him. The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed its personnel were in the area but not involved in the shooting.

            <p>In the case of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist facing deportation, the government presented a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio arguing that Khalil's presence in the U.S. poses a foreign policy risk. The memo cites Khalil's alleged role in "antisemitic protests" as grounds for deportation, asserting that his activities create a hostile environment for Jewish students. Khalil's lawyers criticized the memo, arguing that it infringes on First Amendment rights and lacks evidence directly related to foreign policy. They plan to request to depose Rubio in court to understand the basis for his determination.</p>

            <p>Betty Brown, the oldest surviving victim of the Post Office Horizon scandal, has rejected a revised compensation offer, stating that it is still "not good enough". Brown, 92, was forced out of her post office branch in 2003 after being wrongly accused of theft due to faulty software. Despite an increased offer, she believes she is owed more and is determined to continue fighting for full justice. The Horizon IT system caused widespread miscarriages of justice, with numerous sub-postmasters wrongly accused and prosecuted.</p>

            <p>A new drug called capivasertib, designed to slow the progression of an incurable form of breast cancer, is now available on the NHS in England. Clinical trials have shown that the drug can double the time it takes for the cancer to grow and can shrink tumors in a quarter of patients. The drug, which works by blocking the activity of a protein molecule called AKT, offers a new treatment option for women with advanced breast cancer. It can substantially delay chemotherapy which many women fear because of the side-effects.</p>

The president claimed the tariffs would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government, but experts warned of recession and inflation risks.
