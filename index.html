          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed China's commitment to boosting its advanced manufacturing capabilities, a move that could intensify trade tensions with the United States. Xi emphasized the importance of self-reliance in advanced manufacturing as the "backbone" of China's economy, despite criticisms from the U.S. regarding trade imbalances and state subsidies. While China aims to achieve self-reliance, especially in high-tech sectors, this strategy clashes with the Trump administration's demands for fair competition and reduced state support. Experts anticipate continued trade friction and sustained tariff rates on Chinese goods. (not investment advice)</p>

A state forest ranger responded to the call and found the two hikers in an altered mental state; the "deceased" hiker called and was not injured. The ranger escorted the two mushroom-affected hikers to a hospital and reunited the group at their campsite.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. Court of International Trade ruling that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is expected to pursue alternative legal means. Goldman Sachs analysts suggest options such as Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 301, and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930. While Section 122 offers a swift workaround, it's limited to 150 days without Congressional action. The administration's appeal indicates a determination to maintain its trade policies, potentially escalating the matter to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

The overhaul, inspired by the successful models of Australia and Canada, aims to enhance pension pots for individuals. While seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already endorsed the reforms in a voluntary agreement, the government is also implementing a legislative backstop to ensure progress by the end of the decade. These changes are expected to significantly impact pension scheme operations, with the potential to improve retirement outcomes through better governance and investment diversification.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by heightened demand ahead of potential negative effects from increased U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. Despite U.S. President Trump imposing an additional 25% tariff on cars produced outside the United States on April 3, Toyota has stated it will not pass the tariff costs onto consumers in the United States, but analysts predict this stance may be unsustainable in the long term. For the full business year, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly released an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, intensifying competition with OpenAI. The company, known for its free, open-source R1 model that outperformed rivals like Meta and OpenAI, released the upgrade on AI model repository Hugging Face without an official announcement. The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is just behind OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 reasoning models on LiveCodeBench, a site that benchmarks models against different metrics. DeepSeek has become a symbol of Chinese AI development despite U.S. efforts to restrict access to chips and technology.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through Secretary of State Marco Rubio, announced it would "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." The State Department is also revising visa criteria to "enhance scrutiny" of future applications from China, including Hong Kong. This move has sparked anxiety across U.S. university campuses and is likely to provoke a response from China, which is the second-largest country of origin for international students in the United States. The lack of detail on the scope of the directive has fueled worries among the roughly 275,000 Chinese students in the United States, as well as professors and university administrators.</p>

          <p>Beijing should anticipate Washington adopting alternative pressure tactics in future tariff negotiations, according to Wu Xinbo, a renowned Chinese scholar. Wu noted that the Trump administration had recognized the limitations of imposing heavy tariffs. While President Trump might continue using tariffs, he is likely to show more restraint after seeing their mixed results. Wu suggests that such measures could relate to science, diplomacy, and security, urging China to be alert to these potential shifts in strategy.</p>

          <p>German tank parts maker Renk is looking to hire talent from the struggling auto sector as it scales up to meet rising demand driven by increased military spending. The company, a global leader in creating gear boxes for tanks, has seen its stock rally on the back of increased military spending, with its share price rising over 300% so far this year. CEO Alexander Sagel and Chief Operating Officer Emmerich Schiller's previous experience working in the automotive industry has helped them capitalize on this cross-industry collaboration. Germany's largest trade union, IG Metall Lower Saxony, warns of a "one-sided industrial policy focus towards rearmament," which may provide employment in the short term but is based on an unstable security environment.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, questioning the motivations behind their decision to serve in an army involved in the occupation of Palestine. It draws parallels to the pied-noirs in Frederick Forsyth's novel, highlighting the "fierce commitment to the Jewish state" and the elaborate social apparatus through which young Americans are radicalized. The author contrasts this with the experience of Muslims, arguing that the radicalization of young Zionist men and women does not receive the attention it deserves from law enforcement, and notes the affinity for Israel within American media and politics.</p>
