          <p>Russia and Ukraine executed another prisoner swap, each side releasing 307 soldiers, following a large-scale missile and drone attack on Kyiv that injured at least 15 people. The exchange, occurring at the Belarus border, is viewed as a rare instance of cooperation amid the ongoing conflict. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched a subsequent set of drone strikes on Kyiv early Sunday, resulting in additional injuries and damage to residential buildings. Despite the prisoner exchange, battles persist along the 620-mile front line, with no ceasefire in sight, and both sides continue deep strikes.

Separately, seven Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers have accused the Israeli military of using Palestinians as human shields, sending them into buildings and tunnels to check for bombs and gunmen.

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, a move interpreted as a demonstration of Canada's sovereignty and independence amid perceived threats from US President Donald Trump. This invitation marks a shift in Canada's relationship with the Crown, with the last throne speech delivered by a British monarch in 1977. The move comes after Trump spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty and imposing tariffs that have threatened Canada's economic stability. While the bulk of Canada's modern population is indifferent to the British monarchy, the invitation signals a government more supportive of the Crown.</p>

          <p>The US decision to prioritize white South African refugees, known as Afrikaners, while other refugees remain in limbo has sparked controversy. President Trump signed an executive order opening the refugee pathway exclusively to Afrikaners, citing "racial discrimination". Meanwhile, refugees from countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, who have been conditionally approved for US resettlement, face indefinite delays. This policy shift has been criticized for its perceived unfairness and potential violation of humanitarian principles. The article highlights the complex and often inconsistent nature of US refugee policy.</p>
