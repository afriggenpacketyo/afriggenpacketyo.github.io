          <p>London-based AI startup Nscale, which emerged from stealth only last year, has secured major partnerships and significant funding, positioning itself as a key player in European AI infrastructure. The company announced collaborations with Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to expand AI capabilities in the U.K. and a $6.2 billion agreement to develop hyperscale infrastructure in Norway. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has praised the company, and Nvidia has made a substantial equity investment, highlighting Nscale's swift ascent from its origins in cryptocurrency mining infrastructure. The firm's rapid expansion reflects the intense demand for data centers capable of handling advanced AI workloads and Europe's push for sovereign AI.</p>

          <p>Senator Adam Schiff has strongly condemned FBI Director Kash Patel's leadership, asserting that it has substituted expertise and non-partisanship with incompetence and "rabid partisanship." Following Patel's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Schiff expressed his concern that the bureau is being weaponized, which undermines the rule of law. He highlighted Patel's contradictory statements regarding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation and the refusal of justice department officials to press for more details on powerful individuals connected to Epstein. Schiff described these developments as a "terrible tragedy" for the law enforcement agency and suggested the situation points toward a potential cover-up.</p>

          <p>A violent incident unfolded in North Codorus Township, Pennsylvania, where five police officers were shot while reportedly serving a warrant. According to law enforcement sources, three of the officers are in grave condition and one is in critical condition. The suspected gunman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Attorney General Dave Sunday traveled to the area in response to the shooting. Local hospitals initiated enhanced security protocols and treated individuals in serious condition, while a nearby school district implemented a temporary shelter-in-place as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Former CDC Director Susan Monarez testified before a Senate committee that she was fired for refusing to comply with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agenda to alter vaccine guidelines. Monarez alleged that Kennedy demanded she approve, without review, all recommendations from a newly reconstituted advisory panel and fire career scientists, which she refused to do on the grounds of scientific integrity. Her testimony highlighted concerns that political motives are driving potential changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, particularly for the hepatitis B vaccine. The hearing underscored the growing conflict between the administration and the public health establishment over vaccine science.</p>

          <p>During President Donald Trump's state visit, a landmark £150 billion U.S. investment package for the U.K. was announced, a deal the British government calls the largest of its kind. The investment is expected to generate over 7,600 jobs across various sectors, including defense, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing. A significant portion, £90 billion, will come from asset manager Blackstone over the next decade.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock declined after the company reported mixed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and announced it was reversing a controversial rebranding effort.

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration has initiated a campaign against what it frames as a leftist plot responsible for the murder. Although the alleged killer appears to have acted alone, some voices on the political right are working to connect the act to a broader network of progressive organizations. This move is seen by critics as an attempt to leverage a national tragedy for political purposes by targeting and potentially defunding nonprofit groups that oppose the administration's agenda. The strategy reflects a pattern of escalating political retribution and polarization following the violent event.</p>

In a public letter, Greenfield stated that Unilever has silenced the ice cream brand's progressive social mission for fear of controversy, particularly at a time when he feels advocacy is crucial. This move culminates years of clashes over the brand's independence, which was meant to be protected by an independent board established during the 2000 acquisition. The dispute highlights the ongoing struggle between maintaining the brand's activist identity and the corporate objectives of its multinational owner.</p>

A recently released Republican stopgap bill funds the government through November 21 but omits the ACA provision, setting up a contentious negotiation.

          <h2>Study Finds Vitamin B3 Supplement Linked to Reduced Risk of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 16:04:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study involving nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that taking nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is associated with a lower risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers. The most significant risk reduction, 54%, was observed in individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis. This research provides stronger evidence for a practice already common among dermatologists, who often recommend the over-the-counter supplement to patients to help protect cells from UV radiation damage. The findings may lead to more rigorous recommendations for using Vitamin B3 as a preventive measure, especially for high-risk patients.</p>

          <p>A dive team has positively identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing vessel that sank nearly a century ago. The ship disappeared during a storm in January 1929 with 21 crew members aboard, and no survivors were ever found. The discovery was made by Atlantic Wreck Salvage, whose team used sonar scans and conducted dives to confirm the vessel's identity based on distinctive features like its winch and steam engine. The find is described as bittersweet, offering historical significance and potential closure for the descendants of the lost crew.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first policy meeting, newly confirmed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran was the sole dissenter, voting for a larger half-percentage-point interest rate cut instead of the quarter-point reduction approved by the committee. This move positions the Trump appointee as even more dovish than other members who had previously favored cuts. The Fed's anonymous "dot plot" of rate forecasts suggests an unusually wide disagreement among officials, with one projection, likely Miran's, anticipating much lower rates by the end of the year. Miran's immediate dissent highlights the political tensions surrounding the central bank's independence and monetary policy direction. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. homeowners are facing a dramatic increase in property insurance costs, with average premiums rising nearly 70% in the last five years. The surge is attributed to a combination of factors, including increased risks from climate-related disasters like wildfires and hurricanes, rising home values, and higher costs for construction materials. This financial pressure is causing some homeowners to consider forgoing insurance coverage, a risky decision that could lead to financial ruin. Experts note that while premiums vary by location, the trend of rising costs is widespread, reflecting the escalating expense of covering potential losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This commentary uses the assassination of Charlie Kirk as a starting point to discuss the erosion of legal and political norms in the United States. The author reflects on the resurgence of preventable diseases like measles, linking it to a societal loss of trust in institutions, and draws parallels to the current political climate where facts are dismissed and division is actively encouraged. The article argues that the administration's response to the assassination, focusing on assigning blame to political enemies, exemplifies a dangerous political philosophy that defines politics through enmity. This approach threatens the foundation of a lawful, democratic society.</p>

          <p>Spanish police have arrested 19 individuals on suspicion of murder, torture, and other charges after more than 50 people went missing from a migrant boat traveling from Senegal. Survivors reported that during the perilous journey, some passengers began attacking others, accusing them of being "witches" when the boat encountered engine trouble and food shortages. Victims were allegedly beaten, thrown overboard alive, and denied rescue if they fell into the sea. The vessel, which originally carried about 300 people, was rescued with 248 survivors, revealing the horrific violence that had occurred during the voyage.</p>
