          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant flight delays and cancellations due to staffing shortages and equipment failures at the Philadelphia air traffic control center.

United Airlines has cut 35 daily round-trip flights from Newark, and travelers are facing long waits and frustration due to the ongoing disruptions, and the Port Authority has invested billions into Newark Liberty to modernize it.</p>

          <p>A group of over 150 former state and federal judges has criticized the arrest of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan, accusing the Trump administration of attempting to intimidate the judiciary. Judge Dugan was arrested for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration agents in her courtroom. The judges' letter condemned the arrest as undermining the rule of law and eroding public trust in the judiciary, while also criticizing the public posting of Judge Dugan in handcuffs by the F.B.I. director.

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a temporary loss of communication with aircraft, leading to hundreds of flight delays and diversions. The incident caused multiple controllers to take trauma leave, exacerbating existing staff shortages. The FAA acknowledged the impact of its antiquated air traffic control system on its workforce and is working to improve telecommunications equipment reliability. United Airlines has also announced flight cancellations due to the airport's inability to handle scheduled operations, with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association confirming that controllers took leave under provisions for workers experiencing traumatic events.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas, including the "capture" of Gaza and the relocation of its population to the south. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation aims to destroy Hamas and rescue remaining hostages. The plan also includes delivering aid through private companies, ending a two-month blockade, a proposal that the UN and aid agencies reject. International reactions are mixed, with President Trump pledging aid to Palestinians, the UK opposing an expansion of military operations, and the EU urging restraint, but Palestinians in north Gaza are strongly opposed to being forcibly displaced to the south once again.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices had fallen below $2 per gallon, attributing it to his policies and urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. However, the average U.S. gas price is around $3.165 per gallon, significantly higher than Trump's claim. While RBOB gasoline futures did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, this contract represents wholesale, unfinished gasoline and does not reflect the retail prices consumers pay. Experts emphasize that the RBOB price excludes taxes, transportation costs, and other fees, making it irrelevant to consumers.</p>

The plan involves a minimum 20% reduction of four-star generals and flag officers in the active-duty component and the National Guard in the first phase, followed by an additional 10% reduction across the military.

Trump announced he was authorizing the Commerce Department to begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, causing confusion and concern in Hollywood. Voight and his manager submitted a comprehensive plan to increase domestic film production, including tax incentives, co-production treaties, and infrastructure subsidies, but Trump has since walked back the certainty of these tariffs, saying he will meet with Hollywood studios to gauge their reaction.</p>

This decision suggests that the Trump administration is not planning to restrict access to mifepristone, despite the President's previous statements on abortion.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed a series of China-related bills targeting industrial espionage, export controls, national security threats, and alleged human rights abuses. The bills aim to deepen U.S. ties with Taiwan and protect Falun Gong practitioners. The Economic Espionage Prevention Act authorizes sanctions on foreign entities involved in trade secret theft, aiding adversarial militaries, or violating U.S. export laws, specifically targeting Chinese firms transferring sensitive technologies to countries like Russia. The bipartisan consensus reflects rising U.S.-China tensions over tariffs and technological competition.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security has already assisted some migrants with plane tickets and is instructing participants to use the CBP Home app to signal their intent to leave. Those who sign up will be deprioritized for arrest and detention by ICE, with the administration touting self-deportation as a dignified alternative to forced removal.

          <p>Every American newborn carries a slew of synthetic chemicals in their body, many of which have never been tested for safety, raising concerns about their long-term health effects. The rise of synthetic materials began in the mid-20th century, driven by companies like DuPont who transformed themselves from munitions makers to providers of household goods. Despite emerging evidence of the harmful effects of these chemicals, manufacturers suppressed research and lobbied against stricter regulations. The pervasive presence of PFAS, or forever chemicals, in the environment and human bodies highlights the lasting damage caused by these unregulated substances.</p>

          <p>Medicare does not cover dental care, vision care, hearing aids, overseas medical care, and long-term custodial care, leaving seniors exposed to significant out-of-pocket expenses. As healthcare costs continue to rise, seniors are increasingly turning to Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, to shore up their healthcare protection. Purchasing Medigap coverage can help mitigate the financial impact of rising healthcare expenses and secure coverage before health issues arise, as eligibility can depend on current health status. It is important to consider the potential coverage gaps and proactively plan for uncovered expenses to ensure greater financial security in retirement.</p>

The administration also disclosed that it had opened a so-called Section 232 investigation into how importing certain pharmaceuticals affects national security — a move widely seen as a prelude to initiating tariffs on drugs.</p>
