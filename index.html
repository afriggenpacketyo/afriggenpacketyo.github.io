          <h2>Venice Architecture Biennale Focuses on Adapting Cities to Extreme Heat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 02:19:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale explores how cities can adapt to rising temperatures and extreme weather caused by climate change, which scientists say led to tens of thousands of excess deaths in Europe in recent years. Curator Carlo Ratti emphasizes the need for a collective, interdisciplinary approach to rethink the built environment, incorporating knowledge from construction, architecture, urban planning, and sciences. The biennale highlights solutions like redesigning urban areas with more trees and permeable surfaces to combat overheating and improve water absorption, while also showcasing cities like Paris, Copenhagen and Rotterdam that are pioneering climate adaptation strategies. The exhibition aims to spur a global construction revolution to make cities more resilient and habitable in the face of climate change.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is in Brussels for his second foreign trip since taking office, engaging with EU and NATO officials to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine. Talks are expected to center on European sovereignty, particularly in light of policies enacted by US President Donald Trump, with Merz promising Germany's renewed influence in Europe and the world. Merz is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President AntÃ³nio Costa, and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola to address these critical issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, primarily fueled by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a significant decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. While exports to the U.S. plunged over 21%, shipments to ASEAN countries jumped by 20.8%, with notable growth in exports to Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Despite the overall export growth, economists anticipate a potential weakening in trade data in the coming months due to the impact of U.S. tariffs. The surge in exports could be partly due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>

The Japanese government plans to hold a third round of talks with the U.S. in mid-May or later to address these tariff issues.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis, who suffered a stroke in 2013 that left him with aphasia, has made a comeback with the help of artificial intelligence. Working with country musician James DuprÃ© and producer Kyle Lehning, Travis has released two new songs, "Where That Came From" and "Horses in Heaven," and is currently on his "More Life Tour." AI was used to model Travis's voice using stems from his previous recordings, allowing him to continue creating music despite his condition. Travis's wife, Mary, emphasizes that the process was collaborative and creative, with the goal of preserving Travis's unique tone and inflections.</p>

The downgraded H20 chip will feature significantly reduced memory capacity to meet new technical thresholds set by U.S. regulations, after the original H20 was blocked from sale due to export license requirements.

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, fell nearly 7% after its first-quarter earnings missed estimates due to "production fluctuations." While revenue increased by 28% year-on-year to $2.24 billion and profit surged 162% to $188 million, these figures fell short of expectations. SMIC anticipates revenue to decline 4% to 6% sequentially in the current quarter, with gross margin also expected to decrease. Despite the earnings miss, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, and capacity utilization reached 89.6%.</p>

          <p>Sweeping tariffs on imported aluminum imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, but they have failed to revive domestic aluminum production. Rising electricity prices in the U.S. relative to global competitors are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts, as energy costs for U.S. aluminum smelters are significantly higher compared to those in Canada, Norway, and the Middle East. This has resulted in higher prices for U.S. consumers and a disadvantage for domestic producers, with companies like Alcoa Corp and Century Aluminum facing closures and production idlings due to the lack of competitively priced, long-term power. Hydro's CFO suggests that new energy production capacity in the U.S. is being rapidly consumed by the tech sector, which has a higher ability to pay than the aluminum industry.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines focus on the US-UK trade deal and the election of a new Pope. The trade agreement, hailed as "historic" by both Sir Keir Starmer and President Trump, aims to reduce tariffs, though some remain in place. The agreement also reportedly includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain, a claim the government denies. Additionally, the selection of the new Pope, Leo XIV, is highlighted, with reports focusing on his promise to "build bridges" and his previous criticisms of the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Kent E. Calder of Kyodo News discusses the revival of U.S. strategic interest in Greenland, driven by its geographic location and the changing Arctic landscape due to climate change. With the Arctic warming rapidly, Russia is exploiting its geo-economic advantages, leading the U.S. to consider expanding its presence in Greenland. Calder suggests a "Compact of Free Association" model, similar to agreements with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, to balance U.S. interests with international concerns and avoid conflict over sovereignty.</p>

The agreement includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, particularly for agricultural products like beef and ethanol. While the 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, the deal provides exemptions for the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. annually and excludes Rolls Royce engines from tariffs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick estimates the deal will generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S.</p>
