          <p>Shein's United Kingdom operations saw a substantial 32.3% increase in sales, reaching £2.05 billion in 2024, with pre-tax profits also rising to £38.25 million. The fast-fashion giant expanded its UK presence with new offices and promotional events, demonstrating strong market performance. Despite this growth, the company's filing acknowledges risks from supply chain issues, inflation, and regulatory changes as it pursues a highly anticipated initial public offering in Hong Kong after facing delays with its London listing plans.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering momentum in July, as key data for retail sales and industrial output fell short of analyst forecasts. Retail sales grew by 3.7%, below the expected 4.6%, while industrial output rose 5.7%, also missing projections, indicating persistent weak domestic demand. This slowdown, coupled with a worsening property investment slump and high youth unemployment, raises concerns about achieving the annual 5% growth target and may prompt calls for new policy support from Beijing.

          <p>Mali's ruling military junta announced it has thwarted an attempted coup, arresting several military officers, civilians, and a French national accused of being a foreign agent. The government claims the plot was supported by unnamed "foreign states" and aimed to destabilize the nation. This event occurs amid a broader crackdown on dissent, with critics suggesting the arrests may be a tactic to intimidate opposition rather than a response to a genuine coup attempt, further consolidating the junta's power under General Assimi Goita.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding economists' expectations despite trade pressures from U.S. tariffs. The growth was primarily driven by resilient exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP after contracting in the previous quarter. However, analysts remain cautious, warning of a potential future slowdown as investment spending may soften and the full impact of tariffs on key sectors like automobile exports could exert downward pressure on corporate profits and capital investment.

          <p>A major federal building in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated Thursday after five letters containing an unknown white powder were discovered. First responders and hazmat units quickly secured the scene, and at least two people were reported to have been exposed to the substance. The FBI is investigating the incident, sending the letters to its lab in Quantico for analysis, while officials stated that no ongoing threat to the public remains at this time.</p>

          <h2>Louisiana Sues Roblox, Alleging Failure to Protect Children from Predators</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against the online gaming platform Roblox, accusing the company of failing to implement adequate safety measures to protect children from sexual predators. The suit, brought by Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox prioritizes profit over child safety, creating an environment where predators can victimize kids. This legal action follows other cases, including one where a 13-year-old girl was allegedly introduced to a predator on the platform, then kidnapped, trafficked, and sexually assaulted.</p>

          <h2>Poll Indicates Americans Feel Tipping Expectations Have Increased</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 20:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that two-thirds of Americans believe that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years, though few view this trend positively. The survey highlights differing perspectives on the purpose of tipping, with some seeing it as a way to show appreciation or supplement wages, while others view it primarily as an added, often obligatory, cost. This sentiment aligns with broader public concerns about rising prices and costs, suggesting that the perceived increase in tipping pressure is contributing to financial strain for many consumers.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery. Amid growing concerns over Britons seeking cheaper procedures like hair implants and dental work overseas, the campaign will advise viewers to consult UK doctors first and avoid package deals. This initiative is part of a broader effort to protect patients from botched procedures that can result in life-altering injuries and place a burden on the NHS for corrective care.</p>

          <p>Chef Daniel Humm has announced that his acclaimed New York restaurant, Eleven Madison Park, will begin serving meat and fish again, ending its four-year run as a high-profile, three-Michelin-star vegan establishment. Humm cited a desire for inclusion and business realities, noting a decline in private event bookings and wine sales since the transition to a plant-based menu. The move reflects broader challenges in the plant-based market and the difficulty of sustaining a luxury dining experience without traditional animal products, which many patrons still expect.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years after the Hamas attacks, Israel is deeply fractured over the ongoing war in Gaza, with societal fault lines widening into chasms. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains a hardline stance of total victory, a position supported by his right-wing base but increasingly challenged by others. Polls show a majority of Jewish Israelis are not troubled by Palestinian suffering, while a growing minority protest the killing of civilians, and hostage families desperately call for a deal to secure the release of their loved ones.</p>

The meeting, which also included former Attorney General Eric Holder, signals high-level Democratic support for the Texas legislators' standoff against what they term a "systematic assault on democracy."</p>

          <p>As President Trump and Vladimir Putin prepare for their summit in Alaska, their objectives appear to be distinct yet potentially overlapping. For Putin, the meeting itself is a victory, signaling a failure of Western efforts to isolate him and granting him recognition on the global stage, from which he will push for territorial concessions in Ukraine. For Trump, the summit offers a chance to fulfill his campaign promise of being a peacemaker, potentially earning him a significant diplomatic achievement, even if a comprehensive resolution to the war remains a long shot.</p>

While the government views this expansion as critical national infrastructure, concerns are mounting over the immense energy and water consumption these centers will require. Experts warn that the increased strain on national grids could lead to higher utility bills for consumers and exacerbate environmental pressures, particularly on water resources in regions like London.</p>

The system was recently used on the Swedish sci-fi film 'Watch the Skies' for its U.S. theatrical release, a distribution that producers say would have been impossible with traditional dubbing methods.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska stands in stark contrast to historically significant, meticulously planned meetings between U.S. and Soviet leaders. This hastily arranged discussion on the Ukraine war carries considerable uncertainty, with President Trump himself acknowledging the high chance of failure. There are widespread concerns among allies and observers that Trump, who has previously sided with Putin over his own intelligence agencies, may be outmaneuvered by the Russian leader, who is likely seeking to buy time and continue the conflict.</p>
