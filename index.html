        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government's plans to conclude talks regarding the Chagos Islands deal have been paused due to a last-minute injunction granted by a High Court judge. Bertrice Pompe, a Chagossian, filed a case against the Foreign Office, leading to the interim relief. The judge's order prevents the government from taking any conclusive steps to finalize negotiations about transferring the British Indian Ocean Territory to a foreign government. The court is scheduled to hear the case again on Thursday, introducing uncertainty into the future of the islands.</p>

          <p>The House is preparing to vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill after unveiling an updated version aimed at appeasing Republican holdouts. The legislation addresses tax, defense, and energy priorities, but has faced setbacks due to internal GOP disagreements over Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, and renewable energy credits. Speaker Mike Johnson negotiated changes, including adjustments to Medicaid work requirements and renewable energy tax credits, to secure enough votes for passage. Despite these efforts, the bill is expected to encounter resistance in the Senate, highlighting the challenges of unifying the Republican party on key policy issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK government borrowing was higher than anticipated in April, reaching £20.2 billion, which is £1 billion more than the previous year and surpasses analysts' predictions. This marks the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since 1993, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). While tax receipts saw an increase due to higher National Insurance contributions from employers, government expenditure also rose due to pay increases, inflation-related costs, and pension and benefit hikes. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is now estimated at £148.3 billion, slightly lower than initial estimates but still above the government's forecast.</p>

          <p>China has expressed strong concerns to the European Union regarding the proposed handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson urged the EU to ensure a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies. The European Commission is proposing a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas, with a lower fee for parcels sent to European warehouses. This fee is expected to generate approximately 3 billion euros to cover customs and safety checks.</p>

          <p>A South African lobbyist for white rights, Ernst Roets, has gained traction in American political circles, particularly through appearances on Tucker Carlson's show, where he claimed that white people in South Africa face shocking levels of racism. President Trump, after halting aid for African H.I.V./AIDS and malaria programs, signed an executive order offering refugee status to “ethnic minority Afrikaners,” the vast majority of whom are white. This has led to controversy, as there is no evidence of systematic civil rights violations against white South Africans, who still own a significant portion of the country's land.</p>

          <p>An independent sentencing review proposes releasing violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving only a third of their sentence to alleviate prison overcrowding. The review also suggests managing more offenders in the community and expanding a voluntary chemical castration pilot program for some sexual assault offenders. Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, who chaired the review, emphasizes the need for major reforms to address dangerous conditions and high reoffending rates caused by overcrowded prisons. The government is expected to accept some measures, with further details in a future sentencing bill, though concerns remain about the impact on victims and the probation service.</p>

Favorable regulatory developments, such as the GENIUS Act and support from U.S. President Donald Trump, along with JPMorgan's decision to allow clients to buy Bitcoin, have also contributed to the market's positive sentiment.

Russian stockpiles of military equipment are expected to dwindle by mid-fall, and further offensive operations into 2026 will likely require forced mobilization, which is politically and economically challenging. The Russian economy is slowing, burdened by international sanctions, inflation, and high costs.

          <p>A new study indicates that wildfires exacerbated by climate change have led to thousands of deaths and cost billions of dollars in the United States due to smoke exposure. From 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to approximately 15,000 deaths and $160 billion in economic costs. The study focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildfire smoke, which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular issues. Researchers emphasized the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the increasing impact of wildfire smoke on public health.</p>

The settlement, which involves the archdiocese, its parishes, and several insurers, will establish a trust to benefit survivors, pending approval from the survivors, the bankruptcy court, and other creditors. However, some attorneys representing survivors expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed settlement, calling it a "secret backroom deal" that most victims would not agree to.

          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move criticized by Democrats as "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act permits them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. Environmental groups and California officials have voiced strong opposition, with the state prepared to sue if the waivers are revoked.</p>

The new research found the most severe effects would be in southern Washington, northern Oregon and northern California.
