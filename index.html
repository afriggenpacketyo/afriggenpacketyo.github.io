          <p>BP shares initially surged following reports of potential acquisition talks with Shell, but the increase was tempered after Shell denied the rumors. Sources suggest that if a deal were to materialize, it would likely involve multiple companies purchasing different segments of BP. BP has faced challenges in recent years, including ambitious carbon emission reduction goals and subsequent adjustments to increase oil and gas investments while scaling back renewables spending due to underperformance compared to its rivals. The energy sector is currently undergoing significant shifts as companies balance traditional energy production with renewable energy initiatives.</p>

          <p>The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) held its first meeting following the appointment of several vaccine critics by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a move that has stirred controversy. The panel, composed of independent medical and public experts, evaluates vaccine data and provides recommendations on eligibility and insurance coverage. The new ACIP chair, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, emphasized the importance of evidence-based recommendations, but one of Kennedy's appointees resigned ahead of the meeting due to a mandatory review of financial holdings. The panel will assess data on COVID-19 and RSV vaccines and create new work groups to review childhood vaccine schedules and previously unreviewed shots.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A credit card grace period is the time between the end of your billing cycle and your payment due date when you won't be charged interest on new purchases, provided you pay your full statement balance by the due date. This feature allows cardholders to make purchases without accruing interest, effectively offering a temporary, interest-free loan. To maximize the benefits of a grace period, it's crucial to pay the full statement balance each month, automate payments, track billing cycles, and avoid cash advances. Understanding and utilizing the grace period can help consumers avoid hefty interest charges and make the most of their credit card benefits (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A lightning strike at Dominion Beach Park in South Carolina injured twenty people, including eight adults and twelve juveniles. The incident occurred on a sunny day when lightning struck the water, reportedly energizing a metal cable surrounding the swimming area.

The Irmo Fire District emphasized the unpredictable nature of lightning, noting that it can strike far from a cloud. Dominion Beach Park is expected to reopen after safety assessments.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to cut welfare spending by £5 billion annually faces significant opposition from Labour MPs, who cite concerns about a lack of consultation and potential impact on poverty. The reforms include making it harder to access Personal Independence Payments (Pip) and cutting incapacity benefits, with the goal of controlling the rising number of working-age benefit claimants. Official impact assessments estimate that approximately 250,000 additional people, including 50,000 children, will be left in relative poverty by 2030 due to these reforms. The government argues that these changes will incentivize work and reduce reliance on welfare, supported by increased investment in employment support.</p>

The images show craters and damaged buildings at Fordo, as well as damage to tunnel entrances at Isfahan. Work appears to be underway to cover craters at the Natanz enrichment complex, suggesting efforts to address the inflicted damage. These strikes are aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, though Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

This move aims to prevent film productions from relocating to other regions that offer more generous tax incentives. The proposal includes increasing the tax credit up to 35% for productions in the Los Angeles area and up to 40% for those shot outside the region, while also broadening eligibility to include animated films and competition shows. The state's entertainment industry has faced challenges due to the pandemic, strikes, and recent fires, prompting lawmakers to support the industry with these incentives.</p>

          <p>Marcus Monzo has been convicted of murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin with a samurai sword in Hainault, as well as three counts of attempted murder, wounding with intent, and possession of an offensive weapon. The attacks began when Monzo drove a van into a pedestrian before fatally attacking Anjorin, who was walking to school. Monzo then entered a nearby home and attacked a man before being apprehended. The court heard that Monzo was experiencing a cannabis-induced psychosis and had killed his pet cat before the attacks; he will face a life term at sentencing.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a nearly 3% increase, heading towards a record close for the first time since January, driven by investor confidence in the company's leading position in artificial intelligence. The stock reached an intraday high of $153.13, matching its previous peak, and is currently trading at $151.92, surpassing its closing high of $149.43 on January 6. Nvidia's market capitalization now stands at $3.7 trillion, making it the world's largest company, slightly ahead of Microsoft. Despite being locked out of the world's second-largest economy due to export controls, Nvidia's rally reflects the strong demand for its GPUs in AI development.</p>

Analysts estimate that a significant portion of Flagstar's multi-family loan portfolio is exposed to New York rent regulations.

          <p>With credit card debt reaching high levels and interest rates averaging around 22%, finding ways to pay less interest is crucial. Strategies to eliminate interest charges include transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card, paying the balance in full every month, using a 0% APR intro offer for new purchases, enrolling in a credit card hardship program, and requesting a temporary rate reduction. Balance transfer cards offer promotional periods of up to 21 months with no interest, while paying the statement balance in full avoids interest altogether. Utilizing these methods can help consumers take control of their credit card debt (not investment advice).</p>

Some Iranian Americans, donning "Make America Great Again" hats, support President Trump's actions and call for regime change in Iran. Others fear that US involvement will only strengthen Iran's leaders and push the country into an uncertain future. The community debates the best course of action for their adopted country to respond to Iran, with some favoring support for exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi and others emphasizing the need for Iranians to choose their own path.</p>

          <h2>Spicy Turkey Sandwich Recipe</h2>

          <p>This turkey sandwich is a bit spicy, pleasantly crunchy and bound together with a delicious cilantro variation of roasted garlic sunflower seed dip: a dairy-less dip! Soaked sunflower seeds blend into the creamiest, smoothest dip, with a texture similar to a hummus but without the chickpeas or tahini. Thinly sliced cucumber and onions bring a fresh crunchiness that I find essential to a great sandwich. This is a perfectly fresh and light sub for any occasion, but it’s especially lovely wrapped up and enjoyed at the beach.</p>
