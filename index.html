          <p>EPA chief Lee Zeldin announced a major overhaul of the agency aimed at reducing staffing to Reagan-era levels and saving taxpayers an estimated $300 million annually. The reorganization will focus on incorporating science into rule-making and prioritizing clean air, land, and water initiatives. The EPA plans to restructure several offices, including the Office of the Administrator, Office of Air and Radiation, and Office of Water. Zeldin emphasized the need to reduce excess spending and improve efficiency within the agency, which had seen a significant increase in budget and grant awards under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to respond after a Houthi missile, launched from Yemen, struck near Ben Gurion Airport, causing injuries and prompting flight cancellations. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed the Israeli airport was "no longer safe for air travel." Netanyahu stated that the attacks "emanate from Iran" and that Israel would respond at a time and place of their choosing. The airport has since reopened, and authorities are investigating the failure to intercept the missile.</p>

          <p>A ballistic missile launched from Yemen by the Houthi militia struck near Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, leading to a temporary suspension of flights and prompting threats of retaliation from Prime Minister Netanyahu. The strike, which injured several people, was claimed by the Houthis, who warned international airlines to avoid the airport. Netanyahu asserted that Iran was behind the attack and vowed to respond, while opposition leaders criticized the government's failure to prevent the missile strike. The incident marks a significant success for the Houthis and a failure for Israel's air defenses.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would not rule out using military force to gain control of Greenland, citing international security needs, and expressed interest in annexing Canada as the 51st state. Trump claimed the U.S. subsidizes Canada heavily and suggested that combining the two countries would be beneficial. While acknowledging that the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney opposes the idea, Trump remained open to discussing it. A recent poll indicated that a majority of Americans oppose the U.S. trying to take control of either Greenland or Canada.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a particularly damaging element in relationship arguments. This phrase, while seemingly minor, communicates that the partner is inadequate and that someone else would be a better fit. The underlying issue is often a fear of openly expressing needs and frustrations. The article suggests a better approach involves clearly communicating needs without shame or comparison, fostering a more secure and emotionally close relationship.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated over $800 million in NIH grants for research into LGBTQ health, impacting studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections. The cuts align with the administration's opposition to diversity programs and gender-affirming care, and have been justified by officials as a move away from "politicized D.E.I. and gender ideology studies." Scientists argue that these cuts create a hierarchy of patients and undermine efforts to address health disparities affecting LGBTQ communities, potentially reversing progress made in areas like HIV prevention.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article explores the idea of repurposing underused single-family homes into multifamily units as a solution to the affordable housing crisis. Developers like Monte Anderson are retrofitting existing homes into "roommate houses" with multiple studio apartments, circumventing zoning restrictions. Cities and states are encouraging similar initiatives by easing regulations on accessory dwelling units (ADUs) like backyard cottages. This approach aims to add housing in existing neighborhoods without major disruption, addressing the mismatch between large houses and smaller households.</p>
