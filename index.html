          <p>China commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II with a Victory Day parade, where President Xi Jinping emphasized the need to learn from history to avoid future conflict. The event highlighted ongoing tensions with Japan, particularly concerning its perceived lack of remorse for wartime actions and the rise of right-wing nationalism. This article suggests China and Russia are challenging the Western-centric narrative of the war's conclusion, positioning themselves as key victors against fascism. The parade is presented as part of China's broader effort to promote its vision for a new global order.</p>

          <p>At least 19 Russian drones violated Polish airspace, prompting NATO to scramble F-16 and F-35 fighter jets to intercept and shoot them down. The incident marks the first time in NATO's history that its fighters have engaged potential targets over allied territory, escalating tensions in the region. U.S. President Donald Trump reacted to the news with a brief social media post stating, "Here we go!" The incursion has been widely condemned by European leaders and NATO officials, who have reaffirmed their commitment to defending every inch of the alliance's territory.</p>

          <p>NASA has implemented new restrictions blocking Chinese citizens, even those with valid U.S. visas, from physical and virtual access to its facilities and data systems. This move tightens security as the space race between the U.S. and China intensifies, with both nations planning crewed missions to the moon in the coming years. While NASA has historically limited direct employment of Chinese citizens, this new policy affects contractors, students, and university scientists who previously contributed to agency projects.

Although Musk later reclaimed the top spot as Oracle's stock gains moderated, the shift highlights the intense market enthusiasm for companies capitalizing on the AI boom.

          <p>This article analyzes recent actions by the Trump administration, such as the detention of South Korean workers in Georgia and alleged covert operations in Greenland, as evidence of an ego-driven foreign policy that undermines U.S. credibility.

The discussion extends to the domestic deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., raising constitutional concerns about militarized policing and the potential for normalizing authoritarian tactics.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a departure from typical pre-holiday shipping patterns, freight trade into the United States, particularly from China, has slowed considerably. Data reveals a sustained 27% year-over-year decline in imports from China, with key sectors like furniture, toys, and electronics seeing major reductions. Logistics experts attribute the slowdown to the early front-loading of inventory by retailers to get ahead of tariffs, followed by a sharp decline in new orders. This trend suggests a muted peak season, which could have downstream effects on the domestic trucking, rail, and warehousing industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that its Perseverance rover collected a rock sample on Mars that contains potential biosignatures, the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the planet. The sample, named Sapphire Canyon, was gathered from an ancient river valley in Jezero Crater and exhibits mineral patterns and textures often associated with microbial life on Earth. While researchers cannot yet rule out non-biological origins, the finding is a significant step in the quest to determine if Mars once hosted life. The next critical phase involves bringing the samples back to Earth for more detailed analysis.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has launched a petition against FIFA's use of dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, arguing it prioritizes profit over genuine fans. Mamdani contends that the pricing model will make tickets unaffordable for many and could diminish the atmosphere at the games. He is calling for FIFA to end the practice, set aside a percentage of tickets for local residents, and cap resale prices, similar to policies in place for past tournaments. The move aligns with Mamdani's broader political focus on affordability in the city.</p>

          <p>This article critiques a recent large-scale Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Hyundai electric-car plant in rural Georgia, which resulted in the arrest of 475 foreign workers. The author argues that targeting a major foreign investment in a Republican-leaning area represents a significant strategic error for the Trump administration. The raid, which detained mostly South Korean nationals with visa issues, is described as an 'own goal' that could undermine efforts to attract foreign manufacturing and investment to the United States, contradicting the administration's economic objectives.</p>

The nonprofit Friends of Big Bear Valley, which operates a popular 24-hour livestream of the eagles, fears the construction and human activity will drive the endangered raptors away and is exploring legal action or purchasing the land for conservation.</p>

          <p>A social media post by the Holocaust Museum LA stating that 'Never again' should apply to everyone sparked intense online backlash, prompting the museum to delete it and apologize. This article explores the historical and evolving meaning of the phrase, from its anti-fascist origins among Buchenwald prisoners to its adoption by Zionist and Jewish self-defense movements. The author argues that the controversy reflects a growing trend of rejecting the universalist interpretation of Holocaust memory in favor of a more exclusive, ethnonationalist view, which can be used to shield political actions from criticism.</p>

However, negotiations are still ongoing with another operator, London Transit. If an agreement is not reached, some limited industrial action may still affect a small number of routes in the city, providing some relief to commuters after a week of significant travel disruption from a separate London Underground strike.</p>

A court has ruled Cowen unfit to stand trial due to being 'seriously mentally unwell,' but a jury determined that he did commit the assault.

The report from the China-Brazil Business Council highlights the deep economic integration between the two nations, with bilateral trade growing nearly fivefold in two decades. While export-related jobs offered higher salaries, the impact of imports was found to be more widespread across Brazilian industries and communities. However, the study also warns of the risks associated with Brazil's heavy reliance on a single trading partner and a narrow range of export commodities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration is appealing a federal judge's order that temporarily blocks him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had ruled that Cook made a strong case that her removal would violate federal law, which requires 'cause' for such an action, and that maintaining the Fed's independence was in the public interest. Trump sought to fire Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. The legal battle is part of a broader context of presidential pressure on the central bank's interest rate policies.</p>
