        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to halt proceedings in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case involving the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued DOGE for public access to its records and plans for government overhaul. The administration claims executive privilege, asserting that DOGE, as a presidential advisory board, is exempt from FOIA. The Solicitor General argues that depositions and document production would expose private executive branch information, undermining the purpose of the litigation. </p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has increased interest in alternative stores of value. The price of Bitcoin has been steadily climbing in May, fueled by corporate momentum and adoption by Wall Street. Inflows into ETFs tracking Bitcoin's price have exceeded $40 billion, with minimal outflows.

          <p>Narendra Modi's decade-long tenure as India's Prime Minister has seen the emergence of a counterterrorism doctrine that risks escalating conflicts with Pakistan. A recent exchange of hostilities between India and Pakistan demonstrated the policy's potential for escalation, with both countries engaging in intense fire. President Trump's intervention to broker a cease-fire was perceived as a humiliation by Modi's nationalist base, leading to domestic criticism. The crisis has highlighted how India's national security is increasingly tied to Modi's personality cult, potentially alienating its neighbors and leading to military adventurism.</p>

Seven in 10 Americans feel powerless to act during a cardiac emergency, contributing to the 90% fatality rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The American Heart Association is working to improve survivability rates, reporting an increase in bystander confidence to perform CPR since Hamlin's incident. </p>

          <p>The FDA is planning a major policy shift, potentially limiting COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or those with high-risk conditions, requiring vaccine makers to conduct lengthy, placebo-controlled trials for broader use. FDA officials argue that annual boosters may not be worth the risk for healthy individuals without updated clinical trial data. Experts caution that lengthy trials could result in vaccines ineffective against current variants. This change aligns with recommendations from other countries like the U.K., Canada, and Australia, sparking debate on the necessity of annual boosters for young, healthy individuals.</p>

          <p>A recent inflation surprise indicates a potentially gloomier economic outlook, with the highest inflation rate in a year at 3.5%. Higher energy and water bills, coupled with rising food and service prices, have contributed to the increase. While pay rises are outpacing price increases for some workers, economists worry about the government's policies adding to inflation. Some economists anticipate inflation could inch up further in the coming months, delaying potential interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. </p>

          <p>Germany's Bundeswehr has deployed Armored Brigade 45 to Lithuania, marking Germany's first permanent foreign troop deployment since World War II. The brigade will form the core of a combat unit securing NATO's eastern flank in response to the Russian war in Ukraine. The deployment includes nearly 5,000 German soldiers, with infrastructure development underway in Lithuania to support the brigade's presence. The German government aims to increase defense spending and has passed legislation to make serving on NATO's eastern flank more attractive to soldiers.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that U.S. chip export controls are a "failure," reducing Nvidia's China market share from 95% to 50%. Huang warned that these restrictions are harming American businesses more than China, motivating Beijing to accelerate its own chip production. The Chinese Commerce Ministry criticized the U.S. policy as "overreaching" and "bullying," demanding a correction. Nvidia is caught between the U.S. and China amid a deepening tech cold war, maintaining relationships with both sides.</p>
