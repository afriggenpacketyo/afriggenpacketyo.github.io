          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to former U.S. President Donald Trump, has publicly criticized India for its ongoing purchases of Russian crude oil, labeling them "opportunistic." Writing in the Financial Times, Navarro argued that India's actions undermine international efforts to isolate Russia's economy, especially given their strategic partnership with the U.S. He accused India of acting as a global clearinghouse, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports and providing Moscow with necessary funds. These comments follow reports of cancelled U.S.-India trade negotiations and increased U.S. tariffs on Indian imports, bringing total duties to 50%, highlighting escalating tensions over New Delhi's energy sourcing. India defends its imports as a necessity for predictable and affordable energy costs, noting other nations also trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's blockbuster obesity drug, Wegovy, has received accelerated U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in adults with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. This significant approval makes Wegovy the first GLP-1 class treatment authorized for MASH, broadening its therapeutic applications beyond diabetes and obesity. The decision was based on the ESSENCE trial, where the drug demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in liver fibrosis for nearly two-thirds of treated individuals. This development, coupled with a separate announcement of a price reduction for Ozempic, led to a notable increase in Novo Nordisk's share price, strengthening its position in the metabolic disease market.

          <p>Raging wildfires continue to devastate parts of Spain and Portugal, leading to a rising death toll and extensive evacuations. Spain has deployed an additional 500 troops, bringing the total to 1,900, as two firefighters tragically died in separate incidents in Spain and Portugal, adding to previous fatalities. The blazes, exacerbated by a heatwave scorching southern Europe, have burned over 343,000 hectares in Spain alone this year, nearly double the previous year's amount. Thousands of residents remain evacuated, and air quality is severely impacted in affected regions. Both nations have activated the European Civil Protection Mechanism for assistance, with meteorologists linking the increasing severity to human-induced climate change, making such extremes more frequent.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on Kharkiv, Ukraine, killed at least seven people, including two children, hitting an apartment building and claiming an entire family. This attack, part of a broader wave of Russian drone and missile launches across multiple Ukrainian regions, occurred just before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's critical meeting with President Donald Trump and European leaders in Washington. Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a cynical act aimed at pressuring Ukraine and undermining diplomatic efforts for peace. The incident highlights the continued brutality of the conflict, with July having recorded the deadliest month for Ukrainian civilians since May 2022, underscoring the urgent need for international aid and security guarantees.</p>

This high-stakes meeting follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which, despite not yielding a ceasefire, led to a pivot towards seeking a broader peace deal. Discussions are expected to cover security guarantees for Ukraine, territorial questions, and rebuilding efforts, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicating the necessity of concessions from both sides. The urgency of these talks is underscored by continued Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities, highlighting the complex challenges in achieving a durable resolution.</p>

          <p>Hamas negotiators in Cairo have reportedly received a new proposal for a Gaza ceasefire, outlining an initial 60-day truce and a two-batch hostage release. A Palestinian official stated the proposal serves as a framework to launch negotiations for a permanent ceasefire, prompting internal consultations within Hamas and with other Palestinian factions. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty confirmed that Egypt is working with fellow mediators Qatar and the United States to secure this truce, which also aims to ensure the unrestricted flow of humanitarian and medical assistance to Gaza. The conflict, nearing its 23rd month since the October 7, 2023, attack, has tragically resulted in over 62,000 Palestinian deaths, highlighting the desperate need for a resolution.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has issued a stern warning to its citizens, including government employees, against obtaining mainland Chinese identification documents. Taipei stated that individuals acquiring such IDs, including mainland resident IDs or citizenship, could face severe consequences, including the automatic loss of Taiwanese status and disqualification from civil or military service. This warning comes as Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior moves to enact new rules aimed at tightening control over those seeking to regain citizenship after acquiring mainland Chinese household registration. The measure underscores Taiwan's efforts to safeguard its sovereignty and national security, reflecting the heightened political sensitivities and cross-strait tensions with Beijing.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, has re-strengthened to a Category 4 storm and is forecast to bring "life-threatening surf and rip currents" to the U.S. East Coast this week. Although the large storm is not expected to make direct landfall in the U.S., its extensive reach means coastal areas will experience significant effects. The hurricane's center is predicted to pass between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast by mid-week, maintaining its dangerous major hurricane status. North Carolina's Outer Banks are particularly advised to monitor Erin's progress due to the risk of strong winds and flooding tides, with a mandatory evacuation declared for Hatteras Island.</p>

          <p>The recent trend of "job-hopping" has been replaced by "job hugging," a phenomenon where workers are holding onto their current positions "for dear life," according to consultants at Korn Ferry. This shift reflects a broader stagnation in the labor market, characterized by low hiring, quitting, and layoff rates, indicating a significant lack of movement. Experts attribute this behavior to widespread economic and political uncertainty, making workers nervous about their ability to find new opportunities. While job hugging offers a sense of security, it can lead to sacrificed earnings growth and potential career stagnation, as job switchers typically command higher wage increases. The overall cooling of the job market also presents challenges for new entrants seeking employment.</p>

In Texas, Republican Governor Greg Abbott is pushing for new GOP-crafted maps that could create up to five Republican-leaning districts, a move met with strong resistance from Democrats who previously fled the state to deny a quorum. Simultaneously, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Democrats are attempting to counter this by unveiling plans to undo the state's non-partisan redistricting commission to create more left-leaning districts. Both efforts are part of a broader national push by Republicans to secure their House majority, leading to accusations of gerrymandering and a complex legal and political fight.</p>

This "tax revolution" is part of Resolution 68, an ambitious plan to make homegrown private companies the economy's primary driving force by 2035, increase tax revenue for mega-infrastructure projects, and curb corruption. While the resolution promises deregulation and improved access to capital, the shift is causing distress among small businesses, many of whom face steep tax hikes and increased administrative burdens.

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling flights and initiated a gradual suspension of operations ahead of a potential strike by its flight attendants, set to begin Saturday. The union, representing around 10,000 flight attendants, issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract talks reached an impasse, citing "poverty wages" and unpaid labor as key issues. The airline, which offered a 38% pay increase over four years, has responded with a lockout notice. This escalating dispute threatens to severely impact hundreds of thousands of travelers, with the airline expecting to be completely grounded by Saturday morning, potentially stranding 25,000 Canadians abroad daily and causing significant inconvenience to customers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced significant tax reforms, including a new two-rate Goods and Services Tax (GST) structure of 5% and 18%, replacing previous higher levies. These changes, part of a push for self-reliance, aim to simplify compliance, lower tax rates, and modernize the GST framework to make it more growth-oriented, particularly benefiting manufacturing, logistics, housing, and consumer goods. The reforms are intended to bolster India's domestic consumption-driven economy, which the Reserve Bank of India forecasts to grow by 6.5% in fiscal year 2025-2026. This economic boost comes as India faces escalating U.S. tariffs, notably an additional 25% levy over its Russian crude oil purchases, with analysts suggesting the domestic measures could largely offset the tariff impact.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, which re-intensified to a Category 4 storm, caused widespread power outages in Puerto Rico as its outer bands brought heavy rains and tropical-storm winds. Initially, over 147,000 utility customers were without power, though service was largely restored to most by Monday morning. The storm is now moving closer to the southeast Bahamas and is expected to bring dangerous surf and rip currents to the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada. While not forecast for direct U.S. landfall, its large size will impact coastal areas, prompting an emergency evacuation for Hatteras Island in North Carolina. Scientists link such rapid hurricane intensification in the Atlantic to human-caused climate change.</p>

Ukraine aims to avoid territorial concessions without robust security guarantees, wary of a "peace deal" that could allow future Russian aggression. European leaders prioritize a clear U.S. commitment to Ukraine's long-term security and oppose border redrawing by force.

          <p>A growing number of U.S. workers are planning to delay retirement, with roughly 70% considering pushing back their retirement date due to fears of insufficient funds. However, economists warn this strategy is risky and often unreliable, as research indicates 58% of workers retire earlier than intended, frequently due to health-related or employment issues like age discrimination. The evolving labor market may also not always value skills acquired over decades, making continued employment challenging. With the rapid decline of traditional pensions, workers increasingly depend on 401(k)s and personal savings, which are vulnerable to unexpected medical bills, market downturns, or job losses, highlighting the precariousness of this retirement plan.
