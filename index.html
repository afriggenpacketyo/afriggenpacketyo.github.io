        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wang Xingxing, founder of Chinese robotics company Unitree, predicts a "ChatGPT moment" for robotics could occur within the next two to three years. He defines this breakthrough as a robot successfully performing a novel task, like fetching water for a person, in an unfamiliar environment. While hardware capabilities are advancing, Wang believes the key challenge lies in developing more sophisticated AI for embodied intelligence. He expressed skepticism about current Vision Language Action models, suggesting that generative world models like Google's Genie 3 might be a more promising path for achieving complex robot motion control.</p>

          <p>In December 2022, nurse Alexandra Pennig was found shot dead in her bathroom, with her colleague Matthew Ecker claiming it was a suicide. Detectives became suspicious due to inconsistencies, such as a dry sink where Ecker claimed to have washed his hands. The case turned when investigators found a small metal piece from the bathroom door lock underneath Pennig's body. This discovery suggested the door was forced open before she was shot, contradicting Ecker's story and leading to his conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year sentence.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are pleading with approximately 9,200 households in Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to cease all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets. The request follows a broken water control valve that caused a multi-day service outage and a boil-water advisory during a severe heatwave. Although some service has been restored, officials warn that continued consumption is depleting pressure in the system's main tank, delaying full repairs. A subsequent failure of a temporary pipe has further complicated efforts, with the city aiming to restore normal service by Monday morning.</p>

          <p>Northern China, including Beijing, is experiencing its traditional rainy season with severe consequences for the fifth time since 2012. This year's flooding is considered unusual because the late July storms primarily impacted the northern districts of the capital. This contrasts with the major floods of 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the southern parts of the city. The article highlights the recurring and shifting nature of these extreme weather events that have repeatedly caused deadly floods in the region over the past decade, raising questions about the city's preparedness and changing climate patterns.</p>

After an early exchange of service breaks, Raducanu gained control late in the first set and dominated the second, not dropping a game after breaking for a 3-2 lead. The victory sets up a third-round match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka. In other results, Iga Swiatek and Madison Keys also advanced in the tournament.</p>

On the pitch, however, Rashford has impressed in pre-season, scoring his first goal and positioning himself for a key role, potentially as a center-forward, amid the surrounding drama.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is facing a renewed and dangerous nuclear arms race, yet public opposition is strangely muted compared to the Cold War era. The author points to Russia's withdrawal from the INF treaty, the buildup of nuclear-capable weapons in Europe by NATO, and increased spending by all nine nuclear states as evidence of escalating risk. The piece suggests that nuclear weapons are increasingly viewed as offensive tools rather than deterrents and criticizes the "puerile standoff" between leaders like Trump and Putin. It calls for a revival of anti-nuclear activism to halt the "madness" before it leads to global catastrophe.</p>

          <p>A shooting in a Baltimore neighborhood on Saturday night left six people wounded, including a five-year-old girl. According to Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley, the incident occurred as a group of people were gathered outside eating crabs.

A 38-year-old man is in critical condition, while four other adults sustained non-critical injuries.

Researchers identify a "threefold disadvantage" for these women as immigrants, refugees, and women, with challenges including childcare shortages, lack of recognized qualifications, and language barriers. Various publicly funded projects and nonprofit organizations like Work for Refugees and ReDi School of Digital Integration are working to address these obstacles.

          <h2>CDC Employees Express Fear and Lack of Surprise Following Deadly Shooting at Atlanta Campus</h2>

          <p>Following a deadly shooting at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, some employees expressed that they were not surprised by the attack, citing years of escalating hostility and threats against public health workers. The article details the fear among staff, who feel abandoned by a political administration that has often maligned the agency's work. It connects the violence to rhetoric from figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of anti-vaccine activism. Employees reported a sluggish response from leadership after the attack, which killed a police officer, and now feel their workplace is no longer safe.</p>

          <p>The Rifle Correctional Center in northwest Colorado evacuated 179 inmates on Saturday evening as the large Lee Fire continued to advance. The Colorado Department of Corrections announced the inmates were being safely transferred to other secure facilities outside the fire-affected area. As of Saturday, the Lee Fire had burned over 92,000 acres, making it one of the largest wildfires in the state's recent history, and was only 6% contained. Shifting winds on Friday caused the fire to spread rapidly, prompting new evacuation orders in two counties, including the area around the minimum-security prison.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance participated in high-stakes diplomatic meetings in the United Kingdom with Ukrainian officials and European allies. The talks, held at Chevening House, were aimed at progressing toward an end to the war in Ukraine and occurred just a day after President Trump announced a direct meeting with Vladimir Putin. The engagement is seen as an effort to coordinate with allies amid concerns that Ukraine could be excluded from the primary negotiations. Ukrainian officials described the talks with Vance as "constructive" and reiterated that a lasting peace is only possible with Ukraine at the negotiating table.</p>
