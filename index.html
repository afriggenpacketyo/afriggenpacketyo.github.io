          <p>Yum Brands announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations. The company's performance was impacted by same-store sales declines of 5% in the U.S. for both KFC and Pizza Hut, attributed to ineffective value messaging and increased competition. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to show strength with a 4% rise in same-store sales, driven by popular new chicken products. The report comes as CEO David Gibbs prepares to retire, with CFO Chris Turner set to take over in October. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Health is investigating an outbreak that has infected 21 people who consumed unpasteurized milk from a single, unnamed farm. The infections, caused by campylobacter and E. coli, have led to seven hospitalizations, including two cases with severe complications. Six of the individuals affected are children under the age of ten. While selling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Florida, it can be sold as pet food, which is not subject to the same sanitation regulations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," explores the argument that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was a product of historical contingency rather than an unavoidable outcome. The book focuses on the shah's hubris, U.S. obliviousness, and a series of miscalculations that allowed Ayatollah Khomeini to establish a theocratic dictatorship. Anderson posits that the revolution's success was largely an accident, shaped by the specific actions and inactions of key players in the months leading up to the event. This perspective challenges grand theories about Iranian culture or Islam being the sole drivers of the upheaval.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has published a list of 35 states, counties, and cities it designates as "sanctuary" jurisdictions for limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the department will pursue lawsuits to eliminate these policies, which she claims impede law enforcement and risk public safety. The list includes 12 states, such as California and New York, and major metropolitan areas like Cook County, Illinois. This action follows a presidential executive order aimed at compelling local jurisdictions to comply with federal immigration law.</p>

One demands the full, unredacted Epstein files from the Department of Justice by August 19.

This move is part of a broader Republican-led effort to investigate the federal government's handling of the Epstein investigation and the enforcement of sex trafficking laws.

          <p>In the investigation of a double murder at Devil’s Den State Park, witnesses have come forward describing an unsettling encounter with a man matching the suspect's description shortly before the killings. A couple hiking on the trail reported that the man, dressed in black and carrying a large bag, gave them a "death stare" and exuded "bad energy." Authorities have arrested 28-year-old Andrew James McGann for the stabbing deaths of Clinton and Cristen Brink, stating the attack appears to be a random event. McGann has reportedly confessed to the crime, and DNA evidence links him to the scene.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, the two largest banks in the U.S., had rejected him as a customer. He alleged that JPMorgan gave him 20 days to move hundreds of millions of dollars and that Bank of America subsequently denied his request to open an account. Trump attributes these rejections to pressure on the banks from the previous administration, reviving claims of financial institutions discriminating against conservatives. The statements come as the administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to penalize banks for dropping customers on political grounds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Civil rights groups and political experts are raising alarms that a new congressional map proposed by Texas Republicans is designed to dilute the voting strength of the state's growing Latino population. The plan, part of an unusual early redistricting effort, significantly alters districts like that of Rep. Greg Casar in Austin, a move critics say violates the Voting Rights Act. Despite Hispanics being the largest demographic group in Texas, the proposed map fails to create new Latino-majority districts and weakens existing ones. This has prompted legal challenges and accusations of unconstitutional racial gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether buying an annuity is a sound financial decision for a 70-year-old, especially given current economic conditions. Purchasing an annuity at this age can provide a larger, guaranteed income stream for life, as insurers calculate higher payouts based on a shorter life expectancy. However, potential drawbacks include a lack of liquidity, as the principal is tied up, and the risk of not recouping the investment if one has health issues suggesting a shortened lifespan. The best decision depends on individual health, financial goals, and the need for predictable income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance on disclosing the immigration status and ethnicity of crime suspects "needs to change." Her comments follow a public debate over a case in Warwickshire involving the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, where the two suspects are reportedly Afghan nationals. Cooper argued for greater transparency to provide local communities with more information, though she noted the decision rests with individual police forces. The debate reflects a broader tension between public information, preventing misinformation, and ensuring a fair trial for the accused.</p>

          <p>For Americans struggling with significant credit card debt, debt settlement, or forgiveness, can be a viable option. Financial experts advise that to qualify, individuals typically need over $7,500 in unsecured debt and must be able to document a clear financial hardship, such as job loss or medical crisis. The first steps include organizing all financial documents and accessing credit reports to get a full picture of one's debt. When negotiating with creditors, either directly or through a reputable firm, it is crucial to get any final settlement agreement in writing to ensure the terms are legally binding.

          <p>Pfizer has increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance, citing effective cost-cutting measures and strong business performance. The pharmaceutical company also reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, boosted by better-than-anticipated sales of its Covid-19 products and other key drugs like Vyndaqel. The optimistic outlook comes even as the company navigates President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and potential tariffs. CEO Albert Bourla confirmed the company is in "extremely productive" discussions with the administration to find solutions for drug affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

Texas Democratic lawmakers broke quorum by leaving the state to prevent a vote on the new congressional maps, which they argue are designed to unfairly favor Republicans. In response, Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows has signed civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats. The standoff highlights a high-stakes partisan conflict over electoral power ahead of the midterm elections, testing the balance of power within the state.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its support for former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for allegedly plotting a coup. After a Brazilian judge placed Bolsonaro under house arrest, the U.S. State Department publicly condemned the order. This follows President Trump's recent imposition of sanctions on the presiding judge and threats of steep tariffs on Brazilian imports, actions he framed as a response to what he calls a politically motivated "witch-hunt." The U.S. intervention has outraged many Brazilians but has energized Bolsonaro's supporters, who hope it will lead to an amnesty for their leader.</p>
