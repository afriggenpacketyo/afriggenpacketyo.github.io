          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that President Trump's newly announced tariffs are likely to increase prices on both domestic and imported goods, which will weigh down an already weakening U.S. economy. Dimon highlighted the potential for inflationary outcomes due to rising input costs and increased demand for domestic products. He noted the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs' impact on global capital flows, corporate profits, and responses from trading partners. Dimon emphasized the need for a quick resolution to minimize cumulative negative effects, viewing the situation as a significant strain on the economy.&#x20;</p>

The company has raised $42 million through convertible notes and warrants to acquire SOL and validators for the Solana network. Janover's CEO, Joseph Onorati, believes Solana's speed, usability, and programmability make it ideal for decentralized finance applications, despite its volatility.&#x20;</p>

          <p>While global markets face turmoil due to President Trump's tariffs, defense stocks are showing resilience, potentially viewed as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Analysts suggest the tariff impact on European defense stocks will be minimal, citing increasing defense spending in Europe due to pressure from Trump and geopolitical instability. Germany has passed a debt reform to increase defense spending, and the EU plans to mobilize funds to bolster regional security. Despite a recent stock price plunge in Rheinmetall, analysts see a "great opportunity" for investors due to the changing mindset towards defense spending.&#x20;</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded the highest number of measles cases in a single year since 2019, with a significant outbreak in West Texas leading to two deaths. Cases have been reported in 21 states, and health officials attribute the rise to lower vaccination rates. The CDC reports that only 93% of kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year, down from 95.2% in 2019-2020. Health experts emphasize the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates to achieve herd immunity and prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry, facing trade tariffs from the US. The ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars remains in effect from 2030, but manufacturers gain more flexibility on annual targets and face lower fines. The changes aim to address the impact of US tariffs, including a 25% levy on cars imported to the US, a major export market for the UK. The government is also providing £2.3bn in tax breaks to the car industry.&#x20;</p>

          <p>Three Harvard University students and two recent graduates have had their student visas revoked, with no specific reason provided. The Trump administration has been deporting international students from schools across the country, with approximately 300 student visas revoked nationwide. Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed many of the students had been participating in campus protests.

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has decided not to file criminal charges against a police officer whose van followed two teenagers before their fatal e-bike crash in Cardiff. The CPS cited insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The deaths of the teenagers sparked a riot in Ely, Cardiff, after rumors spread that police chased the boys before the crash. CCTV footage later confirmed police were following the boys minutes before the incident, leading to an investigation.&#x20;</p>

          <p>The artist behind a portrait of Donald Trump, which hung in the Colorado state Capitol, is defending her work after the former president criticized it. Trump called the portrait "the worst" and said it was "purposefully distorted," leading state Republicans to remove it. The artist, Sarah Boardman, stated that Trump's words have negatively impacted her business of over 41 years. Boardman also painted a portrait of President Obama, which Trump praised.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that AI bots can deliver mental health therapy with comparable efficacy to human clinicians. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that an AI bot trained in clinical best practices improved the mental health of patients with conditions like depression and anxiety. Patients developed strong bonds with their AI therapists, accessing them frequently and at all hours. The American Psychological Association acknowledges the potential of AI therapy but emphasizes the importance of rigorous clinical training and oversight.</p>
