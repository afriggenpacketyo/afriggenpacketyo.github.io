          <h2>Trump Announces Sanctions on Countries Buying Iranian Oil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 15:11:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that any country or person buying oil or petrochemicals from Iran will face secondary sanctions, preventing them from doing business with the United States. This move aims to intensify the "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, intended to halt the country's oil exports and limit its ability to finance militant groups. Experts suggest the primary target is China, which imports over a million barrels of Iranian oil daily, and that the sanctions' impact hinges on whether the U.S. targets Beijing's state-owned enterprises. The article suggests Trump's actions are intended to strengthen his negotiating position with Iran regarding its nuclear program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia criticized Anthropic's arguments supporting U.S. chip export restrictions on China, calling them "tall tales." Anthropic had claimed that Chinese smuggling tactics included hiding chips in "prosthetic baby bumps" and "packed alongside live lobsters." Nvidia argues that American firms should focus on innovation instead of advocating for tighter controls. These restrictions, known as the "AI Diffusion Rule," aim to prevent China from advancing in the AI sector.

The ruling, which applies to the Southern District of Texas, prevents the government from detaining or deporting Venezuelans under the act.

This "tariff fear-buying" was boosted by special discounts and promises from automakers not to raise prices. However, demand slowed in late April as inventories tightened and prices rose. Experts predict that higher costs and lower inventories could lead to lower sales in the future.

          <p>With rising interest rates and increasing financial struggles, settling debt for less than the total balance owed can be a viable option. Most successful settlements typically involve paying 30% to 50% less than the original balance. Creditors are more likely to negotiate if the account is delinquent and the borrower is experiencing financial hardship. While it's possible to negotiate on your own, working with a debt relief expert can offer advantages in terms of experience, negotiation skills, and ensuring proper documentation.</p>

          <p>Savers with CD accounts maturing in May 2025 should proactively research their options to maximize returns. With inflation nearing the Federal Reserve's target and interest rates potentially pausing, it's crucial to explore alternatives. Consider high-yield savings accounts or short-term CDs for competitive rates, but also weigh the affordability of long-term CDs for potentially higher interest earnings. Contacting the bank before the CD matures is essential to discuss options and avoid automatic rollovers into accounts with lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>
