          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 22:07:50 EDT</div>

          <p>Donald Trump has officially announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, set to take effect on August 1, 2025, following a national security assessment. He justified the move by highlighting copper's critical role in defense and technology sectors, including semiconductors, military hardware, and data centers. The announcement caused a significant surge in U.S. copper prices, creating a large premium over global market rates. Analysts note this tariff falls under a national security justification, distinct from tariffs aimed at trade imbalances or negotiation tactics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its policy interest rate at 2.5%, pausing to assess the effects of recent measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. Housing prices in the capital spiked over 19% annually in June, prompting authorities to address the rapid growth in household debt. Although South Korea's economy experienced a slight contraction in the first quarter, the central bank prioritized financial stability over stimulating growth. The bank cited the need to evaluate risks associated with the housing market and potential volatility in the foreign exchange market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff policies are creating significant uncertainty for Chinese manufacturers who use Southeast Asian countries as transshipment hubs to reach American markets. President Trump's recent moves have placed the region in Washington's trade crosshairs, disrupting established supply chain strategies. The lack of clear implementation details regarding these threatened tariffs has forced many Chinese companies to pause their expansion plans. This policy ambiguity is redrawing profitability lines and compelling businesses to adopt a more cautious, risk-averse approach to their international operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russian aggression, reversing a recent pause on some shipments. The decision was framed as a response to the high number of casualties and Russia's attacks on Ukrainian cities. While the Pentagon confirmed the move, the Kremlin stated that such actions do not align with efforts for a peaceful resolution. The initial pause in weapons transfers had reportedly been implemented without the full knowledge of the State Department, causing some internal confusion.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement in Minnesota arrested two men after seizing almost 900 pounds of suspected methamphetamine, valued at approximately $1.7 million. Authorities are calling it one of the largest meth busts in the state's history. The operation involved two separate traffic stops following an undercover purchase from one of the suspects. Investigators believe the two men, Joel Casas-Santiago and Guillermo Mercado Chaparro, are connected to a larger drug trafficking organization based in Mexico. The seizure is part of a broader federal focus on targeting violent crime and drug trafficking rings.</p>

          <p>Economists and industry experts are warning that the new 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer goods. Products from home appliances and electronics to electric vehicles and construction materials heavily rely on copper for components like wiring and plumbing. While the administration argues the tariff will reshore manufacturing and bolster national security, critics worry it will fuel inflation and increase costs for maintaining the nation's electrical grid.

The research also highlights significant disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a much slower recovery than white and Asian residents.

          <p>As catastrophic floodwaters rose in Kerr County, Texas, some emergency alerts were reportedly delayed because dispatchers needed supervisory approval to activate the CodeRED notification system. Radio traffic recordings from the morning of the flood reveal a firefighter's request to send an alert was met with a delay. A former county official who helped install the system noted that an hour passed between the first signs of an emergency and when an alert should have been sent. This raises serious questions about the emergency response protocol, even as the National Weather Service issued 22 separate warnings for the area.</p>

          <p>The European Union has expressed optimism about finalizing an outline for a trade deal with the United States within days, even as the Trump administration escalates its trade war. The announcement comes after President Trump threatened new tariffs on numerous countries, including a 50% duty on copper and potential levies on semiconductors. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic indicated that negotiators are making good progress on a framework agreement. However, some member states remain cautious, acknowledging that the talks are complex and could continue until the August 1 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has confirmed 1,288 measles cases so far this year, marking the highest number of infections recorded since 1992. This total surpasses the 2019 figure, with the largest share of current cases linked to an outbreak in West Texas that has resulted in two pediatric deaths. Health experts attribute the resurgence of the once-eliminated virus to declining vaccination rates in certain communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend the MMR vaccine as the most effective protection against the highly contagious and potentially severe respiratory virus.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for large-scale layoffs of federal workers. The decision allows the administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to resume its efforts to reduce the size of the government while legal challenges proceed. A coalition of labor unions had sued to block the layoffs, arguing the president exceeded his authority. The Supreme Court's majority opinion stated the government was likely to succeed on the merits of the case, though a dissent criticized the court's action.</p>

The strike by 9,000 workers, including sanitation employees and 911 dispatchers, had led to trash piling up across the city. The new three-year deal includes a 3% raise in each year and a one-time $1,500 bonus, which is significantly less than the union's initial demands. First-term Mayor Cherelle Parker stood firm on the city's fiscal limits, and workers began returning to their jobs immediately after the agreement was announced.</p>

          <p>This article presents an analysis of Pixar's film "Elio," arguing that its themes of alienation and belonging feel particularly relevant amid the current U.S. political climate regarding immigration. The story follows a Latino boy who feels like an outcast and dreams of leaving Earth, a narrative that could resonate with Latino children witnessing the impact of harsh immigration enforcement. The author notes the film's box office struggles might be partly influenced by a climate of fear in Latino communities. Ultimately, the piece suggests "Elio" offers a message of redefining home and belonging on one's own terms.</p>
