            <p>President Trump intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and warning of economic slowdowns if interest rates aren't immediately lowered. Trump claimed the U.S. has virtually no inflation and that energy costs are declining, preemptive rate cuts are necessary. This pressure comes as Trump's team explores the legality of firing Powell before his term expires in May 2026, which could trigger a steep sell-off in U.S. equity markets. Any move questioning Fed independence could raise the bar for future rate cuts.</p>

            <p>Governor Gavin Newsom announced that naloxone, a generic form of Narcan used to treat opioid overdoses, is now available to all California residents for $24 through the state's CalRx program. This initiative expands access to the life-saving medication, aiming to reduce overdose deaths. The state has already seen a decrease in synthetic opioid overdose deaths, possibly due to comprehensive efforts to tackle the opioid crisis. Newsom hopes CalRx will produce affordable generic versions of other essential drugs like insulin.</p>

The lawmakers argue his deportation constitutes a constitutional crisis and accuse the Trump administration of running a government-funded kidnapping program.

            <p>Enterprises are increasingly using the yuan for international payments, driven by concerns over the safety and credibility of U.S. assets. A weakening U.S. dollar, influenced by new U.S. policies, creates an opportunity for the yuan's internationalization. Surveys indicate a growing percentage of enterprises planning to increase yuan settlements, with about 68% using the yuan for cross-border trade. The volatility in the U.S. Treasury market has prompted some global capital to flow away from the U.S.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has dropped to its lowest point amid discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. Economic optimism has waned, with more Americans believing the economy will worsen. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are increasingly negative. The public disapproves of tariffs, inflation, and government spending, while immigration remains a strong point for the president.</p>

            <p>Pope Francis, who passed away at the age of 88, is remembered as a vocal critic of the powerful and a figure whose influence extended far beyond the Catholic Church. During his 12-year papacy, he softened the Church's image, loosened the Vatican's grip on power, and addressed major social issues. He championed social justice, supported marginalized groups, and promoted inclusivity within the Church. His efforts to reach out to those on the economic and political margins, build bridges with other religions, and advocate for environmental protection resonated globally.</p>

While consumers can take steps to mitigate exposure, the study emphasizes the responsibility of mattress manufacturers to eliminate toxic chemicals.</p>
