          <p>Shares in Danish wind farm developer Orsted fell by as much as 17% after the U.S. government issued a stop-work order for its nearly completed Revolution Wind Project off Rhode Island. The order creates significant uncertainty for the company, which is in the process of raising capital through a major rights issue. Analysts expressed concern that the halt could lead to substantial financial consequences, including a multi-billion dollar write-down if the project is ultimately cancelled. Orsted has stated it will comply with the order while exploring options to resume construction.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across Asia saw significant gains, with mainland China's CSI 300 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index leading the surge. The rally was largely driven by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which signaled that the central bank might begin easing its monetary policy soon. Analysts suggest that momentum could be sustained by capital rotating from the U.S. to China and from maturing time deposits into equities. Chinese property and technology stocks were among the top performers following the news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a sentencing hearing for Erin Patterson, who was convicted of murdering three people with poisoned mushrooms, the sole survivor delivered a powerful victim impact statement. Pastor Ian Wilkinson told the court he feels only "half-alive" following the death of his wife, Heather, and described the profound loss of his two closest friends. Despite his grief and ongoing health issues from the poisoning, Wilkinson offered Patterson his forgiveness for the harm done to him. The prosecution has argued for a life sentence without parole for Patterson.</p>

          <p>Arsenal and England forward Bukayo Saka is expected to be out of action for up to four weeks due to a hamstring injury he sustained during a match against Leeds United. This setback will cause him to miss key fixtures, including Arsenal's game against Liverpool and England's upcoming World Cup qualifiers. The club is also monitoring captain Martin Odegaard, who suffered a shoulder injury in the same game. Arsenal may rely on its newly signed attacking players to cover for the absences.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic dispute has erupted between France and the United States after France summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner. The summons was a response to a letter Kushner sent to President Emmanuel Macron, alleging that France was not doing enough to combat antisemitism and that its pro-Palestinian gestures embolden extremists. The French foreign ministry firmly rejected the allegations as "unacceptable" and a violation of the principle of non-interference in another country's internal affairs. The U.S. State Department has stood by the ambassador's comments.</p>

          <p>In a joint effort to combat environmental degradation, China's 'Great Green Wall' project may be extended into Mongolia. The initiative aims to slow the expansion of the Gobi Desert, a major source of the sand and dust storms that increasingly affect the wider East Asian region. With nearly 80% of Mongolian land impacted by degradation, this cross-border collaboration is crucial for mitigating the severe environmental and health challenges posed by desertification.

          <p>Economists are observing a significant shift in labor market dynamics, from the "Great Resignation" to a new phase dubbed the "Great Stay." Amid economic uncertainty, fewer employees are voluntarily leaving their jobs, and employers are simultaneously slowing down both hiring and firing. This has created what some call a "no-hire, no-fire" market, characterized by very low turnover. This trend of stabilization, driven by worker insecurity and employer caution, is evident in recent data from both the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Shares of China's Dongfeng Motor Group surged by as much as 69% upon resuming trading in Hong Kong. The dramatic rise was triggered by an announcement from its state-owned parent company, Dongfeng Motor Corporation, revealing plans to take the automaker private in a deal valued at around $7 billion. This move aligns with a broader Chinese government strategy to consolidate the state-owned automotive sector to enhance its global competitiveness. The company also reported a 6.6% increase in revenue for the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

A significant point of contention is the Scottish government's decade-long delay in fulfilling its promise to convert the remaining dangerous single-carriageway sections of the road to dual carriageway, a project originally slated for completion by 2025.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party is advocating for a revival of fracking, telling energy firms to prepare for renewed drilling if the party comes to power. Deputy leader Richard Tice argues that leaving the UK's substantial shale gas reserves untapped is "grossly financially negligent." This pro-fracking stance marks a sharp departure from the policies of previous governments, which have repeatedly banned the controversial extraction method due to concerns about earthquakes and environmental impacts. The policy directly opposes the current Labour government's focus on transitioning to clean energy.</p>
