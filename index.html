          <p>A high-stakes summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents in Anchorage, Alaska, has ended without a tangible agreement for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Despite both leaders describing the talks as constructive and having made progress, they departed without taking questions or announcing any concrete deals. The outcome is seen as a setback for the U.S. president's image as a dealmaker, especially after he had previously threatened Russia with severe consequences if the conflict was not resolved. The meeting leaves the future of negotiations and potential further sanctions uncertain.</p>

          <p>Democrats in the California legislature have unveiled a proposal for a new congressional map designed to give their party up to five additional seats in the U.S. House. The move is a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas and is being framed as a necessary measure to "fight fire with fire." The plan would be presented to voters in a special election, bypassing the state's independent redistricting commission. The proposal has drawn criticism from Republicans and good-government groups who argue it politicizes the process.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be sold separately from the main property it accompanies. This development is a significant milestone following a city law passed a year ago to enable such sales, aiming to create more accessible forms of homeownership. Officials hope this project will serve as a model for other cities in the state, potentially offering a new type of starter home and helping to address California's housing crisis. ADUs now account for about one-fifth of statewide housing growth.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in the Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the shrinking sea is the primary cause of the region's poor air quality and high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that the focus of mitigation efforts should pivot from shoreline dust control to protecting residents where they are most exposed, such as by improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok featuring works by exiled artists from authoritarian countries has been censored following pressure from the Chinese government. Officials from the Chinese embassy reportedly complained about pieces by Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong artists, leading the gallery to remove or cover up sensitive artworks and descriptions. The show's Burmese curator and his wife, fearing for their safety, have since fled Thailand and are seeking asylum in the UK. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an act of transnational repression and a violation of freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is aiming to disrupt the market by producing an affordable, American-made pickup truck. The company's strategy is to keep the base model simple and spare, significantly reducing manufacturing costs, and then allowing owners to customize it with a wide range of accessories. With over 100,000 reservations already made, Slate's approach targets the high sticker price that remains a major barrier for many potential EV buyers, although the expiration of federal tax credits could challenge its price competitiveness.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached between the White House and Washington D.C. officials to scale back the Trump administration's recent takeover of the city's police force. Under the new pact, the Metropolitan Police Department will remain under the command of its local chief, Pamela Smith, rather than a federally appointed administrator. The deal was announced after D.C. filed a lawsuit and sought an emergency restraining order against what it termed a "hostile takeover," successfully de-escalating a tense standoff over local versus federal control.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's move to federalize the Washington D.C. police force, Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution to terminate the action. Citing the D.C. Home Rule Act, the resolution argues that the president has not demonstrated the "special conditions of an emergency" required to legally take control of the local department. The sponsors, including Representative Jamie Raskin, contend that the takeover is an unlawful and egregious attack on the city's autonomy and was based on a misleading narrative about crime rates.</p>
