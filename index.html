          <p>Super Micro Computer shares fell 18% after the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results, partly due to President Donald Trump's tariffs. CEO Charles Liang noted a June revenue shortfall caused by a lack of working capital and specification changes from a major new customer. The company, which previously benefited from AI server demand, also provided a lower-than-forecast guidance for the fiscal first quarter. This performance has raised concerns about its near-term growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Romanian law, explicitly allowing its armed forces to shoot down Russian drones over its territory, is believed to have prevented a NATO clash with Russia. Russian strikes on a Ukrainian gas distribution center near the Romanian border prompted the deployment of F-16s, but no intrusions occurred. Romanian defense officials state that Russia has avoided crossing into their airspace since the law's passage. This measure highlights efforts by Eastern European states to fortify borders against Russian threats.</p>

This marks a first for U.S.-built vehicles under an expanded program, and NHTSA is closing its 2023 safety probe into Zoox. The company plans to deploy a commercial ride-hailing service, eyeing Las Vegas as its initial market later this year.

          <p>President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) jobs reports were "rigged" to politically harm him, specifically alleging downward revisions occurred after the 2024 election. However, the article clarifies that major downward revisions happened months *before* the election, and a pre-election report actually showed a sharp slowdown in job growth. Experts warn that Trump's move to fire BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer politicizes crucial economic data, raising concerns about its future trustworthiness.</p>

The incident occurred during a surf camp, with the sea lion swimming under her instructor before the attack.

          <p>An "unprecedented" wildfire is raging in southwestern France, having already scorched over 15,000 hectares, an area larger than Paris, and claiming one life. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou described it as the biggest fire since 1949, linking it to global warming and drought. Approximately 2,000 firefighters are battling the rapidly spreading blaze, which has led to evacuations and road closures. The situation remains critical due to strong winds and dry conditions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Mexican musician Ricardo Hernández, known as "El Makabelico," alleging he laundered money for the Cartel del Noreste (CDN) through concerts. The U.S. Treasury Department claims 50% of his streaming royalties go directly to the cartel. This action is part of a broader effort targeting musicians whose work explores cartel themes, with the administration previously revoking visas of other artists. The sanctions aim to block Hernández's U.S. properties and financial transactions, highlighting the complex intersection of music and organized crime.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler's resignation presents President Donald Trump with strategic options for filling central bank board vacancies. Analysts suggest Trump could appoint a temporary "shadow chair" to influence current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, or directly name his preferred long-term successor. The short remaining term of Kugler's seat adds complexity, potentially making it less appealing for nominees. This situation highlights Trump's desire for lower interest rates and raises concerns about the Fed's independence from political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Borrowers seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) face new hurdles, including an executive order from President Donald Trump that aims to limit eligibility for certain types of employment. Additionally, a significant backlog of applications to switch repayment plans and process "buyback" requests for missed payments is stalling progress for millions. Experts advise borrowers to maintain their current course while awaiting clarity on eligibility changes, which may face legal challenges. These issues create uncertainty and difficulty for those relying on PSLF for debt relief.</p>

          <p>Apple plans to commit an additional $100 billion to U.S. domestic manufacturing over the next four years, increasing its total U.S. investment to $600 billion. This announcement, confirmed by the White House, aims to ease tensions with President Trump, who has pushed for more U.S. production and threatened tariffs. The new manufacturing program seeks to reshore critical components, bolstering America's economic and national security. While analysts note shifting production to the U.S. could take years and raise prices, Apple continues to expand its domestic supply chain.</p>

          <p>A committee of Italian ministers has approved plans for a 3.3-kilometer bridge connecting Sicily to mainland Italy across the Strait of Messina, with completion targeted by 2032. Hailed by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government as an economic boost for the impoverished south, the €13.5 billion project faces significant controversy. Critics raise concerns about its location in an earthquake zone, environmental damage, and potential mafia infiltration of contracts. Despite decades of debate, proponents view this approval as the project's furthest advancement.</p>

          <p>Approximately 9,200 households in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch are without water due to emergency repairs at a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power pump station. A valve failure at a pump station connected to a 10-million-gallon tank cut off water flow, draining the tank. DWP is coordinating with the Metropolitan Water District and providing bottled water at distribution sites. Repairs are expected to be completed by Friday, with city officials mobilizing resources to ensure resident safety amidst rising temperatures.</p>

          <p>Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militant and political movement, has declared it will disregard the Lebanese government's decision to establish a state monopoly on arms. The group described the move as a "grave sin" and attributed it to American "diktats," despite international pressure for disarmament. Hezbollah, though weakened by last year's conflict with Israel, maintains significant support and refuses to discuss disarmament while Israeli attacks persist. This rejection underscores deep internal divisions and risks escalating tensions in Lebanon.</p>

          <p>The murder of 32-year-old Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, initially reported as a suicide, was solved by a crucial piece of evidence: a metal ring from a bathroom door lock. Matthew Ecker, the only other person present, claimed Pennig locked herself in the bathroom before shooting herself, and he broke the door open afterward. However, the discovery of the lock piece *underneath* Pennig suggested the door was forced open *before* she was shot, contradicting Ecker's story. Ecker was subsequently charged and convicted of second-degree murder.</p>
