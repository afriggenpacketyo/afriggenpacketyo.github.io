          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs as high as 35% on Japanese goods if a new trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This potential increase is significantly higher than the current 10% levy most Japanese exports to the U.S. face. Trump expressed doubt that a deal would be finalized, while Japan's chief cabinet secretary stated the country would not make concessions that could harm its agricultural sector. The threat escalates trade tensions as the administration's 90-day tariff pause for negotiations with global partners is set to expire.</p>

          <p>Protesters gathered outside the office of Republican Rep. Young Kim to voice opposition to President Trump's proposed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, includes significant cuts to federal programs like Medicaid while extending tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. Activists and constituents, including nurses and families reliant on Medi-Cal, argued that the cuts would be cruel and reckless, potentially causing millions to lose healthcare coverage. Rep. Kim stated she voted to protect Medicaid services, but critics contend the bill will harm vulnerable Californians.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking the program in September, with the judge stating the administration lacks the authority to vacate a TPS designation before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. The decision provides temporary relief for Haitians who rely on the status for legal residency and work permits. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, asserting its authority to enforce immigration laws.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's signature spending proposal, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," is a 940-page legislative package that has ignited fierce debate. The bill aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, expand the child tax credit, and allocate $170 billion for defense and border security, including funds for the border wall. However, it also proposes significant spending cuts to social welfare programs like Medicaid, which has caused a rift among Republicans and drawn sharp criticism from figures like Elon Musk over its projected $2.4 trillion addition to the national debt. The bill's passage through Congress has been extremely narrow, requiring a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The House Judiciary Committee has issued subpoenas to Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania as part of its ongoing antitrust investigation into Ivy League schools. The probe examines whether the universities colluded to raise tuition rates and used applicants' financial data to limit financial aid, practices the committee likens to price-fixing and price discrimination. Committee chair Jim Jordan stated the schools' previous responses to document requests were inadequate. The universities maintain they have been cooperating with the investigation, which could inform potential legislative reforms to antitrust laws concerning higher education.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing sensitive Medicaid recipient data with the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit alleges that the transfer of personal health information, including names, addresses, and immigration status, violates federal privacy laws and is intended for immigration enforcement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta argued the action creates a culture of fear that will deter people from seeking vital medical care. The administration defended the data sharing as a legal effort to crack down on fraud and misuse of federal funds.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032, targeting chemicals that have contaminated local groundwater for decades.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet medical journal estimates that the Trump administration's shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) could result in 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. The research found that USAID programs, which the administration has largely dismantled, have saved over 90 million lives in the past two decades through initiatives targeting HIV, malaria, and child mortality. The administration argues the agency has been inefficient, but researchers say their analysis shows that the aid has had a substantial life-saving impact for a relatively small taxpayer cost.</p>
