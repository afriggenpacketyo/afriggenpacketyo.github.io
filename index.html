        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports indicate that Israel launched a series of airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and high-ranking military officials, including the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, who was reportedly killed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the operation as "Operation Rising Lion," aimed at rolling back the Iranian threat to Israel's survival, stating that the attacks would persist until the threat is eliminated. The United States denied involvement in the operation, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasizing that Israel took unilateral action, prioritizing the protection of American forces in the region, and warning Iran against targeting U.S. interests. The strikes have led to heightened tensions, with Iranian media reporting explosions and casualties in Tehran and Natanz, prompting the U.S. Embassy in Israel to advise employees and their families to shelter in place. </p>

          <p>Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins sent letters to California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass regarding the impact of anti-ICE riots on the veteran community. The VA was compelled to close its Los Angeles Ambulatory Care Center for at least five days due to the riots, affecting over 600 veteran appointments. Collins criticized Newsom and Bass for prioritizing opposition to President Trump's policies over maintaining law and order, and questioned the safety of veterans after federal law enforcement leaves the area. The letter requested specific steps to restore order and a status update on investigations into the defacement of the care center, also requesting that state and local authorities pay to repair the damage to the building.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump illegally deployed the California National Guard to suppress protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, ordering the troops to be returned to Governor Gavin Newsom's control. The judge found that Trump failed to demonstrate a "rebellion" in Los Angeles requiring federal intervention and did not properly notify the governor. Newsom praised the ruling as a victory for all Americans, asserting that the president's actions threatened democracy and moved the country closer to authoritarianism. The temporary restraining order does not affect the deployment of U.S. Marines, who the Justice Department claims are solely for protecting federal buildings and personnel.</p>

          <p>Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey issued a stern warning to protesters considering violence, stating that those who engage in violent acts will face lethal force.

Ivey's remarks were made at a press conference alongside Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, emphasizing Florida's stance as an "anti-riot state" amidst planned nationwide protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Uthmeier affirmed Florida's support for ICE and contrasted the state's approach with California, where the National Guard has been deployed in response to protests.</p>

          <p>Dan Wang, a keen observer of contemporary China, characterizes the country as an "engineering state" due to its rapid development and focus on large-scale infrastructure projects. China's integrated transport systems, including subways and high-speed rail, are considered attractions in themselves, highlighting the nation's advancements in civil engineering. The country has built more dams, bridges, and high-rises than any other nation, showcasing its obsession with large public works. Wang contrasts this with the United States, which he terms the "lawyerly state," noting that China's STEM graduates outnumber those of the U.S. by a significant margin.</p>

          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's deployment of California National Guard troops to address protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles, deeming the move "illegal". The judge ordered the Trump administration to return control of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, though the order does not limit the use of Marines and will not take effect until Friday at noon. Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta had filed an emergency request to block what they termed Trump's "unnecessary" and "unlawful militarization" after Trump deployed over 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, against the objections of Newsom and other state and local officials. The judge cited protesters' First Amendment rights, stating that the protests did not meet the legal requirements of a "rebellion" to justify a federal deployment.</p>

The ruling, which could still be appealed, marks a setback for the White House in its dispute over the powers it can assert in cracking down on illegal immigration.

          <p>Research indicates that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. Archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. The findings suggest that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient society. This study provides new insights into the history of animal domestication and early human societies in China.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's popularity remaining sluggish. With no party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, all eyes are on whether Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can retain its seats, given approval ratings for his Cabinet sometimes dipping below 30 percent. Most parties, including the LDP's coalition partner, Komeito, and Tomin First no Kai, are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, especially those unaffiliated. Major issues at stake include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals involving the LDP, and child-rearing concerns.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Solar Firms Eye Overseas Expansion Amid U.S. Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are continuing to expand overseas to ensure survival amid ongoing trade tariffs, focusing on localizing production abroad. Although the U.S. and China reached a 90-day truce in their tariff war in May, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the U.S. remain subject to tariffs of up to 3,521 percent. While most of the existing overseas capacity of Chinese solar manufacturers is in Southeast Asia, nearly 80 percent of their planned overseas capacity expansion is targeted for the Middle East and Africa, followed by the U.S. and Europe. Companies are preparing for the possibility of tariffs rising to 200 percent, which would make exports unfeasible.</p>

          <p>Approximately 45,000 grocery workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions stores in Southern California have authorized a strike to protest what they deem unfair labor practices. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals representing the workers announced the vote, giving their leaders the authority to call a strike. The workersâ€™ contracts expired on March 2, and negotiations have been ongoing for several months. The union contends that staffing shortages have hurt service and working conditions, while the companies have allegedly engaged in unlawful surveillance and interrogation of members for union activity.</p>

          <h2>Trump Orders Merger of Wildland Firefighting Forces, Citing Efficiency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 20:20:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the US government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings from former federal officials about potential costs and increased risks. The order aims to centralize firefighting efforts, currently split among five agencies and two cabinet departments, with the proposed budget calling for a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the US interior department. This would involve shifting thousands of personnel from the US Department of Agricultureâ€™s Forest Service, with fire season already underway, and the administration has not disclosed the potential cost savings. Organizations representing firefighters and former forest service officials warn that restructuring firefighting efforts could cause major disruptions and increase the likelihood of catastrophic fires.</p>

          <p>JJ Spaun leads the US Open at Oakmont after the first day, finishing four under par, while top-ranked players Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler faced challenges. McIlroy started well but faltered with a four-over 74, while Scheffler, the tournament favorite, is three over par after an uncharacteristically ragged round. Only 10 of the 156 players finished under par, highlighting the difficulty of Oakmont Country Club. Patrick Reed achieved a rare albatross on the par-five fourth hole but finished at three over par due to a triple-bogey on the last hole.</p>

          <p>Douglas McCarthy, the singer of the British electronic industrial group Nitzer Ebb, has passed away at the age of 58, though the cause of death was not specified. McCarthy founded Nitzer Ebb in Essex, and the band released its first single in 1985, drawing aesthetics from post-punk and the nascent goth movement. Nitzer Ebb's harsh and antagonistic style, known as EBM (electronic body music), played a formative role in the industrial wave, influencing acts like Nine Inch Nails and Rammstein. McCarthy revived Nitzer Ebb in 2007 and released the album "Industrial Complex" in 2010, and he had faced health issues, including liver cirrhosis, in recent years.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 20:05:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy, which delivers toxic drugs inside cancer cells, to treat the blood cancer myeloma. The drug, belantamab mafodotin, has been shown to halt the cancer for nearly three times longer than current therapies and reduces side effects. The therapy works by binding a lethal chemotherapy drug to an antibody that targets plasma cells, releasing its toxic payload once inside. Clinical trials showed the therapy halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current treatments, and around 1,500 patients a year could benefit from the new drug.</p>
