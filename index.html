          <p>A wildfire in New Jersey's Ocean County has led to mandatory evacuations for residents in Ocean Township, Lakewood, and Lacey Township. The fire, which started at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has threatened over a thousand structures and forced the evacuation of thousands of people. Fire officials are working to contain the blaze, which has already burned thousands of acres and caused significant traffic disruptions, but there have been no reported injuries. Shelters have been opened by the Red Cross to assist those displaced by the wildfire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's energy-storage industry is struggling due to the US-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to concerns about price competition. Experts project a decrease in capital expenditure and slower expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS). With higher tariffs potentially impacting exports to the US, Chinese producers are seeking alternative markets. The sector is also dealing with overproduction, which has led to a price war and a significant drop in export prices.</p>

The Real ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to enhance the security of state-issued identification, but implementation has faced multiple delays. Travelers with non-compliant IDs will be subject to additional screening, and those who fail secondary verification may be denied access.</p>

          <p>While China faces declining birth rates and reluctance among youth to have children, Guangdong province, particularly the Chaoshan region, is bucking the trend. Cultural traditions that prioritize larger households and honor lineage contribute to higher birth rates in the province. Guangdong recorded over a million births in 2024, making it China's top province for new births for the seventh consecutive year. This is attributed to the enduring belief that more children bring more blessings and carry on the family name.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appears inclined to rule in favor of parents seeking the ability to opt their children out of public school instruction involving storybooks addressing gender identity and sexual orientation. The case revolves around a dispute between families and the Montgomery County Board of Education in Maryland, with the court's conservative majority expressing skepticism about the school board's decision to eliminate opt-outs. Justices questioned the feasibility of denying religious exemptions, drawing attention to the potential burden on parents' First Amendment rights.</p>
