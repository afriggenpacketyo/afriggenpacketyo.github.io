          <p>The husband of a Palestinian doctor in Gaza remains in critical condition after an Israeli strike killed nine of their ten children. Hamdi al-Najjar, also a doctor, sustained significant injuries to his brain, lungs, and kidney. The couple's surviving son, Adam, was also injured but is reportedly doing reasonably well. The Israeli military has stated that the incident is under review, while the Red Cross reported the deaths of two staff members in a separate strike. The United Nations reports that a significant portion of Gaza is under Israeli evacuation orders or within militarized zones, exacerbating the dire situation for civilians. The loss of life and ongoing conflict continue to shock medical professionals and civilians in the region. The optimism score cannot be calculated due to the tragic nature of the event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision has expanded President Trump's authority over high-level officials, effectively allowing him to neutralize independent expertise within the executive branch. This ruling, made in a case involving members of the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards, has been criticized for overruling a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument. The decision enables the consolidation of power in the presidency and risks assimilating a ‚Äúmove fast and break things‚Äù ethos into constitutional law. Critics argue that the court's actions undermine lower courts seeking to protect the rule of law and embolden an administration eager to act outside traditional constitutional norms.</p>

          <p>Ketamine therapy, depicted on reality television and touted by some celebrities, is gaining traction as a treatment for depression and other mental health conditions. While the FDA has approved a ketamine derivative for treatment-resistant depression, experts caution against viewing it as a quick fix. Ketamine can be effective in creating more connections between brain cells and distracting from negative thoughts, but it also carries risks, including addiction, cardiovascular issues, and neurological dysfunction. Experts urge caution, emphasizing the importance of medical supervision during IV treatment to monitor for dangerous side effects, as ketamine therapy is intended to be used in combination with antidepressant pills only under the supervision of a medical professional.</p>

Separately, an avalanche in Kandersteg, north of Zermatt, resulted in the death of a 29-year-old Swiss citizen and minor injuries to two others.

          <p>The executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, Cindy McCain, has described the current level of aid entering Gaza as a mere "drop in the bucket" compared to what is needed to prevent famine. McCain warned that 500,000 people in Gaza are extremely food insecure due to the Israeli blockade, which Prime Minister Netanyahu defends as a means to pressure Hamas. She stated that only about 100 trucks are allowed to enter Gaza daily, far fewer than the 600 trucks that were entering during the ceasefire. McCain also refuted claims that Hamas is responsible for looting aid trucks, attributing it to the desperation of starving people, and urged the international community to increase pressure to allow more aid into Gaza.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail. The officer, Leslie O‚ÄôNeal, initially pulled Arias-Cristobal over for a false turn, but the charges were later dropped. However, the arrest triggered immigration enforcement, resulting in Arias-Cristobal‚Äôs detention due to her undocumented status and narrowly missing the DACA eligibility deadline. Her plight drew national attention, with some supporting her release and others advocating for her deportation. The case highlights the impact of local law enforcement's collaboration with ICE under 287(g) contracts and a new Georgia law requiring local law enforcement to apply for such agreements.</p>

          <p>Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer for the film ‚ÄúRust,‚Äù has been released from prison after serving 14 months for involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Gutierrez was found guilty of reckless handling of firearms and ammunition on the movie set. Alec Baldwin, who pointed the gun that killed Hutchins, was initially charged but the charge was later dismissed. Several civil lawsuits against Baldwin and the producers remain unresolved, and the incident has prompted increased scrutiny of film set safety, particularly on low-budget productions.

          <p>During his commencement address at West Point, President Trump made controversial remarks, including telling graduates to avoid "trophy wives," referencing real estate developer Bill Levitt, which was met with mixed reactions. The speech also focused on isolationist stances and the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the military. Trump stated that the military's job is to dominate foes and annihilate threats, not to host drag shows or spread democracy. He also referenced his own legal troubles, comparing his investigations to those of Al Capone. These remarks have sparked criticism for politicizing a military commencement ceremony.</p>

Galloway cites a recent poll indicating Tesla's ranking plummeted, attributing this decline to Musk alienating Tesla's core customer base through political alignment. Despite Musk's recent announcement to refocus on Tesla, Galloway notes that Musk has alienated his core demographic. Tesla reported a significant drop in earnings per share, and has faced widespread protests at its dealerships and showrooms. Galloway added that Musk has cozied up to people who aren't interested in EVs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a top public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly LNG. From 2013 to 2024, Japan invested $93 billion in such projects, with $56 billion going towards overseas LNG development. This contradicts Japan's leadership in the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which promotes cooperation on net-zero emissions. Critics argue that Japan's promotion of LNG as a "transitional fuel" for AZEC partner countries is a form of greenwashing, as LNG involves significantly more emissions than coal. The study from Cornell University found that LNG involves 33% more emissions than coal, when processing and shipping are considered.</p>

          <p>A new parenting framework, "emotionally safe parenting," prioritizes attunement to a child's emotional needs and creating a secure environment for them to express their feelings. This approach focuses on building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, respond without shaming, and view misbehavior as a signal for support. Key practices include doing inner work to understand personal triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by reconnecting after conflicts. By focusing on emotional attunement and inner healing, parents can create an environment where their child feels safe expressing their authentic self.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, communities are commemorating the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, which sparked widespread protests against racism and police brutality. Events were held in both Houston, where Floyd grew up, and Minneapolis, where he was killed. In Minneapolis, community members planned a church service, a candlelight vigil, and a gospel concert in George Floyd Square. In Houston, local organizations hosted poetry sessions, musical performances, and speeches by local pastors. While some see progress in addressing systemic racism, others note that President Trump is rolling back police reforms in some cities.</p>

The family was unable to evacuate due to concerns about living conditions in crowded tent camps. The incident is part of a renewed round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, which has resulted in thousands of casualties.
