          <p>California Senator Alex Padilla was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security press conference held by Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. Padilla interrupted Noem while she discussed deportation plans in California, leading to a confrontation with officers. Video footage shows officers pulling Padilla by the arms, pushing him to the ground, and handcuffing him after he identified himself as a senator and attempted to ask questions. DHS defended the officers' actions, claiming Padilla did not identify himself and lunged toward Secretary Noem, while Padilla's office stated he was exercising Congressional oversight and was wrongly detained; despite the incident, Noem and Padilla held a 15-minute meeting afterward. </p>

          <p>Violent unrest in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, has led families to hide in attics and wardrobes, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable. The unrest, which began after a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, has resulted in injuries to 41 officers and the arrest of 15 people. Chief Constable Jon Boutcher described the violence as "racist", emphasizing solidarity with diverse communities and warning against bigotry. Outreach workers reported families trapped in their homes with mobs attempting to enter, leading to residents feeling unwelcome and fearing for their lives, and police have deployed a heavy presence in affected areas to prevent further violence.</p>

          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a slight decrease following a sharp increase in the previous session, which was driven by fears of a potential conflict between Israel and Iran. President Trump indicated that an attack by Israel on Iran was possible but not imminent, which contributed to the easing of concerns. Earlier, oil prices had surged by over 4% due to fears of supply disruptions, with analysts suggesting prices could spike to $120 per barrel if Iran were to close the Strait of Hormuz. Despite these concerns, experts believe the likelihood of Iran blocking the strait remains low, as it has never been closed off in recorded history.</p>

Noem was discussing immigration operations when Padilla interrupted to ask a question, leading to his removal from the room. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the situation, describing Padilla as "one of the most decent people" and condemning the actions as "outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful." The incident occurred amid increased tensions and protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement, with Noem supporting the federal deployment of troops to maintain order.</p>

          <h2>Tariffs Have Yet to Significantly Impact Inflation</h2>

          <p>Despite widespread concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet caused significant increases in inflation, with recent consumer and producer price indexes showing benign results. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff announcements, a lag in the tariffs' impact on the real economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economists believe the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months, as pre-tariff stockpiling diminishes and charges make their way into import prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Savers are advised to compare CD rates and traditional savings account rates carefully to maximize interest earnings. Certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts offer viable alternatives to traditional savings accounts, particularly in the current high-interest rate climate. The fixed interest rates of CDs provide immunity to rate changes during the term, offering potentially higher returns than traditional savings accounts. A comparison shows that a $5,000 CD can earn significantly more interest than a traditional savings account over various terms, emphasizing the benefit of locking in high CD rates while they are still available.

Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta filed an emergency request to block the deployment, arguing it is an "unlawful militarization." The state seeks to prevent the use of federalized National Guard and active-duty Marines beyond protecting federal buildings.

This move will eliminate climate and health benefits for Americans that are 20 times larger in dollar terms, with the costs borne by the public through dirtier air and climate change. The EPA is ditching restrictions on planet-heating emissions and weakening regulations on harmful toxins, such as mercury, with Administrator Lee Zeldin touting the need for "beautiful clean coal".
