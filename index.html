        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent trade talks, the United States and China have agreed to reduce tariff rates, lowering duties from triple-digit figures. Chinese goods entering the US will face at least 30% tariffs, while American exports to China will encounter a minimum of 10% in duties. However, these rates do not account for previous tariffs from earlier trade disputes or duties on specific goods. Financial institutions estimate the baseline tariff rate for Chinese exporters to be about 50%, combining older tariffs and the new duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms, initially challenged by interest rate hikes in 2022, saw profits increase as higher rates boosted net interest income. Companies like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo experienced significant profit growth in 2024 due to this. However, as interest rates decline, these fintechs, especially digital banks, face a test to sustain profitability. Diversifying revenue streams and strong monetization of customer bases through non-interest services will be crucial for weathering economic changes and the transition to a lower-rate environment.

The UN and aid groups dispute Israeli claims that Hamas controls incoming food, while thousands of tons of essential supplies remain stranded at the Egyptian border.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been a vocal opponent of gender transition treatment, advocating for the elimination of diversity initiatives related to transgender troops.

With nearly a fifth of U.S. retail sales occurring during the Christmas season, the 90-day tariff pause can help resolve potential product shortages. While some businesses had halted production due to tariff increases, the reprieve allows for resumed orders and manufacturing. However, previously imposed tariffs remain in place, leading to an estimated weighted average tariff rate of 43.5% on Chinese products.

          <p>President Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has put India in a difficult position, as India has historically opposed third-party mediation in the region. Trump announced a ceasefire brokered by the U.S. after clashes between the two countries, and offered to help find a solution to the Kashmir issue. While Pakistan welcomed Trump's offer, India's position has hardened, especially after revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. The main opposition party in India has requested an explanation from the government.</p>

          <p>A recent auction at Christie's in New York revealed potential caution flags for the art market, with limited enthusiastic bidding and presold items. Experts cited economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs as a factor affecting the global art market. While the Riggio collection achieved a $272 million total, it fell short of pre-sale expectations. A Mondrian painting failed to spark a bidding war, and a Warhol painting was withdrawn. However, paintings by Richter, van Gogh, and Frankenthaler sold above their high estimates, indicating some demand in the art market.</p>

While Zelenskyy supported Trump's attendance, the Kremlin remained noncommittal. Trump, currently on a Middle East tour, stated he was "thinking about flying over" if he believed "things can happen." The announcement came after a "coalition of the willing" threatened Russia with fresh sanctions if it failed to comply with a 30-day ceasefire.

The resolution, passed by the DNC's credentials committee, stems from a challenge by Kalyn Free, who alleges the DNC improperly combined questions and tallied votes during the election. While the challenge is unrelated to the controversy surrounding Hogg, it brought back to the fore his turbulent tenure as a party leader. Hogg has faced pushback over his efforts to mount primary challenges against Democrats, prompting calls for neutrality from party leaders.</p>
