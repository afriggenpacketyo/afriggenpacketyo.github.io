          <p>A 16-year-old boy tragically died after encountering difficulties while swimming in a lake at Colwick Country Park in Nottinghamshire. Emergency services were dispatched following reports of the boy's disappearance, and an underwater search team located his body. Authorities have stated that the death is not being treated as suspicious and are preparing a file for the coroner. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the hidden dangers of open water swimming, especially as parts of the UK are experiencing record high temperatures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan has revised its growth forecast for the fiscal year, cutting it in half to just 0.5 percent, citing the impact of trade policies and U.S. tariffs on the global economy. The central bank also decided to hold interest rates steady at 0.5 percent, complicating efforts to normalize monetary policy. This decision reflects concerns that tariffs could lead to an economic slowdown and potentially trigger a decline in prices. The Bank of Japan projects core prices to rise by around 2.2 percent this fiscal year, slightly lower than its previous forecast.</p>

          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a Stoke-on-Trent firm known for its colorful pottery, has ceased trading after more than 100 years, resulting in the loss of 57 jobs. The company's directors cited rising energy costs as a major factor in the closure, with costs increasing by almost £250,000 over the past two years. The collapse of Moorcroft is another blow to the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent, which has seen several firms close in recent years. Industry leaders are calling for government support to help the sector cope with high energy costs and competition from cheaper imports.</p>

The BOJ indicated that it will continue to raise its policy rate if economic and price forecasts are realized, but cautioned that drastic changes to tariff policies would affect its monetary policy outlook.</p>

          <p>Tesla's shares experienced a drop in overnight trading following reports that the company's board has initiated a search for a new chief executive to succeed Elon Musk. The Wall Street Journal cited sources familiar with the matter, noting that the move follows a decline in Tesla's sales and profits. The company's reputation has also been negatively impacted by Musk's involvement in President Donald Trump's administration, where he has been working to downsize the federal government.</p>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in what is seen as an effort to improve relations with the EU amid trade tensions with the United States. The sanctions, imposed in 2021, had strained relations between the EU and China. While the move is viewed as a positive step, it is unlikely to lead to a revival of the frozen EU-China investment deal. The EU maintains its sanctions on Chinese officials over human rights concerns in Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>An op-ed in the New York Times argues that the U.S. military lacks the personnel and materiel to fight a major war, despite possessing advanced military equipment. The authors contend that the military is equipped only for short, high-intensity conflicts, and that modern wars require both advanced systems and a large volume of munitions. They highlight the shortage of artillery shells, precision-guided missiles, and the challenges in recruiting and maintaining a trained force. The article suggests that the U.S. needs to increase its investment in ammunition, ships, planes, and the well-being of service members.</p>
