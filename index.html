          <h2>A Former Parisian Waitress Offers Advice on Avoiding Tourist Overcharging Scams</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 01:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent investigation by Le Parisien revealed that Parisian cafes are overcharging tourists, a practice the author, a former waitress in the city, confirms is not surprising. She recounts personal experiences of both witnessing and being subjected to such scams, like inflated bills and upselling. The article provides practical advice for travelers to avoid these "tourist taxes," such as learning key French phrases, being wary of deals that seem too good to be true, and carefully checking the bill before paying. This guidance aims to help visitors enjoy the city's cafe culture without being exploited.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man allegedly stabbed eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, before being taken into custody by authorities. The attack, which occurred near the checkout area, appears to have been random, with victims including six males and five females. Six of the injured are reported to be in critical condition, with all victims receiving treatment at a local medical center. Law enforcement, who arrived within three minutes of the 911 call, credited citizen involvement in helping to apprehend the suspect and prevent further harm in what officials are calling a brutal act of violence.</p>

          <p>Four individuals, including a married couple, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children aged 7 to 16. Authorities allege the children, particularly four who were adopted, were subjected to horrific treatment, including being kept in plywood cages under bunk beds. The abuse reportedly included beatings, being sprayed with vinegar as punishment, and being forced to lie about their situation. The investigation began after a church member raised concerns, leading to the removal of all children from the home.</p>

          <p>The party chief of China's Jilin province, Huang Qiang, has reignited a sensitive historical debate by urging a clear presentation of the history of the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms as Chinese. These kingdoms, known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae, are a point of contention, with both nations claiming historical ties. Huang's comments, made at a modern history exhibition, emphasized a confident telling of this history from a Chinese perspective. The remarks raise the specter of diplomatic friction by touching upon a long-standing and contested view of the ancient territories located in what is now northeastern China and the Korean peninsula.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly censoring news about mass casualty events, such as a recent incident where a car struck children near a Beijing school. Authorities often release vague statements omitting key details, while photos and discussions are scrubbed from the internet, a practice that has intensified since a particularly deadly attack in November. This information control, aimed at preventing copycat crimes and unrest, is now facing pushback from some citizens who are demanding transparency online. Experts suggest local officials may be covering up failures, creating a tension between local censorship and the central government's need to maintain legitimacy.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that significantly escalates the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, with RSF commander Hemedti as president, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent partition of the nation. This development, which follows an agreement between paramilitary, rebel, and civilian groups, aims to establish a secular "New Sudan." The UN has warned that this action risks further fragmenting the country and undermining diplomatic efforts to resolve a conflict that has already displaced millions and killed an estimated 150,000 people.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield, rejecting her claim of self-defense. Prosecutors argued the killing was the culmination of a bitter custody battle over their daughter, while the defense portrayed Doug as a violent abuser. The trial featured testimony about their turbulent relationship, including Ashley's previous allegations of poisoning and abuse, which were never substantiated with charges. Benefield was ultimately sentenced to 20 years in prison, bringing a conclusion to a case that gained public attention through the victim's older daughter on TikTok.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, was met with protests across the country, where demonstrators criticized his presence and UK leaders' engagement with him. While the president played a round of golf, hundreds gathered in Edinburgh and other cities, with signs decrying him as a "disgrace" and not welcome in Scotland. The protests, organized by a "Stop Trump Coalition," brought together various groups to create what one organizer called a "carnival of resistance." Despite the demonstrations, Scottish First Minister John Swinney is still scheduled to meet with Trump during his visit.</p>

          <h2>Vogue Advertisement Featuring AI-Generated Model Sparks Debate on Beauty Standards</h2>

          <p>A Guess advertisement in the August edition of Vogue has generated controversy by featuring a model created entirely with artificial intelligence, a first for the magazine. While Vogue clarified it was not an editorial choice, the ad has raised concerns among real models and advocates about its impact on diversity and unrealistic beauty standards. Critics argue that using flawless, digitally created figures undermines progress in industry inclusivity and could negatively affect the body image of consumers. The company behind the AI model defends its work as a new marketing option, but acknowledges that its more diverse AI creations receive less engagement online.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope said to have been invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat considered "as accurate as the gods." Despite its historical renown, the device's existence has been questioned by some scholars, leading to its removal from school curriculums in 2017. By combining modern scientific principles with historical clues, the researchers hope to restore this lost wonder of antiquity and validate its ingenious design.</p>

          <h2>New Research Links Nanoplastics to Serious Health Issues, Including Brain and Heart Disease</h2>

          <p>Emerging scientific research is revealing the potential long-term health impacts of nanoplastics, microscopic particles that contaminate our food, water, and air. For the first time, researchers at the University of New Mexico have found plastic particles in human brain tissue, with higher amounts observed in the brains of people with dementia. Other studies are linking exposure to these particles with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Experts describe nanoplastics as "toxic drug delivery systems" and are conducting long-term clinical studies to better understand their effects on chronic diseases, particularly in children.</p>

          <h2>Hundreds of Passengers Rescued After Being Trapped on a High-Speed Train in Austrian Tunnel for Six Hours</h2>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna, Austria, to Hamburg, Germany, were stuck inside a tunnel for over six hours following a power failure. The incident, which occurred shortly after departure, left passengers in the dark and without air conditioning in the heat. The evacuation was reportedly delayed when some passengers attempted to walk out of the tunnel on their own, forcing a safety shutdown of power to a replacement train. Eventually, all passengers were safely evacuated through emergency exits and transported back to Vienna by bus, with two individuals receiving on-site medical treatment.</p>
