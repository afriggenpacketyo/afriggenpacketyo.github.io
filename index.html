          <p>A new poll indicates that Donald Trump has the lowest 100-day job approval rating of any president in the past 80 years. The poll reveals public disapproval of many of Trump's policies and widespread economic discontent, including recession fears. Despite this, the poll indicates that Trump is still more trusted than the Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems. The majority of people oppose various administration initiatives, peaking at 77% opposed to cuts in federal funding for medical research.</p>
