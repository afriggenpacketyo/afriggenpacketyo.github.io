          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court injunction, allowing the Trump administration to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning or the chance to challenge their removal based on potential torture or death in their destination country. The ruling is a win for the administration's immigration policy, enabling officials to deport migrants to third countries. Justice Sotomayor dissented, accusing the court of condoning lawless behavior, while a Homeland Security official tweeted support for the decision. The executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance criticized the ruling for stripping away due process protections.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, many Trump voters have expressed support, viewing the action as aligned with his 'America First' agenda and trusting his judgment to protect American interests while avoiding prolonged conflict. While some voters voiced disappointment, fearing escalation, others see the strikes as preventative and necessary to disarm countries posing future threats. Supporters also defended Trump's decision to proceed without congressional approval, citing the need for swift action to protect American safety. Some Republicans, however, criticize the strikes, accusing Trump of betraying his pledge to avoid 'never-ending wars'.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, set to begin in approximately six hours, involving two 12-hour periods. Neither Israeli nor Iranian officials have publicly commented on Trump's announcement, but the agreement is described as a cessation of hostilities following a 12-day period of conflict, which began with Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear targets. The announcement comes after Iran fired missiles targeting Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which were reportedly intercepted with U.S. assistance. Trump has struck a de-escalatory tone, congratulating both countries on having the stamina, courage, and intelligence to end the conflict.</p>

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the lack of briefing and accused the president of potentially misleading the public, while Speaker Mike Johnson stated that the retaliation was expected. Several war powers resolutions have been introduced to require congressional approval before any further action against Iran, with bipartisan support emerging against the conflict, but Johnson indicated that it might not get a vote.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to reform prior authorization practices, which require patients to seek permission before receiving medical treatment. The agreement aims to standardize approvals, expedite decisions, reduce procedures subject to prior authorization, and honor existing approvals when patients switch insurers. While officials hailed it as a positive step, concerns remain about insurers' commitment, as similar pledges in the past have not been fully honored. Some states have already legislated prior authorization reforms, mandating faster decisions and greater transparency from insurers.</p>

          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies and resulting increases in energy prices. While initial market reactions saw crude oil prices jump, they later fell amid speculation that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil flow. Experts believe that ongoing tensions could still disrupt the energy market, with potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities posing a significant risk. A closure of the Strait of Hormuz could lead to a worst-case scenario where prices spike to $130 per barrel, significantly impacting global GDP.</p>

          <p>President Trump's stance on Iran has shifted from discouraging military strikes to actively participating in them, now suggesting the possibility of regime change with the phrase "Make Iran Great Again". This shift has created division among his supporters, with some accusing him of betraying his promise to avoid foreign wars. While some aides express surprise, Trump's actions reflect an improvisational approach, contrasting with the more cautious and planned approach of previous administrations. The shift exemplifies the hubris of the Iraq War project, which Trump had promised to leave behind.</p>

          <p>In a recent order, the Supreme Court's Republican justices have allowed President Trump to bypass federal law and an international treaty protecting immigrants from torture. The order permits Trump to send immigrants to countries where they may face torture while the case is litigated, without allowing them a meaningful opportunity to object. The administration appears to be targeting countries where immigrants are likely to be unsafe, such as South Sudan and Libya. This decision has been criticized for creating a deadly trap for immigrants seeking protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>

While presidents have often sent forces into combat without formal declarations of war, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 sought to reassert congressional authority.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, officials and experts have offered conflicting assessments regarding the extent of the damage. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that Iran's nuclear ambitions had been "obliterated," while others, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, said it would "take some time" to assess the damage. An Israeli official noted a lack of understanding of the damage, and a high-level European ballistics expert expressed skepticism about the bombs' ability to penetrate deep underground. IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi stated that the extent of the damage underground in Fordo is unclear.</p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, earning $21 million domestically, signaling challenges for original animated movies. Despite positive reviews, the film struggled to attract audiences, possibly due to competition from other family-friendly movies and unfamiliarity with the title. Disney remains optimistic that 'Elio' will find its audience over time, similar to 'Elemental,' and emphasizes the importance of continuing to create original animated content. While animated sequels and films based on existing intellectual property have consistently performed well, industry insiders recognize the need for fresh stories to maintain the animation business's vitality.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to use its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, despite China's heavy dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own economic interests. The analyst pointed to China's past agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of this approach. While about 16% of China's seaborne crude comes from Iran, its actions will be driven by economic self-interest rather than direct military intervention.</p>

The government expects to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then, and seeks to stress that investment in defence will be felt "directly in the pockets of working people" pointing to new jobs that would be created.</p>
