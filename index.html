          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly costs for home equity loans have slightly decreased, making them a more affordable option for homeowners. The article provides a detailed breakdown of estimated monthly payments for a $100,000 loan over 10 and 15-year terms, comparing them to costs from earlier in the year. It also contrasts these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), advising borrowers to weigh the stability of a loan against the potential for further rate drops with a HELOC. This analysis offers a financial overview for those considering borrowing against their home's value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bruce Pearl, the head coach of Auburn University's men's basketball team, is reportedly set to retire before the 2025-26 season, with his son Steven Pearl expected to take over the program. This announcement comes amidst swirling rumors that Pearl may pursue a political career, potentially running for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Tommy Tuberville, who is running for Alabama governor. Pearl has been an outspoken supporter of Israel and has previously commented on his desire to make an impact beyond coaching. During his tenure, he led the Tigers to two Final Four appearances with a record of 246-125.</p>

          <p>The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, has been dropped as a patron or ambassador by six charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation. The decisions follow the publication of a 2011 email in which she referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend," which appears to contradict her earlier public condemnation of him. A spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was sent to mitigate a defamation threat from Epstein and that she still deeply regrets any association with him. This development comes amid increasing public pressure for transparency regarding Epstein's network of powerful connections.</p>

Jackson, known for his influence on the trading of Opendoor, revealed his firm holds a position and suggested the company is poised for massive growth by using AI to innovate the mortgage industry. He compared its low valuation to the much higher multiple of newly public Figure Technology Solutions, projecting that Better Home could be a "potential 350-bagger in 2 years." The endorsement caused a significant, immediate surge in the company's stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

This move has been met with significant pushback from Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, which stated there is no credible scientific evidence for such a link. Leading medical organizations have also affirmed acetaminophen's safety when used as directed during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Southern California is expected to remain humid with a possibility of showers through the upcoming weekend due to tropical moisture from the Pacific. While significant rainfall is not anticipated for the Los Angeles area, the weather pattern will create unusually muggy and unstable conditions. The highest probability for isolated storms is forecasted for Tuesday and Wednesday, primarily affecting areas north and east of L.A. County. Meteorologists note that another system, Tropical Storm Narda, is developing off the coast of Mexico and could funnel more moisture into the region by early next week, potentially extending the wet and humid conditions.</p>

          <p>Ahead of an expected announcement from the Trump administration linking acetaminophen use in pregnancy to autism, medical experts and Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, are strongly refuting the claim. Kenvue stated that over a decade of rigorous research shows no credible evidence for such a link and warned that discouraging its use could lead pregnant women to riskier alternatives. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other major studies support this position, highlighting acetaminophen as the safest option for treating conditions like high fever, which itself can pose risks to fetal development.

          <p>Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva has criticized the Premier League's scheduling, claiming his team was at an "unfair advantage" in their recent match against Arsenal. City had only 66 hours to prepare for the Sunday game following a Champions League match on Thursday night, whereas Arsenal had played their European fixture on Tuesday. Silva stated that it is not right to play one of the season's most important games with such a significant disparity in rest, adding that he did not feel he was in perfect condition. Manager Pep Guardiola echoed these sentiments, stating the team was "incredibly tired" and has previously criticized scheduling for English teams in Europe.</p>

          <p>As fall begins, experts note that climate change is generally causing peak autumn foliage to occur later than it has historically, with delays of about a week since the mid-20th century. The timing and vibrancy of leaf color changes depend on various factors like temperature, rainfall, and elevation, making precise predictions difficult. While warmer fall temperatures can delay the process, weather from previous seasons also plays a role in the intensity of the colors. Online foliage maps can help track general patterns, but local conditions create significant variations, so experts recommend exploring different locations and elevations to find the best views this season.</p>

This has prompted organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics to issue their own, sometimes conflicting, strong recommendations.

          <p>More than 400 prominent figures from the entertainment industry, including Tom Hanks and Lin-Manuel Miranda, have signed an open letter organized by the ACLU to protest the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. The letter condemns the government pressure that led ABC to take Kimmel off the air, calling it a "dark moment for freedom of speech." The suspension followed Kimmel's monologue criticizing the response to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which prompted the FCC chairman to suggest regulatory action against the network. The incident has sparked a broader debate on free speech, with other entertainers and even some conservative commentators voicing concern over government censorship.</p>

It draws a parallel to Hannah Arendt's warnings about the blurring of truth and lies, citing Trump's claims about Tylenol and autism as an example.

Costs are highly dependent on factors such as the beneficiary's age, location, gender, tobacco use, and the specific plan chosen.

The Brooks family expressed gratitude for the pleas but remains focused on holding all involved accountable.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people across Italy participated in a day of strikes and protests in solidarity with Palestinians, leading to clashes with police in several cities. The largest demonstrations occurred in Milan and Rome, with reports of about 60 police officers injured during confrontations near Milan's central station. The nationwide action, coordinated by trade unions, caused widespread disruption to public transport and major ports. The protests highlight political tensions within Italy over its stance on the Gaza conflict, as Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government has not followed other European nations, like France, in formally recognizing a Palestinian state.</p>

The launch is being promoted by top female athletes, including Serena Williams and Sha'Carri Richardson, and represents a significant growth opportunity for both brands by combining Nike's manufacturing power with Skims' cultural influence.</p>

          <p>The health and beauty chain Bodycare is closing all of its remaining 56 stores, resulting in the loss of 444 jobs, after administrators failed to find a buyer for the business. The company, which entered administration earlier this month, was deemed no longer viable due to stock shortages and high operating costs. Founded in 1970, the retailer was known for its value-oriented warehouse-style stores but faced intense competition from larger chains, supermarkets, and online sellers. While discussions about selling the Bodycare brand itself are ongoing, the physical store closures are expected to be completed by the end of the week.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Trump administration has announced it will cancel its long-standing annual Household Food Security Report, labeling it "redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous." For 30 years, this survey has provided critical data on the number of Americans struggling to access adequate food, shaping national anti-hunger policies. Anti-hunger advocates argue that ending the report will leave policymakers "flying blind," especially as recent data showed a significant increase in food insecurity. The decision comes after the administration expanded work requirements for SNAP benefits, which is projected to remove 2.4 million people from food aid.</p>

While the quake caused loud noises and objects to fall from shelves, there have been no immediate reports of major damage or injuries. As a precaution, the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system operated trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing minor delays for commuters. The event serves as a reminder of the region's seismic risks.</p>

Reid explained the interaction as a display of Kelce's passion, stating the team needed more "juice" at that point in the game.

          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran argued that the central bank's benchmark interest rate is excessively high and should be cut by nearly two percentage points. Miran contended that policy changes from the White House, including those on taxes, immigration, and deregulation, have lowered the neutral interest rate, making current monetary policy too restrictive. He warned that maintaining such tight policy risks unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment. Miran's stance places him outside the consensus of the Federal Open Market Committee, where he was the sole dissenter in last week's vote, advocating for a larger half-point cut.

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,700 per ounce as investors seek a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty and anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Bullion has gained over 40% this year, driven by ongoing purchases from global central banks and heightened geopolitical tensions. For investors looking to gain exposure, most experts recommend using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), rather than buying physical bars or coins. Financial advisors generally suggest limiting gold allocation to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, typically under 3%. (not investment advice)</p>

The tournament has sold a total of 440,000 tickets, more than triple the amount from the previous event, achieving a nearly 94% capacity rate across all games.

The Justice Department is advocating for a breakup of Google's ad-tech divisions to restore fair market conditions, a move Google argues would be disruptive and unnecessary.
