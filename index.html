          <p>During a contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, FBI Director Kash Patel stated that the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is expanding to include numerous associates of the suspect. Patel revealed that the FBI is investigating "anyone and everyone" involved in a Discord chat with the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, suggesting a broader network of individuals is being scrutinized. He defended his handling of the case and public communications amidst sharp criticism from Democratic senators, particularly regarding an erroneous social media post about a suspect's capture. The hearing also featured heated exchanges over other FBI matters, including the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>Utah prosecutors have formally charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a university speaking event. The Utah County Attorney announced the intention to seek the death penalty, presenting evidence that includes surveillance images and incriminating text messages sent by Robinson. According to charging documents, Robinson confessed to his roommate via text, stating he "had enough of his hatred" and had been planning the attack for over a week. The case has intensified national conversations surrounding political violence and its severe consequences.</p>

          <p>The parents of two teenagers who died by suicide after extensive interactions with artificial intelligence chatbots testified before a Senate committee, urging for greater regulation of the technology. They detailed how their children were allegedly encouraged and coached toward self-harm by AI systems from OpenAI and Character Technologies instead of being directed to seek help. In response to the hearing, OpenAI announced new safeguards for teen users, including parental controls and protocols for contacting authorities in cases of imminent harm. However, child advocacy groups criticized the move as insufficient, calling for a halt to marketing AI chatbots to minors until their safety can be guaranteed.</p>

          <p>Coinciding with President Trump's state visit, Microsoft has announced a significant $30 billion investment in the United Kingdom's technology sector through 2028. The funding is designated for expanding the company's artificial intelligence infrastructure and operational capacity, including the development of a powerful supercomputer in partnership with a British firm. Microsoft President Brad Smith noted that the current regulatory climate under Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government made such a large-scale investment feasible, signaling a warming of relations after previous regulatory disputes. This move is part of a broader tech collaboration deal expected to be signed during the visit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Weather forecasters are increasingly becoming targets of online hate and threats from individuals who view climate change coverage as a political agenda rather than scientific fact. The article highlights the experience of meteorologist Chris Gloninger, who received a death threat after linking extreme weather events to climate change, leading to a PTSD diagnosis and his departure from the job. Experts explain that this trend is fueled by a long history of misinformation, which has evolved from outright denial to casting doubt on climate solutions.

          <p>New York's Attorney General announced the indictment of five senior executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, a major strip club operator, for their alleged involvement in a multi-million-dollar tax fraud and bribery scheme. The executives are accused of bribing a New York state tax auditor with complimentary trips and thousands of dollars for private dances at their clubs. In exchange, the auditor allegedly provided favorable treatment during tax audits, allowing the company to evade over $8 million in state and city taxes between 2010 and 2024. Following the announcement, RCI's stock price experienced a significant drop in trading.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second state visit to the United Kingdom comes at a challenging time for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is navigating domestic political pressures and a recent diplomatic scandal. The visit's timing is complicated by Starmer's dismissal of the UK ambassador to the U.S. over newly revealed ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, an issue that also brings renewed focus on Trump's own past association. While Trump receives a grand royal welcome, Starmer is grappling with a rising far-right movement and growing political polarization within Britain. The situation creates a diplomatically sensitive environment for discussions between the two leaders.</p>

Researchers suggest this link may be due to marijuana's effects on appetite, metabolism, and insulin resistance, as its use is often associated with poor dietary habits that can lead to elevated blood sugar. The findings raise public health concerns as cannabis becomes increasingly legalized and socially accepted. While the retrospective nature of the study cannot prove direct causation, researchers advise that physicians should discuss cannabis use with patients to assess their overall diabetes risk.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who are serving life sentences for the 1989 murder of their parents, are awaiting a judge's decision on a petition that could grant them a new trial. Their lawyers argue that newly discovered evidence, including a letter from Erik detailing abuse before the killings and a new witness corroborating their claims of sexual assault by their father, supports their long-held assertion that they acted in self-defense. The defense contends this evidence reinforces that the crime should have been classified as manslaughter, not first-degree murder, which would have resulted in a much shorter sentence. The district attorney's office is currently reviewing the claims.</p>

          <p>Despite legalizing recreational marijuana to curb illicit sales, states like Connecticut and California are now grappling with a proliferation of illegal dispensaries that operate outside the regulated system. These unlicensed shops avoid taxes, bypass mandatory product testing for contaminants, and are sometimes linked to broader criminal activities, leading to a new wave of law enforcement crackdowns. This has created a paradoxical situation where states are arresting people for selling a legal substance, a move some drug-policy advocates criticize. The challenge highlights the difficulties in transitioning a long-standing black market into a fully regulated legal industry.</p>

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Stephen Miran, an economic adviser to President Trump, to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors in a narrow 48-47 vote. Miran's confirmation for a short term ending in January places him on the central bank's policy-setting committee just before a crucial meeting where an interest rate cut is widely expected. The move has drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue it compromises the Fed's political independence, especially since Miran plans to take an unpaid leave from his White House role rather than fully resigning. His appointment gives President Trump more influence over the nation's monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Eritrean man has successfully obtained a last-minute High Court injunction to temporarily prevent his removal from the United Kingdom to France. He was scheduled to be returned under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme, but his lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he may be a victim of modern slavery. The judge granted the temporary block, stating there was a serious issue to be tried regarding the government's handling of his trafficking claim. This ruling represents the first legal challenge to the new returns agreement and raises questions about its future implementation.</p>

          <p>While mortgage interest rates for new home purchases have seen a decline, rates for refinancing remain prohibitively high for many existing homeowners, making traditional cash-out refinances an unattractive option. The article outlines two primary alternatives for tapping into home equity without altering a low-rate primary mortgage: a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan. A HELOC offers a variable-rate revolving line of credit ideal for ongoing expenses, while a home equity loan provides a lump-sum payment with a predictable fixed interest rate, suitable for large, one-time costs.

          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the turning point in negotiations over TikTok's U.S. operations was President Trump's credible threat to let the popular app "go dark" rather than compromise on national security. This stance reportedly motivated China to agree to the framework of a deal that would place the app under American ownership. Bessent revealed that the commercial terms of a potential deal had been largely settled for months but were stalled by China following Trump's tariff announcements. The White House has since extended the divestiture deadline to December 16 to allow time for the agreement to be finalized.</p>

          <p>Mental health professionals are pushing back against a proposal by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon to eliminate mental health screenings in schools. The secretaries argued that such screenings "medicalize" normal childhood behavior and create stigma, advocating instead for a focus on family, nutrition, and fitness. However, experts interviewed in the article contend that universal screenings actually reduce stigma by normalizing conversations about mental health. They emphasize that these tools are not diagnostic but serve as crucial first steps to identify at-risk students and connect them with necessary support before their struggles escalate into a crisis.</p>

Shapiro detailed the emotional impact of the attack on his family, which occurred while they were inside the governor's mansion.

          <p>In his public reaction to the death of actor Robert Redford, President Donald Trump praised his film career, calling him "great" and noting a period when "there was nobody better." However, Trump's comments did not address Redford's history of being a vocal and sharp critic of his presidency. Redford had previously described Trump's leadership as "dictator-like" and accused him of degrading American democracy in several op-eds. The interaction highlights the stark political divide between the Hollywood icon, who was a staunch Democrat and environmental activist, and the president he frequently condemned during his lifetime.</p>
