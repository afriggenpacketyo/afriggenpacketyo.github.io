          <p>The Trump administration's "reciprocal" tariffs have officially been implemented, affecting numerous U.S. trading partners with increased duties. Rates vary significantly, with countries like Syria, Laos, and Myanmar facing duties around 40%, while allies like the EU and Japan have negotiated lower 15% rates. The policy has created uncertainty, with some nations like Switzerland failing to secure a last-minute deal and others like China remaining in a trade truce. Economists are watching closely to determine the full impact on global trade, economic growth, and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain's homelessness minister, Rushanara Ali, is facing calls to resign after allegedly increasing the rent on a property she owns by £700 a month. The increase reportedly occurred shortly after the previous tenants' fixed-term contract ended and they moved out. A spokesperson for the minister stated that all legal requirements were met, and a source claimed the tenants chose to leave while the house was on the market. The incident comes as the government's Renters Rights Bill, which would restrict such actions, is in its final parliamentary stages.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors has created significant uncertainty within the industry, as key details remain undefined. The policy would exempt companies that are "building in the United States," but the specific investment required for this exemption is unclear. Experts suggest this could consolidate market share among major players like TSMC and Samsung, which have already invested heavily in U.S. facilities. Questions also persist about whether the tariffs apply only to raw chips or to finished consumer goods containing them, which would have a much larger economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

The positive performance was attributed to gains in public holdings like Grab and private investments in India. Despite the Vision Fund's success, the group's overall profit was weighed down by investment losses in other holdings, including sales of T-Mobile and Alibaba shares. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspects are alleged to have participated in firearms training in 2022 to prepare for a potential armed assault on the German parliament. This operation is part of an ongoing investigation into the group, whose alleged ringleaders were arrested in December 2022 and are currently on trial.</p>

          <p>Florida Polytechnic University and the Orlando College of Osteopathic Medicine are partnering to offer an accelerated six-year medical degree program. This initiative aims to address a severe shortage of healthcare providers in Polk County, which has half the state average of doctors per capita. The program will allow up to 20 high-achieving students annually to earn a Bachelor of Science and a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree in six years instead of the traditional eight.

The world's largest automaker now projects a full-year operating income of 3.2 trillion yen, down 600 billion yen from its previous forecast.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that in a world facing complex, overlapping crises, leaders and institutions must shift away from a rigid desire for control and instead embrace uncertainty. The author contends that the traditional top-down, rules-based approach to governance is ill-suited for tackling challenges like climate change and declining trust in politics. Citing neuroscience and historical policy failures, the article suggests that an obsession with control stifles creativity and collaboration. It calls for a cultural shift towards co-creation and pluralist thinking, proposing that letting go of the need for certainty is essential for renewing democracy.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new regulations to clamp down on the unregulated cosmetic surgery industry following several incidents of patient harm and death. The proposals aim to protect consumers from "cowboy" practitioners by restricting who can perform high-risk procedures like Brazilian butt lifts and ensuring providers are regulated by the Care Quality Commission. The new rules would also introduce age restrictions, mandate licensing for clinics offering Botox and fillers, and impose financial penalties for violations.

          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, which would mark its fifth reduction since last August and the lowest rate in over two years. This move would likely lower mortgage costs for homeowners on variable rates but would also result in smaller returns for savers. The decision comes as the UK economy shows signs of stagnation, with zero growth recorded in April and May. A cooling labor market and slowing wage growth are seen as factors that could allow the Bank to cut rates despite inflation remaining above its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese researchers has identified 37 young "de novo" genes, which are unique to humans and are not evolved from existing genes. These genes, which arise from previously non-functional DNA, are believed to be key to advanced human traits like higher cognitive abilities. However, the research, published in Cell Genomics, also found that the expression of these unique genes was significantly increased in tumors. The study suggests that these genetic elements, which may contribute to making humans smarter, could also act like "dormant bombs" that fuel cancer proliferation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is threatening secondary sanctions against countries, particularly India and China, for their continued purchase of Russian oil, a key revenue source for Moscow's war in Ukraine. President Trump recently levied an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing its oil trade with Russia, which could significantly impact India's economy. This move creates a dilemma for both India and China, who have defended their purchases as necessary for energy security. Any major disruption to Russia's five million barrels per day of oil exports could trigger a global price spike and stoke inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is the most frequently stolen vehicle in the United States, according to a new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute. The high-performance muscle car, which retails for around $75,400, had a theft rate 39 times higher than the average for all vehicles between the 2022 and 2024 model years. The report found that expensive, powerful vehicles and pickup trucks dominate the list of most-stolen cars. Conversely, electric vehicles were among the least stolen, likely because they are often parked in garages and are more easily tracked.</p>

          <p>A new coffee-table book about Auschwitz by famed fashion photographer Juergen Teller is being criticized as a narcissistic and banal project that fails to add any meaningful understanding of the Holocaust. The critic argues that the more than 800 iPhone photos are unremarkable and lack hierarchy, giving equal weight to gas chambers and local snack bars. In one instance, Teller photographs pages from the "Book of Names" that contain his own surname, a move described as narcissistic rather than an act of solidarity. The article contends the book is a detached vanity project that blurs responsibility.</p>

The problem, which United stated was related to its internal flight information system, has been fixed, but residual delays are expected as the airline works to restore normal operations.

          <p>An intense and deadly wildfire, described by officials as the largest in nearly 80 years, is burning in a rural, wooded region of southwestern France near the Spanish border. The blaze has consumed 16,000 hectares, resulting in one death, at least one missing person, and 13 injuries, including nine firefighters. Over 2,100 firefighters, supported by aircraft and helicopters, are battling the flames, but unfavorable weather conditions with high temperatures and strong winds are expected to hamper their efforts.

The gains for Samsung and TSMC are linked to their significant existing and planned investments in U.S. manufacturing, which would likely exempt them from the levy, potentially giving them a competitive advantage over rivals.

          <p>A new study from Harvard Medical School suggests that lithium, a metal commonly used as a mood stabilizer, plays a crucial physiological role in brain health. Researchers found that depleting natural lithium levels in mice accelerated brain changes associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, maintaining normal lithium levels, particularly with a compound called lithium orotate, protected against these changes and even reversed memory deficits in mouse models. The findings could pave the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's, though human trials are still needed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency's new recruitment campaign has drawn responses from both actor Dean Cain and the animated show "South Park." Cain, who played Superman in the 1990s, posted a video encouraging followers to join ICE, while Homeland Security's X account used a still from an upcoming "South Park" episode featuring ICE to promote its hiring website. "South Park" responded satirically, as its recent episodes have mercilessly lampooned the administration, and the upcoming episode appears to focus on the absurdity of the recruitment drive itself.</p>
