          <p>Zia Yusuf is set to rejoin Reform UK just two days after resigning as chairman, taking on a new role leading the party's "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf had initially cited that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time" when he resigned, but later stated his decision was due to exhaustion after 11 months of volunteer work. Reform leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf will have a more public role and appear more frequently in the media. This comes after Yusuf criticized Sarah Pochin's remarks about banning the burka, highlighting internal disagreements within the party.</p>

          <p>More than 100 dogs were rescued from a suspected puppy mill in North Carolina, where they were found living in unsanitary conditions, according to the SPCA of Wake County. The dogs were discovered in cramped cages, surrounded by waste, with many mother dogs nursing young puppies. The shelter's medical team is currently treating the dogs for various health issues, including skin and dental problems. The homeowner surrendered 21 chickens in addition to the dogs, and it is unclear whether they will face charges. The shelter is seeking donations and foster homes to support the rescued animals, with plans to place them up for adoption once they are healthy.</p>

          <p>Amid parliamentary gridlock in France, there's been a surge in remembrance policies, with parliamentarians adopting three texts that reclassify historical events or offer reparations. These initiatives include the posthumous promotion of Alfred Dreyfus to brigadier general, recognition and compensation for former returnees from French Indochina, and a resolution addressing Haiti's "double debt" from 1825. While these measures are largely symbolic, they reflect a willingness to take historical responsibility. Some view this as a form of social maturity, while others see it as a way to circumvent politically paralyzed legislature.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough has expressed his dismay over the damage inflicted on the world's oceans due to certain fishing methods in an interview with Prince William. The interview precedes a UN Oceans conference focused on protecting oceans from threats like plastic pollution and climate change. Attenborough specifically criticized the impact of bottom trawling on the deep ocean floor, calling it "unspeakably awful." The UN aims to secure ratification of the High Seas Treaty to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030, but concerns remain about the effectiveness of protected areas if destructive practices like bottom trawling are still permitted.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was mistakenly deported, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal criminal charges related to human smuggling. He is accused of participating in a conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country. The charges, dating back to 2016, allege he transported undocumented individuals and MS-13 members. His lawyer calls the charges "preposterous." The White House had initially resisted a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return.</p>
