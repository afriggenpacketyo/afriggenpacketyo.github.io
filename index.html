          <h2>Trump Seeks Supreme Court Approval for Transgender Military Ban</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has asked the Supreme Court to allow his administration's policy prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military to take effect while legal challenges proceed. The request follows a federal appeals court decision to keep a lower court order blocking the ban nationwide. Trump's policy, which aims to establish high standards for troop readiness and cohesion, disqualifies individuals with gender dysphoria or who have undergone related medical interventions, citing concerns about medical and mental health constraints. The Supreme Court has given the plaintiffs until May 1 to respond to the administration's request.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the deportation of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student and Palestinian activist arrested during his citizenship interview. Mahdawi, a permanent U.S. resident, co-founded the Palestinian Student Union and led protests against the war in Gaza. His attorneys argue that his First Amendment rights were violated, and the judge has scheduled a hearing to decide whether he should be released while the case continues. The Department of Homeland Security asserts that Mahdawi's advocacy for violence and support of terrorists warrant the revocation of his privileges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Companies accelerated their orders for durable goods like autos and appliances by 9.2% in March in anticipation of President Trump's tariffs on U.S. imports, according to the Commerce Department. The increase was driven by a surge in transportation equipment orders, particularly nondefense aircraft. A Federal Reserve report indicated that companies were adjusting their behavior to get ahead of the tariffs, with increased vehicle sales attributed to a rush to purchase before tariff-related price increases. However, the report also showed apprehension about broader economic conditions due to the tariffs, suggesting the surge in orders may not be indicative of long-term trends.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has cut hundreds of millions of federal grant dollars meant to prevent gun violence, opioid addiction, and support victims of violent crimes. The Department of Justice notified over 350 organizations that their funding was being terminated, stating that the money no longer aligns with Department priorities. The department intends to focus on law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting children, and supporting victims of trafficking and sexual assault. The cuts come at a critical moment for community-based violence prevention, which had seen increased funding during the Biden administration and is credited with the recent drop in homicides.</p>

          <p>The UK has lifted asset freezes on Syrian government bodies, including the defense and interior ministries, following the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Sanctions are also being lifted on sectors like financial services and energy production to facilitate investment and rebuild Syria's economy. The Foreign Office stated that sanctions on members of the former Assad regime and those involved in the Captagon drug trade would remain. The move aims to encourage the return of Syrian refugees, with the Home Office pausing asylum claims to assess the situation.</p>

Nvidia's senior director of corporate sustainability, Josh Parker, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that compute and energy demand are only rising due to AI.

In the ancient world, death was an omnipresent reality due to diseases, plagues, and natural disasters, influencing daily life and philosophy. Funerals were often expressive and intimate affairs, with limited professional palliative care available. While ideas about the afterlife varied, common themes included the continued existence of the dead and the belief that they depended on sustenance provided by the living.</p>

Researchers at Anthropic are studying "model welfare," considering the possibility that AI models might become conscious and deserve moral status. While current AI systems are not considered conscious, the increasing reliance on AI for emotional support and advice raises questions about the threshold at which AI might deserve moral consideration, potentially similar to that given to animals. The debate centers on whether AI systems can experience joy or suffering and whether they should be granted rights.</p>
