          <p>India's foreign ministry has responded to threats of increased U.S. tariffs by highlighting that both the United States and the European Union continue to engage in significant trade with Russia. The ministry stated that India only began importing Russian oil out of necessity after the 2022 Ukraine conflict disrupted traditional energy supplies, a move it claims was encouraged by the U.S. to stabilize global markets. This defense comes as former President Trump accuses India of profiting from discounted Russian crude and threatens substantial new tariffs on Indian goods. The statement underscores the complex global trade dynamics and perceived double standards in international sanctions policies.</p>

          <p>In response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports, the Chinese government has introduced a new plan to support its domestic cattle industry. The policy, announced by the nation's top economic planner, aims to increase local beef production and promote consumption by establishing a quality-grading system for domestic products. Officials noted that Chinese diets are often deficient in high-quality proteins, indicating significant potential for growth in consumption. The move is part of a broader strategy to strengthen key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic farm goods against a backdrop of increasing foreign competition.</p>

          <p>According to a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence contributed to over 10,000 job cuts in the first seven months of 2025. AI is now listed as one of the top five reasons for layoffs, with the tech sector seeing over 89,000 job cuts this year. The report also highlights that other factors, such as federal spending reductions and trade tariffs, are having a more immediate and widespread impact on the labor market. The trend particularly affects entry-level corporate roles, where listings have declined significantly even as mentions of AI in job descriptions have soared. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A political standoff over congressional redistricting has intensified, with California Governor Gavin Newsom vowing to fight "fire with fire" against Republican efforts in Texas. Newsom stated that California would pursue its own partisan redistricting only if Texas Republicans proceed with their plan, which could add five new GOP seats to the U.S. House. This development comes as Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state to prevent a vote, prompting Texas Governor Greg Abbott to threaten them with arrest. The confrontation highlights the national implications of state-level redistricting battles and the increasingly aggressive tactics being employed by both political parties.</p>

          <p>The cleanup from Storm Floris is underway across Scotland, with significant travel and power disruptions expected to continue. The storm, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, left approximately 50,000 homes without electricity and caused 119 incidents on the nation's rail lines due to fallen trees and debris. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) is working to restore power, while Network Rail is conducting inspections to clear routes. The Scottish government has urged caution, advising people to avoid travel if possible as recovery efforts proceed after winds reached up to 90mph in some areas.</p>

Organized by the Jewish-American group IfNotNow, hundreds gathered to demand the Trump administration pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into the territory amid reports of starvation. Speakers, including the New York City comptroller, condemned the Israeli government's blockade as a policy of forced mass starvation and an affront to humanity. The protest reflects a growing movement within the American Jewish community calling for an end to the conflict and a change in U.S. policy toward Israel.</p>

          <p>U.S. border agents have been directed to cease deportations under President Trump's asylum ban, following a federal appeals court order that partially limited the policy. The directive, reported by CBS News, instructs Customs and Border Protection officials to process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law rather than the sweeping ban. This development comes after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the administration cannot use the ban to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. The original ban, which was challenged by the ACLU, is a central part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire, named the Gifford fire, is burning through Los Padres National Forest in central California, having scorched more than 72,000 acres. The blaze, which is only 5% contained, threatens over 450 structures and has forced evacuations in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. At least three injuries have been reported, and over 1,000 firefighters are battling the flames in difficult terrain amid forecasts of hotter, drier weather.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly ordered a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This move follows claims by President Trump and his allies that the probe, known as "Russiagate," was a politically motivated effort to undermine his presidency. The action stems from a referral by the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who alleged the Obama administration politicized intelligence to falsely link Trump to Russia.

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean “Diddy” Combs’ motion for release on bail, ordering that he remain in custody at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center until his sentencing in October. The judge ruled that Combs failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that he was not a flight risk or a danger to the community. Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges in July, though he was cleared of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking counts. His legal team had argued for his release, citing ongoing threats of violence at the notorious facility and submitting a letter of support from one of the victims in the trial.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that the stock market's strong rebound on Monday was driven by the impressive earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" technology companies. After a downturn late last week fueled by a weak labor report, the major indexes surged, with Cramer attributing the resilience to the financial strength of Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla. He highlighted flawless performance from Microsoft and strong results across Alphabet's divisions, suggesting these cash-rich, diversified tech giants are fundamentally sound. This performance has seemingly overshadowed broader economic concerns, such as potential Federal Reserve actions or political turmoil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New, stricter gun licensing laws have taken effect in the United Kingdom, bringing a sense of hope to campaigners like Emma Ambler, whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered in 2020 with a legally held weapon. The updated regulations require two character references for shotgun certificate applications and mandate that police investigate domestic abuse signs and an applicant's history of dishonesty. These changes were prompted by several high-profile shootings and are intended to prevent unsuitable individuals from accessing firearms. Ambler has been a prominent advocate for these reforms, stating the changes represent a meaningful step towards preventing similar tragedies.</p>

          <p>A newly formed company that hired Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump as advisers quickly revised a public filing after it appeared to state an intention to seek federal government funds. The company, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called New America Acquisition 1 Corp., initially filed a document saying its target acquisition should be positioned to benefit from federal grants and incentives. After an inquiry from the Associated Press about the potential conflict of interest, the line was removed from the filing, with a law firm calling it a clerical error. Critics argue the initial language revealed an intent to exploit public office for private gain.</p>

Bonta claimed a return of over $33,000 for every dollar spent, with the majority of savings coming from a successful lawsuit that blocked an attempt to freeze federal funding. The state has filed 37 lawsuits against the administration on issues ranging from healthcare and education funding to environmental regulations and voting rights. Governor Gavin Newsom affirmed his support, promising Bonta would have all necessary resources to continue the legal fights. (not investment advice)</p>

Hainan's government has released a plan to draw over 1.5 million domestic medical tourists annually by 2027, a significant increase from the current 400,000. The strategy also includes approving new medical products for the domestic market and introducing at least 40 innovative international drugs and devices each year. This push aims to capture a larger share of the lucrative medical tourism market as a key regional competitor loses a significant financial incentive.</p>

          <p>New guidance for the UK's National Health Service recommends that patients coming off obesity drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive structured support for at least a year to prevent weight regain. Health assessment body NICE issued the advice, warning that weight management is a long-term process and that patients often regain a significant portion of lost weight after stopping treatment. The guidance encourages a focus on building sustainable behavioral habits, self-monitoring, and utilizing support systems. An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK are on these weight loss jabs, which are prescribed alongside diet and exercise programs.</p>

The task force will focus on critical areas such as security, transportation, and visa processing for the global event. This initiative follows the passage of legislation that secured $1 billion in federal funding for the Games' security and planning.

          <p>Lawyers for an Arizona woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years are suing the federal government to stop her imminent deportation, arguing she is being illegally placed in expedited removal proceedings. The lawsuit claims that Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul is being denied her right to a hearing before an immigration judge, a protection typically afforded to long-term residents. Federal law allows for expedited removal for those in the U.S. for less than two years, but her lawyers say this case represents an unlawful expansion of that policy. The Department of Homeland Security contends Co Tupul has not provided documentation of her long-term residency to ICE.</p>
