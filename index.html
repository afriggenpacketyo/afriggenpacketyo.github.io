        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior Iranian official cautioned that any U.S. involvement in the ongoing conflict with Israel would escalate the situation into an "all-out war," as the exchange of missile strikes continues. Israeli forces targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting retaliatory missile launches from Iran towards Israeli cities. The conflict has resulted in a rising death toll and a mass exodus from Tehran, fueled by warnings from President Trump. The United States is considering direct military action, including potential strikes on Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment facility, though internal disagreements persist on the course of action. Optimism is low as the situation remains volatile with threats of further escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's 50+1 rule, in place since 1999, ensures club members retain control over their professional football clubs, preventing external investors from gaining complete control. The rule stipulates that the parent club must hold at least 50 percent plus one vote in its spun-off professional football company. While it protects fan culture and promotes equality, critics argue it puts German clubs at a financial disadvantage compared to clubs in other countries with greater investor involvement. Exceptions exist for clubs like Bayer Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg, which have received continuous support from companies for over 20 years.</p>

          <p>UK inflation remains at 3.4%, the highest in over a year, with food prices continuing to rise, particularly for chocolate, which saw a record increase of 17.7% due to bad weather and mismanagement in cocoa-producing regions. Some economists speculate that businesses are passing on increased employer National Insurance payments to customers. Rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices, with air fares falling by 5% between April and May. Chancellor Rachel Reeves maintains the government is investing in Britain's renewal, while shadow chancellor Mel Stride expresses concern about the impact on families.</p>

Vice President JD Vance has defended Trump's position, asserting that it focuses on using the American military to achieve American goals. Trump's earlier actions, such as withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, further demonstrate his commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>President Trump's foreign policy is characterized by a lack of consistent ideology, driven instead by a collection of impulses and instincts. His approach resembles an internationalized version of his real estate dealings, prioritizing U.S. interests and deals that personally benefit him. This absence of a grand strategy leads to volatile and contradictory policies, shifting between interventionism and isolationism based on immediate influences. The president's near-dictatorial power over foreign policy, combined with his lack of doctrine, creates chaos and undermines stability, particularly during times of geopolitical instability.</p>

          <p>The legality of Israel's attack on Iran is hotly debated, with arguments focusing on whether it constitutes self-defense under international law. Israel claims the attack was a preemptive measure against a potential nuclear threat, while legal analysts argue it was a "preventive" attack, lacking the imminence required for self-defense. Experts point to the IAEA's statements and U.S. intelligence suggesting Iran was not on the verge of producing a nuclear weapon. The debate also encompasses the laws of combat and the targeting of civilians, raising concerns about the erosion of international law.</p>

          <p>California is bracing for a dangerous wildfire season in 2025, exacerbated by sweeping changes at federal agencies like the U.S. Forest Service, NOAA, and FEMA. Budget cuts, layoffs, and restructuring at these agencies are weakening California's ability to prepare for and respond to wildfires. Experts warn that the combination of dry conditions, an early snowmelt, and reduced federal support puts the state at a significant disadvantage. President Trump has also ordered the expansion of resource mining and oil and gas drilling in national forests, further straining the Forest Service's capacity.</p>
