            <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealth Group CEO Brian Thompson, have requested a federal judge to block prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. The defense argues that pursuing the death penalty is a 'political stunt' by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who previously described the murder as a 'premeditated, cold-blooded assassination.' The case is ongoing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where Mangione faces murder and terrorism charges.</p>
