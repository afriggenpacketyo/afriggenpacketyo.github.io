        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams has been awarded â‚¬100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC regarding a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and online article. The article alleged that Adams sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, a claim Adams denies. The court found that the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith, and the jury sided with Adams after deliberating for nearly seven hours. Adams stated that the case was about holding the BBC accountable for upholding the ethos of the British state in Ireland, which he believes is out of sync with the Good Friday Agreement. The legal bill for the case is believed to be between â‚¬3-5 million, making it one of the most expensive cases the corporation has ever fought.</p>

          <p>Following accusations from US President Donald Trump that China violated a recent tariff truce, China has responded with its own accusations of US wrongdoing. Trump claimed China had "totally violated its agreement" to lower tit-for-tat tariffs, while US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated China had not been removing non-tariff barriers as agreed. China's response did not directly address the US claims but urged the US to "cease discriminatory restrictions against China." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that trade talks with China had become "a bit stalled" and that leaders of both countries may need to weigh in with each other. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is changing its approach to academic exchange with China, moving away from the open-door policy initiated in the 1970s. The Trump administration plans to revoke visas for Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in critical fields, citing concerns about espionage and technology theft. This policy shift contrasts with the welcoming environment experienced by Chinese students in the 1980s, when academic exchange was seen as a form of soft power diplomacy. The new measures are expected to significantly reduce the number of Chinese students on American university campuses.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers are advised to take proactive steps to manage their finances. Experts recommend paying down credit card debt, locking in high-yield savings rates, and improving credit scores. Switching to a zero-interest balance transfer credit card or consolidating high-interest credit cards with a lower-rate personal loan can help reduce debt. Moving money into a high-yield savings account can provide better returns before rates potentially decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

The research accuses Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of "ambivalence and inertia" regarding the issue, which costs broadcasters revenue and increases users' risk of cyber-crime. The Amazon Fire Stick is identified as a major enabler of piracy. While sports broadcasting is a big business, the increasing cost of rights deals leads to higher prices for fans, driving some to illegal streams.</p>
