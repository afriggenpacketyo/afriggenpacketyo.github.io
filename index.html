          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order, allowing the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to third countries without first giving them a chance to raise fears of torture, persecution, or death. This decision is a victory for the administration's immigration policies, which have faced setbacks in the courts. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented. The administration has approached countries like Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda about accepting migrants who are not their citizens, and has an arrangement with El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants it claims are gang members. The order allows the administration to proceed with deportations to third countries while legal proceedings continue, a move opposed by immigration lawyers who argue it violates due process. The article underscores the ongoing legal battles surrounding the Trump administration's immigration policies and their impact on migrants.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell sharply after Iran launched a missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, with no reported casualties, raising hopes of de-escalation in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil closed at $68.51 per barrel, a 7.22% decrease, while global benchmark Brent shed 7.18% to settle at $71.48. President Trump thanked Iran for giving early notice about the strike, which allowed for no lives to be lost, and called on the Islamic Republic to move toward peace. The market sell-off suggests investors believe the conflict will de-escalate, with some analysts suggesting Trump has successfully escalated to de-escalate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, which aim to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments by Â£5 billion a year by 2030. The MPs are concerned about the impact of the welfare reform bill on poverty levels, the lack of consultation, and the potential consequences on the jobs market and people's health. The amendment, if successful, would prevent the bill from progressing through Parliament, highlighting a potential rebellion against the government's welfare plans. The government has a working majority of 165, meaning 83 Labour MPs would need to oppose the bill to force a defeat.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court granted the Trump administration's request to stay a lower court injunction, allowing them to deport individuals to third countries without prior notice. The ruling permits the administration to proceed with deportations to countries that are not the migrants' country of origin. A lower court judge had previously ordered the administration to keep migrants in U.S. custody until they had the opportunity to conduct a "reasonable fear interview." The Supreme Court's decision comes amid ongoing legal challenges to Trump's immigration policies, with judges repeatedly ruling that the administration has violated due process.</p>

The article also raises concerns about potential Iranian retaliation against U.S. forces in the region and the possibility of terrorist attacks within the United States.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the Iranian nuclear ambitions had been "obliterated," while Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said it would "take some time" to assess the damage. Experts have expressed skepticism about the extent of the damage, noting that the underground facility at Fordo is built nearly 300 feet beneath the ground, within solid rock. The true extent of the damage cannot be ascertained until inspectors from the IAEA or members of the international community are allowed to access the sites.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly submitted an improved bid of more than Â£60m for Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo, following a rejected bid of Â£45m plus add-ons earlier in the month. Talks are expected to continue this week for the Cameroon forward, who would become the club's second signing of the summer. New Tottenham manager Thomas Frank was also interested in Mbeumo, along with other Champions League clubs. Brentford is expected to want at least the same fee as Wolves received for Matheus Cunha before agreeing to sell Mbeumo.</p>
