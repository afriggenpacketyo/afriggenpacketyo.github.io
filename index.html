          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal is strengthening as it nears the U.S. southeast coast, with forecasts predicting significant rainfall for the Carolinas. The National Hurricane Center has issued tropical storm warnings, highlighting the increasing risk of flash floods as the storm's rain bands move onshore. The storm is expected to make landfall in South Carolina before weakening over land. Authorities have also warned residents about the potential for isolated tornadoes and have advised drivers to avoid flooded roads.</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister is set to host a summit with counterparts from several neighboring countries to discuss tightening European migration rules. The meeting aims to build momentum for a stricter continental policy, focusing on combating people smuggling and improving the efficiency of deportations. This comes as the European Union works to fully implement its new common asylum system, known as GEAS, by 2026, amid ongoing debate among member states over its specific regulations.</p>

          <p>Alice Weidel, leader of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, has condemned a proposal from the Social Democrats to explore a potential ban on her party. This political pressure comes as the AfD is under heightened scrutiny from Germany's domestic intelligence service for what it cites as "confirmed right-wing extremist tendencies." In response to the growing criticism and in an effort to polish its public image, the AfD has recently passed a new internal code of conduct.</p>

The situation in Saxony is reported to be especially difficult, with around 700 emergency personnel deployed to contain the blaze. In the nearby state of Thuringia, another large fire has been brought under control after being described by authorities as the largest of its kind in the state in over three decades.</p>

          <p>The German city of Cologne is preparing for its annual Christopher Street Day (CSD) parade, one of Europe's largest Pride events, with an expected 60,000 participants and hundreds of thousands of spectators. The event commemorates the 1969 Stonewall riot and celebrates the LGBTQ+ community under the motto "For queer rights. Many. Together. Strong." This large-scale celebration of diversity stands in contrast to smaller Pride events in eastern Germany, which reportedly faced peaceful far-right counter-protests.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains belonging to seven people who were missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The facility, operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, was later found to have no local licenses for storing fireworks on the agricultural property where the blast occurred. The explosion and subsequent fires destroyed several structures, prompted evacuations, and are now the subject of a multi-agency investigation including federal authorities.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is grappling with a severe funding crisis, a problem made acute by the Trump administration's threat to drastically cut U.S. contributions. As the UN's largest donor, a significant reduction in U.S. funding could cripple essential humanitarian agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Programme. This financial threat occurs within a broader context of weakening multilateralism, as global conflicts increase and the international rules-based order faces unprecedented challenges from multiple member states.</p>

          <p>The UK's High Court has ruled that the security service, MI5, provided false evidence to the courts and conducted "deficient" internal inquiries regarding its handling of a violent, abusive neo-Nazi who was also a state agent. The case revolves around MI5's attempts to cover up its relationship with the informant and lying about its communications with a BBC journalist who was investigating the story. The court has now ordered a new, more robust investigation and may consider contempt of court proceedings against the individuals involved.</p>

          <p>Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has announced on his social media platform X that he is forming a new political party, named the "America Party." He positioned the party as a challenge to the established Republican and Democratic two-party system. This announcement comes weeks after a very public and dramatic falling out with U.S. President Donald Trump, for whom Musk had previously been a significant financial backer and advisor. It is not yet clear if the party has been formally registered.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom government has announced a £500 million initiative to establish "Best Start" family hubs in every local authority across England by 2026. These hubs are designed to provide a wide range of integrated support services for families, including midwifery care, parenting advice, youth clubs, and debt counseling. The plan aims to support an additional 500,000 children in the country's most disadvantaged areas, though the opposition has questioned how much of the policy is new versus a rebranding of existing services.</p>
