The crew successfully contained the device, and all 160 customers and six crew members deplaned without injury or arrests. Emergency personnel met the aircraft as a precautionary measure, with no impact on overall flight operations at Dulles International. The specific cause of the smoking device remains under investigation by authorities.</p>

This heat wave, particularly impacting the Pacific Northwest, poses risks due to warm overnight temperatures and fuels elevated fire weather concerns. Simultaneously, Tropical Storm Fernand has formed in the Atlantic, expected to strengthen but remain over open waters, while lingering effects from Hurricane Erin cause rough surf and rip currents on the East Coast.</p>

          <p>The governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut are challenging a Trump administration order that halted construction on the nearly complete Revolution Wind project, an offshore wind farm. The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited national security concerns and a directive from President Trump to re-examine existing wind energy leases. Critics, including Senator Chris Murphy, link the decision to alleged political favors for the oil industry, jeopardizing a project crucial for powering 350,000 homes and meeting state climate goals.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Tamil Nadu, India, in collaboration with the UK's Face Lab, have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old male skulls found at the Kondagai burial site. These reconstructions, revealing features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, offer new insights into early inhabitants and migration routes. The findings from the Keeladi archaeological site challenge existing narratives about Indian urban civilization, suggesting an independent ancient civilization in the south.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were denied parole after separate hearings, marking their first chance at freedom since their 1989 murder convictions. Lyle's hearing was disrupted by the unexpected public release of an audio recording from Erik's Thursday session, which prison officials confirmed was "erroneously" disclosed. This incident sparked anger among relatives and the brothers' attorney, who argued it compromised the fairness of the proceedings, turning a sensitive legal process into a public spectacle. Both brothers will be eligible for parole again in three years.</p>

These changes aim to "toughen up community punishments" and deter reoffending, as part of a wider strategy to address prison overcrowding by reducing custodial sentences for less serious crimes. The Ministry of Justice also plans to introduce more mandatory drug testing for offenders released from prison, with a focus on increasing supervision for dangerous individuals.</p>

          <p>Gaza City is officially gripped by famine, with nearly half a million people facing catastrophic hunger, as new Israeli strikes kill at least 33 people, including those sheltering in tents. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) declared the famine, urging an immediate, large-scale response, while Israel denounces the report as lies and prepares for a Gaza City offensive. Efforts for a ceasefire are on hold, with US President Trump expressing frustration over Hamas's stance on hostage releases, as the death toll in Gaza continues to mount.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies ace pitcher Zack Wheeler will be out for six to eight months after being diagnosed with venous thoracic outlet syndrome, requiring additional surgery. This diagnosis follows an earlier procedure to remove a blood clot from his upper right arm, threatening his availability for the start of the 2026 season. Wheeler, 35, was a leading candidate for the NL Cy Young Award, making this a significant blow to the team and his career. The surgery would entail a long recovery period.</p>

          <p>Multiple postal services across Europe, including Germany, France, and the UK, along with India's government, are suspending most package shipments to the United States. This action stems from a lack of clarity regarding new Trump administration tariffs, effective August 29, which eliminate the "de minimis" exemption for goods valued under $800 for all countries. Companies cite ambiguous policies and insufficient time to establish new logistics systems for duty collection, impacting small businesses and international trade. This widespread disruption highlights significant challenges in adapting to rapid changes in global trade policy, with many key questions remaining unresolved. (not investment advice)</p>
