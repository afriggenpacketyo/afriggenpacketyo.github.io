          <p>The Taliban's chief diplomat, Amir Khan Muttaqi, recently engaged in comprehensive discussions with US special envoy Adam Boehler and former envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. Topics included fostering bilateral relations, addressing issues concerning citizens, and exploring investment opportunities within Afghanistan. This significant meeting occurred shortly after the release of US citizen George Glezmann, who was detained by Taliban intelligence in late 2022. While the US government does not officially recognize the Taliban regime, President Trump has made the liberation of American detainees a key foreign policy objective. Future talks are expected to continue, focusing on citizens held in each other's countries, with at least one US citizen, Mahmood Habibi, reportedly still detained.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer reportedly questioned Lord Mandelson about his association with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US. The Prime Minister's office had vetted Mandelson, but new information, including supportive emails Mandelson sent to Epstein after his 2008 conviction, emerged recently, leading to Mandelson's sacking. Critics are now scrutinizing what Sir Keir knew and when, as Mandelson's answers to vetting questions are believed by some in No 10 to have been "economical with the truth." This political fallout highlights ongoing concerns about accountability in high-level appointments.</p>

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a non-binding resolution that backs a two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict, urging Israel to commit to a Palestinian state. The vote, 142-10 with the US among those against, came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the idea of a Palestinian state. Co-sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, the resolution condemns attacks by Hamas and Israel, also highlighting the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza due to the ongoing conflict. This initiative aims to open doors for peace, though Israel and the US view it as counterproductive and a "gift to Hamas."</p>

          <p>Chicago Sky general manager Jeff Pagliocca has confirmed that star player Angel Reese will remain with the team, despite a public late-season disagreement. Reese had been suspended and missed the final three games due to a back injury after stating she might "move in a different direction" if the team did not acquire better players, calling it a "nonnegotiable." Pagliocca indicated the team has "closed the chapter" on the incident, describing Reese as an "ascending young talent" and highlighting ongoing productive conversations. The Sky concluded the WNBA season tied for the worst record at 10-34, with Reese averaging 14.7 points and a league-high 12.6 rebounds.</p>

          <p>Nepal's leading political parties have collectively called for President Ram Chandra Poudel to reinstate the parliament, which he dissolved following deadly anti-corruption protests. Eight major parties, including the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, and Maoist Centre, assert that the dissolution was unconstitutional and violated judicial precedents. The parliament was dissolved at the recommendation of interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki, a move also demanded by the "Gen Z" protest movement that saw over 50 deaths. The parties argue that public demands, including new elections, should be addressed through a democratically elected institution, urging restraint and support for the upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>Illinois lawmakers and local officials are demanding a full investigation into the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during a traffic stop in a Chicago suburb. Democratic US House member Delia Ramirez and others condemned the incident as "inevitable violence" stemming from the Trump administration's anti-immigrant agenda, emphasizing that a traffic violation should not result in death. DHS claims Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and dragged an officer, while surveillance videos show agents breaking into his car. This event occurred amid increased ICE operations in Chicago, sparking outrage and calls for transparency and accountability from Governor JB Pritzker.</p>

          <p>Canada, the world number two side, demonstrated their Women's Rugby World Cup contender status by ruthlessly demolishing Australia 46-5, setting up a highly anticipated semi-final against holders New Zealand. The Canadian team, which notably crowdfunded its tournament preparations, was irresistible in the first half, crossing the try line five times. Their relentless tempo, combined with superb handling skills and hard-running forwards, proved too much for the Australian Wallaroos. Despite Australia's second-half efforts, Canada secured a commanding victory, with Fabiola Forteza adding a sixth try, solidifying their path to the semi-finals. The outcome reflects a strong performance from the Canadian side.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to NATO allies, stating the US would only impose "major" sanctions on Russia if all NATO nations agreed to do the same and cease buying Russian oil. He criticized NATO's commitment to winning the war as "far less than 100%" and called some members' oil purchases "shocking," weakening their negotiating position. Trump also urged NATO countries to impose 50-100% tariffs on China, believing these steps would quickly end the war in Ukraine.

While proponents see it as a crucial step to regulate fast-moving technology and encourage a "race to the top" in safety, some industry groups argue it could stifle innovation with expensive compliance.

Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer ruled that the attorney general lacked the authority to bring the RICO case, as district attorneys had declined to prosecute, and no special permission from the governor was obtained. This decision, nearly three years after arrests, invalidates most of the indictment and highlights prosecutorial overreach and procedural negligence.

Small explains that thin lip skin is susceptible to sun damage and irritation, warning that lip oils without SPF can magnify UV exposure, leading to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimates that over 250,000 residents have evacuated Gaza City for their safety, as the military intensifies attacks to defeat Hamas. Concurrently, Palestinian militias in Lebanon's largest refugee camps, Ain al-Hilweh and Beddawi, delivered significant quantities of weapons to the Lebanese army, supporting Beirut's push to disarm non-state groups. This development, confirmed by the Palestine Liberation Organization, comes amidst reports of 32 deaths in Gaza City due to IDF strikes on high-rise buildings allegedly used by Hamas. Separately, thousands protested in Berlin, demanding peace in Gaza and an end to arms exports to conflict zones.</p>

These initiatives aim to enhance reliability and attract more LNG traffic, which saw a 66% drop in 2024. While the dam is a long-term solution, costing $1.6 billion and requiring community relocation, the land bridge offers an earlier alternative.</p>

          <p>Fourteen workers at the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter in Billings, Montana, were hospitalized after a smoke cloud from two pounds of methamphetamine, incinerated by the FBI, filled the building. City officials reported that negative pressure likely drew the smoke inside, while a fan meant to reverse the pressure was unavailable. The incinerator, typically used for animal carcasses, is also used by law enforcement for drug disposal, a practice the shelter director claimed she was unaware of. The incident led to the evacuation of 75 animals and concerns about contamination, with symptoms lingering for some workers and the shelter's future uncertain.</p>
