            <p>Singapore's President dissolved parliament on Tuesday, setting the stage for a general election, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's first since taking office in May. Nomination Day is scheduled for April 23, followed by nine days of campaigning and a cooling-off day before the polling date, which will be announced later. The ruling People's Action Party is expected to face challenges for all 97 parliamentary seats, with voter concerns including the cost of living and unemployment. Singapore recently eased its monetary policy for the second time amidst concerns about potential zero growth this year.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off following President Trump's tariff announcements, causing yields on the 10-year Treasury to spike. This is unusual as during times of uncertainty investors generally tend to flock to the safety of U.S. debt. Speculation points to China and Japanese life insurers as potential sellers, with concerns about weaponizing Treasury holdings and reducing exposure to U.S. policy uncertainty, respectively. However, some analysts argue that selling Treasurys could negatively impact China's own investments and appreciate the yuan, which is the opposite of what Beijing is trying to do.

Chinese computer scientist Liu Shaoshan highlighted the intense competition and ethical pressures within the field, adding that practitioners also faced ethical pressures.

The funding will subsidize infrastructure, provide low-interest loans, and support training and research programs.

            <p>Oil giant BP is facing increased speculation as a potential takeover target following a strategic reset that involves cutting renewable spending and boosting investment in oil and gas. Potential suitors include Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron, with analysts questioning whether any will make a move. The strategic shift follows a period of underperformance, reigniting rumors of a merger with Shell, though antitrust concerns and Shell's capital discipline could pose challenges. BP's recent moves are seen as an attempt to attract investor interest and monetize non-core assets. (not investment advice)</p>

The amendment prioritizes children's rights to moral, physical, and spiritual development over other rights, including the right to assemble. Critics view this as another step towards authoritarianism by the Orbán government. The amendment also declares that the constitution recognizes only two sexes, male and female, providing a basis for denying the gender identities of transgender and intersex individuals.</p>

He has only made five starts in the Champions League this season, with seven appearances as a substitute, scoring three goals and adding two assists. It was at Anfield where he made his mark, coming on after 67 minutes to deliver a performance of remarkable maturity, capping it by being entrusted with the spot-kick that sent PSG through.</p>
