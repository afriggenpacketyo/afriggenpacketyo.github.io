          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs. The court found it unlikely that Congress intended to grant presidents unlimited tariff power, dealing a significant setback to a key economic policy. While the ruling does not strike down the tariffs immediately, allowing time for a Supreme Court appeal, it challenges the legal foundation of the administration's trade strategy. The administration argues the tariffs are vital for national revenue and warns their removal could be financially damaging. (not investment advice)</p>

The community is reportedly in shock, leaving tributes for Logan, whom his family described as a boy full of life with an infectious personality.

          <p>This article provides context on the major 6.0 magnitude earthquake that struck eastern Afghanistan, highlighting the significant challenges in rescue and reporting. The mountainous, hard-to-reach terrain, combined with damaged infrastructure and landslides, is severely hampering relief efforts. The political situation under the unrecognized Taliban government, along with the prior withdrawal of many aid agencies and journalists, further complicates the response and the flow of accurate information. The piece also notes the particular vulnerability of women and girls due to Taliban-imposed restrictions.</p>

          <p>The United States has reportedly suspended the issuance of most non-immigrant visas to holders of Palestinian Authority passports, effectively creating a blanket ban. This move, detailed in a diplomatic cable, expands on previous restrictions and affects Palestinians seeking to travel for business, study, or medical care. The State Department cited compliance with U.S. law and national security but did not explicitly confirm the policy change. The decision follows the denial of visas to dozens of Palestinian officials and aligns with the Trump administration's staunch support for Israel.</p>

          <p>Amid significant leadership turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), President Trump has publicly called for pharmaceutical companies to justify the success of their COVID-19 drugs. In a social media post, he referenced the debate over their effectiveness and demanded answers, stating he has seen "extraordinary" information from Pfizer that has not been shared publicly. This comes as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls federal health agencies and the FDA limits new vaccine approvals to high-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the University of Exeter suggests that daily consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice may help lower blood pressure in older adults. The research found that the juice altered the oral microbiome, increasing helpful bacteria and reducing microbes linked to inflammation. Nitrates are converted by the body into nitric oxide, which helps dilate blood vessels and improve vascular health. While researchers note more study is needed, the findings support the established belief that a diet rich in vegetables can help manage chronic health conditions.</p>

Founded by music students in 1980, the DKB operates with a grassroots structure where all musicians have a say in artistic and operational decisions. This collaborative approach, combined with their financial independence and the artistic direction of conductor Paavo Järvi, is credited for their success. The film parallels the orchestra's pursuit of freedom with composer Joseph Haydn's own journey as a freelance artist.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-owned mining company, Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, is being accused of covering up the true scale of a toxic spill that polluted a major Zambian river with cyanide and arsenic. An environmental cleanup firm hired by the company claims the spill released 1.5 million tons of toxic material, at least 30 times more than admitted. The firm alleges its contract was terminated just before it could submit its final report. The Kafue River, a vital water source for over half of Zambia's population, suffered significant contamination, leading to fish kills.</p>

          <p>Kenyan authorities fear that a starvation cult responsible for over 400 deaths may still be active, as dozens of new graves have been discovered near the original site. Police believe some followers of Pastor Paul Mackenzie Nthenge escaped a 2023 crackdown and regrouped nearby, continuing the sect's practices. Mackenzie, who allegedly encouraged followers to starve themselves to death to meet Jesus, is currently on trial for murder. The new discoveries raise serious questions about the effectiveness of the initial police investigation into the horrific case.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Taipei, U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, referred to Taiwan as a "free country" with the "right to remain free," prompting a strong rebuke from China. Wicker and Senator Deb Fischer met with Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te, reaffirming U.S. friendship and commitment to the island's self-determination. China's Foreign Ministry condemned the visit and remarks as a serious violation of the "one-China" principle, which the U.S. officially acknowledges. The visit highlights the delicate diplomatic balance the U.S. maintains between its support for Taiwan and its relationship with Beijing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has defended his administration's decision to issue 600,000 student visas to Chinese nationals, pushing back against criticism from some of his staunchest supporters. Arguing that it would be "insulting" to ban them, Trump stated the move benefits U.S. universities and helps maintain a good relationship with China. This marks a reversal from his administration's previously hardline stance and has drawn anger from allies in the Maga wing of his party, who view the students as potential security risks and competitors for university spots.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has approved a development strategy until 2035 aimed at fostering a multipolar world order, according to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has announced an ambitious plan to make Albania a completely cashless society by 2030, but experts are skeptical. Critics point to the country's large informal economy, particularly in agriculture, and the population's strong preference for cash transactions. Cybersecurity experts also warn the plan is "dangerous," citing Albania's vulnerability to major cyberattacks and the lack of robust digital infrastructure. They argue that eliminating cash without adequate safeguards could paralyze the economy and harm small businesses that are not equipped for a fully digital transition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Extortion by organized crime syndicates has become a systemic threat to Cape Town's economy, suffocating sectors like nightlife, construction, and transportation. Business owners, particularly foreign nationals, are forced to pay "protection fees" under the threat of violence, while major infrastructure projects have been halted due to racketeering. Despite some high-profile arrests, law enforcement struggles to combat the problem, with few convictions and victims often too fearful to cooperate. The situation is part of a broader "pandemic of organized crime" affecting South Africa.</p>

In an interview, she said the plans have the backing of President Trump, who has reportedly assured allies of an "American presence" to support the peacekeeping efforts. This development comes as Ukraine continues to seek robust international security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression as a condition for any potential peace agreement.

          <p>Financial coach and self-made millionaire Bernadette Joy advises that prospective homebuyers should only purchase a home if they can afford the payments on a 15-year mortgage. She argues that with a 30-year mortgage, homeowners build very little equity in the initial years, with most of the payment going toward interest. Joy also cautions renters to account for the numerous hidden costs of homeownership, such as maintenance, furnishing, and higher utilities, before deciding they can afford to buy. If total living expenses exceed 50% of income, she suggests the purchase is not financially sound. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump's statement was made while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China, where he made public shows of solidarity with Chinese and Russian leaders, creating a complex geopolitical picture.
