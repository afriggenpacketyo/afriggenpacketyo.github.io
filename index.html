It highlights the market's negative reaction to Trump's tariff announcements, leading to increased interest rates and business uncertainty. The author points out the irony of Trump's earlier calls for a debt ceiling default when Biden was in office, contrasting it with his later support for eliminating the debt ceiling altogether.

            <p>The article criticizes President Trump's seemingly detached response to economic turmoil caused by his tariff policies. It contrasts his actions, such as golfing and attending fundraising dinners, with the anxieties of ordinary people. The author draws comparisons to historical figures like Nero and Marie Antoinette, suggesting that Trump is out of touch with the struggles of average Americans. The article highlights the volatility and lack of clear strategy in Trump's governance style.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is using Project Esther, a plan from the Heritage Foundation, to deport protesters who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The administration is calling those protesters, without evidence, “Hamas supporters.” Project Esther calls for the administration to rebrand pro-Palestinian supporters as Hamas supporters. It suggests public firings of pro-Palestinian professors and the deportation of student visa and green-card holders who have spoken critically of Israel, and advocates using anti-racketeering laws to break up pro-Palestinian groups.</p>

            <p>An immigration judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student activist, can be deported from the US. Khalil, a postgraduate student at Columbia University, has been a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests. The Trump administration argues that his participation in demonstrations and his views are antisemitic and "pro-Hamas." The judge stated that the government had the right to deport him due to "potentially serious foreign policy consequences."</p>

            <p>The article explores the potential of Stephen A. Smith, a prominent sports media personality, to run for president. It draws parallels to Franklin D. Roosevelt's use of mass media to connect with the public during the Great Depression and questions whether Smith's celebrity and media presence can translate into political success. The author emphasizes the importance of having clear policy solutions and the ability to govern, rather than relying solely on personality and campaign slogans.

            <p>The Supreme Court has issued rulings stating that migrants have the right to a hearing before they are deported, putting a check on President Trump’s power to arrest and quickly deport alleged gang members. The court emphasized that individuals facing deportation are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. However, the rulings leave many questions unanswered, including how the administration will comply and whether judges can block deportations, raising concerns about the long-term impact.</p>

            <p>Experts argue that tuberculosis (TB) could be eradicated with increased public health funding, but cuts to programs are hindering progress. A recent TB Hill Day saw advocates lobbying Congress for more resources. While there's an effective cure for TB, it persists as a disease of poverty, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. Public health cuts are projected to increase TB cases, but celebrity advocates like John Green are working to raise awareness and lower drug prices.</p>

The scientists genetically engineered gray wolves with traits resembling dire wolves, using ancient DNA. While acknowledging the scientific advancements, experts find the term 'de-extinct' misleading. Colossal defends their work, citing a definition of de-extinction that focuses on creating a functional proxy of an extinct species, and highlighting their related efforts to protect endangered species.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the concerns of U.S. farmers regarding China's imposition of steep tariffs on U.S. exports. Farmers are worried about the increased cost of farm supplies and the risk of retaliation against exports of U.S. crops. While the White House is considering ways to help farmers, previous aid packages were only a short-term fix and didn't address the longer-term damage. The article highlights the impact on soybean exports, where China has shifted to purchasing from Brazil, and the potential for market distortions caused by government aid.</p>

            <p>A three-year legal battle over the death of Charles Givens, an inmate with mental disabilities, concluded with a jury finding no liability for five former corrections officers. Givens' sister sued, alleging the officers beat him to death, but the defense argued he died from a seizure-induced fall. The case highlighted broader concerns about conditions at the Marion Correctional Treatment Center, including multiple hypothermia cases. Despite the verdict, the lawsuit led to some changes at the facility, including the installation of cameras in the shower room.</p>
