          <p>Apple has approved Spotify's U.S. app update, enabling users to access pricing information and make purchases through various payment options within the app. This approval follows a U.S. federal judge's order for Apple to cease imposing commissions on purchases made via web links inside iPhone apps. Spotify's spokesperson Jeanne Moran stated that this milestone will allow the company to freely display clear pricing information and purchase links. The update permits users to buy subscriptions, upgrade plans, and use payment methods other than Apple's system, marking a significant win for developers seeking a level playing field.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's tariffs are expected to significantly impact American families and parents, leading to increased costs for numerous household goods. Analyses estimate that these tariffs could cost the average American household between $4,900 and $7,700 annually. The Consumer Brands Association warns that food product costs will likely rise due to the need to import certain ingredients not available in the U.S., while the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association has urged tariff exclusions for critical safety products for children. Baby formula and diapers are also not exempt from the new tariffs so far, raising concerns about the affordability of these essential items.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year outlines $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, as announced by the White House. The proposed cuts would affect various departments, including Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency. However, the budget also calls for a 13% increase in defense spending, bringing it to $1.01 trillion, and allocates $175 billion towards the southern border. Budget proposals are essentially wish-lists for the administration, serving as a starting point for negotiations with Congress and illustrating the president's priorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite worries over the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, the U.S. labor market demonstrated resilience in April, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 177,000. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.2%, and a broader measure of unemployment edged lower, indicating a relatively stable labor market. The report led traders to push out expectations for an interest rate cut, and sectors like health care and transportation showed significant job creation. While the federal government reported job losses, analysts suggest it is too early for the report to reflect the impacts of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The recent Canadian federal election saw a substantial shift in the political landscape, with 17% of seats changing hands, up from just 7% in 2021. Notably, leaders from three of the five parties represented in the House of Commons failed to win their seats. The New Democratic Party (NDP) suffered significant losses, potentially impacting their parliamentary funding and influence, while the Liberal Party experienced a dramatic turnaround. All 59 seats that flipped went to either the Liberals or Conservatives, reflecting a wider shift away from Canada's smaller parties.</p>

Defensive giants in healthcare, energy, and consumer staples, supported by high dividend yields, have fueled the rally. Analysts suggest the FTSE 100 could continue its upward momentum, potentially reaching 8,900 points by the end of next month, but caution against risks from geopolitical hotspots and a firmer pound.</p>

Top fixed annuities currently offer rates between 5.25% and 6.80%, but rates vary depending on the insurer, contract length, and product type. For immediate annuities, retirees in their mid-60s to mid-80s can secure payout rates between 6.5% and 10.5%. Experts advise considering one's timeline, comparing multiple insurers, evaluating fees and riders, understanding the surrender period, factoring in inflation, and aligning with an overall retirement plan.
