        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly reported strong first-quarter earnings and revenue, driven by soaring demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro, with revenues up 45%. Mounjaro brought in $3.84 billion, up 113%, and Zepbound booked $2.31 billion, more than quadrupling its previous year's sales. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to a $1.57 billion charge related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks noted investments in U.S. manufacturing in response to potential tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England is holding local elections which are the first major test since Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party victory last year. Nigel Farageâ€™s right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., aims to capitalize on voter frustration with the flatlining economy and the struggling Conservative Party. Voters will elect over 1,600 council members and six regional mayors, with a special election also occurring to replace a Labour lawmaker who resigned after punching a voter. The results are expected to reveal the extent of Reform U.K.'s impact and whether they can translate poll surges into actual votes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are options for homeowners to borrow against their home's equity, offering lower rates than credit cards or personal loans. HELOCs may be easier to qualify for due to rates based on the prime rate plus a margin, and potentially more flexible debt-to-income requirements. While HELOC rates have dropped more sharply than home equity loan rates, the best option depends on the borrower's needs, such as flexible withdrawals for phased projects or predictable payments for debt consolidation. Borrowers should understand the terms and risks of each product before applying, as the home serves as collateral.</p>

The lawsuit alleged that IRS agents Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler targeted and sought to embarrass Biden by revealing information about his tax investigation. Shapley and Ziegler testified before the House Oversight Committee about facing limitations during the investigation. Biden was later granted a sweeping pardon by his father, President Joe Biden, granting him clemency from all crimes he "has committed or may have committed" over the past decade.</p>

          <p>A spring heatwave in the UK is expected to significantly impact plant life, with potential negative effects on indoor plants due to increased temperatures and direct sunlight.

Outdoor plants require more water, particularly newly planted ones, to encourage deep root systems. Trees face a "worrying" situation due to leaf expansion demands coupled with soil moisture deficits, potentially hampering photosynthesis and increasing vulnerability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that his tariffs could lead to fewer and more expensive products in the U.S., suggesting children might have two dolls instead of 30. He blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for economic setbacks after a report showed the U.S. economy shrank during the first three months of the year. Trump insisted China would suffer more from his trade war and that companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers.

          <p>With pronatalist policies gaining traction, it is important to consider whether they benefit children. While policies like giving money to parents can improve financial stability and allow for longer parental leave, other proposals, such as medals for large families, are unlikely to have a significant impact. A world with more children could foster greater tolerance and child-friendly environments, but pronatalism can also reinforce patriarchal values. Ultimately, policies that ensure children's access to food, housing, health care, and education are the most pro-child.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) chief Kazuo Ueda stated the central bank will continue to pursue additional interest rate hikes, despite economic uncertainty stemming from U.S. tariffs, which have prompted a reduction in growth and inflation outlooks. While the BOJ expects to stably achieve its 2 percent inflation target in the latter half of the three years through March 2028, a year later than previously forecast, Ueda noted a potential shift in U.S. trade policy could accelerate the next rate hike. The BOJ maintained its short-term policy interest rate at around 0.5 percent.</p>

          <p>Howmet Aerospace has increased its 2025 profit forecast due to robust demand for its aircraft parts, projecting adjusted profit per share between $3.36 and $3.44. The updated outlook includes considerations for tariff impacts. Howmet, which supplies parts to Boeing and Airbus, had previously warned customers about potential shipment halts due to tariffs. The company is prioritizing long-term deals and sees increased demand following a fire at a competitor's parts factory. It reported a first-quarter revenue of $1.94 billion, up 6.4% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>A 10-foot great white shark stranded in shallow water off the coast of Ardrossan, South Australia, was rescued by three local men and an 11-year-old boy. The rescuers used crab rakes to move the shark into deeper water after an hour-long effort. Wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta noted that shark strandings are becoming more visible through social media, and suggested contacting environmental authorities in such situations. Shark attacks in Australia are rare, though there have been recent incidents.</p>

U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent stated the partnership would accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery and facilitate the end of the war.

          <p>Donald Trump's second term is characterized by a high number of errors and blunders, leading to what is being called "rule by error". Examples include the mistaken deportation of an Salvadorian man despite a deportation protection order, and an email sent to Ukrainian refugees telling them to self-deport. The administration has also faced criticism for using incorrect calculations in determining tariff policy. These errors have contributed to Trump's low job approval rating.</p>

          <p>As federal research funding declines under the Trump administration, some private companies are looking to fill the gaps, particularly in areas like women's health. However, experts caution that private efforts cannot replicate the breadth and depth of federal funding, which has been crucial for drug discovery and addressing public health issues. The NIH has faced budget cuts and staff reductions, leading to concerns about the future of scientific research.
