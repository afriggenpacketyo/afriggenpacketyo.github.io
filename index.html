          <p>President Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs on imports, claiming this action will reduce U.S. dependence on foreign goods and boost domestic manufacturing.  However, experts warn of potential economic risks, including a possible recession and increased consumer prices.  The move comes amidst weeks of market turmoil and despite polls showing declining public approval of Trump's economic policies. This protectionist approach has already strained relationships with key allies like Canada and Mexico.</p>

Experts suggest businesses are adopting a cautious "wait-and-see" approach, minimizing imports until trade policies stabilize. This data suggests potential negative impacts on the U.S. economy.</p>
