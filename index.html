          <h2>Federal Reserve Maintains Steady Interest Rates Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 18:34:39 EDT</div>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates unchanged for the third consecutive meeting, acknowledging increased uncertainty due to President Trump's tariffs, which could potentially lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's cautious approach, stating that they are prepared to respond to economic developments but are not in a hurry to lower rates, as they need more data to assess the impact of the tariffs. Powell also noted the possibility of the Fed's dual mandate facing conflicting pressures if inflation and unemployment rise simultaneously, requiring a challenging judgment on which economic issue to prioritize. This decision reflects the Fed's struggle to balance maintaining a healthy labor market and keeping inflation low amid volatile economic policies.</p>

          <p>AppLovin's stock experienced a significant increase after the company announced better-than-expected earnings and revenue, along with the sale of its mobile gaming division to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash and a 20% ownership stake. The company's first-quarter net income rose substantially compared to the previous year, although it anticipates lower-than-expected sales for the second quarter. This strategic move allows AppLovin to focus on its core advertising technology business, while also gaining a stake in Tripledot Studios, which specializes in mobile games.

          <p>Following weeks of escalating tensions after a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India conducted strikes against Pakistan, leading to a military response from Pakistan. Both sides are now assessing the damage and casualties, with each claiming a form of victory. India asserts its strikes targeted terrorist groups and were limited in scope, while Pakistan claims to have downed Indian aircraft. Diplomats and analysts hope this exchange can serve as a de-escalation point, though the possibility of further conflict remains open depending on whether both sides feel they have adequately responded to public anger.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas experienced its wettest May on record after a rare storm system brought consecutive days of rain, leading to flash flooding and a tragic incident where a man was swept away by floodwaters in Henderson. The unusual weather pattern, caused by a low-pressure system interacting with Pacific moisture, resulted in significant rainfall for the arid region, surpassing previous records. While flooding occurred on the Las Vegas Strip and surrounding areas, a search is underway for the missing man in Henderson. Scientists note that climate change is likely intensifying extreme weather events in Nevada, contributing to longer dry periods punctuated by intense storms.</p>

The action comes amidst heightened tensions and scrutiny of Columbia's handling of pro-Palestinian protests, with the Trump administration previously cutting federal funding due to concerns over the protection of Jewish students. The group Columbia University Apartheid Divest claimed responsibility, stating that the occupation was in protest of the University's funding and profits from imperialist violence.</p>

          <p>As tariffs increase under President Trump's trade policies, businesses are faced with the challenge of deciding whether and how to pass the costs onto consumers, and how to communicate the price hikes. Some companies are opting for transparency by explicitly stating the tariff surcharges, while others are using vague language to avoid political backlash. Meanwhile, some are offering "pre-tariff" sales to capitalize on consumer urgency, as the trade war continues to create uncertainty and force businesses to adapt their pricing and marketing strategies.</p>
