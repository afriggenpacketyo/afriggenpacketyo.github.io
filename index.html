The woman was able to call 911 for help and was transported to a local hospital. Officials from the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) believe the attack involved a mother bear, as a cub was found in a nearby tree. Efforts to track and capture the bear are currently underway, with the intention of euthanizing it for assessment.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell has described improving the nation's weather warning systems as a "national responsibility." The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is pushing for a major investment to upgrade forecasting infrastructure, including Doppler radar and data analytics. Cantwell argued that such federal investments are crucial for providing more advanced warnings for events like floods, tornadoes, and fires, ultimately saving lives and resources. She stressed that local communities depend on a robust, national system for accurate and timely information.</p>

This comes as top officials escalate criticism of Powell, particularly over a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters, raising concerns about the central bank's independence.

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," has become a prominent and combative defender of the administration's mass deportation policies. During a recent speech, he aggressively confronted a heckler, and in a subsequent interview, he walked back comments that appeared to confirm racial profiling by ICE agents. Homan also admitted that U.S. citizens have been caught up in raids as "collateral arrests." His increased public profile comes as the administration ramps up its immigration enforcement actions across the country.</p>

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the delay provides a window for negotiations until the new U.S. deadline.
