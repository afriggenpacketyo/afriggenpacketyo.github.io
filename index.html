          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has become the leading candidate to be the next Fed Chair, according to prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket. His odds surged after reports that President Trump's advisers favor his policy approach, which is open to adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts. Waller, a Trump appointee, has recently expressed a more dovish stance, dissenting from the Fed's decision to hold rates and calling the approach "overly cautious." His rise surpasses previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, who have also advocated for lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials point to progress on immigration, the economy, foreign policy, and artificial intelligence as key successes.

The administration also emphasized its efforts to advance AI development and uncover details surrounding the 2016 Trump-Russia probe, framing these actions as part of a continued "America First" agenda.</p>

Huckabee also commented on the breakdown of ceasefire negotiations, blaming Hamas's lack of seriousness, and addressed concerns over humanitarian aid and the deaths of American citizens in the West Bank, promising thorough investigations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is becoming more crypto-friendly, with President Trump planning an executive order to broaden the availability of digital assets in retirement plans. This has fueled interest in cryptocurrency ETFs, like those for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which offer investors exposure without directly holding the assets. While some advisors advocate for significant crypto allocation in portfolios, others remain cautious about the inherent volatility and risks. The article distinguishes between standard crypto ETFs, suitable for long-term holds, and high-risk leveraged funds designed for short-term trading, advising investors to understand the difference.

          <p>A group of Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, has formally asked Google and YouTube about their settlement discussions with President Trump. They are concerned that the tech giant might be negotiating a "quid-pro-quo" arrangement to settle a censorship lawsuit filed by Trump in exchange for favorable regulatory treatment. The letter highlights that Google faces multiple federal antitrust and labor lawsuits and could benefit from positive outcomes under the Trump administration. This inquiry follows reports of "productive discussions" between Trump's lawyers and YouTube, a Google subsidiary.</p>

However, after imposing a lower 25% tariff on India with a 21-day delay, oil prices fell, suggesting the market believes Trump will ultimately back down to avoid a significant spike in global energy prices that would undermine his domestic policy goals.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its forecast for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, slightly lowering its storm prediction but still anticipating above-normal activity. The agency now projects a 50% chance of an unusually active season, with 13 to 18 named storms, of which five to nine could become hurricanes. This adjustment considers factors like neutral El Niño conditions, warmer ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear. Officials urge communities in storm-prone areas to remain prepared, as the peak of the season typically occurs from mid-August to mid-October.</p>

The announcement, made alongside President Trump, has temporarily shifted Wall Street's focus away from the company's perceived lag in artificial intelligence strategy. As part of the investment, Apple will spend $2.5 billion to expand its partnership with Corning, which will now produce all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches domestically.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, citing concerns over his alleged "highly conflicted" ties to China. The demand appears to stem from Tan's investments in Chinese companies, some of which are reportedly linked to the Chinese military, and his previous role at a firm that violated U.S. export controls. This unusual presidential intervention caused Intel's shares to fall and comes as the company, a recipient of U.S. government subsidies, has been scaling back some domestic investment plans. The White House defended the move as necessary for national security.</p>

The author argues that being rude or even witnessing rudeness can increase anger and depression, while practicing courtesy—even towards AI bots—can boost personal happiness. The piece suggests that individuals can counteract this negative trend by making politeness a conscious habit, renouncing sarcasm and snark, and responding to incivility with dignity.

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet is meeting to discuss future military plans for the Gaza Strip, amid media reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may seek approval to occupy parts of the territory not yet under Israeli control. The potential for a full occupation has been met with opposition from the families of hostages still held in Gaza, who fear it would endanger the captives' lives. The meeting comes as the World Health Organization reports record levels of acute malnutrition among young children in Gaza, and as President Trump urged more nations to join the Abraham Accords to ensure regional peace.</p>

          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force successfully executed a high-risk medical evacuation of three people from McMurdo Station, an American research base in Antarctica. The nearly 20-hour mission was conducted in perilous conditions, including sub-zero temperatures and 24-hour winter darkness. A C-130J Hercules crew used night vision goggles to land on a manually prepared ice runway to retrieve one person requiring urgent care and two others needing assistance. U.S. officials praised the mission as "nothing short of heroic," highlighting the extraordinary skill and courage required for such an operation.</p>

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is set to decide on the controversial project, which has faced opposition over espionage and security risks due to its proximity to London's financial district. The proposed 20,000-square-meter complex near the Tower of London would be Europe's largest embassy, but concerns from local residents and pro-democracy campaigners have complicated its approval process, which is now under direct government control.</p>

Companies like TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix, which have pledged billions for U.S. facilities, saw their stock prices rise on investor hopes they will avoid the duties. Trump has stated that companies "building in the United States" will be exempt from the charge.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to eliminate thousands of humanities grants was "unlawful" and violated the Constitution's separation of powers. The ruling allows a lawsuit, filed by Oregon Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils, to proceed. The grants, previously approved by Congress and distributed by the National Endowment for the Humanities, were abruptly terminated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The judge stated that the power of the purse belongs exclusively to Congress, not the President, in a significant victory for the plaintiffs.</p>

          <p>For the second consecutive week, attorney Alan Dershowitz was refused service at a farmers' market pierogi stand in Martha's Vineyard, escalating a local conflict that has drawn national attention. After Dershowitz threatened legal action and accused the vendor of antisemitism last week, he returned in what he called an effort to "restore community." The vendor, who identifies as Jewish, stood firm, stating their refusal was based on Dershowitz's representation of figures like Jeffrey Epstein. The confrontation ended with marketgoers chanting for Dershowitz to leave, highlighting deep social and political divisions in the exclusive enclave.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented new "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, with President Trump announcing that "billions of dollars" are now flowing into the country. The policy establishes a blanket 10% tariff rate for most countries, but significant exceptions and higher rates apply to others. For instance, Brazil and India face total tariffs of 50% due to specific U.S. objections, while Mexico and Canada are subject to pre-existing levies of 25% and 35%, respectively. Meanwhile, China is under a temporary truce with a 30% tariff rate, as some nations continue to negotiate for exemptions.</p>

          <p>This article explores why the belief in a secret "client list" detailing Jeffrey Epstein's powerful associates endures, even with no proof of its existence. The theory is fueled by the public's awareness of Epstein's vast network, the existence of his old address book, and President Trump's own vacillating statements on the matter. The author draws a parallel to the JFK assassination, where government secrecy and slow, selective information release have fed conspiracy theories for decades. The piece concludes that due to unresolved questions and a lack of full transparency, convincing the public that the list is not real is nearly impossible.</p>

While the planet's existence requires further confirmation, scientists speculate that it could host moons, much like the fictional Pandora from the film.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an overview of three key financial tools for retirees: Social Security, annuities, and reverse mortgages. It explains that while Social Security provides a foundational income, it is rarely sufficient on its own. Annuities can offer a guaranteed lifetime income stream, acting like a personal pension, which is ideal for those worried about outliving their savings. Reverse mortgages allow house-rich, cash-poor seniors to tap into their home equity without selling. The article concludes that the best strategy often involves blending these options to create a resilient and flexible retirement plan. (not investment advice)</p>
