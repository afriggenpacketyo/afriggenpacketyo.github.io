          <p>Devastating floods in central Nigeria have left thousands homeless and hungry, with survivors reporting slow aid delivery despite President Tinubu's assurances of swift relief. At least 200 people have died in Niger state, and hundreds are feared missing, with the worst-hit areas like Mokwa still awaiting federal government assistance. Residents express frustration over the lack of tangible results from a $10 million World Bank grant meant for flood prevention, as roads and bridges are impacted and fears of disease outbreaks grow. The article highlights the common occurrence of floods during Nigeria's rainy season, exacerbated by poor drainage and construction on waterways, and notes that the country suffered one of its worst disasters in decades in 2024, with flooding killing over 1,200 people. The slow response and lack of preparedness have fueled anger and desperation among those affected. The overall situation is dire, and the need for immediate and effective aid is critical.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to speak soon amid escalating tensions over trade, potentially derailing a tentative agreement reached weeks earlier.

The article notes that the Trump administration has accused China of slow-walking renewed exports of critical minerals, while Beijing has criticized Washington for issuing warnings against using Chinese chips.
