          <p>A 19-year-old, Joseph Kling, has been arrested and charged with aggravated arson and arson for allegedly starting the Jones Road Wildfire in New Jersey, which consumed at least 15,000 acres. Authorities determined the fire was caused by an improperly extinguished bonfire involving wooden pallets. The fire prompted mandatory evacuations and threatened numerous structures, although no homes were lost and no injuries were reported. Smoke from the wildfire is expected to impact air quality in New York City and Long Island, prompting an air quality advisory. This fire is a reminder of the dangers of unattended fires and the rapid spread of wildfires in dry conditions.</p>

          <p>Israel has developed a new medical discipline focused on receiving and treating returning hostages, learning from the experiences of those released after captivity in Gaza. A team from Israel's medical, military, and social welfare systems has been updating a manual to help hostages readjust to everyday life. Doctors have noted small victories, such as a hostage refusing medical tests as a sign of regaining control. The discipline addresses the unique needs of returning captives, ranging from infants to the elderly.</p>

          <p>Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund, warned that President Trump's policies to reshape the global economy could damage the economy and financial assets. They expect a policy-induced slowdown and a rising probability of a recession. The firm said the policy changes create exceptional risks to U.S. assets, which are dependent on foreign inflows. They also said that the combination of an economic slowdown and a shift away from the U.S. could unwind conventional investing wisdom.</p>
