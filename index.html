          <p>A federal judge has blocked the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who is charged with a hate crime and attempted murder for attacking a group demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado. The judge cited the urgency of the situation and the need to protect the family's constitutional rights, as they have not been charged in the attack. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the family's knowledge of the attack is under investigation, as Soliman claims no one knew of his plans. The attack injured 15 people and a dog, with Soliman admitting he was driven by a desire to kill "all Zionist people."</p>

          <p>The Department of Education has threatened Columbia University's accreditation, alleging violations of federal antidiscrimination laws and failure to address anti-Semitism on campus following the October 7th attack by Hamas. The department claims Columbia's leadership acted with indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students, potentially jeopardizing the university's eligibility for federal student loans and Pell Grants. Columbia has stated it is aware of the concerns and is working with the federal government to combat anti-Semitism, while the accreditation group confirmed receipt of the Education Department's letter. Last month, the department determined that Columbia had failed to protect Jewish students from severe harassment, denying them equal access to educational opportunities.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of President Donald Trump's tax-cut bill, asserting that it will lead America into "debt slavery" and urging lawmakers to reject it. Musk has been actively posting on X, calling for a new spending bill that doesn't significantly increase the deficit and raise the debt ceiling. This criticism follows Musk's recent departure from the Trump administration, where he temporarily led the Department of Government Efficiency. A source indicated that Musk's opposition stems partly from the bill's cuts to an electric vehicle tax credit that benefits Tesla. (not investment advice)</p>

These systems aim to transform warehouse robots into adaptable assistants, building on Amazon's previous AI initiatives, such as a web browser-based agent and the Alexa+ update.

          <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development is considering imposing time limits on federal rental subsidies and adding work requirements as a condition of funding, according to an internal document. This rule would vastly expand the number of local housing authorities that can impose such restrictions, bypassing Congress. While a HUD spokesperson did not confirm details, they referenced President Trump's budget proposal with a two-year time limit aimed at empowering families to achieve self-sufficiency.

This change, funded with Â£1 billion up to 2029, aims to save parents Â£500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. The government has also pledged Â£13 million to food charities to redistribute surplus food from farms, and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized that feeding more children for free is a major intervention to alleviate poverty and support children's education. While welcomed by the education sector, some argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child limit, would be more effective.</p>

The groups contend that the CPUC failed to consider all the benefits of solar panels and ensure continued expansion in disadvantaged communities. Lawyers from the Attorney General's office, siding with utilities, argued that credits given to panel owners were causing a "cost shift" to non-solar customers, raising electric bills. The justices are considering whether a state appeals court erred in deferring to the CPUC's expertise, with a decision expected within 90 days.</p>

Russia's competitive advantage in nitrogen-based fertilizer production, due to cheap gas, has led to calls from the European fertilizer sector to address the issue of "dumping" cheap fertilizer into the EU market.

          <p>Hundreds of arrests were made across 28 states in a coordinated effort to curb rising rates of organized retail theft, led by the Cook County Regional Organized Crime Taskforce. The initiative involved over 100 law enforcement agencies and more than 30 major retailers, including Target, Macy's, and Walgreens, who provided critical information. Organized retail crime involves coordinated theft operations, often reselling stolen goods for profit, with authorities noting the increasing sophistication and prevalence of this crime. The crackdown aims to deter such conduct by demonstrating that it is being prosecuted and taken seriously.</p>

          <p>Sean Penn and Dustin Lance Black, known for the Harvey Milk biopic *Milk*, have condemned the decision by US defense secretary Pete Hegseth to remove Harvey Milk's name from a navy ship. They view the move as an attempt to fuel culture wars and distract from important civil rights fights. The renaming, scheduled during Pride month, is reportedly intended to align with President Trump's objectives of reestablishing a "warrior culture." Black emphasized that Milk is a civil rights icon whose legacy will not be diminished by renaming a ship.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has proposed an innovative solution to President Trump's efforts to undermine civil service protections by neutralizing federal agencies. The Merit Systems Protection Board, which hears claims of civil servants being illegally fired, lacks a quorum due to Trump's actions. The Fourth Circuit's decision in National Association of Immigration Judges v. Owen suggests that if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role, courts should hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected, but its fate depends on a potential appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

El Fasher, one of the last areas controlled by the Sudanese army, has been under attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, with both sides blaming each other for the aid convoy attack. The conflict has displaced nearly 13 million people and created a severe humanitarian crisis, with the RSF and allied militias accused of committing atrocities against Black African ethnic groups.

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that required hospitals to provide abortions as stabilizing medical treatment in emergency situations. The 2022 guidance, issued after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v.

HHS and CMS rescinded the guidance, stating it "do[es] not reflect the policy of this Administration."
