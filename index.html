          <p>Raymond McCourt, a convicted murderer who escaped from HMP Castle Huntly, an open prison in Dundee, was captured by plain clothes officers on an Edinburgh bus. McCourt, who was originally jailed in 1993 for fatally shooting a newsagent, had been missing since Tuesday and was previously spotted in Glasgow. Police Scotland had issued a warning advising the public not to approach him, but he was apprehended without incident. The successful recapture of McCourt concludes a brief but tense period of uncertainty for authorities and the public. Optimism score: 80</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the UK saw their largest increase in nearly four years during the first quarter of the year, with sales volumes rising by 1.6% between January and March. This growth was largely driven by warmer weather in March, which boosted sales in garden centers, clothing stores, and DIY goods retailers. However, food sales volumes declined, particularly in supermarkets, and analysts warn that consumer confidence fell in April, suggesting potential weakening sales in the coming months. The figures provide a positive sign for retailers after a disappointing Christmas period. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>The Gran Abuelo, an approximately 5,400-year-old tree in Chile, is facing a threat from a proposed highway that would cut through a protected national park. Scientists warn that the road will increase the risk of wildfires and damage the fragile ecosystem. The tree, a Patagonian cypress, is not only ancient but also a valuable climate record-keeper. The scientific community has rallied against the project, leading the government to back off for now, but the future of the tree remains uncertain. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>Financial markets rose on Friday as investors reacted positively to potential signs of easing trade tensions between the United States and China. The optimism was fueled by reports that China was considering exempting some American goods from its 125 percent tariff. However, the Chinese government denied engaging in trade negotiations with Washington, contradicting President Trump's claims. Despite the conflicting messages, markets in Asia and Europe generally saw gains. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Japan's Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) has announced a plan to temporarily eliminate the consumption tax on food items for one year, ahead of the upcoming parliamentary election. This proposal aims to alleviate the burden on struggling households facing persistent inflation and potential impacts from higher U.S. tariffs. While Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has resisted changing the consumption tax rate, other parties are also considering tax cuts to appeal to voters. Consumption makes up a large portion of domestic demand, and the tax cut seeks to stimulate spending amid rising living costs. Optimism score: 60</p>

The 1960 treaty, which governs the sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin, has survived previous conflicts. Experts suggest that while it is nearly impossible for India to hold back large volumes of water during high-flow periods, Pakistan could face significant impacts during the dry season. India's actions have heightened tensions between the two countries, with Pakistan warning that any attempt to stop water flow would be considered an "Act of War". Optimism score: 35</p>
