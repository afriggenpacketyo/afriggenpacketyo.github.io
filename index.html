          <p>In a recent interview, Tucker Carlson and Senator Ted Cruz engaged in a heated debate regarding the U.S.'s approach to Iran, highlighting divisions among Trump's allies on foreign policy. Carlson questioned Cruz's support for potential Israeli strikes against Iran and challenged his knowledge of the country's demographics and political landscape. Cruz defended his stance by citing alleged Iranian assassination plots against Trump and Iran's nuclear ambitions. The exchange underscores broader disagreements within the Republican party regarding interventionist versus isolationist strategies in the Middle East. </p>

          <p>Senator Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has voiced strong concerns about the Trump administration's lack of communication regarding its plans for Iran. Warner stated that he has no understanding of the administration's foreign policy towards Iran, even after intelligence briefings. He suggested that the administration may be manipulating intelligence to justify potential military action, drawing parallels to the lead-up to the Iraq War. The senator also noted that many of his Republican colleagues are similarly uninformed about the administration's plans, raising further questions about transparency and strategy. </p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA reveals a significant link between addiction to social media, mobile phones, and video games among teenagers and a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The study, which followed over 4,000 kids from ages 9 to 10, found that by age 14, a substantial portion of the participants showed signs of addiction to these screens. Researchers assessed addiction through questionnaires and monitored how these addictive behaviors changed over time, finding that those with high or increasing addiction were more likely to report suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The study suggests that addressing screen addiction is crucial for improving adolescent mental health and reducing suicide risk. </p>

          <p>The Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report indicates that the program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034, one year earlier than previously estimated, potentially leading to a 19% cut in benefits. This shift is partly attributed to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees. Lawmakers are urged to take swift action to address the program's financial challenges, either by raising revenue or cutting benefits. The report also notes a record number of Americans filing for Social Security benefits this year, possibly driven by anxieties about the program's stability.  (not investment advice)</p>

FBI special agent Timothy Chan stated that Soliman's targets were those he considered Zionists, and that investigators found the number 1187 on clothing in his car, representing the year Israel was liberated by Muslims.

While these bombs could cause significant damage to facilities like the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, which processes uranium isotopes, the risk of widespread contamination is considered low. Due to the heavy nature of uranium hexafluoride gas, any contamination is likely to remain localized.
