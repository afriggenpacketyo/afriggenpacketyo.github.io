          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral against Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, a move in the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and the central bank. The new referral concerns alleged misrepresentations on a mortgage application for a third property made to the U.S. government. This action follows Cook's lawsuit against President Trump, in which she seeks to block her potential removal from the Federal Reserve board. The escalating dispute highlights the significant tension between the executive branch and the independent financial institution.</p>

          <p>A shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, killed two children and injured 18 others during a school Mass at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis before dying by suicide. The victims killed were 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski. Authorities report Westman, a former student at the attached school, was heavily armed and had an obsession with past mass shootings, though a specific motive remains under investigation. The attack is being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region demonstrated varied results, diverging from the positive trends seen on Wall Street as investors analyzed new regional economic data. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 experienced a decline after Tokyo's core consumer prices rose at a slower rate, though still above the central bank's target. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains, and mainland China's CSI 300 also rose slightly. The mixed trading activity reflects regional economic nuances and investor caution despite strong performance in U.S. markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The meeting occurs as both nations face economic pressures from U.S. tariffs, potentially pushing them towards cautious cooperation despite deep-seated mistrust stemming from border disputes and China's relationship with Pakistan. While experts do not foresee a lasting friendship, the talks signal a willingness to find common ground on issues like trade imbalances and supply chain dependencies. The outcome will indicate the future trajectory of the complex relationship between the two Asian powers.</p>

The company has agreed to recall its "sunshine/omega-3 golden yolk" eggs, which were distributed in California and Nevada between June and July.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers—Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, Jr.—who were convicted on federal charges related to the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. The decision was based on concerns of bias after the original presiding judge allegedly made prejudicial comments, suggesting the police department was infiltrated by gangs. The officers had been convicted of witness tampering but were acquitted of violating Nichols's civil rights causing his death. This ruling reopens a significant case that sparked nationwide protests against police brutality.</p>

The incident occurred during a period when federal officers were deployed to the city by President Trump to address crime.

Abrego Garcia, who was controversially deported and then returned to the U.S. to face charges of transporting undocumented migrants, has pleaded not guilty.

          <p>The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has used his executive authority to overrule a board-approved plan to display the Israeli flag on school campuses. The decision was made due to "heightened safety concerns" and potential risks to the school community. The initial 3-to-2 board vote to display the flag during Jewish American Heritage Month had been controversial, with supporters viewing it as a stand against antisemitism and critics arguing it was an inappropriate political statement in a public school setting. For now, only the U.S. and California state flags will be displayed on district campuses.</p>

          <p>A major Russian missile attack on Kyiv not only killed at least 23 people but also caused damage to the European Union's delegation office in the city, drawing sharp condemnation from European leaders. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed outrage, stating two missiles struck just 50 meters from the diplomatic mission. The attack, described as one of the largest on the capital this month, is being viewed by European officials as a deliberate escalation and a mockery of peace efforts. The strike has prompted the EU to prepare a new package of sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>South Carolina has filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to reinstate a state policy that prohibits transgender students from using bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity. The move comes after a federal appeals court blocked the policy, which threatens to withhold 25% of state funding from non-compliant school districts. The state argues that a previous circuit court ruling in favor of trans students is a "discredited outlier" in light of recent Supreme Court decisions. The case escalates a major legal battle over LGBTQ+ rights and could set a significant national precedent for transgender youth in schools.</p>

          <p>A new Texas law, SB 17, is set to take effect, restricting individuals and companies from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing or renting property for long-term leases. State officials defend the law as a necessary measure to protect national security, citing concerns over foreign adversaries acquiring land near critical infrastructure. However, opponents, including members of the Chinese-American community and civil rights groups, condemn the law as discriminatory and xenophobic, drawing parallels to historical exclusion acts. The legislation has created fear and uncertainty among visa-holders and business owners, who worry it will lead to unfair scrutiny and economic harm.</p>

Zhao suggested that Hong Kong's government has shown a positive attitude but must move quickly to implement favorable policies. One specific recommendation was to expand the limited range of cryptocurrencies currently permitted for trading on licensed exchanges in the city. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation by the BBC has uncovered allegations from Rohingya refugees who claim the Indian government forcibly deported them to war-torn Myanmar by sea. According to testimonies, a group of 40 refugees were taken from Delhi, flown to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, put on a naval vessel, and then forced into the Andaman Sea with life jackets, eventually reaching shore in Myanmar. The refugees, who are now in the care of a resistance group, describe being treated like "captives." The UN's special rapporteur says there is "significant evidence" supporting these claims, which raise serious human rights concerns about India's treatment of the persecuted minority group.</p>

According to officials and parents, older students in the school's "buddy system" immediately acted to push their younger partners under the pews when the gunfire began, often shielding them with their own bodies. One student reportedly took a shotgun blast to the back while covering another child. These heroic actions are credited with saving lives and preventing the tragedy from being even worse, highlighting the bravery of children in a moment of unimaginable terror.</p>

          <p>An angler in Lake Huron discovered an unusually large grass carp, an invasive species that poses a significant threat to the Great Lakes ecosystem. The fish measured over 1.2 meters long and weighed 26 kilograms, one of the largest specimens ever processed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Although this particular fish was sterile and unable to reproduce, the presence of grass carp is a major concern as they can consume up to 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, destroying habitats for native species. Officials are urging the public to report any sightings and not release the fish back into the water.</p>

In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney plays an aging, successful movie star grappling with his life choices and legacy, a role that draws parallels to his own public persona. The film also stars Adam Sandler, Laura Dern, and Billy Crudup. Early reviews are varied but highlight Clooney's subtle performance, which could place him in the upcoming awards season conversation for his portrayal of a character undertaking a psychological journey of self-reflection.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of 8,000 Americans suggests that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is a net negative for the brand's appeal. The poll found that 35% of consumers were less likely to buy a Tesla because of FSD, while only 14% said it made them more likely to purchase one. The results present a challenge for Tesla, as CEO Elon Musk has positioned the company's future on the success of its autonomous driving technology. The findings also indicate strong public support for stricter regulation of autonomous vehicles and highlight a potential market education and trust issue for the automaker.

The parliament's chief executive informed members of the decision to deactivate the pass "given the ongoing criminal investigation," effectively locking Smyth out of the building.</p>
