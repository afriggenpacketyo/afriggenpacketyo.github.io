          <p>Microsoft has announced it will lay off approximately 9,000 employees, which constitutes just under 4% of its global workforce. This move is part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and reduce managerial layers, following previous job cuts earlier in the year. The company stated the organizational changes are necessary to position itself for success in a dynamic marketplace. As of June 2024, the tech giant employed 228,000 people worldwide, and these cuts continue a trend of workforce reduction seen across the tech industry.</p>

          <p>Researchers have sequenced the first complete genome from Egypt's Old Kingdom, revealing the life and ancestry of a potter who lived between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago. The man's well-preserved remains, found buried in a ceramic pot, allowed scientists to determine he was about 64 years old, had brown hair and eyes, and stood 1.6 meters tall. Genetic analysis indicated his ancestry was 80% North African and 20% from the Fertile Crescent, providing direct evidence of population mixing during this critical period of Egyptian history.</p>

          <p>According to payroll firm ADP, private sector employment in the U.S. unexpectedly declined by 33,000 jobs in June, marking the first decrease since March 2023 and starkly missing economists' forecasts of a 100,000-job gain. The report cited a hesitancy to hire and replace departing workers as the primary cause for the contraction, with significant losses in professional services and health sectors. While the ADP report can differ from the official government jobs data, this surprising downturn suggests potential weaknesses in the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

The nearly 140-year-old company is undertaking this court-supervised sale as part of a restructuring agreement with its lenders, who have committed $912.5 million to fund operations during the process. The filing attributes the financial difficulties to declining consumer demand and a market shift away from preservative-laden canned foods toward healthier alternatives, which increased costs for surplus inventory.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man charged with the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, is expected to plead guilty in a deal that will spare him the death penalty. In exchange for pleading guilty to four counts of murder and one count of burglary, Kohberger will receive four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The plea deal, initiated by the defense, provides a resolution to the high-profile case, sparing the victims' families a lengthy and painful trial, though the families have expressed mixed reactions to the agreement.</p>

          <p>In a 4-3 decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court's liberal majority has struck down the state's 176-year-old abortion ban. The court ruled that the 1849 law, which was functionally dormant for decades under Roe v. Wade, was superseded by a more recent 1985 law that permits abortions until fetal viability. This ruling provides legal certainty for abortion providers in the state, who had resumed services after a lower court's similar finding in 2023 but faced the threat of the old ban being reinstated.</p>

          <p>Amid growing cybersecurity concerns and a desire to diversify supply chains, Germany is reportedly turning to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components, reducing its dependence on the dominant Chinese market. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, reflecting a broader European trend. While a complete decoupling from China is considered unrealistic, Germany is focused on sourcing critical, high-risk components like software and chips from "non-red" supply chains, an area where Taiwan's advanced tech sector offers a key advantage.</p>
