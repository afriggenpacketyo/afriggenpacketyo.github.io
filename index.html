          <p>A suspect was killed following a violent series of events in Lexington, Kentucky. The individual allegedly shot a state trooper before fleeing to the Richmond Road Baptist Church, where they opened fire and injured multiple worshippers. Law enforcement, including the Kentucky State Police and Lexington Police, responded and secured the suspect, who is now deceased. The injured trooper and victims from the church are receiving medical attention, and Governor Andy Beshear has called for prayers for all those affected by the violence.</p>

          <p>A serious incident occurred at London Southend Airport when a 12-meter aircraft crashed shortly before 4:00 PM BST. An eyewitness reported seeing the plane bank heavily and invert before hitting the ground, resulting in a "huge fireball." Emergency services, including police and fire crews, responded to the scene, and the public has been asked to avoid the area. The airport has confirmed the incident and cancelled at least four scheduled flights, stating more information will be provided as it becomes available.</p>

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are leading a bipartisan effort to pass a sanctions bill aimed at pressuring Russia to end its war in Ukraine. The legislation would grant the president authority to impose tariffs up to 500% on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's economy by purchasing its goods. Graham described the bill as a "sledgehammer" to cripple the funding of the Russian war machine. The move has gained momentum following President Trump's expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin and signals a potential turning point in U.S. policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A historic 1940s fortune cookie factory in Denver has been transformed into a unique, free-to-the-public art gallery by founder Amanda Precourt. After purchasing the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago, Precourt undertook an eight-year renovation to create a space for community connection and healing through art. The gallery, named the Cookie Factory, opened in May with a mission to promote mental wellness and foster dialogue. Its inaugural exhibition features nature-inspired work by artist Sam Falls and will run through September.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner won his first Wimbledon men's singles title, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a four-set match. The victory marked a significant moment for the world No. 1, who had previously lost five consecutive matches to his rival, including an epic five-set final at the French Open just weeks earlier. After Alcaraz took the first set, Sinner rallied to win the next three, breaking a 20-match winning streak for Alcaraz at the All England Club. This win gives the 22-year-old Italian his fourth overall Grand Slam title.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report released one year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, reveals significant security lapses by the U.S. Secret Service. The investigation found that the agency had denied or failed to fulfill at least 10 requests for additional resources, including counter-snipers and drone countermeasures, for Trump's 2024 campaign events. The report accuses then-Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials and points to a "cascade of errors" and communication failures. Six personnel have been suspended, but the report suggests accountability has been insufficient for the severity of the failures.</p>

          <h2>Trump to Meet NATO Chief Amid Plans to Sell Weapons for Ukraine</h2>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Washington this week, a meeting that coincides with discussions about a new U.S. strategy to arm Ukraine. The plan involves selling advanced weapons to NATO allies, who would then transfer their existing, compatible military hardware to Ukraine, accelerating the delivery of aid. This development comes as the administration signals a tougher stance on Russia, with a bipartisan sanctions bill also gaining support in Congress. The meeting and arms plan suggest a significant shift in the U.S. approach to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed ten people, including six children, who were waiting to collect water, according to emergency officials. The Israeli military has acknowledged the incident, stating that a "technical error" caused a munition targeting an Islamic Jihad militant to miss its mark by dozens of meters, and that it regrets any harm to civilians. The strike occurred in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp and has drawn further attention to the high civilian toll in the conflict. The International Committee of the Red Cross also reported a surge in weapon-related injuries at its field hospital.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th floods in Kerr County, Texas, were suspended due to a new flood threat. Heavy thunderstorms prompted a flash flood warning for the same area along the Guadalupe River that was devastated over a week ago. Officials ordered all search crews and volunteers to evacuate the river corridor as water levels began to rise again. The original flooding event resulted in at least 129 deaths statewide, and more than 160 people remain missing, with the ongoing severe weather complicating the massive search effort.</p>

          <p>A top White House economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, has affirmed that President Trump is serious about imposing new tariffs on Mexico, the European Union, and other nations if trade deals are not improved to his satisfaction. The statement reinforces the administration's hardline stance after Trump announced a 30% tariff on EU and Mexican goods starting August 1. European leaders, who had believed a deal was near, are now scrambling to find a solution before the deadline, with Germany's chancellor emphasizing intensive work to resolve the escalating trade dispute.

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett defended President Trump's proposed 50% tariff on Brazil, even when questioned about the fact that the U.S. maintains a trade surplus with the country.

He stated that an overall strategy is necessary to prevent transshipping and achieve the administration's objectives. The defense comes as the administration continues its aggressive global tariff policy, drawing concern from trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

This human-interest story highlights the difficult choices facing residents in flood-prone areas, where the emotional attachment to a home and community often outweighs the growing risks associated with more frequent and severe weather events, forcing them to weigh love against logic.</p>

The crash investigation report had raised questions about the engine fuel cutoff switches, noting that Air India had not performed inspections suggested in a non-mandatory 2018 FAA advisory. The FAA's new notification states it does not consider the issue an unsafe condition that would warrant a mandatory directive, aiming to quell concerns about the design across Boeing's fleet.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against a growing backlash from some of his own supporters, including prominent conservative figures. The criticism stems from frustration over a recent Justice Department memo on the Jeffrey Epstein case, which stated there was no evidence of a "client list" or blackmail of high-profile figures, contrary to widespread speculation. In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to "let Pam Bondi do her job," highlighting a rare public division between the president and factions of his base over a highly sensitive and conspiracy-laden topic.</p>

          <p>The conflict between FIFA and the global players' union, Fifpro, has intensified following a FIFA announcement supporting mandatory rest periods for players. While the commitment to a 72-hour gap between games and a three-week summer break was welcomed, union executives were reportedly left perplexed by the process, as key representatives from Fifpro and the PFA were not present at the meeting. The dispute is rooted in concerns over an expanded fixture calendar, including the new 32-team Club World Cup, which has led to a lawsuit accusing FIFA of prioritizing competitions over player welfare.</p>
