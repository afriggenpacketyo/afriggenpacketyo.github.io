        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government shutdown continues with no resolution, as top congressional leaders from both parties publicly blame each other for the ongoing stalemate. House Speaker Mike Johnson states that the House has passed a funding measure and that the responsibility now lies with the Senate. In response, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argues that Republicans are not negotiating in good faith, particularly on extending health insurance tax credits, and insists that a direct meeting with the president is necessary to end the impasse.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish is putting significant pressure on England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, for a spot in the national squad ahead of next summer's World Cup. Currently on loan at Everton, Grealish scored a dramatic 93rd-minute winner against Crystal Palace, continuing a run of excellent form that includes four assists in his first six league appearances. Despite being left out of the latest squad, his performances have drawn praise from figures like former England striker Wayne Rooney, who believes Grealish's talent will give the national team manager a selection "headache."</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou is facing intense scrutiny after failing to secure a win in his first seven games, leaving the club just one point above the relegation zone. Following a 2-0 defeat to Newcastle, Postecoglou acknowledged the team's struggles and stated he expects to discuss the situation with the club's owner. Despite the poor results and defensive vulnerabilities, the manager remains defiant, stating that he embraces the challenge and is confident in his ability to turn the team's fortunes around, pointing to the upcoming international break as a crucial period for training.</p>

          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, citing a need to address crime and protect federal assets. The decision follows an incident where federal immigration agents shot an armed woman after they were reportedly rammed by vehicles. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and other local leaders have condemned the move as an abuse of power intended to manufacture a crisis. This deployment is part of a broader, controversial strategy of sending federal forces to Democrat-led cities, raising constitutional questions about the domestic use of military personnel.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has identified the release of all hostages from Gaza as the most immediate and critical phase of the peace plan proposed by President Trump. As negotiators prepare for talks in Cairo, Rubio emphasized that discussions should focus on the logistics of a swift hostage return, stating that this step cannot be delayed. Hamas has reportedly agreed to the framework of releasing hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, which U.S. officials hope will pave the way for a broader agreement to establish a stable, terror-free Gaza.</p>

          <p>Sussex Police are investigating a suspected arson at a mosque in Peacehaven as a hate crime and have released images of two individuals they wish to identify. The fire, which occurred on a Saturday night, damaged the building's front entrance and a vehicle, though no one was injured. A volunteer reported that two people inside the mosque managed to escape after an accelerant was used to start the blaze. The incident has prompted an increased police presence and has been condemned by community leaders and the Home Secretary as an appalling attack.</p>

While some hostages have been returned via exchanges and key Hamas leaders have been killed, the group remains operational and many hostages are still captive. The war has created a severe humanitarian crisis, drawing international condemnation, genocide accusations, and ICC arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. Although regional adversaries like Hezbollah have been weakened, the conflict has deepened divisions within Israeli society and bolstered global support for Palestinian statehood.</p>

In a post on Truth Social, Trump questioned why the network would provide a platform for a Democrat to speak "unabated or challenged" on healthcare. He expanded his critique to accuse the network of being politically correct and unfair to Republicans, demanding that Fox News either "get on board, or get off board, NOW."

Chinese state media reports that hundreds of local villagers and rescue teams have been mobilized to clear the snow and assist those stranded at altitudes above 16,000 feet.

A subtle shift, such as a sigh or a sharp edge, can make a neutral question feel like an accusation, escalating tensions. Since nonverbal cues carry significant emotional weight, partners often remember how something was said more than the words themselves. To de-escalate, experts recommend catching and correcting one's own harsh tone or calmly asking a partner to rephrase their statement.</p>

          <p>Hungary's governing Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has become a dominant force in social media advertising, often outspending the combined political entities of much larger EU nations. This strategy is a cornerstone of Fidesz's political communication, allowing it to maintain a state of permanent campaigning. With platforms like Google and Facebook now banning political ads, Orban's party is pivoting to a network of online activists, dubbed "digital freedom fighters," to spread its message, though it faces a strong challenge from an opposition with significant organic online reach.</p>

          <p>A series of small earthquakes, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.5, occurred near the Big Bear area in Southern California over the weekend. The cluster of temblors was centered in the San Bernardino Mountains and produced weak shaking that was felt by some residents indoors. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that the event was minor and caused no damage. The area's last major seismic activity was in 1992, when a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck, following the powerful magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake on the same day.</p>

          <p>George Russell secured his second victory of the season at the Singapore Grand Prix, a race that also saw McLaren clinch the constructors' championship. However, the win was overshadowed by escalating tensions between McLaren teammates and title rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, who made contact at the start of the race. Piastri voiced his frustration over the team radio, claiming it was unfair that Norris was not asked to reverse positions. The incident adds to a series of contentious situations between the two drivers as they battle for the championship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author and researcher Brené Brown argues that effective communication requires a tolerance for discomfort because honesty and vulnerability are inherently difficult. In a recent interview, she explained that people often struggle to communicate well because they are not taught how to be clear, use precise language, or take accountability when conflicts arise. To navigate difficult conversations, experts suggest using phrases that validate the other person's feelings and demonstrate active listening, such as "It sounds like what's most important to you is..." to show you understand their perspective before responding.</p>

          <p>Major corporations including Prologis, Amazon, and Meta have co-founded the Sustainable Concrete Buyers Alliance (SCoBA) to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon concrete. The initiative aims to use the members' collective purchasing power to create market demand for sustainable building materials, thereby encouraging investment in decarbonization technologies for cement production, which accounts for 8% of global emissions. By creating offtake agreements and using a "book-and-claim" system, the alliance hopes to overcome the high costs and logistical challenges that have slowed the transition to greener construction materials.</p>

          <p>Syria is conducting its first elections in over forty years, employing a complex, indirect process to form a new parliament after the fall of the Assad dictatorship. Due to the displacement of millions and a fragile infrastructure, citizens will not vote directly; instead, appointed committees will select members of an "electoral college," who will then choose 121 parliamentarians. An additional 70 seats will be directly appointed by the interim president. While some see the process as a necessary first step, critics, including minority groups, have called it a charade designed to legitimize the transitional government.</p>
