          <p>An NHS trust and a ward manager have been convicted of health and safety failings in connection to the 2015 suicide of 22-year-old Alice Figueiredo, who had a history of mental health issues and suicide attempts. Figueiredo took her own life while under close observation at Goodmayes Hospital, using a bin bag taken from an unlocked communal toilet, despite prior warnings about the risk of bin bags. The North East London Foundation NHS Trust (NELFT) was cleared of corporate manslaughter, and ward manager Benjamin Aninakwa was cleared of gross negligence manslaughter, but both were convicted under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The family hopes this case leads to improvements in mental health care by ensuring transparency in similar failings.</p>

          <p>Top trade officials from the U.S. and China are scheduled to meet in London to address the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries. The U.S. delegation includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng will lead the Chinese side. The talks aim to ensure China restores the flows of critical minerals and to move forward with the Geneva agreement, which temporarily slashed duties for 90 days. Both sides have accused each other of violating the Geneva agreement, with the U.S. citing delays in critical mineral exports and China criticizing visa restrictions on Chinese students.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced plans to sue the Trump administration after the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles to address protests. Newsom criticized Trump's action as illegal and inflammatory, accusing him of escalating the situation by commandeering the state's National Guard without consulting him. The deployment followed large-scale immigration enforcement operations and subsequent clashes between law enforcement and protesters, with Trump labeling the protesters as troublemakers and insurrectionists. Newsom requested the federal government to rescind the deployment, asserting that there was no need for the National Guard.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey indicates that Americans' concerns about inflation decreased in May, following President Trump's decision to ease some tariff threats. The survey revealed a substantial dip in the one-year inflation outlook, dropping to 3.2%, and declines in the three-year and five-year horizons as well. This shift coincides with Trump's adjustments to his tariff proposals, moving from universal tariffs to a 90-day negotiating window. The survey results offer positive news for the White House, which has been working to alleviate concerns about tariff-induced inflation, though food prices are expected to rise.</p>

          <p>This article discusses strategies for consolidating $50,000 or more in credit card debt without negatively impacting one's credit score. Options include taking out a personal debt consolidation loan, which offers a fixed monthly payment and potentially lower interest rates, and using a home equity loan or HELOC, which leverages home equity for lower interest rates. Another option is working with a credit counseling agency, which can negotiate reduced interest rates and bundle debts into a single monthly payment. The article emphasizes choosing a strategy that fits one's credit profile and financial goals to achieve financial freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

The author suggests that while European and South American teams still dominate, the increased number of qualifiers from other confederations could improve their chances. The United States, Mexico, and Canada have a slim chance due to financial resources, while Africa faces challenges with poverty and corruption. Asia, particularly Japan, South Korea, and potentially Saudi Arabia, is seen as the most likely to produce a winner in the future.</p>

          <p>This article addresses frequently asked questions about home equity borrowing, including the differences between HELOCs and home equity loans, how much one can borrow, interest rates and fees, and potential uses for the funds. HELOCs offer a line of credit with variable rates, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed rates. Borrowing amounts typically range from 80 to 90% of a home's value minus the current mortgage balance, and funds can be used for various purposes, including debt consolidation and home renovations. The article stresses understanding the risks involved, as the home serves as collateral.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that the Trump administration's deportation program has positive net approval from Americans, supported by Republicans but shaped by views on who is targeted. Support is strong among those who believe the program prioritizes deporting dangerous criminals, but drops if the focus is perceived to be broader. Half of Americans believe Trump is deporting more people than expected, and most in this group disapprove of the program, emphasizing the need for due process. The poll also reveals mixed views on the program's economic impact, with concerns about weakening the economy.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles officials are struggling to manage vandalism, thefts, fires, and violence in downtown L.A. following days of unrest over immigration raids. Businesses have been vandalized, vehicles burned, and clashes have occurred between protesters and law enforcement, prompting President Trump to deploy the National Guard. Mayor Karen Bass criticized the Trump administration for provoking chaos through immigration raids, while Senator Alex Padilla blamed agitators and called for the National Guard to withdraw. Other local officials have condemned the violence, emphasizing that it undermines the values of the community.</p>
