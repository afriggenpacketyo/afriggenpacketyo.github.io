          <p>Global defense stocks experienced a significant rally after President Donald Trump announced a major shift in his stance, stating that Ukraine is in a position to win back all of its territory from Russia. In a social media post, Trump described Russia as a "paper tiger" facing economic trouble, a departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede land for peace. European defense firms like Renk, Leonardo, and Saab saw their share prices climb, reflecting market reaction to the potential for prolonged or intensified conflict and increased military support for Ukraine.

          <p>A 40-year-old man has been arrested in West Sussex as part of an investigation into a major cyber-attack that has disrupted several European airports, including Heathrow. The attack, identified by the EU's cyber-security agency as involving ransomware, targeted the baggage and check-in software provided by Collins Aerospace. This has led to hundreds of flight delays and forced airport staff to use manual, paper-based systems for boarding. The National Crime Agency stated the investigation is ongoing, and the software provider has not given a timeline for a full system restoration, urging airlines to prepare for at least another week of disruptions.</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen was brought to a standstill by Super Typhoon Ragasa, which battered the city with powerful winds and heavy rainfall. Residents reported being frightened by the storm's intensity as it shook windows and roared through the metropolis. Although no deaths were reported as of Wednesday afternoon, the typhoon felled over 170 trees, prompting preemptive trimming by government workers to mitigate damage. The severe weather event highlights the increasing impact of extreme weather on major urban centers in the region.</p>

          <p>Members of the American team for the 2025 Ryder Cup have drawn criticism on social media for their fashion choices at the event's pre-tournament gala dinner. The golfers were photographed wearing suits paired with sneakers and no ties, an informal look that many fans and golf purists deemed inappropriate for the prestigious occasion. The controversy adds a minor social storyline to the highly anticipated tournament at Bethpage Black, where Team USA, led by Scottie Scheffler, will compete against Team Europe, led by Rory McIlroy. The competition itself is set to begin on Friday.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report has revealed that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) engaged in unlawful surveillance practices against journalists between 2011 and 2024. The independent review found 21 instances of illegal attempts to uncover reporters' sources, double the number previously admitted by the PSNI. The report also criticized the practice of "defensive operations," where journalists' phone numbers, provided to the press office, were cross-referenced with police systems to detect unauthorized contact with officers.

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that Ukraine can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO. This statement, made on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Ukraine might have to concede territory to end the war with Russia. Trump attributed his change in perspective to a better understanding of the military situation and Russia's "BIG Economic trouble," labeling the nation a "paper tiger." The shift was welcomed by President Zelensky as a positive signal of continued U.S. support.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to his show with an impassioned monologue, directly addressing his recent suspension and the political pressure from President Donald Trump. While expressing regret that his comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death were perceived as insensitive, he did not apologize and instead pivoted to a forceful defense of free speech, calling government threats to silence a comedian "anti-American." Kimmel criticized Trump's attempts to have him canceled and warned that the president was escalating his battle with the media. The host's defiant return has been framed as a significant moment in the ongoing conflict between the media and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>In a significant ruling for the trial of 'Soldier F,' a judge at Belfast Crown Court has determined that military witness statements from 1972 can be used as evidence. Soldier F, a former paratrooper, denies charges of murder and attempted murder related to the Bloody Sunday massacre, where 13 civilians were killed at a civil rights demonstration. The prosecution argued that statements from two other soldiers, Soldier G (deceased) and Soldier H (unwilling to testify), are the only evidence capable of proving Soldier F fired at civilians. The defense had challenged the reliability of these decades-old statements, but the judge's decision allows them to be submitted.</p>

While some hosts like the Nelk Boys remain loyal, others with massive audiences, including Joe Rogan, Theo Von, and Andrew Schulz, have become more critical or disillusioned. These hosts have voiced skepticism over the administration's policies on tariffs, foreign wars, and a perceived lack of transparency regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files.

After Disney reversed its suspension of Kimmel, his defiant comeback was driven largely by pressure from fellow celebrities, influencers, and grassroots supporters rather than established institutions. However, the victory remains incomplete, as major station groups like Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to boycott his show, preventing it from reaching nearly a quarter of ABC's affiliate markets.

While Erika Kirk tearfully forgave her husband's killer and advocated for loving one's enemies, Trump used the platform to label the suspect a "monster" and blame "radical left lunatics." The author notes Trump's admission that he disagrees with Kirk's philosophy, stating, "I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them."

Research, such as NASA's twin study, has revealed significant physiological changes, including DNA damage and cardiovascular stress.

The core conflict pits a foreign-policy-focused faction, galvanized by the war in Gaza and supported by socially conservative Muslims, against a younger, socially progressive wing centered on issues like transgender rights.

          <p>The Trump administration, led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is taking action based on the belief that rising autism rates are caused by external factors like Tylenol or vaccines, a view scientists say ignores key facts. Researchers and psychologists argue that the steady increase in autism diagnoses is primarily due to a significant expansion of the diagnostic criteria and more widespread screening. The definition of autism has broadened over decades to include a wider spectrum of behaviors, and pediatricians now universally screen for it. This has led to better identification in underserved communities, not a true epidemic.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly using the Venezuelan street gang Tren de Aragua to justify a major deportation campaign and an increased military presence in Latin America. President Trump has described the gang as an "enemy of all humanity" attempting an "invasion" of the U.S., but experts and U.S. intelligence officials dispute these claims. A declassified memo found no evidence the gang poses a significant threat to the U.S. or has widespread links to the Venezuelan government. Critics suggest the administration is instrumentalizing the gang to rationalize aggressive policies, including recent military strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela.</p>

It cautions against treating polls as infallible predictions and advises voters to examine a poll's methodology. Key factors to consider include the sample size, the duration of the survey, whether it was conducted in multiple languages, and the precise wording of the questions. The piece also warns of potential bias in polls conducted by partisan groups with a specific agenda. Ultimately, it suggests that a well-informed decision is more valuable than relying on horse-race polling.</p>

His methods are unconventional, often involving extended maceration periods and a "low and slow" philosophy inspired by the Slow Food movement. Sampler's artistic and philosophical approach results in wines with a distinct personality, channeling the city's eclectic culinary spirit and challenging conventional ideas of winemaking.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while society has rightly focused on advancing girls and women, a significant and often ignored crisis is affecting boys and men. The author points to a widening gender gap in higher education, where nearly 60% of college students are now women, as well as higher rates of suicide and drug overdoses among men. The article criticizes the tendency to blame "toxic masculinity" rather than examining systemic failures in education and healthcare, noting there are federal offices for women's health but none for men's.

The biological evidence from the 1983 sexual assault and murder of Roberta Wydermyer ultimately pointed to a different man, a serial rapist who died in 2020.

          <p>The UK's home secretary has launched an urgent review into the use of taxis for transporting asylum seekers following a BBC investigation. The report found that asylum seekers were being taken on long-distance taxi journeys, sometimes costing hundreds of pounds, for routine appointments like visiting a doctor. One individual reported a 250-mile trip that cost the Home Office £600. While asylum seekers receive a weekly bus pass, taxis are booked for other necessary travel, and the system appears to lack cost controls or consideration for public transport alternatives. The practice has drawn criticism for its high expense.</p>

          <p>A large sinkhole suddenly appeared in a busy area of Bangkok, causing a 50-meter section of road to collapse. The incident occurred in a residential neighborhood near several hospitals and a police station, prompting evacuations and the cordoning off of the site. Authorities believe heavy rain likely eroded a large underground water pipe, leading to the collapse, which was then exacerbated by sliding dirt from a nearby train construction project. Fortunately, no injuries or deaths were reported, but the sinkhole disrupted local utilities as officials worked to secure the dangerous and slowly growing cavity.</p>

However, these new tariffs will feature higher per-unit energy costs, meaning they are unlikely to reduce overall bills for most households. While providing more consumer choice, charities have criticized the plan, stating it fails to address the fundamental problem of high energy costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists are highlighting Super Typhoon Ragasa as an example of how climate change is fueling more frequent and powerful storms. Experts explain that warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy, allowing typhoons to intensify more rapidly and grow larger. Climate change also makes it more likely for these storms to stall near coastlines, where they can deliver colossal amounts of rainfall instead of moving inland and weakening. The UN Environment Programme notes that average Pacific Ocean temperatures have risen by about 1.5 degrees Celsius in the last century, directly contributing to the increased threat posed by super typhoons.</p>
