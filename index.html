          <p>A 39-year-old suspect in a knife attack at Hamburg's central train station, who injured 18 people, had been known to police since 2021 for exhibiting signs of mental illness. The German national was detained after allegedly stabbing people at random, and authorities revealed she had been released from a psychiatric hospital just a day before the incident. Police initiated criminal proceedings against her in several cases last year, and she had received treatment at a psychiatric hospital for three weeks in May. The magistrate ordered her to be placed in psychiatric care, and she is accused of 15 cases of attempted manslaughter combined with grievous bodily harm.

          <p>Aston Villa plans to file a complaint with the Premier League following a controversial refereeing decision in their 2-0 loss to Manchester United, a defeat that cost them a Champions League spot. A goal by Morgan Rogers was disallowed due to a perceived foul on the United goalkeeper, a decision Villa believes was a significant error by an inexperienced referee. The club is questioning why a more seasoned referee was not assigned to such a crucial game, and they are upset that the VAR could not intervene because the referee stopped play before the ball crossed the goal line. Villa director Damian Vidagany expressed the club's frustration, highlighting the referee's inexperience. The author's tone reflects the sports team's frustration and disappointment.</p>

Ukraine's air force reported that Russia launched 69 ballistic and cruise missiles along with 298 attack drones, and the attacks hit western and southern regions of Ukraine which are poorly protected by air defenses.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," arguing they have a "moral component" because those who refuse to work are "defrauding the system." Johnson claimed the bill does not cut Medicaid or SNAP, but focuses on eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse. He stated that there are millions of able-bodied Americans on Medicaid who are not working and taking advantage of the system, and that such requirements are not onerous, requiring recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week. However, critics argue that the bill could cause many to lose coverage, and some Republican senators have voiced concerns about the bill's impact.

          <p>Federal judges are considering creating their own armed security force, shifting control from the Department of Justice, due to increasing threats and concerns about the Trump administration's protection. The proposal arose at a meeting of federal judges, where they discussed the rising number of threats following Trump's criticism of court rulings against his policies. Currently, the US marshals service, managed by the Justice Department, protects federal judges, and some judges worry that Trump might withdraw security from those who rule against him. Judge John Coughenour expressed support for the transfer of marshals to judicial control, citing concerns about the marshals service's independence.

          <p>Cindy McCain, the head of the U.N. World Food Program, warned that the number of aid trucks entering Gaza is only a "drop in the bucket" compared to what is needed to stave off potential famine. She stated that 500,000 people in Gaza are extremely food insecure and could be on the verge of famine. McCain also pushed back on Israel's claims that Hamas is responsible for looting aid trucks, saying there is no evidence. The offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of the territory's population. The author's tone reflects the urgency of the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame faces international condemnation after his actions in Congo, drawing comparisons to Vladimir Putin, leaving diplomats at a loss to explain why one of Africa’s most astute leaders had undertaken such a colossal gamble and what he might do next. Despite claims to the contrary by the UN and the US, Mr Kagame has long denied sponsoring M23. The president has long been accused of undermining Congo militarily and economically. Critics note it has merrily plundered the east for years without triggering a war. The conflict’s future now depends largely on Mr Trump, who is understood to be offering drones to the Congo as part of a package to deter Rwanda and reduce its military advantage in the region.

          <p>Japan is a major public financier of gas and oil projects, despite pledging to halt such funding for fossil fuels, with significant investments in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. This contradicts its leadership in the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which aims for net-zero emissions in Asia. While LNG is considered a "transitional fuel" for AZEC partners, studies suggest it involves more emissions than coal. Experts argue Japan's G7 pledge has loopholes, allowing investments in projects deemed "abated" with carbon capture storage (CCS), and they consider this a form of greenwashing. The author's tone reflects the concerns about Japan's conflicting actions.</p>
