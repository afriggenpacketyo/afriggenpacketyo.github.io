          <h2>Study Shows Americans Are Moving Money to Investment-Yielding Accounts</h2>

          <p>New research from the JPMorganChase Institute indicates that more Americans are transferring money from traditional checking and savings accounts into financial products that provide investment income, such as brokerage accounts and CDs. This trend helps explain the U.S. economy's resilience, as it shows that households' total cash reserves are growing when these other accounts are considered. The shift reflects consumers adapting to a higher-interest-rate environment to make their money more productive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Why Involving Children in Household Chores is Beneficial for Their Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 09:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that parents who shield children from household chores miss a crucial opportunity for their development. By allowing kids to participate in tasks like cooking and cleaning, even if imperfectly, parents can help them build motor skills, confidence, problem-solving abilities, and a sense of belonging. The author suggests turning chores into a shared social activity rather than a lesson or a paid job to foster a child's intrinsic motivation to contribute.</p>

The tragic incident underscores the strict safety protocols required for MRI environments, where metallic objects can become dangerous projectiles.</p>

          <p>The European Union is facing strong criticism over a new policy that would tie development aid for African nations to their cooperation on migration enforcement, such as accepting deportations. African policy experts and humanitarian organizations have labeled the approach as coercive and a form of neocolonialism that undermines trust and partnership.
