          <p>President Trump has been briefed on potential actions against Iran's Fordo nuclear site, weighing the risks and benefits of a strike due to concerns about Iran's rapid progress towards nuclear weapons capability. While attack plans have been reviewed, a final decision is pending, contingent on Tehran's willingness to abandon its nuclear program. The U.S. is considering the logistics of using bunker-buster bombs, while also exploring diplomatic avenues through European allies. Intelligence reports suggest Iran is close to possessing nuclear weapons, though some congressional committees believe weaponization has not yet been ordered. The situation remains fluid as Trump prefers to make a final decision at the last moment. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is reviewing the dispute over President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they were sent to protect federal property during protests against immigration enforcement. While the military's status remains uncertain, immigration raids have accelerated, with ICE agents employing tactics that advocacy groups liken to those of a totalitarian regime. The Trump administration blames stepped-up raids on Los Angeles' sanctuary policies, while ICE defends the use of masks as a response to threats against agents. A settlement may require ICE personnel to wear more visible insignia in the future. </p>

          <p>President Trump has again extended the deadline for enforcing a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S., marking the third delay as a deal to separate TikTok from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, remains elusive. The extension, set to last until mid-September, allows the administration to continue working towards a deal that ensures the data of American TikTok users is safe and secure. While an agreement was previously reached to spin off TikTok's U.S. operations into a new American-owned company, ByteDance has indicated that China's approval is needed, creating further complications. Despite bipartisan concerns about TikTok's potential for spying and propaganda, Congress has taken little action in response to the administration's repeated delays. </p>

          <p>UNCTAD warns that international investment in 2025 has turned negative due to global trade policy changes and tariff uncertainty. Despite modest growth early in the year, trade tensions have led to downward revisions in indicators of foreign direct investment, including GDP, capital formation, and investor sentiment. A two-year positive trend in manufacturing investments, driven by supply chain diversification efforts, has reversed as companies hesitate due to tariffs. The agency estimates that between $100 and $200 billion in project value is at risk globally, with developing countries and sustainable development goals-aligned sectors facing the most significant impact (not investment advice). </p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, providing Â£150 off energy bills to millions more households this winter. The changes will eliminate the property-based qualification, allowing anyone on means-tested benefits to receive the discount automatically. While energy companies will cover the cost, it could potentially lead to a slight increase in all customer bills through the standing charge. The government aims to offset this increase through savings by cutting energy companies' expenditure and addressing problem debt. </p>

          <p>In an era marked by heightened offense-taking, Arthur C. Brooks explores strategies for managing personal reactions to provocation. Drawing on psychological research, he outlines a three-stage process of offense-taking and emphasizes the role of the brain's limbic system and prefrontal cortex in managing emotional responses. Brooks suggests practical techniques such as using humor, activating the prefrontal cortex through practices like meditation, and tuning out offense-making media. He also cautions against mistaking offense-taking for reliable evidence of true offensiveness, noting that it may be a manipulative tactic. </p>
