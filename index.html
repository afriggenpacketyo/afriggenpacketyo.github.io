          <p>The Trump administration, through Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, has released 230,000 previously classified documents related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. These files, now available on the National Archives website, contain details about the FBI's investigation, internal memos, and information concerning potential leads in the case. The release aims to provide greater transparency on the nearly 60-year-old investigation into the civil rights leader's murder in Memphis. This move follows ongoing public interest and questions surrounding the circumstances of his death.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Reverse Mortgages Could Offer Financial Relief for Seniors in Current Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 16:17:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising inflation and concerns over Social Security's future, reverse mortgages are being presented as a viable financial tool for homeowners aged 62 and older. This financial product allows seniors to convert their home equity into cash payments without the burden of immediate monthly repayments, which is particularly advantageous in a high-interest-rate environment. The article suggests this option can supplement retirement income and may be easier to qualify for than other large loans, given high home equity values. However, it is noted that this is not a universal solution for all seniors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has announced the upcoming launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, a new beverage containing prebiotic fiber and cane sugar, set to be available this fall. This move comes four months after the company acquired Poppi, a popular prebiotic soda brand, for $1.95 billion, signaling a strategic shift towards health-conscious consumers. The launch reflects a broader industry trend of adapting to declining traditional soda consumption by incorporating functional ingredients. The new product aims to capture a share of the growing market for gut-health-focused drinks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled approximately 5 million above-ground pools due to a significant safety hazard. The recall follows the drowning deaths of nine children, aged 22 months to 3 years, over the past two decades. Investigators found that an exterior compression strap on the pools, sold by major retailers since 2002, can be used as a foothold for young children to climb in, even when the ladder is removed. Manufacturers are providing a repair kit to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Community bail funds, which saw a surge in popularity and donations following the 2020 protests, are now facing increased scrutiny and legislative restrictions from Republican lawmakers. These nonprofit groups use donations to pay bail for individuals who cannot afford it, allowing them to await trial at home. Proponents argue they are a crucial lifeline and demonstrate the viability of alternatives to cash bail, while opponents raise public safety concerns. At least four states have enacted laws to regulate these funds, sparking a debate over their role in the justice system.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical and statistical analysis of the term "criminal alien," arguing it is a misleading and racially charged slander central to the Trump administration's immigration policy. It traces the origins of criminalizing immigration to the 1929 "Undesirable Aliens Act," which was sponsored by eugenicists and white supremacists. The author presents data showing that immigrants are significantly less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens and that most "criminal alien" convictions are for immigration violations, not violent offenses.

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term has been marked by a heavy reliance on tariffs, which he wields as a flexible and unilateral foreign policy tool, often for objectives typically pursued with sanctions. This approach, part of his "America First" agenda, allows him to exert economic pressure on countries over issues beyond trade, such as immigration and drug trafficking, without congressional approval. While the White House defends tariffs as a source of leverage and revenue, critics warn that the "tariff tango" of threats and rollbacks creates global economic instability and could be linked to broader de-globalization and conflict.

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced a major change to its long-standing business model, confirming it will end its open seating policy and begin offering assigned seats on January 27, 2026. This move abandons the carrier's iconic first-come, first-served boarding process in favor of a system that allows customers to select specific seats and purchase options like extra legroom. The airline is also overhauling its boarding sequence, grouping passengers by seat location. This shift follows other recent changes, such as ending its "bags fly free" policy, signaling a new revenue strategy.</p>

          <p>Paul de Gelder, an Australian Navy diver who lost a hand and a leg in a 2009 shark attack, has shared his top tips for staying safe during a shark encounter. He advises people to remain calm and avoid splashing, as panic can attract the shark's attention. De Gelder also recommends maintaining eye contact with the animal, as sharks prefer to ambush their prey from behind. As a final resort, he suggests pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose to drive it away. His advice comes amid recent shark sightings off the U.S. East Coast.</p>
