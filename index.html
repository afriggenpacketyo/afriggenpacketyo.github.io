          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has appointed Thomas Frank, formerly the Brentford head coach, as their new manager, signing him to a contract extending until 2028. Frank succeeds Ange Postecoglou, who was dismissed earlier in the month despite leading Spurs to victory in the Europa League final. During his seven-year tenure at Brentford, Frank guided the club's ascent from the Championship to the Premier League in 2021. Tottenham finished 17th in the top flight last season but qualified for the Champions League by winning the Europa League final against Manchester United, marking their first major trophy in 17 years. This appointment signifies a new chapter for Tottenham as they aim to improve their league performance under Frank's leadership.</p>

          <p>California Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed and handcuffed after interrupting a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. Padilla attempted to question Noem about deportation efforts, leading to a physical altercation with federal agents. His office stated that he was performing congressional oversight and was wrongly detained, while DHS claimed he lunged toward Secretary Noem without proper identification, prompting the response from security. Following the incident, Noem and Padilla had a 15-minute meeting to discuss his concerns, though reactions to the event have been sharply divided along partisan lines. The incident underscores the escalating tensions surrounding immigration enforcement in California. Optimism surrounding the event is relatively low due to the physical altercation and partisan divide.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, prompting President Trump to deploy additional active-duty Marines to join the National Guard. California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned the deployment as illegal and has initiated legal action against the Trump administration.

          <p>Democratic governors from Illinois, Minnesota, and New York testified before a House Oversight Committee, defending their states' immigration policies and criticizing the deployment of troops to Los Angeles.

The hearing highlighted the ongoing political divide over immigration policies and the role of the federal government in managing immigration-related issues at the state level.

          <p>Despite global efforts to combat child labor, the 2025 target for its elimination has not been met, with sub-Saharan Africa still facing the highest number of underage workers. A joint report by UNICEF and the ILO reveals that 138 million children are currently engaged in child labor, a decrease from 160 million in 2020. However, rapid population growth in sub-Saharan Africa has hindered progress, with poverty, limited access to quality education, and climate change exacerbating the issue. The report emphasizes the need for stronger enforcement of laws, increased investment in education, and strategies to break the cycle of child labor to improve the lives of children across the continent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation data, with recent reports showing benign consumer and producer prices. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods ahead of tariff announcements, a time lag before tariffs affect the economy, and limited pricing power due to consumer belt-tightening. Economists believe the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months, but for now, inflation remains in check due to these mitigating factors. The situation is being closely monitored for future price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal hearing is set for Thursday regarding California's challenge to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they call an unlawful militarization. The lawsuit seeks to prevent the use of federalized troops beyond protecting federal buildings, arguing that there is no rebellion in Los Angeles. The Department of Justice argues that limiting the military's role would amount to a rioters' veto, and the court will consider arguments from both sides at the hearing. The case underscores the ongoing conflict between the state and federal government over immigration enforcement and military deployment.</p>

The jury had previously found Weinstein guilty of one count of sexual assault and not guilty on another, but remained deadlocked on the rape charge. The Manhattan District Attorney plans to retry the rape charge, marking a third trial for Weinstein in New York. The defense team believes the conviction will be overturned due to juror misconduct, while the accuser has expressed her readiness to testify again.

          <p>The Trump administration's EPA is proposing to eliminate power plant pollution standards, a move that critics say will benefit wealthy plant owners at the expense of Americans' health and the environment. The EPA claims the rollback will save the US about $1 billion a year, but this saving comes at the cost of climate and health benefits worth 20 times more. The EPA's action is seen as a favor to fossil fuel interests, with the American public bearing the costs of dirtier air and increased climate change impacts. Experts warn that the rollbacks represent a complete abdication of the EPA's responsibilities under the Clean Air Act.</p>
