          <p>A Mexican Navy training sailing ship, the Cuauhtemoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City during a promotional tour, resulting in injuries to at least 22 people. The ship's masts snapped upon impact with the bridge's deck, causing partial collapse and prompting a swift response from emergency services. New York City Mayor Eric Adams reported 19 injuries, emphasizing that the 142-year-old bridge sustained no major damage. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the collision, which occurred while the ship was conducting training maneuvers with approximately 200 people on board. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have engineered a "groundbreaking" fiber-optic gyroscope that maintains stability across a wide temperature range, making it suitable for navigation in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. Developed by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, this gyroscope offers a more reliable method for measuring orientation and turning rates without external signals like satellites. Inertial navigation systems utilizing this technology are immune to interference, crucial for military and security applications. Interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (IFOGs) are already used in aerospace, weapons systems, oil platforms, and autonomous vehicles due to their simple structure and high resolution. </p>

          <p>High demand for live shows in China, exemplified by sold-out comedy shows in Hong Kong and Coldplay concerts, is fueling a tourism spending spree. Fans are purchasing travel packages that include airport transfers and guaranteed bookings. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel, dining, and tourist bookings to boost domestic consumption, aligning with Beijing's economic agenda. This strategy aims to encourage people to spend more than just the ticket price, with concertgoers traveling across the country for unique experiences. For instance, one fan received a 50% discount to a mountain after presenting her concert ticket. </p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime sceneâ€”bloody, bare footprintsâ€”led to a decades-long search for answers in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs.

Years later, forensic scientist Andrea Feia discovered an unknown DNA profile repeating itself throughout the crime scene. This DNA was eventually matched to Jerry Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy, leading to his arrest and subsequent conviction. </p>

Probation teams would collaborate with councils to assign jobs to offenders, and private companies could also employ those on community sentences.

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, took 19th place despite strong vocals and harmonies, leaving many puzzled. While the band's performance was praised for its vocal precision, the song's manic and inconsistent style was cited as a primary reason for the disappointing result. The staging, though fun, lacked the scale and impact of other performances. Despite these challenges, the band's energy and likability were noted, and they gained new fans across Europe, setting a foundation for future UK entries. </p>

          <p>Former President Trump publicly criticized Walmart for attributing potential price increases to tariffs imposed by his administration, insisting the company should "eat the tariffs." Walmart CEO Doug McMillon had warned that higher tariffs would lead to increased prices on various products. Trump's response highlights his continued efforts to shift the financial burden of tariffs onto foreign producers and retailers, rather than American consumers. A Walmart spokesperson reiterated the company's commitment to keeping prices as low as possible, acknowledging the challenges posed by small retail margins. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine but restricted its use to older adults and those with high-risk medical conditions. This decision limits access for healthy individuals under 65 and requires the company to conduct additional studies on potential heart-related side effects, costing tens of millions of dollars. Experts have expressed disappointment, arguing the restrictions hinder vaccine availability and raise concerns about political influence.
