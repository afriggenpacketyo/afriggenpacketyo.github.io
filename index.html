          <p>Chinese tech giant Xiaomi has successfully reclaimed the top spot in Southeast Asia's smartphone market for the first time in four years, driven by robust second-quarter sales across its budget and premium segments. The company's shipments increased by 8% year-on-year, reaching 4.7 million units and securing a 19% market share, surpassing competitors like Transsion and Samsung. This achievement reflects Xiaomi's strategic expansion of its sales channels, significant growth in its Poco sub-brand, and strong performance of its premium 15 series.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts warn that significant US budget cuts to mRNA technology research, totaling $500 million, could severely impede future vaccine development. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy's decision to cancel contracts and withdraw funding is seen as the latest in a series of anti-science policies under the Trump administration. This move is particularly concerning given mRNA vaccines' critical role in the COVID-19 pandemic and their potential for preventing other infectious diseases and cancer. Researchers fear these cuts will slow down development, drive American scientists abroad, and reduce public access to affordable future vaccines if private funding fills the void.</p>

          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance's recent working holiday in the UK, including a visit to the picturesque Cotswolds, has drawn significant criticism from local residents. The extensive security measures implemented, such as police roadblocks, checkpoints, and a large motorcade reportedly flown from the US, caused considerable disruption. While police denied claims of intrusive questioning regarding social media, they confirmed temporary access restrictions. The visit also spurred a "Vance not welcome party" protest, reflecting broader local frustrations with the US administration and concerns about overdevelopment and infrastructure strain in the popular tourist area.</p>

He highlighted his long-standing frustrations with the system, which he believes has deteriorated significantly since his retirement in 2016. Phelps offered to help address these issues, proposing solutions like increased support for young athletes and prioritizing elite swimmers' needs over coaches, emphasizing that the current system is failing despite medal production.</p>

          <p>Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced plans to build over 3,000 homes in the controversial E1 settlement project in the occupied West Bank. This development, frozen for decades due to international opposition, would effectively sever the West Bank from East Jerusalem, undermining the territorial contiguity essential for a Palestinian state. Smotrich explicitly stated the move would "bury the idea of a Palestinian state," asserting Israeli sovereignty over what he considers God-given land. The announcement comes amidst growing international recognition of a Palestinian state, drawing condemnation from Palestinians and groups like Peace Now, who warn of continued bloodshed.</p>

          <p>The enduring children's book character, Amelia Bedelia, a maid who comically misinterprets instructions, continues to fascinate and confound readers. While commonly explained as a literal interpreter of language, deeper analyses suggest her actions might contain elements of intentional subversion or trickster behavior. Some interpretations even view her as a class warrior, disrupting her wealthy employers' expectations by turning mundane tasks into chaotic performance art. Despite the bizarre premise and dated requests, the series remains immensely popular, prompting modern adaptations that, for some, miss the original's core appeal of an adult doing silly things and subtly challenging authority.</p>

Biden alleged in a recent interview that Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a claim her lawyer, Alejandro Brito, asserts is false, defamatory, and "extremely salacious." Brito stated that Biden's remarks have caused "overwhelming financial and reputational harm" to the former First Lady. This legal threat mirrors a strategy often employed by Donald Trump, as the First Lady seeks to protect her public image from widely disseminated accusations.</p>

The high-end market is particularly weak, with fewer cars priced over $10 million than in a decade. Experts attribute this slowdown to a generational shift, as Baby Boomers downsize and younger collectors, like Millennials and Gen Z, prefer newer, more affordable, and practical cars from the 1980s and beyond. This rotation is driving more private sales and a skyrocketing market for modern supercars, indicating a significant change in collector preferences. (not investment advice)</p>

The article argues that even poorly received movies, whether from Hollywood or Bollywood, hold intrinsic value beyond entertainment. They can spark important cultural conversations, such as discussions on nepotism in Bollywood or misogyny in films like "Animal." The author suggests that "bad" art sharpens critical senses and encourages dialogue, fostering shared experiences of rage or amusement. Ultimately, these films, by their very nature, can contribute to new discourse and a deeper understanding of cinematic and societal issues.</p>

Both leaders may also seek other opportunities, such as economic cooperation for Russia or a perceived diplomatic win for Trump, with the outcome heavily influencing the future of the conflict and international relations.</p>

Pundits weigh factors like new signings, team balance, managerial impact, and player departures for contenders like Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea. While some see Liverpool as favorites due to their talent and confidence, others highlight Arsenal's strengthened attack or City's potential for a different tactical approach, emphasizing the competitive nature of the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's overt integration of his ultra-conservative Christianity into the Pentagon is reportedly causing significant division within the US military ranks. Veterans express concern that Hegseth's religiosity, evident in new recruitment ads featuring biblical texts and a "One Nation Under God" message, politicizes their role and undermines military cohesion. Critics point to Hegseth's personal social media posts, including support for a pastor who believes women shouldn't vote, as contradicting promises to champion women in uniform. While the Pentagon reports a surge in recruitment, opponents warn this approach could attract Christian nationalists, leading to a less effective and more toxic future military.</p>

          <p>Parents face increased costs for school lunches in the upcoming academic year, whether packed from home or purchased at school, largely due to persistent inflation. A Deloitte report indicates packed lunches now average $6.15 daily, up 3%, while school-provided meals have risen 3.3%. Progressive think tanks also attribute some increases to President Trump's tariff agenda, impacting food staples. Despite school lunches often being cheaper or free, many parents still pack meals, prioritizing healthy eating but often resorting to store brands or cheaper alternatives to cut costs. Staffing shortages in school nutrition programs further complicate efforts to meet new nutritional standards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak, the 133-year-old photography company, has expressed "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operations due to significant financial struggles, including a $26 million net loss and mounting debt. This comes despite a notable resurgence in film photography, largely driven by Generation Z's interest in retro aesthetics and analog wellness. While Kodak reported increased film sales and plans to invest in its Rochester factory, its overall financial health remains precarious. The company, which filed for bankruptcy in 2012, is now looking to terminate its pension plan to pay off debts, highlighting the ongoing challenge of adapting to a changing market despite niche demand.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to leverage the Justice Department for a "revenge campaign" against perceived enemies are reportedly encountering significant obstacles within the legal system. Despite appointing loyalists and establishing a "Weaponization Working Group," the DOJ has struggled to advance investigations and faced embarrassing defeats in prosecuting dissenters. Examples include federal prosecutors failing to secure grand jury indictments in Los Angeles protests and charges against the Newark Mayor being dismissed. This suggests that American criminal law, while often favoring prosecution, is proving less flexible for overtly political targeting than the Trump administration had hoped, though the system remains vulnerable.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will host the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony in December, a presidential first, following his controversial takeover of the performing arts center and appointment of loyalists to its board. This move deviates from tradition, where nominees typically come from board members, the public, and past honorees, with the president usually less involved. Trump explicitly stated he rejected some candidates he referred to as "wokesters," highlighting a politicization of the awards. Despite his personal interest in the arts, this action contrasts with his past proposals to eliminate arts and humanities endowments, raising concerns about the politicization of cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Western countries, including Australia, France, and the UK, are announcing their intent to recognize a Palestinian state, signaling Israel's increasing international isolation amidst its Gaza military campaign. While this move brings more states in line with the two-state solution and allows Palestine greater participation in international treaties like the Rome Statute, experts note it often comes with strict conditions that limit Palestinian sovereignty. Critics argue these recognitions are largely symbolic gestures, doing little to end Israel's occupation, settlement expansion, or military control. The shift is influenced by geopolitics and domestic protests, but without coordinated sanctions, it may not bring meaningful change.</p>
