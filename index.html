          <p>A coalition of 25 countries, including major U.S. allies like Britain, Canada, and Japan, has issued a joint statement demanding an immediate end to the war in Gaza. The nations condemned Israel's handling of humanitarian aid as "drip feeding" and decried the "inhumane killing of civilians, including children." This widespread condemnation comes as Israel announces an expansion of its ground offensive into Deir al-Balah, a central Gaza city not previously targeted with ground maneuvers. The move has prompted alarm from the families of remaining Israeli hostages, who fear for their safety amid the escalating conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is holding firm on its August 1 deadline to impose higher tariffs on the European Union, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirming a baseline 30% tariff will take effect. While expressing confidence that a deal will eventually be reached, he stated the deadline is fixed, escalating pressure on Brussels. The EU is preparing retaliatory measures but hopes to negotiate a lower rate, similar to the 10% baseline deal secured by the U.K. However, economists warn that a high tariff rate could be a "total car crash for European exports" and reignite inflation fears in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 11:56:33 EDT</div>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has publicly urged New Jersey's district court judges to extend the tenure of interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba. Her initial 120-day appointment, made by President Trump, expires this week, and without Senate confirmation, only the state's judges can allow her to continue. Habba, who previously served on Trump's civil defense team and has no prior law enforcement experience, has had a tumultuous tenure marked by clashes with state Democrats. Blanche praised her "steady leadership," while critics point to her partisan rhetoric and investigations into political opponents.</p>

          <p>Garris Fabrics & Fashion, a 78-year-old seamstress shop in West Philadelphia, has received a complete storefront makeover thanks to a city-funded grant program. The business, founded in 1947 and now run by the founder's daughter, Denise Garris, specializes in handcrafted dresses for young girls, continuing a family legacy. The grant, administered by the nonprofit ACHIEVEability, is part of an initiative to revitalize the 60th Street business corridor by assisting small businesses at no cost.

After a strong rally earlier in the year, gold's momentum has stalled, consolidating in a tight range. Market experts are divided, with some believing a major new economic headwind or geopolitical event would be necessary for such a surge. Others note that gold can be volatile and point to central bank activity, inflation data, and U.S. dollar movements as key factors that could influence its price in the short term.

          <p>Amid rising tensions between the White House and the Federal Reserve, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a broad review of the central bank's overall function. Speaking on CNBC, Bessent suggested the examination should go beyond recent controversies over building renovations to assess whether the institution has been successful in its core mission. His comments follow a week of conflict, including unconfirmed reports that President Trump was preparing to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent also supported the idea that the Fed should be easing interest rates, criticizing the bank's mindset on inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the Trump administration views the upcoming August 1 tariff deadline less as a final date for deals and more as a tool to increase negotiating pressure. He stated that imposing higher tariffs "will put more pressure on those countries to come with better agreements." Bessent's remarks suggest that even if the steep levies take effect, they will serve as another lever to extract more favorable trade terms for the U.S. This strategy prioritizes the quality of the final deals over the timing, casting further doubt on whether the August 1 deadline is a firm endpoint.

Horner was dismissed in early July after leading the team since 2005, following a period of internal turmoil and declining competitiveness. Brown alluded to the ongoing "drama" at Red Bull over the past few years, which included the departure of key technical and strategic personnel. The dismissal came 17 months after Horner faced allegations of inappropriate behavior, which he has always denied and were dismissed by internal investigations.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal judge to delay his release from criminal custody for 30 days, should the judge rule against the Justice Department's request to keep him detained. The lawyers argue the pause is necessary to evaluate legal options, as they have been advised that the Department of Homeland Security will immediately begin removal proceedings upon his release. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year despite having protection from removal, and was later returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, as seen in the successful Euro 2025, nations from Eastern Europe have struggled to keep pace with their Western counterparts. An analysis suggests that a combination of cultural, political, and economic factors has hindered development in the region. Experts point to a historical lack of investment, societal norms viewing football as a "man's game," and the post-communist collapse of state sponsorship systems as significant barriers. While recent UEFA initiatives are starting to show positive results, a substantial shift in investment and cultural attitudes is still needed for the region to catch up.</p>

To address this, Ofcom suggests broadcasters and YouTube must work together to make UK-made content, particularly news and children's programming, more visible on the platform, and even raised the possibility of new legislation to enforce this.</p>
