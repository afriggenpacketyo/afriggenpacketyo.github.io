          <p>After over six decades in business, pharmacy chain Rite Aid has announced the permanent closure of all its stores, marking the end of a significant era in the retail pharmacy sector. The company had filed for bankruptcy protection twice, in October 2023 and May 2025, amidst mounting financial challenges and over a thousand lawsuits. These legal actions alleged that Rite Aid pharmacies improperly filled prescriptions for controlled substances, contributing to the opioid crisis. Despite efforts to restructure and secure new financing, the company's wind-down plan remains under court review, highlighting the complex interplay of financial distress and legal accountability in its demise.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez was pepper-sprayed and stabbed multiple times during a late-night altercation with a 69-year-old truck driver in a downtown Indianapolis alley. According to court records, Sanchez, reportedly under the influence of alcohol, accosted the truck driver who was backing into a hotel's loading docks. The confrontation escalated, leading the driver to defensively use a knife, fearing for his life. Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso and subsequently charged with misdemeanors including battery, unauthorized entry of a motor vehicle, and public intoxication. The incident led to his absence from a scheduled Fox Sports broadcast.</p>

          <p>Sophie Fay, a 26-year-old NHS intensive care nurse, underwent an above-the-knee amputation after a rare and aggressive cancerous tumor was found in her calf. Initially, she dismissed persistent aching pain and swelling as a muscle injury, but escalating symptoms prompted further medical investigation. An MRI scan revealed a large spindle cell sarcoma of the bone that had encased her blood vessels and nerves, making amputation the only viable treatment. Ms. Fay is now advocating during Bone Cancer Awareness Week, sharing her experience to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and prevent others from facing similar delays in identifying rare bone cancers.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has won the presidency of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. A hardline conservative and ally of Shinzo Abe, Takaichi advocates for "Abenomics," emphasizing loose monetary policy, fiscal spending, and structural reforms, and has criticized the Bank of Japan's interest rate plans. Her administration will face economic strains, tense international relations, particularly with the US under Donald Trump, and domestic concerns about foreign residents. Takaichi also holds hardline stances on China and favors revising Japan's pacifist constitution, indicating a potentially assertive foreign policy.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's significant influence over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding a potential Gaza peace deal, characterizing it as Trump "successfully bullying" Netanyahu. Despite Netanyahu's past resistance to halting military action before a deal, Trump's recent ultimatum led to Israel ceasing offensive operations and dispatching negotiators. The analysis argues that Netanyahu, who has historically leveraged his alliance with Trump for electoral gain, is now constrained by this dynamic, forcing him to acquiesce to Trump's directives to avoid a public feud. Trump's actions demonstrate his transactional approach, balancing US and Arab state interests.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates widespread public disapproval of the ongoing US government shutdown, with few Americans believing either party's position is worth the disruption. President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans all received net negative approval ratings for their handling of the situation. The public's primary concern is the shutdown's potential impact on the economy, with many also criticizing the Trump administration for not focusing enough on lowering prices. The poll underscores a perception of political distraction from major issues and a desire for greater congressional authority over federal spending.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has strengthened in the Pacific Ocean and is projected to continue intensifying, with its path running parallel to Mexico's west coast. Tropical storm watches are in effect for a significant stretch of the Mexican coastline, from Jalisco to Baja California. Although the hurricane is not expected to make direct landfall, forecasters warn of dangerous surf conditions, rip currents, and heavy rainfall of 4 to 8 inches across parts of southwestern Mexico. This rainfall carries a significant risk of flash flooding, particularly in higher terrain areas, necessitating public vigilance and preparedness.</p>
