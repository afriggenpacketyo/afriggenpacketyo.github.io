        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn an $83.3 million jury verdict for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court affirmed that the damages were fair and reasonable, dismissing Trump's arguments about excessive penalties and presidential immunity. This ruling pertains to defamatory statements Trump made in 2019 after Carroll accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s. The decision marks another significant legal setback for the former president in the long-running dispute, with Carroll's legal team stating they look forward to justice finally being done.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its effort to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid by filing an emergency request with the Supreme Court. This move follows lower court rulings that blocked the administration from clawing back funds already allocated by Congress for agencies like USAID. The administration argues that forcing the executive branch to spend the money infringes on the separation of powers and the president's ability to conduct foreign policy. The legal challenge was initiated by nonprofit groups after Trump attempted to use a rarely invoked legislative tool to cancel the funds.</p>

          <p>A new outbreak of the Zaire strain of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo has resulted in 16 deaths, prompting concern from the World Health Organization. A WHO emergency coordinator stated that recent U.S. funding cuts, initiated by the Trump administration, will "definitely have an impact" on the ability to contain the virus. The cuts affect the global community's capacity to deliver essential medical supplies and personnel swiftly. This health crisis is compounded by Congo's already strained healthcare system, which is also battling a major mpox outbreak.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's departure, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has called for her replacement to be a woman from outside of London. She argued that this would help broaden the party's leadership appeal and complement Sir Keir Starmer. The party has initiated an accelerated election process, with nominations opening this week and a winner to be announced in late October. The contest is seen as a pivotal moment for the party's direction, with several high-profile figures, including Dame Emily Thornberry, considering a bid for the position.</p>

          <p>European stock markets closed higher on Monday, with investors closely monitoring political developments in France. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is facing a critical confidence vote he initiated himself amid disputes over significant budget cuts. If Bayrou loses the vote, it would force President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years, signaling continued political instability. Despite this uncertainty, major indices like France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX saw gains, driven by retail and technology stocks, as markets also anticipated key U.S. inflation data.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James has written an essay for China's state-run People's Daily, expressing gratitude to his Chinese fans. The move comes nearly six years after a tweet from then-Rockets GM Daryl Morey supporting Hong Kong protesters created a major rift between the NBA and Beijing. At the time, James had criticized Morey for being "misinformed." His recent essay, published at the conclusion of a promotional tour in Asia, is seen as a sign of the continuously improving relationship between the NBA and China, with games now regularly broadcast in the country again.</p>

          <p>A massive immigration raid at a Hyundai and LG Energy Solution battery plant in Georgia resulted in the arrest of 475 people, including over 300 South Korean nationals. U.S. authorities stated the operation, part of an investigation into unlawful employment, was the largest single-site enforcement action in Department of Homeland Security history. The South Korean government has expressed concern and is working to return its detained citizens. The raid highlights the Trump administration's focus on worksite enforcement as part of its broader crackdown on illegal immigration, creating tension with international business partners.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to resume widespread immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area, temporarily freezing a lower court's order. The original injunction had barred federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or occupation without reasonable suspicion. The Justice Department argued the restrictions severely hampered law enforcement, while dissenting Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson warned the decision enables the government to potentially "seize anyone who looks Latino." The ruling is a key development in the administration's mass deportation campaign.</p>

          <p>Confidence among U.S. workers about their ability to find a new job has plummeted to an all-time low, according to the New York Federal Reserve's latest Survey of Consumer Expectations. The probability of finding new employment after a job loss dropped to just 44.9%, the lowest point since the survey began in 2013. This sentiment reflects a cooling labor market where hiring has slowed dramatically, causing workers to cling to their current positions. The data follows a weak August jobs report, reinforcing concerns about economic uncertainty and a reversal of the "Great Resignation" trend.</p>

          <p>China's export growth decelerated significantly in August, increasing by only 4.4% compared to the previous year, down from a 7.2% jump in July. This marks the slowest pace of export growth since the beginning of the year, signaling potential weakness in global demand. The slowdown is partly attributed to ongoing trade tensions, as exports to the U.S. plunged by 33% following the imposition of additional tariffs by the Trump administration. While exports to the EU saw a modest rise, the overall trend points to increasing economic headwinds for the world's second-largest economy.</p>

          <p>A moose, affectionately named Emil, has become a local celebrity in northeastern Austria after wandering into the country, likely from Poland via the Czech Republic. Moose are not native to Austria, and Emil's appearances have drawn curious crowds and a large social media following. His journey has not been without incident, as he briefly caused the closure of a major railway line after wandering onto the tracks at a main station. Authorities and animal protection groups have urged the public to give the animal space and not attempt to approach or feed him.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates a significant ideological shift among Democrats, with 66% now holding a positive view of socialism compared to only 42% who view capitalism favorably. This trend, which has developed over the past 15 years, is particularly pronounced among Democrats under 50. While U.S. adults overall still prefer capitalism, its popularity has declined since 2021. The findings highlight a growing partisan and generational divide over economic systems, reflecting increasing concerns about economic fairness and the influence of figures like Senator Bernie Sanders on the Democratic party's base.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has postponed a pretrial hearing for former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who faces charges of crimes against humanity. The delay was granted after the 80-year-old's lawyers argued he is not medically fit to stand trial. Duterte is accused of responsibility for thousands of extrajudicial killings during the violent anti-drug crackdown he orchestrated as president. The postponement has been met with disappointment by families of the victims, who fear it will impede justice, while the case continues to create political tension within the Philippines.</p>

          <p>A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that Chagas disease, a potentially fatal condition transmitted by the triatomine insect, or "kissing bug," may now be locally acquired in the United States. While long considered endemic only in Latin America, locally transmitted human cases have now been reported in eight states, including Texas, California, and Tennessee. The parasite is passed through the feces of the infected insect, often when a person scratches a bite wound. The CDC warns that without treatment, the disease can lead to life-threatening heart and digestive problems.</p>

          <p>With interest rates and living costs high, many homeowners are considering tapping into their substantial home equity. Financial experts advise that the smartest uses for a home equity loan or HELOC this fall are those that improve one's financial position, such as funding value-adding home renovations or consolidating high-interest credit card debt. Conversely, they warn against risky uses like speculative investing in volatile markets or paying off credit cards only to run up new balances. Homeowners are cautioned to be disciplined and avoid using their property to finance unsustainable spending habits, which could put their home at risk.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa were treated to a celestial spectacle this week as a total lunar eclipse produced a "blood moon." This phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow on the lunar surface. The moon takes on a reddish hue because the only sunlight reaching it is filtered through Earth's atmosphere, which scatters blue light. Photos from around the globe captured the event's striking red glow. The next total lunar eclipse will be visible from the Americas in March.</p>

The agreement concludes a contentious period that saw City oppose amendments to the regulations, which were approved by a majority of other top-flight clubs.</p>

While his opponents held rallies demanding "no amnesty," his supporters, backed by Donald Trump, marched to decry what they call a politically motivated persecution.

          <p>Italy's national rescue organization has reported a disturbing trend, with more than 100 people dying in the country's mountains since June. Experts attribute the high number of fatalities to a combination of factors, including the effects of climate change and inexperienced hikers. The warming climate is causing permafrost to melt, leading to more frequent and dangerous rockfalls and collapsing glaciers. Simultaneously, more people are heading to the mountains to escape record heat, leading to overcrowding on trails and a casual mindset that underestimates the serious alpine dangers, resulting in a tragic summer season.</p>
