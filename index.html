          <p>The Department of Justice, under new leadership, has reportedly terminated at least three federal prosecutors who were handling cases related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The dismissed attorneys included two supervisors from the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office in Washington, D.C., and another prosecutor directly involved in trying several cases. According to reports, the termination letters did not provide a specific reason for the dismissals, citing only the executive branch's constitutional authority. This move follows a broader staff reshuffling within the DOJ and the pardoning of many January 6 defendants by President Trump.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the U.S. government, under the direction of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced it will cease funding Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. Speaking at a Gavi conference, Kennedy criticized the organization for allegedly ignoring vaccine safety and stifling dissent, confirming a move that could jeopardize the immunization of millions of children in developing nations. Gavi, which functions like a bulk purchaser for vaccines, estimates the U.S. withdrawal of its $1.2 billion pledge could lead to over a million preventable child deaths, a move critics call a dangerous globalization of the anti-vaccine movement.</p>

          <p>Germany is re-examining its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, with former Health Minister Jens Spahn facing scrutiny over the procurement of overpriced face masks. Spahn is being questioned about ordering masks against expert advice, a decision that could cost taxpayers billions in lawsuits from manufacturers. In response to public mistrust, Germany's governing parties are establishing an inquiry commission to review the government's pandemic actions, including lockdowns and the role of scientific advice. The goal is to learn from past mistakes, rebuild public trust, and prepare more effectively for future health crises.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a civil lawsuit filed by three crew members of the movie "Rust" against the film's producers, including actor Alec Baldwin.

          <p>A 70-year-old Egyptian man has pleaded guilty to harming a law enforcement animal after he kicked a Customs and Border Protection beagle at Washington Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred when the 5-year-old detector dog, Freddie, alerted his handler to the man's suitcase during a baggage inspection. The man, who was attempting to smuggle over 100 pounds of prohibited agricultural products, kicked the 25-pound dog with enough force to lift it off the ground, causing contusions. He was ordered to pay the veterinarian bill and has been removed to Egypt.</p>

This action follows several lawsuits by authors against AI companies for copyright infringement and reflects growing concerns that AI poses an existential threat to writers, translators, and other industry professionals.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haiti, effective September 2. This decision removes deportation protections for up to 500,000 Haitians who had sought refuge in the U.S. due to instability in their home country. The DHS stated that conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently for citizens to return, a conclusion that contrasts with the State Department's Level 4 "Do Not Travel" advisory for the nation due to crime, kidnapping, and civil unrest.

The procedural vote was 53-47, falling short of the simple majority needed to proceed. The measure, introduced by Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, was intended to reassert Congress's constitutional role in declaring war, especially following recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Despite a similar resolution passing in 2020, most Republicans, joined by one Democrat, voted against the current measure, arguing it was unnecessary at this time.</p>

The article suggests that the party remains fractured, as seen in the aftermath of the recent NYC mayoral primary, and is still relitigating the past. To move forward, Democrats may need to shift focus to the 2028 presidential race to anoint a new generation of leaders.</p>

          <p>Scientists are raising alarms over the abrupt termination of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), a critical source of atmospheric data for over 40 years. A notice from NOAA indicated that data distribution will cease by June 30, a move that experts warn could severely hamper the ability to forecast hurricanes and monitor polar sea ice. The DMSP satellites provide unique high-resolution data, allowing forecasters to see inside developing storms and track rapid intensification. Critics call the decision reckless, especially as it comes with little warning at the start of what is predicted to be an active hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon, a moderate from Nebraska's competitive second congressional district, will not seek re-election in 2026. His retirement creates a significant opportunity for Democrats, who are aiming to reclaim the House majority and now have a prime target in the Omaha-based swing district. Bacon, who has been a vocal critic of some of former President Trump's policies, represents a district that voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in both 2020 and 2024. His departure removes a key incumbent advantage for the GOP in a critical seat.</p>

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan has confirmed he will attend the upcoming peace ceremony in Nagasaki, marking the 80th anniversary of the 1945 U.S. atomic bombing. This comes after the city government did not invite Israel to the 2024 ceremony due to the conflict in Gaza, a decision that prompted G7 ambassadors to withdraw in solidarity. For this year's event, Nagasaki has adopted a more inclusive approach, inviting all diplomatic missions in Japan. The move signals a step towards diplomatic reconciliation, with Russia's ambassador also expected to attend for the first time since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

The attacks hit multiple locations, including a site near Gaza City's Palestine Stadium that was sheltering displaced people. This new wave of violence comes as President Trump suggested a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached within the next week. However, formal talks have remained stalled for months, with both sides publicly holding firm to conflicting demands for ending the 21-month-long war.</p>

          <p>The victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary has elicited varied reactions from conservatives. While some, like Donald Trump, labeled him a communist, others at a religious conservative conference expressed a grudging respect for his effective grassroots campaign against establishment candidate Andrew Cuomo. Many attendees viewed his success as a phenomenon specific to liberal New York, expressing confidence that his progressive policies would not appeal to the rest of the country. The result has nonetheless fueled debate about the direction of the Democratic party and the appeal of socialist ideas.</p>

          <p>A veteran Chinese expert on the Middle East suggests that while Iran may seek military support from China amid its conflicts with the U.S. and Israel, Beijing is likely to proceed with caution. Scholar Pan Guang noted that China must balance its relationship with Tehran against its broader interests, which include ties with Israel and other Western-aligned nations in the region. The analysis comes as tensions remain high following U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Although Iran has called for a larger Chinese role in de-escalating the conflict, Beijing's strategic and economic considerations will likely temper its involvement.</p>

          <p>Political analysts are expressing concern over the potential politicization of national intelligence under Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard in the Trump administration. Following recent U.S. airstrikes on Iran, some observers note that Gabbard, who initially aligned with a non-interventionist wing of the party, appears to be shaping intelligence statements to match the president's political preferences. This trend is seen as dangerous by intelligence professionals, who strive to avoid such influence. Critics argue this approach contradicts Gabbard's stated goal of rooting out politicization within the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is ending the week on a high note after securing a series of significant victories both domestically and internationally. Key accomplishments include brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after a successful U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, and gaining a commitment from NATO allies to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. At home, a Supreme Court ruling curbed the power of lower courts to block his executive orders nationwide. These events, combined with a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, have bolstered the president's image as a decisive leader.</p>

His Likud party still polls well below a majority, and he faces ongoing legal challenges, including a high-profile corruption trial set to resume next week.

The recent 12-day conflict with Iran, which saw Israeli forces successfully strike nuclear and military targets, followed campaigns that devastated Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. This has effectively dismantled Iran's "axis of resistance" network. However, while the immediate security threats to Israel have been reduced, the underlying political issues, particularly the Palestinian conflict and its humanitarian crisis, remain unresolved and continue to tarnish Israel's international standing.</p>
