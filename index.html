          <p>Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are scheduled to hold a summit in Alaska to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump aims to secure at least a ceasefire and potentially a three-way meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, bolstering his image as a dealmaker. Putin seeks to prevent Ukraine's NATO membership, secure territorial gains, and install a Russia-friendly government in Kyiv. The primary points of contention will be the cessation of military action and the final determination of Ukraine's borders, with both sides holding conflicting positions on territorial sovereignty.</p>

Wing Abby Dow describes their journey as climbing "Everest," a metaphor reinforced by a talk from an actual Everest mountaineer. The team is focused on learning from their last narrow victory over France, aiming for a more dominant performance this time. Dow, who has recovered from injury, emphasizes the team's collective focus on the World Cup, setting aside personal contract negotiations until after the tournament.</p>

The officer, identified as David Rose, was responding to reports of an active shooter and was pronounced dead at a hospital. The suspect was later found deceased from what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and no civilians were injured.

          <p>A wildfire, named the Canyon Fire, has burned nearly 5,400 acres near Los Angeles, prompting evacuation orders for thousands of residents. Igniting on Thursday, the blaze spread rapidly due to extreme heat and dry conditions, though firefighters have since achieved partial containment. A firefighter sustained major injuries when their truck overturned. While favorable weather has recently aided suppression efforts, authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant as temperatures are forecasted to rise. This fire is one of several active blazes in the state, highlighting California's ongoing struggle with increasingly destructive fire seasons.</p>

          <p>A year after a catastrophic landfill collapse in Kiteezi, Uganda, killed 34 people and left over 220 homeless, residents live in fear of another disaster. The Kiteezi landfill is now officially closed, but the capital city of Kampala struggles to manage its 2,000 tons of daily waste. A new landfill site in Buyala is controversial, with the National Forestry Authority claiming it is located within a protected forest reserve. While the city authority has plans for improved waste processing and has promised compensation for victims, families are still waiting for aid to relocate.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing Russian crude oil, raising questions about the future of a potential EU-India free trade agreement. However, experts suggest the move is largely symbolic and will not significantly impact trade negotiations. A more pressing issue for India is the threat of high tariffs on its goods from the United States under the Trump administration. This pressure from the U.S. may paradoxically push India to finalize a trade deal with the EU, seeking more stable and predictable economic partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

This rare diamond structure, first discovered in a meteorite in 1967, is distinct from the common cubic diamond and was believed to form under the immense pressure of meteorite impacts. Previous attempts by global research teams to synthesize this material resulted in mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team produced pure hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometres in size, providing definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence and opening new research possibilities.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out inside the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, a UNESCO World Heritage site in southern Spain, but was quickly extinguished by firefighters. The city's mayor praised the rapid intervention, which he said "averted a catastrophe." The blaze reportedly started in a chapel, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper. No major damage to the iconic structure was reported. The building, a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century that was converted into a cathedral in the 13th century, is a major tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>California's Democratic leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, hosted Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled their state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. Newsom declared that California is prepared to respond with "emergency measures" to "nullify what happens in Texas," suggesting California will pursue its own redistricting to favor Democrats if the Texas plan proceeds. The event, held in Sacramento, highlighted a united Democratic front against the GOP's efforts. The Texas lawmakers reiterated their commitment to blocking the vote, which they argue is an attempt to undermine fair elections.</p>

          <p>Almond growers across Central California are grappling with a massive rat infestation affecting more than 100,000 acres of orchards, causing significant economic damage. The rodents are damaging trees by burrowing in root zones, consuming nuts, and destroying irrigation equipment, with estimated losses ranging from $109 million to $311 million. According to a survey by the California Department of Food and Agriculture, the problem is widespread across several counties. Growers are employing various expensive and labor-intensive strategies to combat the pests, as scientists advise more targeted monitoring and baiting programs.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by several California counties alleging the retailer overcharged customers. The lawsuit claimed that Walmart sold products, particularly items sold by weight like produce and baked goods, for prices higher than advertised or for weights less than labeled. This practice violates California's false advertising and unfair competition laws. As part of the settlement, Walmart will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and has agreed to implement measures ensuring accurate pricing and weighing in its California stores.

          <p>A Fremont man has been charged with felony theft for allegedly stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, valued at over $216,000, from a UCLA library over a potential five-year period. The suspect, Jeffrey Ying, allegedly used fake aliases and a flaw in the library's checkout system to rent the valuable items, some dating back to the 13th century. He would then reportedly return "dummy books" with forged labels in their place. The FBI believes Ying traveled to China after the thefts, possibly to sell the manuscripts, and he was arrested before a planned flight.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the settlement between Disney and actress Gina Carano, who was fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts. The author argues that the settlement, which includes a statement from Lucasfilm hoping to work with Carano again, was the "right thing to do." It posits that the initial firing was an overreaction and an act of pandering to a social media mob. While acknowledging the current political climate, the piece frames the settlement not as corporate capitulation, but as a reasonable course correction for an extreme initial decision.</p>

          <p>The political fight over redistricting in Texas has escalated dramatically, with Republicans taking aggressive steps against the Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has asked the state supreme court to declare 13 of the Democrats' seats vacant. Meanwhile, the House speaker is working to enforce civil arrest warrants outside of Texas and has withheld the lawmakers' pay. The Democrats, who have found refuge and support in blue states like California and Illinois, remain defiant, vowing to continue their quorum break to prevent the GOP's redistricting plan.</p>
