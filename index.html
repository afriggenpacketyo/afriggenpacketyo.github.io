          <p>Amid the devastating Texas Hill Country floods, remarkable stories of survival are emerging even as the death toll rises. One woman was rescued after being swept 12 miles down a river, while another described clinging to a tree with her son as her boyfriend was washed away. In a tragic account, a man died after saving his fiancée and children by punching out a window for their escape. These personal narratives provide a ground-level view of the disaster's human impact, complementing official reports of casualties and ongoing rescue efforts for dozens still missing.</p>

          <p>Texas has commenced a grim recovery operation after a flash flood devastated the Hill Country, leaving at least 27 people dead, including nine children. Dozens remain missing, among them 24 girls from a Christian summer camp on the Guadalupe River, which rose 26 feet in 45 minutes. The article connects the event to the climate crisis, noting the increasing frequency of such downpours. It also touches on political dimensions, including questions about National Weather Service forecast accuracy following recent budget cuts under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Over 20 individuals were arrested in London on suspicion of terrorism offenses after demonstrating in support of Palestine Action. The protest occurred just as the group was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government, making public support for it a criminal act. The ban followed a protest where the group claimed responsibility for causing millions in damage to military aircraft. Critics of the ban, including Palestine Action's co-founder, have described the government's move as an "authoritarian abuse" of power, while supporters held signs reading "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action."</p>

Mercedes' George Russell and Lewis Hamilton finished fourth and fifth, respectively, in a session marked by shifting winds and strategic adjustments. Verstappen noted that the team's low-downforce setup made the car challenging to handle in the high-speed corners but ultimately proved successful.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing criticism for an email claiming a new spending bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers, have labeled the statement a misleading and partisan communication. The legislation actually provides a temporary tax deduction that phases out for higher earners, rather than a full tax elimination. This controversy highlights concerns about the politicization of a previously apolitical government agency and the dissemination of inaccurate information to the public. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The increasing use of digital payment systems has led to a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation," where customers are prompted to tip in a growing number of service situations, from fast-food counters to self-service kiosks.

Experts note that while this technology can increase income for service workers, it also benefits the payment companies.

This perception could effectively terminate any remaining prospects for North Korean denuclearization. Experts believe the regime will likely prioritize making its nuclear arsenal more mobile and resilient, further investing in second-strike capabilities and hardened underground facilities to ensure its deterrent remains credible.</p>

Its innovative design, which broke down complex characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed on computers today.

          <p>After a swimming ban that lasted more than 100 years due to pollution, Parisians are once again taking a plunge in the Seine River. The reopening of designated swimming areas follows a $1.5 billion cleanup project tied to the city's Olympic preparations, which has successfully brought water quality up to European standards on most days. On Saturday, residents lined up to swim in newly opened zones near the Eiffel Tower and Île Saint-Louis. The event marks the fulfillment of a long-held dream for the city, first championed by former mayor Jacques Chirac in 1988.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, scientists are studying sharks in Washington state's Willapa Bay to gain insights into the broader health of the marine ecosystem. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the research involves capturing sharks, examining their stomach contents to understand their diet and water quality, and then releasing them. Beyond the scientific goals, the lab's mission includes changing the public's negative perception of sharks. Researchers hope that by highlighting the crucial role these predators play, they can generate more support for their conservation and the health of the oceans.</p>

          <p>Following his public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, Elon Musk is exploring the creation of a new political party. He has suggested that this "America Party" could strategically target just a few pivotal House and Senate seats. Given the narrow margins in Congress, Musk believes this approach would be sufficient to make the party a deciding vote on contentious legislation. The idea has been floated on his social media platform X, where a poll showed majority support for creating an alternative to the two-party system.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a large-scale luxury beach resort, as part of leader Kim Jong Un's long-standing push to boost the nation's tourism sector. The sprawling complex features high-rise hotels and numerous amenities, but it opens while the country remains largely closed to foreign visitors. Analysts see the project as a pursuit of economic prosperity alongside military ambitions, not as a replacement for them. While some Russian tourists are expected, it remains unclear if the resort can become the international destination Pyongyang envisions.</p>

          <p>An Arizona man is raising awareness about illegal rental practices after being fined $4,000 by his property management company for posting negative online reviews. His lease contained a "non-disparagement" clause that penalized tenants for reviews rated three stars or less, a practice that violates the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act. This law protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback without fear of retaliation. After being contacted by local news, the company stated it would remove the clause from future contracts, but the incident highlights a broader issue of companies attempting to silence customers.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has climbed to 16, with rescue operations continuing for a second day. The building collapsed on Friday, and emergency workers have been using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more people believed to be trapped under the debris. Such incidents are tragically common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards and a lack of regulatory enforcement often lead to unsafe structures being built with substandard materials. A similar collapse in Karachi in 2020 killed 22 people.</p>

          <p>A doctor working in a public hospital argues that new federal work requirements for Medicaid will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable patients. The article contends that millions of Americans who should qualify for Medicaid will lose their coverage due to insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles, not because they are unemployed without reason. For patients who are homeless, disabled, or face language barriers, the process of proving employment or exemption is a significant barrier. The author concludes the policy is engineered to cut costs by making it too difficult for eligible people to access care.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has announced the formation of Tropical Storm Chantal off the coast of the southeastern United States. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for coastal areas of North and South Carolina, where storm conditions are expected to arrive later on Saturday. The storm was located about 150 miles south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. Forecasters expect the center of Chantal to move across the coast of South Carolina on Sunday morning, with some potential for additional strengthening before it makes landfall.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage emotional responses to stressful or angering situations. The concept is based on neuroscientific findings that the physiological effects of anger hormones like cortisol and adrenaline dissipate from the body in about 90 seconds. After this brief period, any lingering feeling is sustained by replaying the thought. Gawdat suggests that by recognizing this, individuals can use the moment after the initial 90 seconds to consciously choose a more constructive response rather than remaining stuck in a cycle of anger.</p>

          <p>The mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal sex-trafficking trial is being analyzed as another example of the legal system's inability to effectively address the complexities of intimate partner violence. While Combs was found guilty on lesser charges, he was acquitted of the most serious ones. This article argues that because existing domestic violence laws are often ill-equipped to handle coercive control by powerful individuals, prosecutors may turn to trafficking charges, which have a higher burden of proof. The outcome demonstrates the difficulty of achieving justice for survivors within current legal frameworks.</p>
