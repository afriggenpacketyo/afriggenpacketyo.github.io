          <p>The House of Representatives initiated debate on a sweeping domestic policy bill championed by President Trump, following Speaker Mike Johnson's efforts to appease Republican holdouts with a series of changes. The bill, encompassing tax cuts and spending adjustments, faces unified Democratic opposition and internal GOP divisions over provisions such as Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. Concessions were made to accelerate Medicaid work requirements, increase the state and local tax deduction, and expand the rollback of clean energy tax credits. The legislation is projected to add trillions to the national debt and cause millions of Americans to become uninsured.</p>

          <p>The UK government is struggling to meet its pledges on illegal immigration and asylum, despite promises to "end asylum hotels" and "smash the gangs" involved in people smuggling. Small boat crossings have reached record levels, and the number of hotels used to house asylum seekers has increased since Labour took office. While there has been a 50% increase in decisions on asylum cases, the overall backlog has risen due to a record number of applications. The government has increased returns of people with no legal right to be in the UK, but forcibly removed a smaller portion.</p>

          <p>Government borrowing in the UK exceeded expectations in April, putting pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves as experts predict potential tax rises in the autumn. Borrowing reached Â£20.2 billion, Â£1 billion higher than the previous year, marking the fourth-highest April figure since 1993. While tax receipts increased by over Â£5 billion due to higher National Insurance contributions, government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs. Experts suggest that the government may struggle to meet its economic rules without implementing future tax increases.</p>

          <p>The tradition of Indianapolis 500 winners drinking milk started in 1936 when Louis Meyer, after winning his third Indy 500, drank buttermilk, a drink his mother told him would refresh him on a warm day. A cameraman captured the moment, and a dairy industry executive requested that milk be given to every winner. From 1947 to 1954, winners were handed cold water in a silver chalice, but the milk tradition returned in 1956. Since then, 69 consecutive winners have enjoyed milk in the victory circle.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to conclude talks on the Chagos Islands deal has been temporarily suspended by a High Court injunction. Two Chagossian women, Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrie Pompe, filed a case against the Foreign Office, resulting in an "interim relief" order. The agreement would transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while allowing the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years. The court will reconvene to hear the case again, as the legal action claims the government failed to consult the Chagossian people adequately.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. The price rise occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, potentially indicating investors seeking alternative stores of value. Macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Positive regulatory developments, such as the GENIUS Act and a pro-crypto agenda from U.S. President Donald Trump, have also supported the market.</p>

The tower, a key cultural relic, was renovated last year to fix falling roof tiles, raising questions about the quality of the $420,000 project.

The Independent Sentencing Review also recommends managing more offenders in the community and expanding a voluntary chemical castration pilot for some sex offenders to 20 more prisons. Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke emphasized the need for major reforms to prevent emergency releases, warning that overcrowded prisons lead to dangerous conditions and high reoffending rates.

          <p>The House of Representatives is moving toward a vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill, following the release of an updated version aimed at satisfying Republican holdouts. The legislation addresses tax, defense, and energy priorities, but faces opposition from various GOP factions over provisions involving Medicaid and state and local tax deductions. Speaker Mike Johnson made changes to win over budget hardliners and blue-state Republicans, including accelerating Medicaid work requirements and increasing the state and local tax deduction. The bill is expected to face resistance in the Senate, where numerous Republicans seek changes.</p>

          <p>China has called on the European Union to ensure a "fair" playing field for businesses following Brussels' proposal to impose a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. The European Commission is suggesting a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas, while parcels sent to European warehouses would incur a 50-cent fee. The proposed fee is expected to generate around 3 billion euros in income for Brussels, intended to cover the costs of customs and safety checks.</p>

          <p>A South African lobbyist named Ernst Roets appeared on Tucker Carlson's show, perpetuating the false narrative of a "white genocide" in South Africa, which has been amplified by the Trump administration. The article refutes claims that white South Africans are being systematically targeted, emphasizing that they still hold a disproportionate amount of the country's wealth and land. It argues that this narrative is a grift used to flip the story of apartheid and cast former oppressors as victims. The author details the complexities of South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy and how the MAGA movement has embraced this false narrative.</p>

          <p>Russia's economy, heavily focused on the war effort, is showing signs of strain due to international sanctions and internal pressures like high inflation. Despite efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to persuade Vladimir Putin to negotiate with Kyiv, Russia has shown little interest in peace talks, but economic and military challenges could change this. Military equipment stockpiles are dwindling, and further offensives into 2026 may require forced mobilization, posing political and economic challenges. The Russian economy is experiencing a slowdown, with economic growth predicted to decrease from 4.3% in 2024 to 2.5% this year.</p>

          <p>Shares in Xpeng are set to extend their rally of nearly 80% this year, with analysts citing the Chinese electric-vehicle maker's introduction of newer models and progress toward profitability. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled from a year earlier, driven by robust sales, with 94,008 vehicles delivered in the first three months. This improved top line helped narrow its net loss and lifted its gross margin. Analysts expect Xpeng to turn profitable in the fourth quarter of this year, driven by strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. (not investment advice)</p>

The UN warns of a potential shutdown of water and sanitation facilities by the end of the week without immediate fuel deliveries. Since early March, Israel has cut off power lines to main desalination plants and imposed a blockade on aid.
