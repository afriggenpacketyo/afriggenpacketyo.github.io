          <p>In Montana, and across the U.S., local jails are becoming de facto mental health institutions due to a broken system. A jail in Polson, Montana, uses tiny isolation cells to house individuals in mental health crises, sometimes for months, while they await an open bed at the state psychiatric hospital. This situation highlights the severe lack of mental health services and crisis care available in communities, with nearly half of the people locked in local jails in the U.S. having a mental illness. The state is trying to improve services but progress is slow.</p>

          <p>A large brood of periodical cicadas, known as Brood XIV, is emerging across the eastern United States this spring. These cicadas, characterized by their red eyes and translucent wings, emerge every 17 years and are known for their synchronized behavior and loud buzzing. This year, they are expected to swarm parts of Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller quantities appearing along the East Coast. The exact timing of their emergence depends on soil temperature, with cicadas typically exiting the soil when it reaches 64 degrees.</p>

Small businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy, yet they often lack the same access to policymakers as large corporations. Small businesses have faced numerous challenges, including COVID-19 mandates, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and tariffs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump faces an uphill battle to pass his budget bill through Congress due to significant divisions among Republicans over spending cuts and tax policies. While Republicans aim to extend tax cuts, raise the debt ceiling, and boost defense spending, disagreements persist over the size of spending cuts, particularly to programs like Medicaid. The House and Senate have different targets for spending cuts, and some Republicans oppose significant reductions to Medicaid, creating a challenging path to consensus and threatening the GOP's ability to unite under tight margins in both chambers.</p>

          <p>With financial uncertainty on the rise, experts emphasize the importance of managing financial stress to protect mental health. Research suggests that how people perceive their financial circumstances significantly impacts their well-being, sometimes more than the actual financial situation itself. Strategies for coping include processing grief after job loss, constructing a new identity, seeking side hustles, embracing uncertainty, and prioritizing self-care. It's important to channel energy in a productive direction after a financial setback and seek emotional relief in healthy ways.</p>

          <p>Following an attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, the US and China are urging India and Pakistan to de-escalate tensions. A political anthropologist at Cornell University argues that the "denial of Kashmiri self-determination" lies at the core of the conflict between India and Pakistan. Both countries have a history of leveraging their minoritized populations against each other, overshadowing the voices and suffering of the Kashmiri people amidst military posturing at the border.</p>
