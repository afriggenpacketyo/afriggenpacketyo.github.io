          <p>The CDC is accused by a union of jeopardizing accommodations for disabled employees by pausing remote work arrangements. This follows an updated Department of Health and Human Services policy that excludes telework as a reasonable accommodation. Employees with disabilities are awaiting clarity on their remote work status, with concerns mounting over potential job losses. The union, AFGE Local 2883, is directing members to legal resources, highlighting the confusion and lack of communication from leadership.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jimmy Kimmel drew criticism from Trump supporters and officials for suggesting Charlie Kirk's alleged killer might have been a pro-Trump Republican. During his monologue, Kimmel stated the "Maga Gang" was trying to distance themselves from the suspect and politicize the event. This sparked outrage, with the FCC chair threatening action against ABC and Democratic Senator Ed Markey calling it censorship. Kimmel reportedly planned to address the backlash by showing his comments were taken out of context.</p>

          <p>A US immigration judge has ordered the deportation of pro-Palestinian protest leader Mahmoud Khalil to Algeria or Syria. The ruling cites his alleged failure to disclose information on his green card application, which the judge deemed a willful misrepresentation. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal, asserting that the Trump administration is retaliating against him for exercising free speech. Khalil, a legal permanent resident married to a US citizen, was previously detained for three months, missing his son's birth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk has highlighted America's deepening political divisions, with many questioning the nation's ability to unite after tragedy. Experts note that incentives in US political life and media often reward extreme rhetoric, exacerbating societal rifts. Utah Governor Spencer Cox attributed recent political violence to social media, urging a de-escalation of tensions. However, figures like Elon Musk and former President Trump have further fueled partisan narratives, with Trump blaming the "radical left."</p>

          <p>ABC has indefinitely pulled "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air after the host's controversial comments linking Charlie Kirk's alleged killer to the MAGA movement. This decision followed FCC Chair Brendan Carr's suggestion that ABC's broadcast license was at risk and Nexstar Media Group's pre-emption of the show. Former President Trump praised the move, while Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and unions condemned it as censorship. Critics argue the action sets a dangerous precedent for free speech and government overreach in media.</p>

          <p>Germany's Central Council of Jews urged Chancellor Friedrich Merz to continue "unconditional" support for Israel, commemorating 75 years since its founding.

          <p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine issued a strong rebuke of the Trump administration's attempts to dismiss climate change dangers, stating evidence is "beyond scientific dispute." Their report directly opposes the EPA's move to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding" regarding greenhouse gases. The Academies affirm that warming is unequivocal and new threats have been identified, warning of worsening climate-induced harm. This scientific consensus challenges the administration's claims about regulatory costs and authority, emphasizing the urgency of climate action.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reveals that Pete Buttigieg was her "first choice" for her 2024 running mate, but she deemed the pairing too risky for America.

Despite her admiration for Buttigieg's talent and their friendship, she ultimately chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>University of California police departments have received approval to acquire additional weapons and equipment, including drones, rifle rounds, and thousands of pepper ball rounds. This annual request comes as UC's handling of protests faces scrutiny. While most requests are for non-lethal alternatives, the move raises concerns about police force against student and faculty demonstrators. Past incidents at UCLA, where pepper-ball projectiles were deployed during protests, highlight tensions. Critics argue that military-grade equipment does not enhance campus safety and may infringe on First Amendment rights.</p>
