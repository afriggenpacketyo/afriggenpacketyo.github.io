          <p>German police will conduct a new search in Portugal as part of ongoing investigations into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. The search will reportedly take place in Praia da Luz, the town where she went missing nearly two decades ago. Madeleine was three years old when she vanished from a holiday apartment complex on May 3, 2007. Her disappearance sparked a Europe-wide police investigation, and has become one of the highest-profile unsolved missing person cases in the world.</p>
