          <p>The jury in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial has raised concerns with the judge regarding one juror's ability to follow legal instructions shortly after beginning deliberations. The judge opted to remind the entire jury of their obligations rather than single out the individual juror, following a suggestion from the defense. This development comes after seven weeks of testimony in the case where Combs faces charges including racketeering and sex trafficking, which he has denied. The jury is now reviewing extensive evidence, including videos and text messages, to reach a unanimous verdict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with a marathon voting session on amendments to President Trump's major tax and immigration bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Republicans are aiming to pass the legislation by July 4, while Democrats are using procedural tactics and introducing numerous amendments to challenge provisions they argue harm working-class families by cutting programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The bill's passage in the Senate is not guaranteed, with some Republican senators expressing opposition, and if it passes, it faces another challenging vote in the House due to the GOP's slim majority.</p>

Azerbaijan's government claims Sputnik was operating through "illegal financing" after its accreditation was revoked earlier in the year.

          <p>This opinion article praises the Trump administration's decision to revoke the U.S. visas of the British punk duo Bob Vylan following their performance at the Glastonbury festival. The author argues the move is a justified response to the band leading the crowd in chants of "Death, Death to IDF," which is characterized as a blatant call for violence against Israelis. The piece dismisses free expression concerns for foreign agitators, comparing the situation to historical bans on anarchists. It frames the decision as a courageous and timely part of President Trump's broader efforts to combat antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Shares of Joby Aviation jumped approximately 14% after the company announced it had delivered its first electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to the United Arab Emirates. This milestone, which includes the completion of piloted flight tests, moves the company closer to its planned 2026 commercial air taxi service launch in Dubai. The agreement with Dubai's transport authority grants Joby exclusive operational rights for six years, positioning the UAE as a key launch market for the emerging air taxi industry.

The IDF denies allegations of deliberate targeting of civilians and announced it will reorganize access to aid sites with new fencing and signage to improve safety.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will lose access to a key satellite data program by July 31, just as the U.S. enters peak hurricane season. The Department of Defense is decommissioning the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, which has provided crucial environmental data for weather forecasting since the 1960s, citing cybersecurity risks and modernization needs. While NOAA insists its remaining data sources are sufficient to maintain high-quality forecasts, the cutoff comes at a challenging time for the agency, which has recently faced staff reductions.

The administration characterized Harvard's response as "deliberate indifference" and threatened a referral to the Department of Justice if the university does not voluntarily comply.

However, many Labour MPs are questioning the logic of defining the new criteria before the review, which is meant to be co-produced with disability organizations, has concluded.

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina is continuing to oppose his party's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," creating uncertainty for its passage. Tillis, who recently announced he will not seek reelection after criticism from President Trump, delivered a fiery speech condemning the bill for breaking Trump's promise not to cut Medicaid, which he says will devastate his state. While some Democrats have praised his courage, it remains unclear if any other Republicans will join his opposition. The episode exposes deep divisions within the GOP over the sweeping legislation and its potential impacts on entitlement programs.</p>

          <p>Police in the U.K. have opened a criminal investigation into performances at the Glastonbury festival by rap-punk group Bob Vylan and Northern Irish rap trio Kneecap.

The U.S. State Department also revoked the band's visas, stating foreigners who glorify violence are not welcome. The BBC, which broadcast the set, apologized for the "unacceptable" antisemitic sentiments. The investigation will consider potential public order and hate crime offenses.</p>

          <p>The White House has asserted that Canada "caved" to President Trump by revoking its planned digital services tax (DST). The reversal came after Trump threatened to terminate trade negotiations if the tax, which would have affected U.S. tech companies, was implemented. White House officials framed the move as a significant victory for American workers and businesses. Top economic aide Kevin Hassett suggested the U.S. will now pressure other countries to drop similar taxes as part of future trade talks, signaling an aggressive stance against what it deems unfair trade practices targeting American firms.</p>

A Quinnipiac University poll found 55% of voters oppose the bill, with similar results from Fox News and the Pew Research Center. However, polls also show that voters are nearly evenly split on the bill's proposal to add work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Despite broad opposition to the overall package, there is some support for extending certain tax cuts, particularly for lower-income individuals.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order that will lift some U.S. financial sanctions against Syria, a move the White House says is intended to help stabilize the country following the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. The order will terminate a 2004 program that froze Syrian government assets, though other sanctions, including those targeting Assad personally and those related to terrorism and human rights abuses, will remain. The decision follows a meeting between Trump and Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who argued that sanctions were hindering the new transitional government's ability to function.</p>

          <p>This film review describes "Jurassic World Rebirth" as a disappointing and uninspired monster movie that fails to capture the magic of the original. The critic argues the seventh installment, starring Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, is a formulaic rehash with a predictable plot, uninteresting characters, and bloodless action. The movie is criticized for its lack of awe and curiosity about the dinosaurs, relying instead on invented mutants and brazen product placement. Despite a screenplay from the original writer and a capable director, the film is ultimately deemed a soulless and boring entry in the tired franchise.</p>

Human rights groups are concerned that newly established justice commissions are too narrow in scope, focusing only on Assad-era crimes while ignoring those by other groups. The lack of transparency and progress is eroding public trust and fueling a rise in vigilante justice.</p>

          <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have acquired All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey and tight end Jonnu Smith from the Miami Dolphins in a major trade. In exchange, the Dolphins will receive safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and a swap of future draft picks. The deal ends speculation that Ramsey could return to the Los Angeles Rams and signals a significant upgrade to the Steelers' secondary. Smith, who had a career year in 2024, provides another offensive weapon for Pittsburgh, while the Dolphins acquire Fitzpatrick, a three-time All-Pro, to bolster their defense.</p>

          <h2>Senate's Version of Trump Bill Includes New Tax That Could Harm Renewable Energy Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 14:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate's version of President Trump's agenda bill contains a new excise tax on wind and solar projects that could significantly harm the renewable energy industry. According to an industry analysis, the tax could raise consumer energy prices and cost clean energy businesses billions by 2036. The provision, ostensibly aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing by taxing projects using components from countries like China, is being criticized by the industry, unions, and even some conservatives. This new tax, combined with the accelerated sunsetting of existing renewable energy credits, poses a major threat to future clean energy development.</p>

          <h2>Recent Fatalities in ICE Custody Put U.S. on Track for One of the Deadliest Years in Immigration Detention</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 14:07:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is on pace for one of its deadliest years in immigration detention history following the recent deaths of two men from Cuba and Canada while in ICE custody. The fatalities bring the total for the 2025 fiscal year to 13, already surpassing the previous year's total. Advocates and attorneys attribute the rise in deaths to deteriorating conditions within a system strained by the Trump administration's aggressive deportation targets, which have pushed detention facilities far beyond their stated capacity. Critics argue the system is collapsing under the pressure, leading to tragic outcomes for detainees.</p>
