In an interview, he addressed what he sees as a rise of Marxism within the party, the delay in swearing in a new Democratic representative, and the commutation of George Santos's sentence. Johnson maintained that his remarks were focused on the rhetoric and ideology of specific movements, not the individuals themselves, amid heightened political tensions.</p>

          <p>American figure skater Ilia Malinin, nicknamed the "Quad God," began his Olympic season with a commanding performance, winning the Grand Prix de France by an extraordinary 40-point margin.

          <p>President Trump announced the immediate cessation of all U.S. payments and subsidies to Colombia, accusing its president, Gustavo Petro, of being an "illegal drug leader" who fails to stop drug production. The decision follows Petro's claims that recent U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean killed a Colombian fisherman and violated his nation's sovereignty. Trump asserted that Colombia's drug operations cause "death, destruction, and havoc" in the U.S. and warned of further action if they are not shut down.</p>

          <h2>UK Energy Secretary Hints at Potential Cut to VAT on Household Energy Bills</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 08:59:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is actively considering a cut to the 5% VAT on household energy bills as a measure to address the country's ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he refrained from confirming specific plans ahead of the November Budget, he acknowledged the significant affordability challenges facing the nation. This potential tax relief comes as the Labour government continues to promise an average bill reduction of £300 by 2030, emphasizing a long-term shift to home-grown clean energy.</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Distinguish John Bolton's Indictment from Other Cases Against Trump Critics</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal analysts suggest that the federal indictment of former national security adviser John Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified information stands apart from recent charges brought against other prominent critics of Donald Trump. While the timing has raised questions of political motivation, experts argue that the evidence and legal procedures in Bolton's case may indicate a stronger foundation than those against figures like James Comey. The charges focus on serious misconduct over a sustained period, making it a rare but not unprecedented prosecution of a high-ranking official.</p>

          <p>The state of Georgia is confronting a historic surge in demand for electricity, with approximately 80% of the new requirement attributed to the rapid construction of AI datacenters.

          <p>AI startup Anthropic, known for its focus on safety, is contending with challenges from two major fronts: intense competition with its larger rival OpenAI and public criticism from the Trump administration. David Sacks, President Trump's AI advisor, has accused Anthropic of "fear-mongering" to achieve "regulatory capture," contrasting its cautious approach with OpenAI's closer alignment with the White House. The situation highlights a fundamental ideological divide in the AI industry over the balance between rapid innovation and proactive safety regulation.</p>
