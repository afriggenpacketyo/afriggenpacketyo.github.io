        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles experienced intense protests following President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in response to immigration enforcement. Demonstrations, centered in downtown L.A. and spreading to nearby cities, resulted in clashes between protesters and law enforcement, leading to arrests and property damage. Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass criticized the deployment as inflammatory, while police cited similar patterns of civil unrest and defended their response. The events have sparked a political row, with officials trading accusations regarding the handling of the situation. The article details the escalation of the protests, the involvement of various agencies, and the reactions from key political figures, with some protesters setting fire to self-driving cars and clashing with law enforcement officials on the freeway. Optimism in the situation is low, given the violence and the political divide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering extending a ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that involves dragging large nets across the seafloor, in English waters. The proposal aims to expand the ban from 18,000 km2 to 48,000 km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. This plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, and it aligns with a UN Ocean Conference goal to protect a third of international waters by 2030. The move comes amid warnings about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine life and the seabed, and pressure is building for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is still negotiating with the Treasury over her department's budget leading up to the Spending Review.

          <p>ByteDance has parted ways with a senior executive overseeing content moderation for its China-focused apps, as the company advances content security amid stricter censorship requirements from Beijing. Li Tong, who led the Content Quality and Data Service team under Douyin Group, is no longer listed in ByteDance's internal employee system. The CQC team is responsible for overseeing content quality and user experience across multiple products, necessary because "some highly sensitive content cannot be spotted by machine."</p>
