          <p>The Trump administration has paused over $6 billion in federal funding for numerous education programs, including after-school care, teacher training, and support for English language learners. The abrupt freeze, announced just before the new school year, has left states and school districts uncertain about their budgets, potentially forcing them to cut programs and staff. Education advocates and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the move, arguing it will disproportionately harm low-income students and families and may face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global's decision to settle a lawsuit from President Trump for $16 million over a "60 Minutes" interview has drawn sharp criticism from press freedom advocates. The settlement, which avoids a direct payment to Trump but covers legal fees and a donation to his future library, is seen by many as a corporate capitulation to political pressure, potentially to smooth the way for a pending company sale. Critics argue the move sets a dangerous precedent, emboldening powerful figures to use litigation to silence news organizations, while Paramount defends it as a business decision to avoid costly legal battles.</p>

          <p>The major domestic policy bill championed by President Trump, which has passed the Senate, combines extensive tax cuts with significant spending increases on immigration control and defense. The legislation allocates billions to border security, including wall construction, and boosts military funding while also incentivizing fossil fuel production. To partially offset these costs, the bill proposes over $1 trillion in cuts to health and social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which could cause millions to lose coverage and has raised concerns about its impact on the national debt.

          <p>The UK's Parliament has voted to proscribe the direct-action group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization under the Terrorism Act 2000. The move, which now makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison, follows a series of incidents, including a break-in at an RAF base. The decision was supported by the government, which cited the group's "aggressive" and "atrocious acts," but was questioned by some MPs who argued its actions constitute direct action rather than terrorism.</p>

The White House confirmed the pause, citing a need to "put America's interests first" after a review of military stockpiles, though it did not specify which weapons are affected. The move has caused alarm in Kyiv, which is heavily reliant on US aid to defend against ongoing Russian attacks, particularly for its air defense systems, while the Kremlin welcomed the news as a step toward ending the conflict.</p>

While reiterating its full-year outlook, the brewer acknowledged that the current environment makes it difficult to predict consumer behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

While some member states support the ambitious target, others find it unrealistic, and environmental activists have criticized the carbon credit provision as a loophole for polluters.</p>

          <p>A federal jury acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, but found him guilty on two counts of transportation for prostitution. The verdict means Combs avoids a potential life sentence but still faces up to 10 years in prison for each conviction under the Mann Act. Prosecutors had alleged he ran a criminal enterprise that coerced women into sexual encounters, while the defense argued the activities were part of a consensual swinger lifestyle and did not meet the high legal bar for racketeering.</p>
