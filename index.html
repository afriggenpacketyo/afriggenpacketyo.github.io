          <p>A Miami jury has ordered Tesla to pay a significant portion of $329 million in damages after finding the company 33% responsible for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot system. The incident resulted in the death of a 22-year-old woman and serious injuries to her boyfriend. Plaintiffs' attorneys argued that Tesla's marketing of Autopilot was misleading, while Tesla maintained the driver was solely at fault and plans to appeal the verdict, which could set a precedent for numerous similar cases.</p>

The ruling could curtail controversial ICE arrests at courthouses, where migrants attending hearings were being detained for rapid deportation.

          <p>President Trump announced he has ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in "appropriate regions" as a direct response to what he termed "highly provocative statements" from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The move escalates a war of words over the Trump administration's ultimatum for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump stated that words can lead to unintended consequences and that he hopes this action will prevent such an outcome, though the submarines' locations were not disclosed.</p>

          <p>Arkansas State Police have arrested a 28-year-old schoolteacher who they say has admitted to the murders of a couple at Devil's Den state park.

          <p>A contentious debate has been reignited in Germany over whether to raise the national retirement age beyond 67 to address the country's demographic and fiscal challenges. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche's call for people to "work more and longer" has drawn sharp criticism from her Social Democratic coalition partners and trade unions. Opponents argue that such a move would effectively be a pension cut for many workers in physically demanding jobs who are unable to work longer.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed repealing its 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health, a move that takes direct aim at California's climate leadership. The plan would rescind the federal waiver that allows California to set its own, stricter vehicle emissions standards. This authority is the legal foundation for the state's plan to ban new gasoline car sales by 2035, and its repeal would significantly undermine California's efforts to combat air pollution and climate change.</p>

          <p>A clearer, though still highly uncertain, strategy appears to be emerging from the Trump administration's recent wave of tariffs. The approach seems to be using the threat of steep duties to pressure countries into bilateral trade concessions, rewarding those who comply with lower tariffs and punishing those who do not. However, this analysis notes that the entire strategy is fraught with significant legal and economic risks, including pending court challenges and the potential to trigger a recession.</p>
