          <p>Firefighters in southern France have successfully brought a massive wildfire under control. The blaze, located in the Aude department, is the largest to affect the region in decades, having burned over 17,000 hectares and resulted in one death and thirteen injuries. While the fire is contained, around 2,000 firefighters remain on site as it is not yet fully extinguished, and authorities have restricted access to the affected forests. The situation remains tense as a heatwave with temperatures up to 41 degrees Celsius is forecast for the weekend.</p>

          <p>Previously suppressed court documents reveal that Erin Patterson, convicted of murdering three relatives with poisoned mushrooms, had allegedly made multiple prior attempts to kill her estranged husband, Simon Patterson. The allegations, which were not presented to the jury, detail a years-long campaign involving tainted food that left him severely ill on several occasions. Mr. Patterson had narrowly avoided the fatal lunch that killed his family members. A sentencing hearing for the convicted triple-murderer has been scheduled for August 25.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are studying a unique group of individuals known as "SuperAgers," people aged 80 and older who possess the memory capabilities of those decades younger. Research from Northwestern University's SuperAging Program highlights that while most brains shrink and slow with age, the brains of SuperAgers shrink at a much slower rate. This resilience offers valuable insights into resisting cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. The findings, summarized in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, aim to uncover the secrets behind their remarkable mental longevity and apply them to broader health and aging challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a discussion on NPR's It's Been a Minute, cultural critics explored the pervasive issue of smartphone addiction and its effects on the human brain. Studies show that a phone's mere proximity can divert attention, even when silent, as people expend mental energy anticipating notifications. The conversation highlighted a growing trend among young adults, 81% of whom feel they use their phones too much, leading some to embrace simpler "dumbphones" like flip phones or BlackBerrys. Experts suggest that overcoming this dependency requires creating intentional moments of connection away from devices, rather than relying solely on willpower.</p>

          <p>The space industry is experiencing a renewed wave of initial public offerings (IPOs), with several companies like Firefly Aerospace successfully debuting on the stock market. This marks a shift from the recent trend of using special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) for listings. Analysts suggest that despite geopolitical volatility, the timing is ripe for space IPOs, driven by government initiatives, strong investor interest in the sector's growth potential, and high-profile projects. However, challenges remain, including increased competition and vulnerability to trade disputes affecting component costs. (not investment advice)</p>

The move follows Kenyan President William Ruto's state visit to Beijing, where he praised China's role in a "new world order" and secured major trade deals. In response, U.S. Senator Jim Risch proposed an amendment to review the ally status, which provides Kenya with significant military and economic benefits.

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a steep 39% tariff on Swiss imports, citing a $48 billion trade deficit that it argues is inflated by Switzerland's massive gold refining industry. Swiss officials contend that gold should be excluded from trade calculations, as refiners only earn a small processing fee on the metal, which artificially bloats the trade figures. The high tariff, which affects key exports like watches, pharmaceuticals, and chocolate, is expected to significantly harm the Swiss economy. Despite diplomatic efforts, Switzerland failed to secure a deal, and the government is now considering relief measures for its businesses.</p>

With a projected budget deficit of £41.2 billion by 2029-30, analysts argue that sustained tax hikes are the only available lever.

          <p>China has strongly condemned remarks made by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., accusing him of "playing with fire" regarding Taiwan. Marcos had stated that the Philippines would inevitably be drawn into any conflict over Taiwan due to its geographical proximity and the large number of Filipino nationals on the island. Beijing's foreign ministry retorted that these are not valid excuses for interfering in China's internal affairs and urged the Philippines to adhere to the one-China principle.
