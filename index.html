          <p>Lowe's announced stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, indicating a pickup in demand for smaller home projects, though the market for larger renovations remained subdued. This article highlights the retailer's strategic acquisition of Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion, a significant step to expand its lucrative business with home professionals, a steadier customer base. CEO Marvin Ellison observed improved sales trends through the quarter, attributing a July surge to better weather and predicting a market inflection when mortgage rates fall below 6%. Despite a challenging backdrop, Lowe's raised its full-year sales guidance, focusing on online and pro sales growth to move the needle. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly demanded the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, following serious allegations of mortgage fraud brought forth by Bill Pulte, director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte's accusations, detailed in a letter to the Justice Department, claim Cook falsified bank and property records to secure more favorable loan terms for two residences. This article places the controversy within the context of Trump's broader campaign to pressure the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates, a decision Cook helps make as a member of the FOMC. Despite the call for her departure, analysts believe Cook is unlikely to resign before the September Fed meeting, as a legal probe would likely continue irrespective of her employment status.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former U.S. intelligence officials, acting on President Trump's directive. The article states that Gabbard accused these officials of politicizing intelligence, leaking classified information, or committing egregious violations of tradecraft standards, though no specific evidence against individuals was provided. This action extends the Trump administration's pattern of targeting intelligence community members, particularly those who assessed Russian interference in the 2016 election. Critics, including Democrats, view these revocations as politically motivated attempts to distract from other issues and undermine the intelligence community's credibility.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced a second day of significant market rotation, moving away from high-performing tech stocks towards value-based and previously lagging sectors. This article notes that while the rotation feels "awful" for investors, CNBC Investing Club's Jeff Marks described it as a "healthy correction" that typically lasts about three days. Major tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia saw declines, but some value stocks such as DuPont and Bristol Myers Squibb showed gains. The article also mentions Lowe's acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, reflecting a broader trend among retailers to target the pro contracting space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>World Boxing, the international governing body for the sport, has implemented a new policy mandating sex testing to ensure only biological females compete in women's categories. This article details that the decision was prompted by global controversy surrounding two boxers who previously failed sex tests and subsequently won Olympic gold medals. World Boxing President Boris van der Vorst stated the policy prioritizes safety and competitive fairness in a combat sport. National teams are now responsible for providing chromosomal sex certification for their athletes, with failure to comply resulting in ineligibility or potential sanctions for the athlete and national team.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares plummeted into bear market territory, marking their longest losing streak since April 2024, with a 20% drop from recent highs. This article attributes the decline to a broader market selloff and a critical short-seller report from Citron Research, which deemed the company "detached from fundamentals." Despite Palantir's recent success, including its first $1 billion revenue quarter and entry into the S&P 500, the report argues its valuation is excessive compared to AI leaders. Concerns persist over its high forward price-to-earnings ratio, suggesting the stock remains expensive even after the significant price correction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have successfully developed a honeybee "superfood" aimed at bolstering bee colonies against significant threats such as climate change and habitat loss. This article reports that trials demonstrated remarkable results, with colonies fed the supplement yielding up to 15 times more baby bees that successfully matured into adulthood. Professor Geraldine Wright of the University of Oxford, a senior author, lauded the innovation as a "huge accomplishment," emphasizing its ability to provide all essential nutrients for bees even during pollen scarcity. This breakthrough offers a vital solution to severe global honeybee declines, which critically impact the pollination of 70% of leading global crops.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of Florida and University College London indicates a significant and concerning trend: daily reading for pleasure among U.S. adults has declined by over 40% in the past two decades. This article reports a consistent annual drop of approximately 3% from 2003 to 2023, raising alarms given reading's established links to well-being and mental health. While digital distractions play a role, researchers also point to a broader decrease in national leisure time and disparities in access to books. Furthermore, the study highlights surprisingly low rates of adults reading to children, suggesting a potential contributing factor to future literacy declines.</p>

The ruling complicates the Home Office's goal to cease hotel use, which currently houses 32,000 asylum seekers at an annual cost of £5.4 billion, underscoring the government's ongoing struggle with asylum backlogs and suitable housing alternatives.</p>
