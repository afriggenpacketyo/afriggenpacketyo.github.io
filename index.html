          <p>Russian forces conducted a large-scale overnight attack on Kyiv, resulting in three fatalities, including a child, and 12 injuries, with damage reported to residential buildings and a kindergarten. This "massive attack" occurred as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief negotiators prepared for talks in New York with US representatives to discuss security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire. Ukraine seeks concrete protections against future aggression, with European nations pledging non-NATO peacekeeping roles and the US signaling support. The article highlights the grim reality of escalating conflict, with explosions also reported in other cities, contrasting sharply with the parallel diplomatic efforts aimed at securing a future peace framework and demonstrating global resolve against continued Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>A commemorative train ride from Chicago to Mississippi marked 70 years since the brutal lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till, an event that galvanized the modern Civil Rights Movement. Among the passengers was Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., Till's cousin and the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping, who emphasized the importance of remembering history to acknowledge progress and the distance still to go. Till's mother, Mamie Till, famously insisted on an open-casket funeral, with photos of his body published nationwide, credited with sparking a pivotal moment in the fight for civil rights. Despite the acquittal of his murderers and a later confession from the accuser that her allegations were false, the article highlights the ongoing need for healing in America and the enduring legacy of Till's sacrifice, ensuring he "didn't die in vain."</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a morning Mass, marking the start of the school year, resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and injuries to 17 others, including 14 children. The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the back of the church after firing a rifle through the windows. Law enforcement is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, though a specific motive remains unknown. The article details the heroic actions of school staff who protected children, the profound community impact of this deliberate act of violence, and the widespread calls for action to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank maintained its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, primarily to assess persistent housing market risks in Seoul and rising household debt, aligning with economists' expectations. Despite stable inflation and "modest improvement" in economic growth, the Bank of Korea emphasized the need for close monitoring of home prices, which had spiked earlier in the year. The article notes the central bank upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2%, citing a recovery in domestic demand due to a supplementary budget and improved consumer sentiment. Analysts anticipate potential rate cuts in late 2025 or early 2026 to stabilize rates around 2%, with exports also showing favorable movements despite potential impacts from US tariffs.

          <p>Europe is enduring its worst wildfire season on record, with one million hectares burned across the EU so far this year, significantly impacting Spain and Portugal where roughly 1% of the Iberian Peninsula has been scorched.

The article highlights that rural depopulation in affected regions also contributes by leaving unmanaged, flammable vegetation, increasing vulnerability to intense blazes. Experts warn of continued extreme fires and threats to ecosystem stability, emphasizing the urgent need to reduce fossil fuel burning and improve fire management to mitigate further environmental damage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pre-owned Tesla Cybertrucks are experiencing an "unprecedented" plummet in value, with average prices falling by nearly 30% to just over $84,000 within the last year, reflecting a broader downturn for all used Tesla vehicles. Experts attribute this trend partly to CEO Elon Musk's leadership and a significant decrease in new car sales for the company in 2025. Despite initial hype and a teased sub-$40,000 price, the Cybertruck's release price doubled that estimate, leading some to question its long-term viability. The article highlights that Tesla even stopped accepting Cybertrucks as trade-ins, signaling severe market challenges for the distinctive vehicle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, signaling sustained demand for AI infrastructure, yet its stock slipped in extended trading due to a data center revenue miss for the second consecutive period. The company projects $54 billion in revenue for the current quarter, excluding H20 shipments to China, and anticipates $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. While overall revenue surged 56% year-over-year, this marked its slowest growth in nine quarters since the generative AI boom began. The article highlights that large cloud providers account for half of Nvidia's data center business, primarily buying its latest Blackwell chips, and the company's board approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases, reflecting continued confidence despite the stock dip.

ICE raids, like one described in Mount Pleasant, target individuals suspected of being in the country illegally, leading to protests from locals who view these actions as "brutalizing people" and "a Donald Trump dominance performance."
