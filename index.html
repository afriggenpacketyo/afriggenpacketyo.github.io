          <p>Amid ongoing conflict, Germany has pledged to help facilitate the provision of five Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine, an increase from its previous commitment. The announcement came during a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, as Kyiv continues to face intense Russian air assaults. Meanwhile, China has criticized new EU sanctions against Russia that impact Chinese businesses, threatening negative consequences. In a separate development, an Italian venue canceled a concert by a pro-Kremlin conductor following public and political condemnation.</p>

          <p>The sandwich chain Subway has named Jonathan Fitzpatrick, a former Burger King executive, as its new CEO. Fitzpatrick previously led Driven Brands, an automotive company also backed by Subway's owner, Roark Capital. The leadership change occurs as the fast-food industry grapples with reduced consumer spending and intense competition. Subway, despite being the largest U.S. chain by store count, has seen its market share decline and sales fall in recent years, presenting significant challenges for the incoming leader.</p>

          <h2>Understanding IRS Rules: Filing an Extension Does Not Delay Tax Payment Deadline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 11:37:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies a common misunderstanding about filing for a tax extension with the IRS. While an extension grants more time to submit tax forms, it does not postpone the deadline for paying any taxes owed, which remains April 15th. Failing to pay by the original date can result in penalties and interest charges accruing on the unpaid balance. The article advises taxpayers to estimate and pay as much of their tax liability as possible by the deadline and outlines several IRS programs, such as installment agreements, for those facing financial hardship.

          <p>A group of anonymous Columbia University faculty members has sent a letter to university leadership, urging the implementation of meaningful reforms to combat antisemitism on campus. This comes as the White House is reportedly nearing a deal to restore federal funding, which was rescinded due to concerns over potential civil rights violations. The faculty's demands include accountability for professors promoting antisemitic narratives and consequences for students involved in disruptive protests. A senior White House official indicated that such measures could be part of the final agreement with the university.</p>

          <p>England has named spinner Liam Dawson to its team for the fourth Test against India, marking his return to Test cricket after an eight-year absence. The 35-year-old left-armer replaces Shoaib Bashir, who is out with a broken finger, and is expected to strengthen England's lower-order batting. England currently leads the five-Test series 2-1 and needs a victory in Manchester to secure their first five-Test series win since 2018. Pace bowler Chris Woakes will retain his spot in the lineup, holding off a challenge from Gus Atkinson.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's soccer, as seen in Euro 2025, teams from Eastern Europe have struggled to achieve the same level of success as their Western European counterparts. This article explores the reasons for this disparity, pointing to a combination of historical, cultural, and financial factors. Experts suggest that a lack of investment, infrastructure, and societal acceptance have held the sport back in the region. However, there are positive signs of change, with increased funding from UEFA and local associations beginning to yield tangible results and grow the game.</p>

The regulator's report highlights that children now watch significantly more content on YouTube than on all public service broadcasters combined. Ofcom is calling on broadcasters and YouTube to work together to make PSM content, particularly news and children's programming, more prominent and easier to find on the platform. The regulator also suggested the government should consider legislation to enforce this if necessary.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has released an emergency fix for a critical vulnerability in its SharePoint software that hackers were actively exploiting in widespread attacks. The breach reportedly affected businesses, universities, and at least two U.S. government agencies.

While a patch is available for newer versions of SharePoint, a fix for the 2016 version is still in development, leaving some systems vulnerable.</p>
