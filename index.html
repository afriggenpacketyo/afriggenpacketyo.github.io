          <p>A federal judge ruled against President Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with California's argument that the president erred in activating the guard. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The ruling could be appealed, but it is a setback for the White House in the dispute over immigration enforcement. This article details the legal challenge to the deployment of the National Guard. </p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs May Have Been Domesticated in China as Early as Neolithic Period</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, potentially challenging the conventional view that domestication first occurred in the Near East. The study, analyzing two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, found evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. This discovery indicates that the domestication process of wild boars coincided with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. The article presents new insights into the history of animal domestication. </p>
