          <p>An Air India passenger plane en route to London Gatwick crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, resulting in the deaths of 241 passengers and crew, as well as eight people on the ground. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed into a residential area, striking a doctors' hostel and causing significant damage and casualties; Vishwashkumar Ramesh, a British man, was the sole survivor. Investigations are underway to determine the cause of the crash, with a focus on potential issues with the plane's wing flaps during takeoff, and authorities have recovered the flight data recorder. Air India and the Tata Group have offered support to the families of the victims, and the aviation regulator has ordered safety checks on the airline's Boeing-787 fleet. </p>

          <p>This article examines the role of debt relief companies in managing credit card debt, highlighting both their potential benefits and drawbacks. Debt relief companies primarily negotiate with creditors to reduce the total amount owed through debt settlement or offer debt consolidation programs, which can be helpful for individuals facing financial hardships such as job loss or medical emergencies. However, these companies cannot guarantee settlements, prevent credit score damage, or stop legal action from creditors, and they often charge fees only after successfully settling a debt. Ultimately, the article advises consumers to carefully research debt relief options and understand the potential impacts on their credit and finances before enrolling in any program.

          <p>Anker Innovations is recalling over 1.1 million of its PowerCore 10000 portable chargers due to the risk of the lithium-ion batteries overheating, potentially causing fires and explosions. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reported 19 incidents involving these chargers, including minor burn injuries and significant property damage. Consumers are urged to immediately stop using the recalled power banks, which were sold online between June 2016 and December 2022, and contact Anker for a free replacement after providing proof of disposal. The recall highlights the fire risks associated with lithium-ion batteries and the importance of proper disposal methods to prevent further incidents.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli missile strikes on Iran that killed senior military leaders, Iran launched approximately 100 drones toward Israeli territory, prompting interceptions by Jordan. The Israeli attacks, targeting nuclear enrichment facilities, occurred shortly before planned nuclear deal talks, marking a significant escalation since the Iran-Iraq war. Amid the rising tensions, former U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to negotiate a deal to prevent further attacks, while Iranian state media reported additional Israeli strikes on a military airport in Tabriz.

Johnson stated that this is just one step towards a more responsible government that prioritizes American taxpayers' interests, and he anticipates Senate approval. The package is one of several ways Republicans are codifying DOGE cuts, with more expected in the future, and the CBO reports say that the bill will benefit the rich and cut resources for the poor.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily reversed a judge's ruling that would have returned control of California's National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, following President Trump's decision to federalize the guard to suppress protests in Los Angeles. The appeals court's decision pauses the temporary restraining order until an emergency hearing, allowing Trump to maintain control of the guard for now, and the case involves a lawsuit challenging Trump's authority to deploy the National Guard over Newsom's objections. The initial ruling found that Trump failed to demonstrate a rebellion in Los Angeles and did not properly notify the governor, while the appeals court has temporarily sided with the justice department.</p>

          <p>Alexander Dighton, a 28-year-old man from Pontyclun, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 22 years for attempting to murder a police officer outside Talbot Green police station. Dighton, who was wearing body armor and armed with Molotov cocktails, injured several officers during the attack, and the court heard that he was motivated by anti-government ideology. Counter-terrorism police said Dighton was interviewed by officers a year before the attack but was not believed to be a threat, and the judge said Dighton's crimes had terrorist connections.</p>
