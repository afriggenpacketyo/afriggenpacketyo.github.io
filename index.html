          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for a large town hall event at Brooklyn College. The two progressive politicians addressed a crowd of approximately 1,700, speaking out against the influence of billionaires and corporate interests in politics. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, outlined his platform which includes rent freezes and higher taxes for the wealthy, while Sanders praised the campaign as a grassroots movement essential for the future of American democracy. The event highlighted the growing progressive wing of the Democratic party and its focus on mobilizing working-class voters against what they term oligarchic control.</p>

          <p>During the Michigan Wolverines' game against the Oklahoma Sooners, an ESPN announcer's praise for kicker Dominic Zvada appeared to jinx a crucial field goal attempt. Announcer Chris Fowler highlighted Zvada's reliability on what he called a "chip shot" kick, only for Zvada to miss the 32-yard attempt. The moment added to a difficult night for Michigan, which ultimately lost to Oklahoma 24-13. The game saw a strong performance from Oklahoma's quarterback John Mateer, who contributed both passing and rushing touchdowns to secure the win for the Sooners.</p>

The winning numbers were 11, 23, 44, 61, and 62, with a Powerball of 17.

          <p>Russian forces conducted a series of overnight drone and missile strikes across multiple Ukrainian cities, resulting in at least two deaths and several injuries. In Kyiv, falling debris from intercepted drones caused fires in residential buildings, and officials reported that a one-year-old child was among the deceased. Explosions were also reported in Odesa, Kharkiv, and other major cities, with Ukrainian officials stating that civilian areas were deliberately targeted. In retaliation, Ukrainian drones reportedly struck an oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished without casualties.</p>

          <p>A summary of UK newspaper headlines reveals several key government initiatives and public concerns. The Sunday Telegraph reports that the new Home Secretary plans to move asylum seekers from hotels to former military bases to address the small boats crisis.

          <p>The case of Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman accused of setting her house on fire and running over her husband as he escaped, is detailed in a "48 Hours" report. Initially convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to life, Stermer's conviction was overturned by a federal judge who cited an unfair trial due to ineffective legal counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. However, prosecutors refiled the charges, and a second trial in 2025 resulted in another guilty verdict, sending her back to prison. The case remains divisive, with her sons convinced of her guilt and her daughters maintaining her innocence, pointing to evidence suggesting her husband may have started the fire himself.</p>

          <p>A joint team of US and Chinese researchers has developed an innovative method to launch small, millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they release a powerful burst of energy capable of launching tiny jumpers up to five feet into the air. This technique offers a new, efficient launching mechanism that can be precisely controlled by manipulating the laser's light.</p>

          <p>Organizers have canceled several major Mexican Independence Day celebrations in Chicago due to community fears surrounding Donald Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops and additional federal immigration agents to the city. Events like El Grito Chicago, which attracted 24,000 people last year, were called off to protect the community from potential large-scale immigration enforcement actions. The planned federal surge has created significant anxiety among the city's large Mexican-American population, despite peaceful protests being held against the administration's policy. Local officials, including the Illinois governor, have expressed concern that the timing of the deployment is meant to target these cultural celebrations.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report from Portugal's accident investigation bureau indicates that a snapped cable was the primary factor in the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon that killed 16 people. The report, released Saturday, states that the connecting cable between the two cabins gave way shortly after they began moving, causing the upper carriage to derail and crash into a building. Investigators noted that a visual inspection of the cable and braking systems had been conducted on the morning of the accident and had detected no anomalies. Two separate investigations, one technical and one by the prosecutor's office, are underway to determine the precise cause of the failure.</p>

          <p>Both Ukraine and Russia are extensively using decoy military equipment, from inflatable tanks to plywood artillery, as a key tactic in their ongoing war. These full-scale models are designed to trick the enemy into wasting expensive ammunition, such as drones and missiles, on worthless targets. Ukrainian volunteer groups are producing large numbers of fake M777 howitzers, which can be assembled quickly on the front line to draw Russian fire. Similarly, Russia deploys imitation drones to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, with some estimates suggesting that up to half of the weapons in certain Russian attacks are decoys.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his computer skills, Acutis created websites to document Catholic miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His path to sainthood was fast-tracked after the Vatican attributed two miracles to his intercession. His story is seen by the Church as a way to connect with and inspire younger generations, blending modern interests like video games and the internet with traditional faith.</p>

          <p>The U.S. men's national soccer team suffered a listless 2-0 defeat to South Korea in a friendly match, continuing a string of disappointing results and raising concerns with the World Cup approaching. The team, featuring an experimental, MLS-heavy roster, struggled with defensive communication and failed to capitalize on scoring opportunities. South Korea's Son Heung-min scored the opening goal, exploiting significant gaps in the American defense. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino defended the team's ongoing evaluation process, stating that the priority is to be ready when the World Cup begins, not necessarily to win every preparatory match.</p>

          <p>With Dame Anna Wintour stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue after nearly four decades, the iconic fashion magazine faces a critical juncture in maintaining its cultural relevance. Wintour, who will remain as global editorial director, is credited with transforming Vogue by bridging high fashion with mainstream culture, famously featuring pop stars and celebrities on its cover. Her successor, Chloe Malle, takes over in a challenging media landscape where monthly print publications compete with the instant-gratification of social media. The transition prompts questions about whether Vogue's influence was tied more to Wintour's personal brand than the magazine itself.</p>

During his visit, the Duke of Sussex will announce a significant donation to the charity Children in Need. The trip has also led to speculation about a potential reconciliation with his father, King Charles, as both are expected to be in the country at the same time. This marks Harry's first visit since April, and while no official meeting has been confirmed, recent signs suggest tensions may be easing.</p>

          <p>The volume of international postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by more than 80% following the Trump administration's decision to end a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) reported that the rule change, which took effect in August 2025, requires customs duties to be collected on parcels valued under $800, a task that many foreign postal operators and carriers are not equipped to handle. As a result, 88 postal operators have suspended some or all services to the U.S., causing major operational disruptions and a near-halt to the flow of international mail. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border system, known as the Entry/Exit System (EES), starting this autumn. The system will track the entry and exit of non-EU citizens in the 29-country Schengen Area, replacing the manual stamping of passports. On their first entry under the new system, travelers from countries like the UK will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial image, at automated kiosks. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, there are concerns that the initial registration process could lead to significant delays at key border points like the Port of Dover and Eurostar terminals.</p>

          <p>Singapore is facing a critical threat from rising sea levels, which are projected to increase by up to 1.15 meters by 2100, potentially inundating 30% of the island nation. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has described the situation as a "life and death" matter, emphasizing that safeguarding the country's existence is the top priority. Unlike larger nations, Singapore cannot retreat inland, as its coasts are home to critical infrastructure like airports and power plants. In response, the government is investing billions of dollars in comprehensive coastal defense projects, including land reclamation, seawalls, and barriers to protect against the encroaching seas.</p>

          <p>Sean Dickson delivered a stunning late-game performance to lead Somerset to a dramatic victory over the Birmingham Bears in the T20 Blast quarter-final. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four, securing the win with just one ball to spare. His unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls was crucial after Somerset's run chase had faltered. The Bears had set a competitive target of 190, largely thanks to a rapid 71 from captain Alex Davies, but were ultimately denied as Somerset advanced to their record-equalling 11th Finals Day appearance.</p>
