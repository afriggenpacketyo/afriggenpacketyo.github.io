          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is reportedly considering former U.S. Representative Jamaal Bowman to lead the city's school system. The potential appointment is controversial due to Bowman's past statements, including calling standardized tests a "form of modern-day slavery" and his defense of anti-Israel rhetoric. Bowman, a former school principal, has also faced criticism for denying atrocities committed by Hamas and honoring a convicted murderer on a school project. This article highlights the political alignment between Mamdani and Bowman, both of whom hold contentious views on Israel and other progressive issues.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has found Tesla partially liable in a wrongful death case, ordering the company to pay $200 million in punitive and approximately $43 million in compensatory damages. The lawsuit stemmed from a 2019 crash where a man driving a Model S with Autopilot engaged ran through an intersection, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend. Plaintiffs' attorneys argued that defects in the Autopilot system were a significant factor, presenting recovered data showing the car was aware of the impending collision but failed to act. Tesla has called the verdict wrong and plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian demonstrators, including several elected officials, were arrested during a protest outside Senator Chuck Schumer's office in New York City. Organized by groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, the activists used pots and pans in a noise protest, demanding an end to the bombing in Gaza and the allowance of humanitarian aid. This demonstration was one of several coordinated across major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Houston, aimed at raising awareness of the humanitarian crisis. The protests reflect ongoing activism nearly two years after the start of Israel's military campaign in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market showed signs of a significant slowdown as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, well below economists' forecasts of 115,000. The Labor Department also made substantial downward revisions for May and June, reducing previously reported job gains by a combined 258,000. With the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2%, analysts suggest the weak performance reflects the economic impact of escalating trade tariffs. The soft report increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve may consider cutting interest rates at its next meeting to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

During arguments, a three-judge panel sharply questioned the Justice Department's claim that the 14th Amendment does not grant citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented parents, citing an 1898 Supreme Court precedent. This follows a similar ruling from the Ninth Circuit, making it the second appeals court to challenge the policy. The order, which directs agencies to deny citizenship to children without at least one parent who is a citizen or permanent resident, is likely headed for a final decision at the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just after the agency released a report showing a major slowdown in hiring. In a social media post, Trump baselessly accused McEntarfer, a Biden appointee confirmed in 2024, of faking statistics and manipulating numbers for political reasons. The move came after the July jobs report showed only 73,000 jobs were added and previous months' figures were revised down significantly. Economists have voiced alarm over the firing, calling it a disastrous move that threatens the integrity of non-partisan federal economic data.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a weaker-than-expected jobs report. The report, which also included significant downward revisions for prior months, intensified concerns about the economic impact of Trump's tariff policies, which contributed to a global stock market sell-off. Trump accused the commissioner of manipulating data, a move that has raised alarms about political interference in the production of crucial economic statistics.

This move is seen as logically incoherent, as Trump simultaneously claims the economy is strong while demanding the Federal Reserve act as if it's weak.

          <p>An individual was fatally shot by security forces while attempting to illegally enter Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Arizona. According to officials, the non-military civilian was driving erratically and failed to stop at the main gate in the early morning. After the vehicle crashed into a deployed barrier and was put in reverse, a member of the 355th Security Forces Squadron shot the suspect. The wing commander stated that the security personnel acted in accordance with their training and policy to ensure the installation's security, while also expressing regret for the loss of life.</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order imposing new tariffs on over 90 countries has elicited a range of reactions from business leaders worldwide, from shock to cautious relief. While Mexico received a 90-day reprieve, Canada faces a tariff hike to 35%, and Switzerland was hit with a surprise 39% levy. The EU negotiated a 15% rate, but Brazil saw its proposed tariff jump to 50%. This article details the varied impacts, with business leaders in affected nations expressing concerns about rising costs for consumers, disruptions to supply chains, and significant uncertainty for future trade.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A ruling from the European Court of Justice has dealt a significant blow to Italy's plan to process asylum seekers in offshore centers in Albania. The court found that Italy's method for designating a migrant's home country as "safe" for return violates EU law, as it must apply to the entire population and be independently verifiable. This "safe country" concept is central to the Italy-Albania deal, which aimed for accelerated processing and deportation. The ruling effectively halts the plan until Italy revises its laws, a development being watched closely by other European governments considering similar offshore asylum policies.</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple has welcomed a baby boy who developed from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, likely setting a new record for the longest storage time before a live birth. The process, known as embryo adoption, involved Linda and Tim Pierce using an embryo donated in 1994 by another woman who had undergone IVF. The concept is gaining traction, particularly among groups who oppose the destruction of leftover embryos. This successful birth highlights advancements in fertility science and raises questions about the future of the estimated 1.5 million frozen embryos in storage across the U.S.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging its actions targeting gender-affirming healthcare for minors. The suit supports children's hospitals and doctors who have faced pressure from the administration to cease providing such care. The legal challenge contends that the administration has acted illegally in its efforts to restrict access to these medical services. This lawsuit represents a significant state-level pushback against the federal government's policies on transgender healthcare and the rights of minors to receive it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Oxford University has found that some birds that are typically monogamous may effectively "divorce" their partners. The research focused on a common European songbird and observed that pairs would sometimes separate and find new mates between breeding seasons. This behavior challenges the traditional understanding of lifelong monogamy in certain bird species. The findings provide new insights into avian social behaviors and the complex factors that influence mate selection and partnership duration in the animal kingdom, suggesting that pairing strategies can be more flexible than previously thought.</p>

          <p>This article features an interview with the economist who first coined the acronym BRIC to describe the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. He discusses how his original concept of an economic bloc has evolved into the current BRICS alliance, which has expanded to include South Africa and several other nations. The interview also explores the reasons behind the significant animosity that President Trump has directed toward the alliance. The economist provides context on the group's goals and its position as a counterweight to Western-dominated financial institutions.</p>

          <p>Newly revised data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals that the U.S. labor market's performance over the past three months was the worst since 2010, outside of the pandemic. The downward revisions show that the economic resilience cited by the Trump administration in the face of its own tariff policies was largely a mirage. This article argues that the mystery of the strong economy has been solved: it wasn't actually that strong. The weaker data, combined with rising inflation, points toward a stagflationary environment, undercutting the administration's claims of an economic boom.</p>

          <p>Amazon's latest earnings report beat most expectations, but weaker profit guidance and underwhelming cloud growth caused its stock to slide. Key takeaways include a significant increase in capital expenditures to over $100 billion for the year, primarily to support AI infrastructure. Its cloud division, AWS, grew 18%, trailing the growth rates of rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. On a positive note, the company appears to be navigating new U.S. tariffs better than feared, with strong online sales and a positive revenue forecast suggesting consumer demand remains healthy.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve holds its benchmark rate steady, interest rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain high, though not as high as they were in August 2024. This article provides a direct comparison of potential earnings on a $10,000 CD for various terms. For example, a 2-year CD opened last year at 5.72% would have earned significantly more than one opened now at 4.10%. Despite the decline, the article concludes that CDs still represent a strong savings option compared to variable-rate or traditional accounts in the current economic climate.
