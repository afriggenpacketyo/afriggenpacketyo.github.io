          <p>South Korea's Kospi stock index reached a new record high for the third consecutive day, fueled by optimism surrounding ongoing trade discussions with the U.S., a notable performance amidst wider losses in other Asian markets. The index hit an intraday high of 3,794.87, although the Kosdaq pared its earlier gains. This upward trend for South Korea's market contrasted with declines seen on Wall Street and in other Asia-Pacific regions, where concerns over the banking sector and trade tensions intensified. Additionally, Singapore reported a significant rebound in non-oil domestic exports for September, exceeding forecasts and reversing a previous fall, contributing to a mixed but generally positive economic outlook in parts of Asia.

          <p>The three leading candidates for New York City mayor, Mamdani, Cuomo, and Sliwa, engaged in a heated debate less than three weeks before the election, clashing significantly on critical issues. Public safety, particularly Mamdani's past calls to defund the police, and his "freeze the rent" housing plan drew sharp criticism from his opponents. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, also faced questions about his previous statements on Israel, asserting he has denounced Hamas repeatedly. Cuomo challenged Mamdani's inexperience, while Sliwa positioned himself as an outsider, criticizing both as professional politicians. This fiery exchange underscored the deep divisions and the tightening race for the nation's largest city.</p>

          <p>Virginia's Attorney General candidates, Republican incumbent Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones, engaged in their only debate, which was largely overshadowed by Jones' leaked incendiary text messages. Miyares intensely questioned Jones about messages that included violent rhetoric towards a Republican delegate, asserting such conduct disqualified him from holding the state's top legal office. Jones offered an apology, expressing shame and embarrassment, but also deflected by pointing to former President Trump's incendiary language and Miyares' perceived lack of accountability for it. The debate also covered legal issues like clean energy and public safety, underscoring the high stakes and competitive nature of this pivotal statewide contest.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral debate presented several key takeaways, prominently featuring the looming presence of former President Trump's threats to the city, which all candidates pledged to resist. A significant point of contention arose over the candidates' experience and integrity, as Andrew Cuomo questioned Mamdani's qualifications, while Mamdani countered by criticizing Cuomo's integrity. Heated discussions also unfolded concerning Israel and the Gaza ceasefire, with Mamdani clarifying previous statements and Cuomo pressing for stronger condemnations of Hamas. Republican Curtis Sliwa sought to distinguish himself by attacking both his rivals and the established political system, underscoring the contentious nature of the race.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) reported a remarkable 39.1% increase in third-quarter profit, surpassing estimates and establishing a new record, primarily propelled by the sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence chips.

CEO C.C. Wei highlighted the strengthening conviction in the AI megatrend, which prompted an upward revision of the 2025 revenue growth forecast and increased investments in capacity expansion. TSMC is actively monitoring U.S. tariff policies but anticipates some exemptions due to its substantial investments in U.S. facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

Hanover Park Mayor Rodney Craig, however, defended the officer's hiring, emphasizing that thorough due diligence, including FBI and Illinois State Police background checks, confirmed his legal work authorization and revealed no criminal history.

          <p>A recent phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, culminating in an agreement for a summit in Budapest, has introduced significant uncertainty for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy before his scheduled White House meeting. Ukraine is enduring severe Russian missile and drone attacks, causing extensive damage to infrastructure and nationwide power outages, prompting Zelenskyy to urgently seek enhanced American military assistance, specifically long-range Tomahawk missiles. The unexpected Trump-Putin dialogue, reportedly at Russia's behest, discussed the Ukrainian crisis and potential trade, which analysts suggest could signal a softening in Trump's position and cast doubt on the provision of advanced weaponry to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>China has significantly escalated its leverage in the trade war with the U.S. by implementing sweeping new curbs on its rare earth exports, requiring government approval and declared use for these critical minerals. This move underscores China's near-monopoly in processing rare earths, which are indispensable for a wide array of technologies, including advanced military equipment and consumer electronics. U.S. President Trump responded with threats of substantial tariffs, while China dismissed U.S. reactions as "unnecessary misunderstanding and panic." Analysts believe these restrictions strategically target American supply chain vulnerabilities, granting Beijing a strong upper hand in forthcoming trade negotiations, despite the modest economic contribution of rare earths to China's GDP.

The article delves into how the growing trend of sauna business meetings normalizes perspiration as a means of bonding and fostering creativity, echoing historical "sauna diplomacy." While past marketing instilled shame, contemporary body positivity movements and a deeper scientific appreciation for sweat's cooling benefits are reshaping perceptions, though some argue commercial interests are capitalizing on this newfound openness.</p>

          <p>Two suspects have been arrested in Florida in connection with an armed home invasion where they allegedly utilized an Apple AirTag to meticulously track their victims' SUV. Authorities stated the suspects attached the AirTag under the vehicle's bumper, followed the couple to their Odessa home, and attempted to force them into their garage. The house alarm's activation prompted the suspects to flee the scene. Crucially, investigators were able to identify and apprehend the individuals because they had used their personal names, phone numbers, and email addresses to purchase and register the AirTag. This case underscores the importance of awareness regarding tracking technologies, with advice for both iPhone and Android users on detecting unknown AirTags.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County has confirmed two cases of Clade I mpox, a potentially more severe and easily transmissible strain, marking its unprecedented detection in the U.S. among individuals without recent international travel to high-risk regions. Both patients required hospitalization but are currently recovering at home. Clade I is particularly concerning due to its potential for causing more severe illness and spreading more readily through various forms of close personal contact, including massage or cuddling, in addition to sexual contact, contrasting with the Clade II strain responsible for the 2022 global outbreak. Health officials are urging vigilance, immediate medical evaluation for unexplained rashes, and widespread vaccination for eligible, at-risk populations.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actress and now debut novelist Reese Witherspoon discusses her new adult thriller, "Gone Before Goodbye," co-written with Harlan Coben, emphasizing her commitment to crafting a female protagonist defined by unique intellectual skills rather than conventional sex appeal. Inspired by her childhood observations of female roles in James Bond films, Witherspoon's novel features Maggie, a talented surgeon entangled in a dangerous conspiracy. She draws parallels to her own career challenges and highlights her production company, Hello Sunshine, which is dedicated to promoting complex female narratives. Both authors have hinted at a future adaptation, with Coben playfully suggesting Witherspoon as the ideal choice for Maggie's role.</p>

          <p>Uganda's Special Forces Command (SFC), an elite military unit, is increasingly viewed as a private army instrumental in sustaining President Yoweri Museveni's enduring power and his burgeoning family dynasty. Government critics accuse the SFC of widespread abduction, torture, and killing of opposition activists, allegations the unit denies, yet its growing influence is reportedly causing significant resentment among senior generals. With Museveni seeking re-election and his son, Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba, serving as army chief and a potential successor, concerns are intensifying over the SFC's recruitment along ethnic lines and the potential for internal military conflicts in a post-Museveni era, raising questions about the country's stability.</p>

          <p>China's extensive property market is anticipated to experience a continued decline through at least 2026, according to S&P Global Ratings. The firm projects an 8% decrease in nationwide primary property sales in 2025, followed by an additional 6-7% drop in 2026, primarily attributed to persistently soft overall demand. This prolonged downturn is expected to exert intensified pressure on numerous Chinese developers, who are already grappling with the dual challenge of delivering homes and meeting their significant debt obligations. As an example, Cifi's plan to restructure its existing debts, issue new bonds, and provide cash payments to creditors aims to bolster its capital structure and reduce its offshore liabilities.

          <p>President Trump's unprecedented public acknowledgment of authorizing CIA covert operations in Venezuela has ignited significant concerns regarding the broad scope and potential ramifications of such actions. Experts suggest that a presidential finding could afford the agency extensive latitude for various operations, ranging from lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers to broader efforts aimed at destabilizing or toppling the Maduro regime, all without requiring direct congressional approval. Historically, similar findings have precipitated drone strikes, the funneling of money and weapons to insurgencies, and even full-scale regime change. Former CIA and defense officials caution about a "slippery slope" and the inherent lack of limitations, noting that any restrictions are executive orders subject to presidential modification.</p>

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, the commanding officer of the U.S. military's Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), is set to abruptly retire at the end of the year, significantly less than a year into his typical three-year posting. This unexpected departure occurs amid escalating U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean and intensifying tensions with Venezuela. Reports indicate underlying friction between Admiral Holsey and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, with Holsey reportedly having voiced concerns about the mission and the attacks on alleged drug boats. Senator Jack Reed, a leading Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, characterized Holsey's resignation as deeply troubling, expressing fears that the administration is overlooking seasoned military advice during a period of potential U.S. confrontation with Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Two individuals linked to a notorious street gang have been convicted for a gruesome, coordinated attack in Lake Forest, California, in 2018, which began as a couple enjoyed an early-morning hot tub soak. Jose Rafael Andrademembreno and Edwin Diaz, allegedly shouting allegiance to MS-13, brutally stabbed Marco Morales multiple times with a machete, pursuing him through his apartment building until his skull was pierced. Morales' girlfriend also sustained stab wounds but survived the assault. The motive reportedly arose from a dispute over a retrieved rifle and money. The Orange County District Attorney condemned the extreme callousness and calculation of the murder, designed to brutalize the victim and instill fear.</p>
