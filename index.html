          <p>A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas has officially taken effect in Gaza, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) beginning to withdraw troops to pre-agreed positions. The first phase of the deal, brokered with help from the U.S., Turkey, Egypt, and Qatar, involves the release of the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages within 72 hours. In exchange, Israel will release 250 Palestinian prisoners. International bodies like the Red Cross are urging for the exchange to be handled with dignity, while nations including Germany and the U.S. have committed to supporting the peace process through aid and monitoring.</p>

The committee praised her as a brave and unifying figure who has continued her struggle against the authoritarian regime of Nicolas Maduro despite facing serious personal threats. Machado, who has been in hiding, has been a central figure in an opposition movement demanding free and fair elections, and her work has drawn support from international leaders, including those in the United States.</p>

          <p>The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," activating new regulatory powers. This move follows a finding that Google holds a dominant market position, with over 90% of U.K. searches conducted on its platform. The designation allows the CMA to impose new conduct requirements and pro-competition interventions to ensure a more level playing field. Google expressed concerns that some proposed interventions could inhibit innovation, particularly in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence.</p>

The ministry accused the named agents of spreading disinformation and manipulating public opinion on the Chinese internet to create cross-strait tensions. Beijing warned that those involved would be held accountable for life under its Anti-Secession Law, signaling an escalation in its campaign against perceived separatist activities and propaganda efforts originating from Taiwan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sanae Takaichi's path to becoming Japan's first female prime minister has been complicated after the Komeito party announced its withdrawal from the ruling coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The departure ends a political alliance that has lasted since 1999 and was prompted by Komeito's dissatisfaction with the LDP's handling of political funding issues. While the split weakens the LDP's position in parliament, analysts suggest Takaichi is still likely to be elected prime minister, though she will face greater challenges in passing legislation without a stable majority coalition.</p>

          <p>Russia has conducted one of the largest concentrated attacks on Ukraine's energy sector, launching hundreds of drones and missiles that caused widespread blackouts and damaged civilian infrastructure. The overnight barrage injured at least 20 people in Kyiv after striking a residential building and killed a child in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as a calculated effort to terrorize civilians before the winter heating season and urgently called on international allies to provide more decisive action and advanced air defense systems to protect the country.</p>

          <p>North Korea celebrated the 80th anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party with a massive military parade in Pyongyang, showcasing its advanced weaponry and reinforcing its leader Kim Jong Un's authority. The event was attended by high-level delegations from China and Russia, underscoring the strengthening ties between the three nations amid rising global tensions. Analysts note that Russia's war in Ukraine and the U.S.-China rivalry have increased Pyongyang's strategic value to Moscow and Beijing, allowing Kim to mitigate the impact of international sanctions and further entrench his country's nuclear status.</p>

          <p>Decades of global conservation efforts have successfully brought the green turtle back from the brink of extinction, resulting in its status being downgraded from 'Endangered' to 'Least Concern' on the IUCN Red List. Once heavily hunted for its meat, eggs, and shell, the species saw its numbers plummet. The recovery is attributed to widespread initiatives such as protecting nesting sites, reducing accidental capture in fishing gear, and raising public awareness. Scientists are hailing this as a significant conservation victory, offering a catalyst for optimism and continued efforts to protect marine biodiversity.</p>

          <p>China has strongly criticized a recent speech by Taiwanese President William Lai, in which he outlined plans to significantly increase defense spending and bolster the island's military capabilities. A mainland foreign ministry spokesman accused Lai of peddling fallacies of independence and acting as a "warmaker," warning that such actions would drag Taiwan into a dangerous conflict. Beijing reiterated its stance that maintaining peace requires upholding the one-China principle and that it remains firmly opposed to U.S. arms sales or any military ties with Taiwan.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to begin a phased rollout of its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), this autumn. The system will track when non-EU citizens, including those from the U.K., enter and leave the 29-country Schengen Area. On their first use, travelers will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, which will be valid for three years and will eventually replace manual passport stamping. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns remain about potential delays during the initial registration process at ports, airports, and rail terminals.</p>

          <p>Roy Lee Ward, 53, was executed by lethal injection in Indiana for the 2001 sexual assault and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne. The execution is the state's third since it resumed capital punishment last year after a long pause. Ward had exhausted his legal appeals after more than two decades, with his attorney stating he was remorseful for the crime. The victim's family expressed that the execution would finally bring justice for the devastating loss they have endured. The case proceeded despite legal challenges concerning the state's handling of the execution drug.</p>

          <p>India has announced it is upgrading its technical mission in Kabul to a full embassy, four years after it was closed following the Taliban's return to power. The decision was revealed during a landmark visit to India by Afghanistan's acting Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi. This move signifies a significant diplomatic shift, as India does not formally recognize the Taliban government but has maintained a presence to facilitate humanitarian aid. The development comes as relations between the Taliban regime and India's regional rival, Pakistan, have deteriorated.</p>

          <p>The announcement that Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has triggered a significant backlash from conservative commentators and MAGA supporters.

          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the song's lyrics, which accused Drake of serious misconduct, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a heated rap battle and would not be taken as verifiable facts by a reasonable listener. Drake had sued the record label for promoting the track, which he claimed spread a false and malicious narrative. The ruling marks a significant moment in one of the most high-profile rivalries in modern hip-hop.</p>

This marks a shift from the bank's previous plan for voluntary enrollment in the biometric system. The move is intended to enhance security at the state-of-the-art skyscraper, which will eventually house 10,000 employees. The policy has emerged amid a broader debate over workplace surveillance and the use of technology to monitor employees, with some exemptions available for staff who will still use traditional ID badges.</p>

During Taiwan's National Day address, Lai also pledged to increase defense spending to over 3% of GDP next year and 5% by 2030 to bolster the island's self-defense capabilities. He called on Beijing to renounce the use of coercion and to help maintain regional stability, emphasizing that Taiwan is determined to "maintain peace through strength" by developing a robust domestic defense industry.</p>
