          <p>Federal authorities are investigating an impersonation scheme targeting White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, according to the Wall Street Journal. Senators, governors, and business executives received texts and calls from someone claiming to be Wiles, with some messages requesting pardons or cash transfers. Officials suspect the impostor used artificial intelligence to mimic Wiles's voice, as some calls sounded like her, but the messages contained broken grammar and overly formal language, raising suspicion among recipients. The FBI believes a foreign country is not involved, and the White House is taking the cybersecurity of all staff seriously. Optimism in the situation is tempered by the potential sophistication of the impersonation tactics.</p>

          <p>A unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs is being hailed as a victory for the constitutional separation of powers. The case, filed by the Liberty Justice Center, challenged Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on imports from almost every nation. The court ruled that the IEEPA does not grant the president unlimited tariff authority, emphasizing that the Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive power to impose taxes and regulate foreign commerce. The decision imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the tariffs, though the administration has appealed the ruling. The ruling underscores the importance of preventing the president from wielding unchecked authority and initiating trade wars.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its childhood immunization schedule, stating that healthy children "may receive" COVID-19 vaccines, replacing the previous broad recommendation. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about removing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women, although the CDC website still recommends vaccination for pregnant women. The agency continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised children and all adults, and the change reflects a move towards "shared clinical decision-making." Health insurance companies will still be required to cover the shots for this age group, and the CDC has removed a statement that the guidance was backed by outside medical groups. The updated guidance reflects ongoing discussions about narrowing recommendations to specific age groups and risk factors.</p>

Zaki, the favorite entering the bee, maintained a joyful approach throughout the competition, but nearly lost after misspelling "commelina" due to overconfidence. Despite the misstep, he recovered and correctly spelled "eclaircissement" to win the title. The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and Zaki is remembered for both his correct and incorrect spellings. He plans to donate a portion of his winnings to charity.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of hiring managers indicates that employees with master's degrees may not perform better than those with bachelor's degrees and relevant experience. Despite this, 72% of hiring managers still offer higher salaries to candidates with master's degrees, with some offering salary increases of up to 20%. The perception remains that a master's degree signifies drive, discipline, and commitment, though employers increasingly recognize that experience can demonstrate similar qualities. Skills-based hiring is becoming more common, with some companies prioritizing work experience over degrees, and Gen Z hiring managers are more likely to view master's degree holders as stronger performers.</p>

          <p>Former Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams has been awarded â‚¬100,000 in damages following a libel case against the BBC. The case stemmed from a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and accompanying online article that alleged Adams sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, an allegation Adams denies. The court found the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith, and Adams stated the case was about holding the BBC accountable. The BBC expressed disappointment, defending its journalism and citing concerns that the ruling could hinder freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused China of violating its trade agreement with the United States, just weeks after both countries agreed to a temporary easing of tariffs. Trump did not specify the exact nature of the violation, but the accusation comes after a federal court froze most of his sweeping tariffs, a decision temporarily halted by a federal appeals court. The agreement between the U.S. and China involved a 90-day suspension of tariffs imposed since early April, with the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese goods and China reducing levies on American imports. Rare earths, materials used in high-tech products, may be at the heart of Trump's complaint, as reports suggest Beijing is slow to increase rare earth exports.</p>

          <p>America's fertility rate remains near historic lows, prompting lawmakers to propose financial incentives to encourage childbirth. Proposed measures include lump-sum payments for newborns and expanded child tax credits, but experts like Melissa Kearney argue that these incentives are insufficient to significantly impact long-term fertility trends. Kearney suggests that the financial commitment of raising a child is an 18-year endeavor, and one-time benefits are unlikely to change that calculus. A shrinking population could have broad economic implications, particularly for programs like Social Security and Medicare.</p>

          <p>Major automakers are set to resurrect extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) to meet changing consumer demand. EREVs are plug-in hybrids that rely on battery-powered motors for propulsion but also have a gas engine to charge the batteries. Ram, Hyundai, and Nissan are planning to introduce EREV versions of their vehicles, citing advantages such as lower production costs and reduced range anxiety. While EV sales growth has slowed, hybrid sales have increased, making EREVs an attractive option for consumers seeking a middle ground.</p>

The Court of International Trade struck down Trump's global tariffs as "contrary to law," but a federal appeals court is temporarily delaying the ruling.

          <p>Growing tomatoes faster can be achieved through several methods, including selecting early-maturing varieties and starting seeds indoors six to eight weeks before the last frost date. Preparing the soil with proper pH levels and adding organic matter is crucial, as is providing adequate space for the plants to grow. Protecting plants from pests and harsh weather, staking or trellising, mulching to retain water, and fertilizing with organic sources like compost tea can also accelerate growth. Timely harvesting is essential to encourage further fruit production.</p>

Gauguin's life was marked by dramatic events, including a childhood in Peru, a career as a stockbroker, and his eventual pursuit of art in Brittany and Tahiti. His art, characterized by bold colors and simplified forms, challenged traditional European aesthetics and paved the way for modern art movements. Recent controversies surrounding Gauguin's relationships with young Polynesian women have prompted a reevaluation of his work and legacy.</p>
