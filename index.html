In letters to the Justice Department and FBI, Durbin detailed an allegedly haphazard review process involving hundreds of personnel working around the clock on a tight deadline. The allegation adds to the political pressure surrounding the handling and release of documents related to the deceased sex offender and his connections to powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it a major stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. While the decision is a significant strategic victory for Chevron, the company's CEO indicated that some job reductions are expected as the two entities integrate.</p>

          <p>In response to mounting public pressure, President Donald Trump announced he has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the court-approved unsealing of grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move follows renewed scrutiny of Trump's past friendship with Epstein and a report about a "bawdy" letter. Critics, however, argue that releasing only the transcripts would be insufficient, calling for the disclosure of all evidence, including videos and witness interviews, to provide a full accounting.</p>

          <p>A popular hiking trail in New York's Adirondack Mountains has been closed for over a month because of a bull moose exhibiting strange and unresponsive behaviors. The Goodman Mountain trail was closed by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) after the moose was observed lingering on or near the path. Officials suspect the animal may have an underlying illness and are monitoring it with trail cameras, keeping the area closed as a precaution due to the potential danger posed by the large animal.</p>

While some companies like OpenAI have committed to the code, Meta joins others like Airbus in expressing concern that the rules will throttle the development of advanced AI in Europe.</p>

The centuries-old tradition, which now focuses on conservation, involves weighing and checking the health of young swans along a stretch of the river.</p>

          <p>According to a Financial Times report, President Donald Trump is now demanding a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% on all goods imported from the European Union. This represents an escalation in trade talks, which appear to have stalled with less than two weeks until the administration's August 1 deadline. The EU had hoped for a deal similar to the one with the U.K., but Trump's new demands reflect his long-standing complaints about the U.S. trade deficit with the bloc.</p>

The one-year inflation forecast dropped to 4.4% in July from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers still perceive some risk, they believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary, an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve.
