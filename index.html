          <p>A-list celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Orlando Bloom, have converged on Venice for the opulent, three-day wedding celebration of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.

          <p>In a significant act of defiance, LGBTQ+ rights supporters are proceeding with the annual Budapest Pride march, despite a police ban enacted under Hungary's contentious "child-protection" legislation. The event has transformed into a major symbol of resistance against the nationalist government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, drawing international attention and support from over 30 foreign embassies and numerous European officials.

          <p>Former heavyweight world champion Deontay Wilder made a successful, albeit low-key, return to the ring, securing a seventh-round stoppage victory over Tyrrell Herndon. This win marks a crucial turning point for Wilder, being his first since October 2022 after suffering three defeats in his previous four bouts, which led to widespread speculation about his career's future. While the performance was dominant, it was a more measured and less explosive "Bronze Bomber," who indicated a new focus on becoming a more complete, all-round fighter. The victory keeps alive the potential for high-stakes future matchups, including a long-awaited bout with Anthony Joshua.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods and subsequent landslides in Pakistan's mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have tragically claimed the lives of at least 11 people, among them four children and three women.

This disaster starkly illustrates Pakistan's acute vulnerability to climate change, with the country's former climate minister sharply criticizing the government's perceived inaction and failure to heed repeated warnings about such intensifying environmental crises.

          <p>A significant policy rift has emerged within Germany's coalition government concerning the future of nuclear energy, exposing deep-seated ideological differences between key ministries. The conservative Economy Minister has indicated an openness to all energy technologies, including nuclear power, which aligns with a recent joint statement with pro-nuclear France. This position directly conflicts with the stance of the Social Democratic Environment Minister, who is committed to upholding Germany's legislated nuclear phase-out. The disagreement highlights the complex challenges Germany faces in balancing national energy security with its ambitious international climate commitments.</p>

          <p>A prominent economist from China International Capital Corporation argues that China holds a distinct comparative advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins due to its mature third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay. The research note posits that these systems already operate in a manner similar to stablecoins, being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and functioning within a well-established regulatory environment. This existing, robust infrastructure and oversight could allow China to stay ahead of the curve as stablecoins become a more central part of the global economic and financial landscape.

The research focused on working-age individuals and analyzed the effects of a diet comprising staples like rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, seaweed, and cooked vegetables. This is reportedly the first study of its kind to specifically investigate the potential mental health benefits derived from this long-standing dietary pattern.

This move, which is facing strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer of eel, would significantly regulate the international market if adopted. The proposed rules would mandate that all eel exports, including the Japanese eel, require special permits and verifiable proof of legal capture. The regulations are slated to take effect in June 2027, potentially reshaping the multi-billion dollar global eel industry.</p>

          <p>The British government has unveiled a sweeping reform of the National Health Service (NHS) in England that will see the elimination of 201 associated administrative and oversight organizations. This major restructuring, a key part of the Labour party's new 10-year health strategy, will dissolve bodies responsible for patient advocacy and whistleblower support, such as Healthwatch England. According to Health Secretary Wes Streeting, the primary goal of the overhaul is to reduce bureaucratic complexity and redirect resources to frontline care, creating a system with "more doers and fewer checkers." The plan also includes axing NHS England and bringing the system under closer government control.</p>

          <p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the 28-year-old son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been officially charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and bodily harm following an extensive ten-month police investigation. Prosecutors in Oslo have confirmed that the charges stem from allegations made by a "double-digit" number of victims and cover a range of offenses. While Hoiby has previously admitted to acts of violence influenced by substance abuse, his defense attorney has stated that he denies wrongdoing in most of the cases, particularly those involving sexual abuse.

          <p>The National Hockey League's first semi-remote draft in a non-pandemic setting has received a cool reception, with prominent figures like Los Angeles Kings GM Ken Holland voicing a preference for the traditional, in-person format. The article describes the new decentralized event as awkward and beset by technical glitches, such as audio delays during virtual calls with newly drafted players. Critics argue that the format, with teams in their home cities, diminished the raw emotion and celebratory atmosphere that made the draft a special occasion for young players and their families, feeling more like a corporate video conference.</p>

The outcome of these negotiations is critical for Japan's economy, as the government has repeatedly stated that the 25-percentage-point tariff hike on its auto exports is unacceptable and deeply damaging.

The innovative technique presents a significant potential alternative to more invasive methods, such as those being developed by Elon Musk's Neuralink, and could revolutionize treatment for paralysis by reducing surgical risks and shortening patient recovery times.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study from Tulane University has revealed that critical sections of New Orleans' flood protection system, fortified after Hurricane Katrina, are sinking at an alarming rate of up to nearly two inches per year. This rate of subsidence is faster than the rise in sea levels, effectively reducing the height and protective capacity of the city's flood walls against storm surges. The research identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and newer residential developments, likely caused by soil compression and groundwater withdrawal, presenting a serious and growing threat to the low-lying city's safety.</p>
