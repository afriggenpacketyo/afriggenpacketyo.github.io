          <h2>CBS News Poll Reveals American Views on Trump's Deportation Program and Economic Policies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Americans have mixed feelings about the Trump administration's deportation program, with support largely dependent on the perceived targets. A majority supports deporting dangerous criminals, but disapproval rises if the program is seen as deporting more people than expected. Concerns about the program's potential negative impact on the economy also exist, with many believing it will weaken rather than strengthen it. The poll also reveals that views on the national economy have stabilized, but support for new tariffs remains net negative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Guardian explores America's fascination with boy geniuses and 'Great Men,' arguing that this infatuation is detrimental to society. The article uses examples like Adam Neumann of WeWork and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook to illustrate how the myth of the temperamental genius is perpetuated. It suggests that this obsession with brute power has led to wealth concentration and authoritarianism, and it urges a shift away from blindly celebrating those who merely 'change the world.' The article also critiques the romanticized narratives surrounding historical figures like Alexander Hamilton.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed four core principles to resolve disputes in the South China Sea, emphasizing consultation, co-management, mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposition to external interference.

The report criticizes external actors for fueling regional tensions and undermining maritime cooperation.

This incident is the latest in a series of deadly events near aid distribution points set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is supported by Israel and the US.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the potential deployment of US marines in his state as 'deranged' following threats from the secretary of defense. The threat arose after protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles led to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. The federal government is reportedly moving to take over the California National Guard, a move Newsom views as inflammatory. Tensions escalated after immigration authorities extended enforcement actions into a majority Latino area, resulting in teargas being deployed against protesters.</p>

The vote includes questions on reducing the time required for non-EU residents to apply for citizenship and increasing worker protections against dismissal. Campaigners for the citizenship law change argue it would help second-generation Italians integrate better. Meloni's government opposes the citizenship measure, seeking to curb illegal immigration while increasing legal work visas. (not investment advice)</p>

It argues that such acts make Jews feel less welcome outside of Israel, thereby reinforcing the need for a separate state. The piece suggests that a rational anti-Zionist movement would focus on making Jews feel safe and welcome in other countries, but the current movement often seems determined to prove Zionism right.</p>
