          <p>The U.S. Embassy in Qatar issued a shelter-in-place advisory for American citizens due to regional tensions, coinciding with Qatar's temporary airspace closure. This follows a State Department warning for increased caution worldwide after the U.S. joined Israel's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, prompting Iran's vow of retaliation. While Qatar's foreign ministry stated the advisory doesn't reflect specific threats and the security situation is stable, the U.K. also advised its citizens to shelter in place. Qatar hosts significant U.S. military presence, including the Al-Udeid Air Base, a major staging ground for U.S. military operations in the Middle East. </p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, alleging the telehealth company sold illegitimate versions of Wegovy, its weight-loss drug, posing a risk to patient safety. This decision comes shortly after the companies announced a long-term collaboration to improve obesity treatment accessibility. Novo Nordisk initiated sales of Wegovy through telehealth platforms due to a nationwide shortage, aiming to shift patients from compounded versions to the FDA-approved semaglutide drug. The company's investigation revealed that knock-off drugs sold by telehealth entities contain ingredients from foreign suppliers that were never inspected by the FDA, and Novo Nordisk will continue selling Wegovy on platforms committed to patient safety. </p>

While the broader tech sector has rebounded strongly, Apple is trading below its key moving averages.

Despite Apple's recent struggles, experts suggest investors are diversifying into more traditional defensive sectors and that the market is adapting to higher volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US Soccer is constructing a new National Training Center (NTC) in Atlanta, aiming to create a world-class facility ready for the men's World Cup next year. Funded in part by Arthur M. Blank, the project seeks to consolidate the training of all 27 national teams in one central hub, eliminating the need to source different locations for each international break. Inspired by European training centers like St George's Park, the NTC will feature multiple pitches, indoor facilities, and locker rooms, and the center aims to foster connections between youth and senior players, and the facility is anticipated to boost the local economy by relocating staff from Chicago. The goal is to establish a heartbeat for the sport, encompassing coaching education and referee certification.</p>

          <p>Hideo Kojima's 'Death Stranding 2' casts players as delivery couriers in a post-apocalyptic world, navigating treacherous landscapes to connect isolated communities. The game delves into themes of digital alienation and technological dependence, questioning whether technology truly brings people closer or erodes human intimacy. Players make deliveries on foot, eventually gaining access to vehicles and infrastructure built by other players, creating a metaphor for interconnected society. Ultimately, the game argues that virtual life is no replacement for physicality and emphasizes the importance of physical bonds in a transient world.</p>

          <p>According to ABC News contributor Steve Hill, Iran has a wide range of options for retaliating against the U.S. following the recent attacks, and he says Iran could retaliate in a way that would justify to its own people that it has retaliated, but not enough to provoke another round of attacks from the Americans so that this remains a one-off. The expert says that if Iran were to attack American forces and kill American citizens as well as military forces, that almost forces a retaliation from the American side.</p>
