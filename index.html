          <p>South Africa secured back-to-back titles in the Rugby Championship, showcasing deep squad talent under coach Rassie Erasmus. New Zealand, in a rebuilding phase under a new coach, integrated many new players but ultimately fell short of the title. Australia showed marked improvement after a poor World Cup, finishing third, while Argentina's campaign was considered a disappointment as they finished last despite some strong individual performances. The tournament provided key insights into the southern hemisphere teams' progress ahead of their November tours.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that Donald Trump's approach to Latin America is impulsive and lacks a coherent strategy, characterized by bullying and threats rather than planned policy. The author suggests that actions against countries like Venezuela and Colombia, framed as anti-drug operations, are alienating regional governments and may inadvertently strengthen authoritarian leaders like Nicolás Maduro. The article concludes that this approach undermines U.S. influence while creating opportunities for rivals like China to expand their presence in the region.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation delves into the world of "sextortion," a rapidly growing online crime where scammers, often based in Nigeria, trick teenagers into sending explicit images and then blackmail them for money. The article highlights the tragic case of a U.S. teenager who took his own life after being targeted and explores the organized nature of these scams, which are sometimes run from communal rooms known as "Hustle Kingdoms." It also examines the significant challenges faced by law enforcement and the difficult role social media platforms play in this devastating crisis.</p>

          <p>The campus of South Carolina State University was placed on lockdown following a reported shooting at the Hugine Suites residence hall. The university issued an alert confirming that shots were fired and instructed students in the dorm to remain in place while others were told to return to their own halls or leave campus. A scheduled homecoming concert was canceled as a result of the incident. The State Law Enforcement Division has been asked to investigate, with no immediate word on potential injuries.</p>

          <p>British Sunday newspapers lead with several key political stories, including the collapse of a Chinese spying case and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's pledge to deport 150,000 illegal migrants annually. This hardline immigration stance is presented as a core policy initiative as the party's conference begins. Multiple papers also analyze Badenoch's leadership, reporting that she faces internal pressure to present a bold vision and reverse the party's fortunes within the next six months to avoid a potential leadership challenge from within her party.</p>

          <p>Sussex Police are investigating a fire that damaged a mosque in Peacehaven as a hate crime, following reports of arson. The incident, which occurred Saturday evening, caused damage to the building's front entrance and a vehicle parked outside, though no one was injured. A volunteer reported that two people inside the mosque managed to escape after attackers allegedly poured a liquid and set it alight.

Analysts attribute the recent sales boom to a government tax credit that has now expired, and they anticipate a significant drop in demand going forward. The article suggests that weaker government support, higher average vehicle costs, and the absence of affordable Chinese brands due to tariffs have hindered EV adoption in the U.S. As a result, American carmakers are scaling back EV investments, raising concerns about their long-term competitiveness.</p>

The judge ruled that the protests in the city were not disruptive enough to justify federalizing the Guard without the governor's consent, stating the president's justification was "untethered to the facts." This decision, which the administration is expected to appeal, temporarily halts the deployment of 200 soldiers.

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the fall of Bashar al-Assad, but the process is facing criticism and challenges. The vote is not a direct popular election; instead, "electoral colleges" will select most lawmakers, with the interim president appointing the rest. Furthermore, polling has been postponed in three provinces due to security issues and political standoffs with Kurdish and Druze groups. Civil society organizations have raised concerns that the system gives the executive branch too much influence, undermining the democratic purpose of the elections.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a predominantly white denomination, has installed Reverend Yehiel Curry as its first-ever Black presiding bishop. The historic installation took place at a ceremony in Minneapolis, marking a significant moment of change for the church. Bishop Curry, who previously led the Metropolitan Chicago Synod, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, who was the first woman to hold the position. His installation is seen as a hopeful step toward increasing diversity and representation within the ELCA's leadership.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people participated in a Pride march in the Hungarian city of Pecs, defying a police ban on the event. The government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban has increasingly restricted LGBTQ+ rights, including passing a law that allows such rallies to be banned under the pretext of "protecting children." Protesters, joined by several Members of the European Parliament, waved rainbow and EU flags, condemning the government's actions as an infringement on fundamental human rights. The demonstration highlights the ongoing tension between Hungary's conservative government and civil liberties advocates.</p>

          <p>In a stunning turnaround, the previously 0-4 UCLA football team defeated No. 7 Penn State 42-37. The victory came just days after a coaching shake-up that saw tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel promoted to play-caller for the offense. Under his new scheme, quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a career-best performance, accounting for five total touchdowns. The upset marked UCLA's first win over a top-10 opponent since 2007 and provided a moment of redemption for a team that had struggled throughout the season.</p>
