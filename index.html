          <p>A New York court ruled that President Trump's blanket import taxes were illegal, but an appeals court temporarily paused the ruling. The tariffs do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are the UK's primary exports to the US. While the UK has negotiated a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, it has not yet been implemented. The ruling blocks Trump's 10% blanket tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision. This uncertainty in international trade makes it difficult for businesses to plan and invest with confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of UK saltmarshes as vital "sinks" for climate-warming greenhouse gases. The report emphasizes that saltmarshes lock away these gases in layers of mud, acting as natural flood defenses. WWF is advocating for the inclusion of these habitats in the UK's official inventory of carbon emissions and removals. The UK has lost a significant portion of its saltmarshes since 1860 due to agricultural conversion, highlighting the need for restoration and protection efforts. These muddy areas are just as important for climate mitigation as trees are.</p>

          <p>In 1955, the United States deported Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist, who then helped China develop its missile and space programs. Qian's deportation, fueled by xenophobia during the McCarthy era, proved to be a critical error, enabling China to challenge American dominance in Asia. This historical event serves as a cautionary tale as the Trump administration targets foreign students and researchers. The price paid for shunning Dr. Qian has been dear, as the United States missed a chance to leapfrog the Soviet Union in manned spaceflight, and China has become a superpower.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated deliberations on legislation that would allow married couples to retain different surnames, a topic that has not been formally debated in 28 years. Despite growing public support, the passage of any of the three bills submitted by opposition parties appears unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) remains hesitant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. A Kyodo News poll indicated that 71% of respondents support the dual family-name system, reflecting a shift in public opinion.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America." Trump's outburst came after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, ruled against his tariffs. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, claiming they provided poor advice on judicial nominations. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the federal courts. The president's attacks mark a significant departure from his long-standing alliance with Leo and the Federalist Society, who have played a key role in shaping the judiciary.</p>

The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods and potential similar measures in other countries add to the company's challenges.

          <p>An Argentine court declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer star Diego Maradona. The decision follows the recusal of one of the judges due to criticism surrounding her participation in a documentary series about the case. The judges decided to retry the entire case, resetting all proceedings since the trial began in March. The case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care in the weeks leading up to his death in November 2020.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, has warned that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in China-US rivalry. Lian suggests that Washington could target specific Chinese entities before expanding sanctions to push China out of the US dollar system. He notes that full-blown financial sanctions, like cutting China off from Swift, would be difficult for the US to implement due to China's economic importance. Excluding China from Swift could lead countries to shift to using China's alternative, CIPS, undermining Swift's importance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily pause a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's tariffs. The administration argued that a ruling against Trump would cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals. The three-judge trade court panel had invalidated all of Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs and other duties, finding that the law Trump invoked did not confer such unbounded authority. The appeals court gave the plaintiffs one week to respond to the administration's bid for a stay pending appeal.</p>
