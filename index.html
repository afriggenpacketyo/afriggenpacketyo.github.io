The State Department has informed other international guarantors of the peace deal and stated that protective measures would be taken if the attack proceeds. Hamas has denied the allegations, accusing Israel of supporting rival armed groups while it works to reassert control in Gaza following a partial Israeli withdrawal.</p>

This comes as King Charles III faces calls to strip Andrew of his "prince" title, following his decision to relinquish other royal and military honors. The new claims add to the scrutiny over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, even after settling a civil case with Ms. Giuffre.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce, have recently cited the adoption of artificial intelligence as a reason for significant job cuts. However, some experts, like Fabian Stephany from the Oxford Internet Institute, are skeptical, suggesting AI is being used as a "good excuse" to conceal other business challenges, such as overhiring during the pandemic. This narrative fuels employee fears, even as recent data from the New York Fed and Yale University indicates that AI has not yet caused widespread job displacement.</p>

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by secret BBC filming from nine years ago, has culminated in the conviction of 14 people involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The scheme, run by the company Sell My Timeshare (SMT), defrauded over 3,500 victims, mostly elderly individuals, by luring them with promises of exiting their contracts and then pressuring them into buying useless fake credits. The fraudulent funds were used to finance lavish lifestyles for the company's owners, including its head, Mark Rowe, who was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, the co-founder of Betfred, has stated that a significant increase in gambling taxes could force the closure of all 1,287 of the company's UK shops, putting 7,500 jobs at risk. The warning comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers raising taxes on the sector, a move supported by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to fund child poverty reduction. Done argues that even a moderate tax hike would eliminate profitability, pushing betting activity to untaxed offshore companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea is expanding its diplomatic outreach in Southeast Asia, recently hosting high-level officials from Vietnam and Laos for its ruling party's 80th-anniversary celebration. The visit by Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary was the first in 18 years, with both nations agreeing to boost cooperation in defense and healthcare. Analysts suggest these relationships provide North Korea with legitimacy and potential avenues to bypass international sanctions, while offering limited economic opportunities for its Southeast Asian partners.</p>

          <p>Over the past four decades, China's Baijitan National Nature Reserve has made significant strides in combating desertification, effectively pushing back the Mu Us Desert by more than 20 kilometers. The reserve has implemented sand control and afforestation over nearly 46,000 hectares, stabilizing vast areas of drifting sands that once threatened the city of Yinchuan and the Yellow River. This successful effort has reduced the desert's presence in the area from over 107,000 hectares to just 1,335 hectares, which are now preserved for research purposes.</p>

Speaking at a summit, Harris argued that despite Tesla's non-unionized workforce, Musk should have been invited as a leader in American EV innovation. The snub was widely seen as a gesture of support for the United Auto Workers union, and Harris suggests in her new memoir that the exclusion alienated Musk, who later became a major financial backer for Donald Trump.</p>

His absence is felt not just in goals and assists, but in the team's ability to build up play and bypass high-pressure defenses. Alexander-Arnold's skill with both feet and his capacity for accurate long passes and cross-field switches of play were crucial tactical tools that the current squad has been unable to replicate, forcing midfielders like Florian Wirtz into deeper, less effective roles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is common for sexual desire to decrease after the initial passionate phase of a relationship, according to couples therapist Andrea Seiferth. This change is partly hormonal, as the bonding hormone oxytocin begins to supersede the hormones that drive initial sex drive. For heterosexual couples, a discrepancy between physical and psychological arousal in women, often influenced by societal messaging and a lack of prioritization of female pleasure, can also contribute. Experts emphasize that open communication, mutual affection, and prioritizing intimacy are key to maintaining a healthy sex life.</p>

The tenant, Baschea Walsh, was informed by the charitable trust that owns the property that her home is being converted into a holiday rental for fans of the show. The West Horsley Place Trust stated it has provided an extended notice period and assistance in finding alternative housing, acknowledging the significant upheaval for Ms. Walsh.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has announced plans to develop a "T-Dome," a multilayered air defense network designed to protect the island from potential missile and drone attacks by mainland China. The proposal, which appears to draw inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome, aims to safeguard critical infrastructure and population centers. However, the announcement surprised Taiwan's defense establishment, as the project was not mentioned in the latest National Defence Report and has no funding allocated in the upcoming government budget.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Sanae Takaichi, is set to form a coalition with the opposition Japan Innovation Party, positioning Takaichi to become the nation's first female prime minister. This new alliance comes after the LDP's long-standing coalition with the Komeito party collapsed, which had initially derailed Takaichi's path to the premiership. The agreement will see Innovation Party lawmakers support Takaichi in the upcoming parliamentary vote for prime minister, stabilizing the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The 20th-ranked USC Trojans suffered a significant setback to their College Football Playoff hopes with a 34-24 loss to Notre Dame in a game plagued by heavy rain. USC's defense struggled, allowing 306 rushing yards, while the offense was hampered by critical errors, including two fourth-down failures and a costly fumble on a trick play in the fourth quarter. Coach Lincoln Riley took responsibility for several "stupid" play calls, as the loss gives the Trojans no margin for error for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>A section of the 5 Freeway in Southern California was closed for several hours on Saturday for a live-fire military exercise at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance. The closure, which affected a route used by approximately 80,000 drivers daily, was implemented due to safety risks, despite the Marine Corps' initial statements that no public highways would be closed. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the event as an "absurd show of force" and a reckless disregard for public safety.</p>
