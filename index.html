The Dragon Bravo Fire has expanded to 5,000 acres, and another blaze, the White Sage Fire, has scorched over 40,000 acres. Meanwhile, smoke from intense Canadian wildfires is causing unhealthy air quality across the Upper Midwest, affecting states like Minnesota and North Dakota.

          <p>After an initial loss to France, England's women's football team secured a place in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals with decisive wins against the Netherlands and Wales. Manager Sarina Wiegman noted the opening defeat created an "urgency" that unified the team, leading to dominant performances. The Lionesses will now face Sweden in a highly anticipated match, a repeat of the Euro 2022 semi-final. Analysts note that while England has found a successful formation, Sweden presents a strong, physical, and counter-attacking challenge.</p>

          <p>The UK's national weather service, the Met Office, has released a report indicating that the country's climate is now "notably different" from past decades due to global warming. The report highlights a significant increase in the frequency of heat and rainfall records being broken, leading to more hot days and fewer cold nights. This shift is causing more severe weather events like storms and floods, impacting infrastructure and nature, with sea levels around the UK rising faster than the global average. The findings underscore the urgent need for adaptation to future climate extremes.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to impose a 50% tariff on Brazil, despite the U.S. having a trade surplus with the country. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated the move is part of a broader strategy to onshore production and reduce what the administration views as a national security risk posed by a large overall trade deficit. The justification for the tariff on Brazil specifically cited a criminal case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, though officials emphasized the wider goal of protecting domestic production capabilities. This policy has raised questions about its economic rationale and potential impact on U.S. industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Senator Rand Paul suggested that the shooter's motive will likely remain a mystery. Paul, who chairs the Senate committee investigating the incident, stated he believes authorities have tried their best but have not found a clear motive. The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Crooks, was killed by a Secret Service sniper after opening fire on the campaign rally, killing one attendee and injuring two others. While documents show Crooks held anti-government and anti-corporate views, no definitive explanation for his actions has been established.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Critics, including prominent conservative figures, have accused Bondi of withholding information after a recent Justice Department memo stated there was no "incriminating client list." In a social media post, Trump urged his base to "let Pam Bondi do her job," attempting to quell the growing frustration. The controversy highlights a division within his supporters over the handling of the high-profile case and the perceived lack of transparency.</p>

          <p>The search for victims of the catastrophic July 4th floods in Texas has been paused due to a new round of heavy rain. Authorities ordered the evacuation of search crews from the Guadalupe River corridor in Kerr County, where over 160 people may still be missing after floods killed at least 129. Officials issued new flash flood warnings and went door-to-door in some areas to alert residents of the renewed danger. The ongoing severe weather is causing other waterways to swell, leading to additional high-water rescues and compounding the region's disaster.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," which marks a return to his more experimental R&B roots, similar to his past projects "Journals" and "Changes." The album feels rawer and more improvisational than his mainstream pop work, featuring murky production and demo-like tracks that reflect a tumultuous period in his personal life. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee, the album embraces a scrappy, idiosyncratic sound that aligns with modern pop trends. The result is a messy yet often beautiful collection that showcases a more instinctual and less polished side of the superstar.</p>

          <p>A Virginia homeowner is pursuing legal action after his new neighbor cut down a large, healthy oak tree that was well within his property line. The neighbor allegedly removed the 89-year-old tree because he disliked it being near his shed, apparently without verifying the property boundaries. After being shown the property stakes, the neighbor then reportedly demanded the homeowner pay half of the $2,000 removal cost. The homeowner has documented the incident, filed a police report, and consulted a lawyer, intending to seek triple damages as allowed by Virginia's timber trespass laws.</p>

          <p>The humanitarian crisis in Sudan's Darfur region is worsening as Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a major new offensive on the besieged city of el-Fasher. RSF fighters reportedly stormed the city's main livestock market and a prison, though the army claims to have pushed them back. The city, which is the last army-controlled stronghold in Darfur, is described as a "death trap" with residents facing starvation and constant shelling. This latest attack follows a communications blackout and comes amid a wider civil war that has created the world's largest displacement crisis and led to accusations of genocide.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to significantly increase France's defense spending in response to growing global threats. Speaking on the eve of Bastille Day, Macron stated that freedom has "never been so threatened" since 1945. The annual defense budget is now set to reach €64 billion by 2027, a goal previously slated for 2030, effectively doubling the spending from when he first took office. Macron cited Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and uncertainty from the United States as key reasons for the accelerated military investment.</p>

The hospital has seen a surge in seriously ill children with the virus and confirmed that cases are rising in the region due to a fall in MMR vaccination rates. While the hospital did not comment on the individual case, the death underscores the serious risks associated with the highly contagious disease. Health officials are urging parents to ensure their children are vaccinated, as uptake in some areas has fallen well below the 95% target recommended by the World Health Organization.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and military ruler of Nigeria, has died at the age of 82 after a period of illness. Buhari was a deeply influential and often polarizing figure, first leading the country in a short-lived, repressive military regime in the 1980s. He later returned to power as a "converted democrat" in a historic 2015 election, promising to tackle corruption and insecurity. However, his presidency from 2015 to 2023 was marked by economic decline, widespread violence, and his own recurring health problems, leaving behind a complex and fraught legacy.</p>
