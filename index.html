The mosaic, made of rich marble and porphyry, was part of the floor in one of Caligula's extravagant ships, which were sunk after his assassination. After being recovered in the 1930s, the mosaic disappeared following World War II and was later purchased by art dealer Helen Fioratti, who used it as a coffee table.
