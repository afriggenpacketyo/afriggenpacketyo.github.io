          <p>House Republicans have released their tax plan, a key component of President Trump's economic agenda, aiming to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanent to prevent tax increases for millions of Americans. The legislation includes provisions such as an increased child tax credit, a higher threshold for estate tax liability, and a boosted deduction for qualified business income. However, the plan omits details on state and local tax deduction caps and a new millionairesâ€™ tax bracket, which remain points of contention within the party, with House Republicans holding a slim majority, they face challenges in passing the bill without Democratic support. The legislation is expected to advance through the Ways & Means Committee, marking significant progress for House GOP leaders after delays.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland jointly visited Kyiv, pledging to intensify pressure on Russia for a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire, marking their first-ever joint visit to Ukraine. This visit underscores Europeâ€™s commitment to Ukraine amid ongoing conflict with Russia, as they look to bolster the Ukrainian military and establish a "coalition of the willing". The leaders also held discussions with President Trump, highlighting the need for a durable cease-fire and confidence-building measures to pave the way for peace negotiations. With the United States potentially reducing its support, European leaders are seeking ways to ensure Ukraine's security and find a resolution to the war, while the Kremlin remains opposed to any cease-fire unless Western military aid to Ukraine ceases.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party is set to unveil significant immigration plans next week, seeking to overhaul the current system and address public concerns about immigration levels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's White Paper, titled "Restoring Control Over the Immigration System," proposes stricter time limits on work visas for non-graduate-level jobs and potential restrictions on foreign students' ability to stay in the UK after graduation. The government aims to link the immigration system more closely to the labor market, encouraging employers to prioritize hiring and training British workers. Amidst rising public concern over immigration, Labour hopes these reforms will demonstrate their commitment to addressing the issue and regaining voter trust, especially with Reform capitalizing on public concern.</p>

          <p>Kosmos 482, a Soviet-era spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intent of reaching Venus, has re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in orbit due to a rocket malfunction.

Experts had predicted that some parts of the half-ton spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's harsh conditions, might survive the descent. The event highlights the legacy of the Cold War space race and the challenges of managing space debris, with scientists emphasizing the low probability of debris harming anyone.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order, halting the Trump administration's sweeping government overhaul, citing that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. The ruling supports a coalition of unions, non-profits, and local governments, who argued that the overhaul, spearheaded by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge), exceeds its authority. The order prevents mass layoffs for 14 days, pending a further hearing to consider a longer-lasting injunction, with the judge noting the potential for irreparable harm without the order. The plaintiffs presented extensive evidence of disrupted critical services due to the government's actions.</p>

Economists are divided on whether Powell's current approach of holding steady is the right course, with some fearing it could lead to a recession. Despite Trump's calls for rate cuts, Powell has voiced confidence in the economy and dismissed the idea of pre-emptive cuts, emphasizing the need for more clarity given the volatile policy mix. The Fed's past reluctance to act swiftly has led to criticism, and Powell risks being labeled as "Too Late" if the central bank misjudges the impact of tariffs and the labor market's signals.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration officials, in collaboration with the Tennessee Highway Patrol, have arrested over 100 individuals in Nashville, creating uncertainty within the immigrant community. The operation underscores the role of local and state law enforcement in President Trump's deportation plans, with Tennessee recently enacting a law to enhance immigration enforcement. City officials in Nashville have disavowed involvement and criticized the arrests, while immigrant rights supporters claim the patrols targeted areas with predominantly people of color. Supporters contend that many detainees could remain in the country with proper legal representation, fearing they are being deported due to fear of prolonged detention.</p>

          <p>A Chicago homeowner, Marco Velazquez, discovered squatters in his property and, unable to get immediate police assistance, decided to move in with them, highlighting the challenges of removing squatters under Illinois law. The squatters claimed to have purchased the property and produced a mortgage document, but Velazquez found no record of it with Cook County officials. After staying overnight with friends, Velazquez negotiated a cash-for-keys deal, paying the squatters $4,300 to leave, as he feared a lengthy legal battle. The case underscores the broader legal issue of why property disputes involving squatters often fall under civil law, though a new bill aims to allow police to remove squatters more quickly.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how the Trump administration, influenced by Elon Musk's "Doge", is dismantling efforts to prevent silicosis, a deadly lung disease, by firing key personnel at NIOSH and OSHA. This reverses decades of progress in protecting workers from silica dust exposure in industries like mining and countertop fabrication. The administration has also paused enforcement of a new silica standard, citing a lack of certified respirators due to staffing cuts. The author argues that these actions prioritize business interests over worker safety, leading to a resurgence of silicosis and endangering vulnerable workers, particularly Latino immigrants in the countertop industry.</p>

          <p>A bone spear tip, dating back 80,000 years, has been discovered in Russia, indicating that Neanderthals, not modern humans, created this sophisticated hunting weapon. The discovery challenges previous assumptions about Neanderthal technological capabilities, suggesting they independently developed bone-working techniques. The spear tip, found in Mezmaiskaya Cave, shows evidence of successful use and craftsmanship, adding to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were more advanced than previously thought. The find supports the idea that Neanderthals had developed specific techniques for working with bone, using techniques that, until recently, had only been credited to our species.</p>

          <p>A family from Ohio found hope in a clinical trial testing an investigational gene therapy for LAD-1, a rare disorder that severely compromises the immune system. The Langenhop family had three children diagnosed with the disease, and they enrolled them in a clinical trial led by Dr. Donald Kohn at UCLA. The gene therapy involved extracting stem cells, correcting the genetic defect, and reintroducing the modified cells, resulting in improved immune function and a better quality of life for the children, with all nine patients producing healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections. The therapy is now under review with the Food and Drug Administration, with the Langenhops honored that their children could help create a medication that may be used to treat others.</p>

Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a bill meant to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to Trump's involvement with meme coins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, as well as the Trump family's venture World Liberty Financial. Critics argue that Trump's pursuit of personal profits is impeding progress on long-awaited advancements in the crypto industry, with some calling for investigations into Trump-linked coins.

This trend, driven by just-in-time scheduling, leaves many low-wage workers with unpredictable incomes and limited access to social safety nets. The author argues that this exploitation of underwork is as detrimental as the overwork that labor laws initially aimed to address, with solutions including requiring employers to set schedules in advance and removing incentives for hiring part-time workers. The author also notes the issue of part-time work must become a political issue to gain traction.</p>

This involves increasing exports, directing state-controlled banks to lend trillions to industrial borrowers, and introducing export controls on critical minerals. While China's strategy has allowed it to retaliate against tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, it has also worsened frictions with trading partners and comes at a cost to many Chinese households. The approach reflects Xi's ambition to challenge the United States' supremacy and reshape China's relationship with the world, with the rivalry potentially dividing the world into competing spheres of influence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's stance on reducing U.S. support for European security is hindering European nations' ability to provide weapons to Ukraine, as they scramble to arm themselves. This has led Ukraine to seek revenue-sharing deals with the United States over natural resources to ensure continued American arms shipments. While European allies have collectively provided significant military support, they face challenges in scaling up production quickly, with experts predicting it will take a decade to reach full capacity. As a result, Ukraine may continue to rely on American weapons to defend its territory, with the outcome of the conflict potentially influenced by the availability of adequate supplies.</p>
