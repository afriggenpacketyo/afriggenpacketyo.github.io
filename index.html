          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 23:23:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports starting August 1, escalating trade tensions with one of its largest partners. In a letter, President Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to stop the flow of fentanyl and its retaliatory tariffs as primary reasons for the new levy. The move is part of a broader protectionist strategy that includes other sectoral tariffs and a warning that duties could increase further if Canada retaliates. This action follows a recent, fragile agreement to resume trade talks, which now appears to be in jeopardy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin laying off approximately 1,800 of its domestic employees in the coming days, following a recent Supreme Court decision. This move is part of the Trump administration's plan to downsize the federal workforce and reorganize the agency to align with its 'America First' foreign policy. Deputy Secretary Michael Rigas informed staff that the process would begin soon, with over 300 bureaus and offices slated to be streamlined, merged, or eliminated. The department is now entering the final stage of its reorganization to focus on what it terms 'results-driven diplomacy'.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi are scheduled to meet in Malaysia during the ASEAN summit, marking a significant high-level engagement between the two nations. Tensions remain high over issues including Taiwan, trade policies, and technology, with both sides expected to address these contentious points. Wang has called for a "fairer and more reasonable" international order while criticizing U.S. protectionism and tariffs. Rubio is also expected to raise concerns about China's support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, making the talks a critical moment for diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Economists are closely watching for China's upcoming first-half GDP data to assess the need for additional fiscal stimulus amid external pressures from U.S. trade policies. While the market expects growth to meet the 5% annual target, concerns persist that the headline figure may conceal underlying weakness in domestic demand and employment. Many analysts argue that more forceful and targeted policy measures will be necessary to navigate the intense external challenges and achieve full-year growth targets. The debate centers on whether current policies are sufficient to weather the economic storm. (not investment advice)</p>

While overall interest has waned, travelers from Vietnam and the Philippines still show strong interest, possibly due to large diaspora communities.

          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe posits that successful campaign slogans often use a specific set of resonant words. After analyzing 20,000 campaign messages globally, he identified eight words—including 'people,' 'better,' 'change,' and 'together'—as emotional shortcuts that work across different cultures and political ideologies. The article explores this formula in the context of famous slogans like 'Make America Great Again' and 'Get Brexit Done,' while also considering how AI might soon tailor political messages to individual voters, potentially making universal slogans obsolete.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, 'Trainspotting' author Irvine Welsh discussed his new sequel, 'Men in Love,' and shared his critical views on contemporary society. He expressed concern that the internet and social media have become a 'controlling force,' leading to a 'post-culture society' of 'dumbed down machines.' Welsh, who remains deeply connected to his working-class roots in Leith, Edinburgh, also reflected on the political landscape and the erosion of the middle class, arguing that modern economic insecurity has placed nearly everyone into a precarious state.</p>

          <p>In a commentary for The Guardian, Australian minister Ed Husic reflects on the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, questioning the international community's repeated failure to prevent such atrocities. The author shares the story of a Bosnian survivor in Australia and draws a direct parallel between the events in Bosnia and the current humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. The piece is a powerful call to action, urging the world to break the cycle of witnessing mass suffering, offering belated recognition, and then declaring 'never again' only in hindsight.</p>

That initial deployment, which uses human safety supervisors, has encountered some issues, including a minor accident captured on video. Tesla is now looking to expand its operational footprint as it works to catch up in the competitive robotaxi space.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, a trend that this article attributes directly to human-influenced climate change. While global average temperatures have risen by over 1.3°C, heatwaves in the UK are now 3-4°C warmer than in the past. The year 2025 has already seen record warmth and its third major heatwave, underscoring how once-rare extreme weather events are becoming a regular feature of British summers. Climate projections indicate this trend will continue, with hot spells becoming even more common, especially in southeastern England.</p>

          <p>In South Korea, a country with the world's lowest birth rate, fertility clinics are experiencing a significant boom in demand.

This trend offers a glimmer of hope amid a demographic crisis, as it shows a persistent desire for children.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel for their roles in what an internal report called an 'operational failure' during the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year.

In response to the security lapses, the Secret Service has implemented reforms, including improved technology and clearer lines of accountability, to prevent such an incident from happening again.

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at an accelerating rate, outpacing the general trend of global warming. The findings, published in Nature Geoscience, show that the longest and most extreme heat waves are becoming more frequent faster than less severe ones. This non-linear effect means that each fraction of a degree of warming will have a greater impact than the last, significantly increasing risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure. The study warns that adaptation strategies must accelerate to keep pace with these changes.</p>

          <p>A new report from UNAIDS warns that decades of progress in combating HIV/AIDS are at risk due to severe funding cuts, particularly from the United States. The Trump administration's sudden halt of most funding for the PEPFAR program has created a massive budget shortfall, threatening to unravel efforts that have saved millions of lives. UNAIDS estimates that without these funds, there could be an additional six million new infections and four million AIDS-related deaths in the next four years. The cuts are already disrupting critical research and treatment programs in highly affected regions like sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
