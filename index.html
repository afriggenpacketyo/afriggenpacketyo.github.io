          <p>Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the third-largest district in the U.S., is integrating AI chatbots into its curriculum, reversing an earlier ban driven by concerns about cheating and misinformation. The district has trained over 1,000 educators on AI tools and is deploying Google chatbots for more than 105,000 high schoolers. This shift aims to equip students with critical thinking skills to assess AI tools responsibly, reflecting a broader national trend encouraged by President Trump and Silicon Valley leaders. While some experts caution against over-reliance on chatbots, Miami school leaders emphasize using AI ethically and with proper guardrails to enhance learning and prepare students for future careers. </p>

          <p>Annual energy bills in the UK are predicted to fall by Â£129 in July, marking the first decrease in Ofgem's price cap in a year, according to analysts at Cornwall Insight. This nearly 7% drop will reduce the typical annual bill to Â£1,720 for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit. While this provides some relief, energy prices remain significantly higher than at the start of the decade, raising concerns about affordability for many households. Experts emphasize the need for government action to upgrade homes and reduce energy bills sustainably, with millions of people still struggling with energy debt. </p>

Poland's presidential race saw Rafal Trzaskowski, a liberal mayor, securing a spot in a runoff against Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian. While the center held, the elections revealed growing dissatisfaction with established parties and a notable presence of hard-right candidates, indicating potential future political instability. </p>

          <p>The EU and UK are working towards a level of cooperation not seen since Brexit, with new agreements on fisheries, trade and security, aiming to deepen defense and trade ties. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting the leadership of the European Union (EU) at a summit in London, and has inked agreements calling for deepening defense and trade ties. Since the UK formally left the EU in 2020 after the Brexit referendum in 2016, ties have mostly been governed under a "Trade and Cooperation Agreement" (TCA) negotiated by former conservative PM Boris Johnson and signed in December 2020. Since Brexit, common challenges facing the UK and EU include Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and a more isolationist and tariff-ready US policy under President Donald Trump. </p>

The statement noted that while this is a "more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.

          <p>The Democratic primary for mayor of Pittsburgh has evolved into a significant battle reflecting the national struggle over the Democratic Party's future direction. Incumbent Ed Gainey, running on a progressive platform, faces a challenge from Corey Oâ€™Connor, representing the party's more centrist wing. The race has drawn attention from outside political action groups, leading to heightened tensions and accusations of meddling. The election is seen as a referendum on whether Pittsburgh will continue its progressive policies or shift towards a more moderate approach. </p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced turbulent trading, with investors selling U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar, signaling growing unease about the U.S. economy. A congressional bill to make President Trumpâ€™s tax cuts permanent and Moodyâ€™s downgrade of the U.S. credit rating have contributed to concerns about federal debt and economic stability. Higher rates tend to push up the value of the U.S. dollar, but the currency slid on Monday against other major currencies like the euro and yen. Anxious investors on Monday also pushed up the price of gold, long a refuge during times of market stress, by nearly 2 percent. </p>

While the results are unlikely to produce major leadership changes, they highlight Chega's emergence as a powerful political force in Portugal. The election was called after the previous government was ousted in a vote of no confidence. Experts suggest the country is likely headed for another unstable minority government due to the center-right's refusal to ally with Chega. </p>

          <p>Many student loan borrowers are experiencing significant drops in their credit scores as loan servicers resume reporting delinquent accounts to credit bureaus. After a nearly four-year pandemic pause, monthly payments resumed in October 2023, but borrowers who couldn't pay were shielded from some consequences. Now, with that grace period over, many are seeing their credit scores plummet, with some reporting drops of over 100 points. This has spurred borrowers to take action, including using savings to bring loans up to date and working with servicers to establish payment plans. </p>

          <p>Keir Starmer banks on public being over Brexit. Sir Keir's big bet is that nobody really cares any more. The view at the top of government is that there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit â€“ membership of the single market and customs union â€“ but that making the relationship smoother within those parameters is mere pragmatic common sense. If Sir Keir is right that the bulk of the public simply wants as little friction with the EU as possible, then he could prove to be our first truly post-Brexit prime minister. </p>
