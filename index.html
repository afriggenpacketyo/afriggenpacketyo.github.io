          <p>President Trump's budget bill is facing significant hurdles in the US House due to Republican dissent over spending cuts and tax cuts. This BBC article reports that the bill, which includes extending tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime wages, and increasing defense spending, is estimated to add $2.3 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. Trump visited Congress to urge Republicans to support the bill, but hard-line members of the House Freedom Caucus are pushing for deeper spending cuts, while others want bigger tax cuts for their voters.</p>
