          <p>Federal prosecutors have a rapidly closing window to seek an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress, with the five-year statute of limitations expiring soon. The case revolves around Comey's 2020 testimony regarding the "Crossfire Hurricane" probe, but it faces significant hurdles, including potential resistance from career prosecutors who reportedly found insufficient evidence. Proving perjury is notoriously difficult, as it requires demonstrating not only that a statement was false but also that the defendant knowingly lied, making the outcome of this politically charged investigation highly uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI has determined that the suspect in the deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility, Joshua Jahn, undertook a "high degree of planning" before the attack. Evidence shows Jahn researched ICE agent locations, downloaded lists of federal facilities, and left handwritten notes expressing his intent to cause "real terror" for ICE personnel, whom he specifically targeted. The investigation, which also found notes indicating he acted alone and hated the federal government, provides insight into the premeditated nature of the assault that killed one detainee and critically injured two others.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing via a home equity loan has decreased, making it a more attractive option for homeowners. A typical $75,000 loan now has lower monthly payments compared to earlier in the year, with a 10-year term costing around $923 and a 15-year term about $726. The article suggests that while the costs are lower, homeowners should still carefully compare these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to determine the best financial product for their specific needs.

          <p>During a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President Donald Trump urged Turkey to stop buying Russian oil to curtail Moscow's energy funding amid the war in Ukraine. The discussion also touched upon Turkey's long-standing desire to purchase F-35 fighter jets, from which it was removed after acquiring a Russian missile defense system. While Trump expressed optimism about resolving the F-35 issue and potentially lifting sanctions, no firm commitments were made, highlighting the complex diplomatic relationship between the two NATO allies.</p>

          <p>A convention in Atlanta celebrated the latest revision of "The Sacred Harp," a Christian songbook first published in 1844 that uses a unique "shape-note" musical notation. This new edition, the result of seven years of work, includes 113 new songs and features compositions from a younger, more diverse group of singers, including the book's first Latino and Black composers. The tradition, which involves unaccompanied four-part harmony singing, is experiencing a revival, attracting a new generation of participants from various backgrounds and ensuring the vitality of this historic American musical form.</p>

          <p>A new study on Maria Branyas Morera, who lived to be 117, suggests her extreme longevity was due to a combination of unique genetic variants and healthy habits. Researchers at the University of Barcelona found she possessed genes that protected against many disorders, some of which had never been seen before. Her lifestyle, which included not smoking or drinking and a diet rich in fish, olive oil, and daily yogurt, likely also played a crucial role by promoting beneficial gut bacteria and combating chronic inflammation, a key factor in aging and disease.</p>

The article details the administration's disorganization, from a haphazard PR stunt with influencers to high-level strategy meetings, driven by President Trump's alleged concern that friends might be implicated in the documents.</p>

Incidents involving numerous drones entering Polish airspace and Russian fighter jets violating Estonian airspace have prompted strong warnings, with officials from Poland and the UK threatening to shoot down future violating aircraft. This hawkish turn, seemingly supported by President Trump, suggests a growing consensus that the risk of responding to these provocations is now less than the risk of allowing them to continue unchallenged.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Sean "Diddy" Combs have asked a federal judge to either vacate his two prostitution convictions or grant him a new trial, arguing that the case was a misuse of the 1910 Mann Act. Combs, who has been jailed since last September, was convicted in July of arranging interstate travel for prostitution but was acquitted of more severe sex trafficking charges. His defense team is arguing for a sentence of no more than 14 months, contending his life and legacy have already been destroyed, while prosecutors are seeking a significantly longer prison term.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued a memo directing federal agencies to prepare for potential mass firings of employees if a government funding deal is not reached by the October 1 deadline. This move escalates pressure on Congress, as the warning of "reduction-in-force" notices goes beyond the typical furloughs seen in past shutdowns. The memo targets programs not funded by mandatory appropriations or aligned with presidential priorities, a tactic Democrats have condemned as an "intimidation" effort by the Trump administration to force a budget agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card debt and interest rates remaining high, many Americans are considering debt relief options. The article advises that waiting for the Federal Reserve's rate cuts to lower credit card APRs is likely an ineffective strategy, as card issuers rarely pass on such savings to consumers. Instead, borrowers are encouraged to explore proactive solutions like debt consolidation, balance transfers, or formal debt management plans. These strategies can provide a more immediate and structured path to reducing high-interest balances, which grow daily and make repayment increasingly difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Republican party is currently split on how to approach free speech, with one faction advocating for restraint from government policing of speech and another, ascendant faction favoring using state power to police the speech of the left. This division is highlighted by the controversy over an FCC official's warning to ABC regarding Jimmy Kimmel's comments, which drew criticism from free-speech-oriented Republicans but support from others who endorse a "tit-for-tat" strategy. The article suggests that instead of focusing on retaliation, Republicans could pass substantive legislation to better protect expressive rights for all, regardless of who is in power.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of a million-year-old human skull, known as Yunxian 2, found in China suggests that our species, Homo sapiens, and our sister species like Neanderthals may have emerged at least 500,000 years earlier than previously believed. Researchers now think the skull belongs not to Homo erectus, but to an early form of Homo longi, a species at a similar developmental level to early Homo sapiens. If correct, this finding dramatically pushes back the timeline for the evolution of large-brained humans and implies these different human species co-existed for a much longer period.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is receiving significant pushback from fellow Labour MPs after criticizing the current Labour government and hinting at a potential leadership challenge against Prime Minister Keir Starmer. While Burnham claims some MPs have urged him to stand, a BBC survey of the parliamentary party revealed little appetite for a change, with many viewing his actions as self-indulgent and unhelpful. Starmer dismissed the issue as "personal ambitions" and contrasted his government's focus on economic stability with Burnham's calls for increased borrowing and spending.</p>

The agreement establishes a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, which will host U.S. user data and oversee security. A key component involves copying TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and retraining it to run solely on the data of its American user base, a complex solution intended to comply with a federal law mandating its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divest from the U.S. business.</p>
