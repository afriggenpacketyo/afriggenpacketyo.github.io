          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student at Tufts University, returned to Boston after being detained by ICE for over six weeks following her criticism of Tufts' response to the Gaza conflict. Ozturk's lawyers claim her arrest was an unlawful attempt to punish her for exercising her First Amendment rights. Upon her return, Senator Edward Markey and other politicians welcomed her and voiced their support. Ozturk plans to continue her legal battle, expressing faith in the American justice system, while also acknowledging the loss of freedom and education during her detention.</p>

          <p>Germany's newly elected Chancellor Friedrich Merz appointed several individuals with business backgrounds to top cabinet positions, sparking concerns about potential lobbying influence. Critics have raised questions about conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the new minister of economic affairs and energy, Katherina Reiche, who previously worked for an energy provider. While Germany has regulations for lobbyists, including a Lobby Register, loopholes and a lack of enforcement mechanisms remain a challenge. The situation has prompted calls for greater transparency and stricter rules to prevent undue influence from special interests in political decision-making.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after a failed attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. The party leadership believed Han had a better chance of winning the elections, but PPP members voted against the motion to switch candidates. Kim thanked his supporters and pledged to work towards the happiness of the South Korean people, while Han accepted the outcome of the vote.</p>
