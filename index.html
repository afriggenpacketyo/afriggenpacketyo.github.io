        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the Labour Party has announced plans to tighten immigration rules in the UK, responding to voter frustration over high immigration levels. The new legislation aims to end what Starmer calls Britain's failed experiment in open borders by restricting skilled visas to graduate jobs and lower-skilled visas to critical industrial sectors, while requiring businesses to increase training for British workers. Additionally, the government intends to raise English language requirements for adult dependents to promote integration and reduce exploitation risks, marking a significant shift from previous immigration policies and focusing on a controlled, selective, and fair system.</p>

          <h2>Tax Code Tweaks Could Expedite Rebuilding After Los Angeles Fires</h2>

          <p>A contributor to the Los Angeles Times argues that Congress should amend the Internal Revenue Code to help victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires rebuild their homes. The proposed changes include exempting fire victims from income taxes on insurance proceeds and lot sales, and allowing buyers to defer income taxes on home sales if the proceeds are used to build or buy in the fire areas. These measures aim to remove disincentives for rebuilding and encourage reinvestment in affected communities, ensuring a faster recovery for fire-ravaged areas and restoring the tax base.</p>

          <p>U.S. Congressman Robert Garcia issued a report calling for increased federal oversight of the privatized emergency alert system after an investigation into faulty alerts sent during the Los Angeles wildfires. The report, titled “Sounding the Alarm: Lessons From the Kenneth Fire False Alerts,” alleges a technical flaw by Genasys caused a false evacuation alert to be sent across the region. The report recommends increased federal funding for FEMA's Integrated Public Alert & Warning System and urges the FCC to establish performance standards for Wireless Emergency Alerts to prevent future incidents and improve public trust in emergency notifications.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that wild chimpanzees possess communication skills involving rhythmic structures and call combinations, providing insight into the evolution of human language. Studies of chimpanzees in East and West Africa reveal distinct drumming patterns among different populations, akin to regional accents, suggesting learned and controlled rhythmic communication. Additionally, research in Côte d'Ivoire shows that chimps combine calls to alter meanings, similar to how humans form sentences. These findings support the idea that rhythmic structures and call combinations were present early in human evolution, highlighting the complexity of chimpanzee communication and its potential connection to the development of human language.</p>
