        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos described the current state of artificial intelligence as an "industrial bubble," acknowledging that investor excitement has led to both good and bad ideas receiving funding. Speaking at Italian Tech Week, he compared the situation to past bubbles, like the dot-com era, noting that while stock prices can become disconnected from fundamentals, the underlying technology is real and transformative. Bezos argued that such bubbles can ultimately be beneficial, as the innovations from winning companies will provide "gigantic" benefits to society, similar to how the 1990s biotech bubble produced life-saving drugs despite many company failures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding designated for major transit projects in Chicago, including an extension of the Red Line subway. Russ Vought, the Office of Management and Budget director, stated the hold was to review "race-based contracting" and ensure funds are not flowing through improper diversity initiatives. This action follows a similar freeze of $18 billion for New York transit projects and is seen as a tactic to pressure Democratic lawmakers during the ongoing partial government shutdown. The move is expected to face legal challenges, as it jeopardizes critical infrastructure upgrades.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly mass shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, a fundraiser was established for the family of the accused shooter. The organizer, a fellow church member, cited religious teachings on caring for widows and the fatherless, noting the shooter's family are also victims of the tragedy and have a son with serious medical needs. The attack, which killed four and injured eight, was reportedly motivated by hatred for the Mormon faith, yet the fundraiser has garnered significant support from the community. As of Friday, it had raised over $334,000, demonstrating a remarkable display of forgiveness.</p>

          <p>San Francisco 49ers quarterback Mac Jones revealed the straightforward motivation behind his choice to wear suits to games, stating, "I wear suits because I’m going to work." After leading his team to a 26-23 overtime victory against the Los Angeles Rams, Jones addressed his gameday attire with a simple and professional outlook. Currently undefeated as the 49ers' starter while filling in for the injured Brock Purdy, Jones is thriving in his new role.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has strongly condemned Mexico for launching multiple anti-dumping investigations into Chinese imports, labeling the actions as protectionist. Beijing has threatened to take all necessary measures to protect the interests of its companies, noting a significant increase in such probes this year. The Chinese government also criticized the United States, accusing it of coercing Mexico into adopting a tougher trade stance against China. The statement urged Mexico to abide by WTO rules and join China in opposing unilateralism and protectionism in the global economy.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation have released a statement describing the deadly attack on their synagogue as a "desecration" that has "changed us all forever." The statement, issued on behalf of the rabbi and other leaders, expressed the community's profound grief over the murder of two beloved members on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism. They described the victims not just as members but as friends and family whose absence creates an unfillable void. The synagogue also acknowledged the extraordinary courage and kindness shown by many in the wake of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>New findings from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) highlight a "motherhood penalty," showing that mothers in England experience a substantial and long-lasting decrease in earnings after having children. Five years after the birth of their first child, a mother's monthly earnings are, on average, £1,051 lower than before they had children. The report indicates that factors such as unaffordable childcare, an unbalanced parental leave system, and maternity discrimination contribute to this gap. Campaign groups are calling the findings "abhorrent" and "avoidable," urging policy changes to address the systemic issues that penalize women for becoming mothers.</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect their money's buying power, with top accounts currently providing returns that outpace inflation. This article explains the current landscape of CD rates, noting that online banks typically offer more competitive rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead costs. It also highlights the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs (around six months to one year) presently offer higher interest rates than long-term ones. Financial experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs to take advantage of these high short-term rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

While the FOMC voted for a rate cut in September and signaled more could come, Goolsbee is wary of "front-loading" cuts and assuming inflation will simply disappear. Despite his caution, he believes the underlying economy can support a gradual reduction in rates over time. (not investment advice)</p>

This technology enables retailers to change prices in minutes, which can improve efficiency and help move perishable items, potentially reducing food waste. However, some lawmakers and consumer advocates express concern that these digital tags could pave the way for "dynamic pricing," where costs for essential goods could surge based on demand, time of day, or other factors.

The music fostered a unique "cholombiano" identity, blending cholo aesthetics with a deep reverence for Colombian artists.

          <p>Deonte' Nash, a former stylist for Sean "Diddy" Combs, is suing the music mogul for alleged sexual abuse and violence, asserting that his legal action is not financially motivated. Nash stated that the lawsuit is about "making myself feel whole" after what he describes as a frightening decade working for Combs. He alleges multiple instances of physical and emotional abuse, which Combs's legal team has denied as "falsehoods." Nash, who recently testified at Combs's criminal trial, said he felt empowered to speak up for himself and for Combs's ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, another key witness.</p>

          <p>The recent execution of Huang Lin-kai in Taiwan has reignited the debate over the country's retention of the death penalty, an outlier among many developed democracies. The execution, the first in five years, was seen by some activists as a political statement and a disregard for due process, as it allegedly occurred while an appeal was pending. While public opinion polls show strong support for capital punishment, opponents argue it violates human rights and risks executing the innocent. The justice minister defended the decision, stating all legal remedies had been exhausted in what was deemed a "most serious" case of intentional homicide.</p>

          <p>Dame Patricia Routledge, the acclaimed actress best known for her iconic role as the snobbish Hyacinth Bucket in the BBC sitcom "Keeping Up Appearances," has died at the age of 96. Her career spanned decades and showcased remarkable range, from celebrated stage performances that earned her both a Tony and an Olivier Award to dramatic roles in Alan Bennett's "Talking Heads." She became a household name in the 1990s, with her portrayal of Hyacinth (pronounced "bouquet") lampooning English social pretensions and endearing her to millions of viewers worldwide.

          <p>An immigration judge has denied a request to reopen the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was erroneously deported earlier this year and subsequently returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges. His lawyers had sought to have his case reopened to allow him to pursue an asylum claim, but the judge found insufficient evidence that his removal to a third country was imminent. Abrego Garcia had previously been granted a withholding of removal, which should have protected him from deportation to El Salvador due to gang threats. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that his final order of removal stands.</p>

          <p>David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has warned that a stock market "drawdown" is likely in the next one to two years as the frenzy around artificial intelligence runs ahead of its actual potential. Speaking at Italian Tech Week, Solomon compared the current excitement to the dot-com bubble, noting that while huge new companies will emerge, a lot of invested capital will not deliver returns. He stated that when investors are excited, they often overlook risks, leading to a market that will eventually face a "reset." This sentiment echoes concerns from other business leaders about a potential bubble in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An upcoming episode of "48 Hours" will detail the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich, who was found dead in a parking garage at an Intel campus in Oregon. Investigators believe the killer, wearing a mask, killed Fandrich inside a maroon minivan after spray-painting security cameras to hide the crime. The prime suspect was Dr. Steven Milner, a former veterinarian who had been stalking Fandrich. A critical piece of evidence, the minivan believed to be the primary crime scene, was inadvertently sold to a scrapyard and destroyed just a week before detectives located it, complicating the prosecution's case.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is under intense pressure from both industry groups and public health advocates as he considers signing a bill to ban the sale of cookware containing PFAS, known as "forever chemicals." The legislation is opposed by the cookware industry and some celebrity chefs, who argue that nonstick pans are essential and that the industry is being unfairly targeted. Proponents, including environmental groups and actor Mark Ruffalo, argue the ban is a necessary step to reduce exposure to the toxic compounds, which are linked to serious health problems. The decision is being closely watched as it could influence similar legislation in other states.</p>

          <p>A significant breakthrough has been announced in the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders, where four teenage girls were killed. Law enforcement officials revealed that new DNA and ballistics technology has identified Robert Eugene Brashers, a deceased serial killer, as the likely sole perpetrator. The case, which had remained cold for nearly 34 years, was cracked after investigators re-examined a shell casing and a fragmented DNA profile, linking them to other unsolved crimes committed by Brashers. This development brings long-awaited answers to the victims' families and is expected to fully exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted for the crime years ago.</p>

The two-month crackdown will target discussions that incite group antagonism or frame topics like education and hard work as "useless." The campaign also aims to curb "anxiety-inducing content" related to employment and dating. This move represents a shift in Beijing's censorship efforts, placing direct responsibility on internet companies to manage and curb user behaviors that authorities believe foster social negativity.</p>

          <p>According to Brendan Wallace, CEO of venture capital firm Fifth Wall, the "winter" for property technology investment is over, but the climate-related subsector continues to struggle. While property tech as a whole is seeing a rebound with new unicorns and successful IPOs, investment in decarbonization and sustainability tech for real estate has been hampered by a negative political shift away from ESG initiatives. Wallace notes that while national policy may be unfavorable, local governments are still pushing for decarbonization, often through carbon taxes. Fifth Wall is continuing to invest in the space, seeing an opportunity due to currently attractive valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the EAT-Lancet Commission asserts that even with a full transition away from fossil fuels, current food and farming systems will push global temperatures past the critical 1.5°C threshold. The report concludes that the most effective way to mitigate this is for people in wealthier countries to adopt more plant-based diets and consume less meat and dairy. This dietary shift, combined with reducing food waste and improving agricultural methods, could cut annual emissions from food systems by over half. The commission's findings face an uphill battle against aggressive lobbying from the meat industry, which has historically worked to undermine such scientific consensus.</p>
