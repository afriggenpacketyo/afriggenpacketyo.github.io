        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norwich City has terminated Johannes Hoff Thorup's contract as head coach following a series of disappointing results, and former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has been appointed to manage the team for the remaining two games of the season. Thorup's tenure lasted less than a year, marked by 14 wins in 47 games. The club's sporting director cited recent poor performance as the reason for the change. Wilshere, previously a first-team coach, will be assisted by Tony Roberts and Nick Stanley as they prepare for upcoming matches against Middlesbrough and Cardiff.</p>

          <p>Florida's public universities are facing scrutiny for their formal cooperation agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), leading to revoked visas and student protests. Unlike elite universities in the Northeast, Florida institutions are openly cooperating with ICE, granting campus police immigration enforcement powers. These agreements, described as 'force multipliers for ICE,' allow universities to question, arrest, and prepare charges for suspected immigration violations. Students have had their visas revoked for various reasons, including speech and past crimes, with universities often receiving no explanation for the changes in student statuses.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent tariff announcements have sparked anxiety and panic within the US economy, as evidenced by a plunge in consumer confidence. Consumers are stocking up on products likely to face price hikes, such as cars and electronics. Businesses are also predicting a slowdown in production, indicating that the tariffs are undermining Trump's goal of reviving American manufacturing. Economists caution that this trend is unsustainable and not indicative of a healthy economy.</p>

          <p>Infighting and backstabbing are resurfacing within President Trump's administration, fueled by controversies related to trade, national security, and loyalty. Tensions are evident in the Pentagon, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces scrutiny for sharing sensitive information outside classified channels. The president's tolerance for chaos and a competitive atmosphere among staff members contribute to the discord. The situation tests White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, known for imposing order on Trump's orbit.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations to address higher levies imposed by Washington. The proposal involves increasing the amount imported from the United States to around 410,000 tons from the current 350,000. Japan has traditionally protected its domestic rice industry, but the government has determined that some concessions are necessary to secure exemption from U.S. tariffs. The proposal also comes amid growing calls in Japan for more affordable imported rice, as prices continue to surge.</p>

          <p>Walt Disney's theme park business is potentially at risk due to a slowdown in air travel to the U.S., stemming from President Trump's tariffs. International guests account for a significant portion of Disney's park attendance, and recent data indicates a decline in foreign arrivals. Economic uncertainty surrounding global trade and warnings from other countries have deterred foreigners from visiting the U.S. Increased competition from Universal's new theme park further complicates the situation, though Disney's cruise business may offset some weakness.
