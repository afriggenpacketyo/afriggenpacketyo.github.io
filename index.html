          <p>Two North Korean fishermen are stuck in South Korea after their boat drifted across the maritime boundary, marking the longest period any reluctant defectors have been held. Despite repeatedly expressing their desire to return home, Pyongyang has refused to communicate with Seoul, a sign of displeasure with the South Korean government's hard-line stance. The article notes that North Korea has officially designated South Korea as a hostile state, severing all communication lines. Their fate hinges on improved inter-Korean relations, particularly after the upcoming South Korean presidential election, where a more conciliatory leader could potentially facilitate their repatriation. Optimism is tempered by the grim reality of potential repercussions for their families back home, who may face harsh treatment due to their accidental defection.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the origins of Indigenous Americans to migrants from modern-day Russia who arrived in the Americas between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of over 1,500 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in Eurasia and the Americas, revealing genetic variations that provide insights into population history, migration, and adaptation. The findings corroborate existing archaeological evidence and highlight the genetic diversity within Indigenous groups, including adaptations to extreme environments.</p>

The post, which has since been deleted, showed seashells arranged to form the shapes "86 47." Trump supporters claimed it was a veiled call to assassinate the president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post. Trump and administration officials rejected Comey's explanation, with Trump labeling him a "dirty cop."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being members of a violent gang under a centuries-old wartime law. The ruling indicated that a majority of the justices were skeptical of whether the migrants had been afforded enough due process protections. The justices sent the case back to an appeals court to examine claims by the migrants that they could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act, and to consider how much notice the government should be required to provide migrants so they have an opportunity to challenge their deportations.</p>
