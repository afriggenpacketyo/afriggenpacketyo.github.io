            <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had her purse stolen while dining at a restaurant in downtown Washington, D.C. The purse contained approximately $3,000 in cash, intended for family dinner and Easter gifts, as well as her passport, driver's license, blank checks, keys, and medication. The U.S. Secret Service is reviewing security footage showing an unidentified white male, wearing a medical mask, snatching the bag, but the incident remains unresolved. Noem stated that the Secret Service is aware of the theft, but she has not yet spoken to the agency about it.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the constitutionality of the US Preventive Services Taskforce, which determines which preventive services health insurers must cover without cost to patients under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The case questions whether the law gives the HHS secretary appropriate supervision over the taskforce, or if the group operates as a largely independent governmental body whose recommendations effectively have the force of law. A ruling against the ACA could result in life-saving tests and treatments becoming subject to co-pays and deductibles, potentially deterring many Americans from obtaining them.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive care services currently provided at no cost under the Affordable Care Act. The dispute centers on the classification of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, with arguments focusing on whether its members are principal officers who require presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. A ruling against the ACA could limit access to vital medical care, while the Biden and Trump administrations have defended the task force's structure. The court's decision, expected by the end of June, could have significant ramifications for healthcare access.</p>
