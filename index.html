          <p>Christopher Moynihan, pardoned by Trump for his involvement in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, has been charged with threatening to kill House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Jeffries expressed gratitude for law enforcement's swift action and criticized Trump's blanket pardons, claiming many released criminals have committed additional crimes. Moynihan faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat and is being held on bail. </p>

          <p>Methane (CH4), a colorless and odorless gas, is a significant contributor to climate change, trapping 84 times more heat than carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 20-year period. While methane dissipates faster than CO2, it accounts for 20-30% of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. Human activities, including agriculture, waste management, and the energy sector, contribute to 60% of methane emissions. The energy sector releases methane through oil and gas production, transportation, and storage, often unintentionally due to leaks or through venting and flaring practices.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center. While Melissa is not expected to directly impact the mainland United States, models show multiple potential paths. The storm is producing winds up to 45 miles per hour. The storm could pass over Haiti, Cuba, or turn toward Central America, and it has the potential to be a long, drawn-out affair lasting well into next week. Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Jamaica and Cuba should prepare for heavy rain, strong winds, flooding and rough surf.</p>

          <p>Cattle ranchers in Texas are concerned about the potential return of the screwworm, a parasitic fly, and the impact of President Trump's talk about importing beef from Argentina. The New World screwworm, eradicated from the U.S. in 1966, has recently appeared in Mexico, prompting border closures. Ranchers are urging the government to focus on eradicating the screwworm threat rather than manipulating the market. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association also expressed concerns about Argentina's trade relationship with the U.S. and the risk of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>

          <p>The annual Orionids meteor shower is set to peak tonight, offering a potentially impressive display visible across the globe. The meteors are known for being bright and fast, originating from debris left by Halley's Comet. Skygazers in the Northern Hemisphere may also have the chance to see either comet Lemmon or SWAN. For the best viewing conditions, find a dark spot away from city lights after midnight with an unobstructed view of the sky. Clear skies are expected across the UK, and the lack of moonlight will enhance visibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government shut down after President Trump and congressional Republicans failed to avert a lapse in federal funding. Government shutdowns occur when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Since 1980, there have been 15 instances of government shutdowns, with President Ronald Reagan overseeing eight during his time in office. The shutdowns have stemmed from various disputes, including disagreements over spending cuts, welfare expansion, and immigration policy. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses.</p>
