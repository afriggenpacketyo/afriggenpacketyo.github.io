        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins, largely thanks to their power hitting. Shohei Ohtani contributed a two-run homer in the first inning, while Will Smith added two solo home runs, boosting his National League-leading batting average. This performance provided a much-needed lift for the team's offense, which has been struggling recently. However, the win was somewhat marred by an injury to closer Tanner Scott, who left the game in the ninth inning with an apparent arm issue.</p>

          <p>A new immersive experience in London called 'Elvis Evolution' is facing backlash from attendees who feel they were misled. The show, which was initially promoted as featuring a life-sized AI hologram of Elvis Presley, instead uses upscaled archive footage and live actors. Disappointed fans have called the event, with tickets costing up to £300, "atrocious and misleading," and many are seeking refunds. The creator, Layered Reality, defended the show as a creative choice to not mimic iconic performances but to offer a new perspective on Elvis's life.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's sovereign wealth fund, Danantara, is set to sign an $8 billion contract with American engineering firm KBR Inc. to construct 17 modular refineries. This major infrastructure deal is a component of a broader trade pact between Indonesia and the United States. The agreement was instrumental in reducing a proposed U.S. tariff rate from 32% to 19%. This development, which had not been previously reported, was confirmed by sources and an economic ministry presentation following the trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's economic strategy reveals a strong preference for using tariffs over traditional sanctions to exert international pressure. This approach aligns with his "America First" agenda, providing direct unilateral control and generating revenue for the U.S. Treasury. However, critics argue this method creates significant uncertainty in global markets and blurs the line between trade policy and punitive actions, potentially destabilizing international relations.

Schnabl contends that this limits the scope of narratives and reinforces stereotypes, preventing more universal or diverse stories from being told.

          <p>According to an analysis by property portal Zoopla, the average monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has surged by £221 over the past three years. This 21% increase is attributed to high tenant demand and a shortage of available rental properties. The rising costs are forcing some individuals to make career decisions based on local rent prices and leading parents to financially support their adult children. While the rate of increase has recently slowed, particularly in cities, affordability remains a significant challenge for many renters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recently circulated close-up images of China's fifth-generation J-35 fighter jets provide strong evidence that the aircraft is nearing operational readiness. The photos show the jets with clear naval markings and a "Flying Shark" insignia, indicating their formal integration into the navy's carrier aviation force. A military analyst noted that the official serial numbers suggest the fighters are part of an initial production run. This development marks a significant step toward deploying the advanced stealth jets on China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian.</p>

          <p>The family of Keith McAllister, 61, who died in a tragic accident involving an MRI machine, is holding the facility's technician responsible for his death. They allege the technician invited McAllister into the scan room to help his wife but failed to warn him about the metal chain he was wearing, which caused him to be pulled into the machine's powerful magnetic field. McAllister remained stuck for nearly an hour and later died from multiple heart attacks. The incident is currently under investigation by Nassau County Police.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the Air India crash that killed 260 people has ignited a storm of controversy and speculation. The investigation is focused on why the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position just seconds after takeoff, leading to a complete loss of engine power. While the cockpit voice recording captured one pilot questioning the other about the action, investigators are urging caution and have condemned speculative media reports as the full probe, expected to take a year, continues.</p>

Hankison is the only officer to face criminal conviction in connection with the fatal raid.

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 migrants from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The program grants temporary protection from deportation and work permits to individuals from countries deemed unsafe. While the court acknowledged that the plaintiffs have a plausible case, it found insufficient evidence to block the policy while the lawsuit continues. This decision raises the risk of deportation for thousands who may be forced to return to unstable home countries.</p>

These posts include demands for the Washington Commanders to revert to their old name and attacks on political opponents. Figures like former Rep. Joe Walsh and Rev.

          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Donald Trump's universal tariffs may have an unintended positive consequence. The economic pressure from these tariffs is compelling countries and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers. By exposing domestic protectionism and inefficiencies, the tariff crisis could be acting as a catalyst for these nations to pursue internal reforms that ultimately free up their own economies and boost commerce.
