          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have finalized a comprehensive deal aimed at improving their relationship following Britain's departure from the bloc in 2020. The agreement encompasses various sectors including security, energy, trade, travel, and fisheries, with officials from both sides expressing optimism about this "historic day" and the beginning of a "new chapter." The British government projects that the deal will bolster businesses, create jobs, reduce food costs, cut bureaucratic processes, improve access to the EU market, and potentially add Â£9 billion to the UK economy by 2040. The agreement also includes a new Security and Defence Partnership, extended fishing rights for EU trawlers, and easier travel for British citizens and their pets.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing new regulations to oversee the burgeoning "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) industry, addressing concerns about potential consumer debt traps. These rules will require BNPL firms, such as Klarna and Afterpay, to conduct thorough upfront checks to ensure consumers can afford repayments. The new regulations will also streamline the refund process and allow consumers to escalate complaints to the Financial Ombudsman. City Minister Emma Reynolds emphasized that these measures aim to provide both consumer protection and the necessary certainty for the sector's investment and job creation.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, at age 82, has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. His office has described it as an aggressive form, categorized with a Gleason score of 9, indicating a severe condition. While routine screening for prostate cancer in men over 75 is controversial, Biden's new symptoms prompted a prostate exam, leading to the discovery of a nodule. Given Biden's age and health, the primary treatment goal is to manage the disease, slow its progression, and maintain his quality of life. Treatment options include testosterone-blocking medication and bone-targeted therapies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that annual energy bills for domestic customers in the UK will decrease by Â£129 in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This reduction of nearly 7% will bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to Â£1,720, down from the current level of Â£1,849. While this decrease is a welcome development for households, energy prices remain significantly higher than at the start of the decade, raising concerns about affordability for many. The energy price cap covers approximately 22 million households in England, Wales, and Scotland.</p>

          <p>Qualcomm plans to launch data center processors designed to power artificial intelligence, which will link to Nvidia's chips. This marks Qualcomm's re-entry into the data center market after previous unsuccessful attempts. The new custom CPU will connect to Nvidia's GPUs and software, a crucial link given Nvidia's dominance in AI-related semiconductors. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia in 2021, which designs processors based on Arm designs, to bolster its efforts with data center CPUs. This move is part of Qualcomm's broader strategy to diversify its business beyond smartphones, as Apple and other players develop their own modems and processors.</p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland have shown a halt, or at least a slowdown, in the rise of hard-right movements, though discontent with established political parties persists. In Romania, centrist mayor Nicusor Dan defeated a hard-line nationalist, George Simion, in a runoff election, confounding expectations of a sharp turn to the right. Poland's election saw liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski come in first, securing a runoff against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, though the margin of victory was small, indicating strong support for hard-right candidates. The outcome reflects a broader trend of fragmentation and a move away from traditional political allegiances in Eastern Europe.</p>

          <p>The city of Milwaukee is facing a lead poisoning crisis in its schools, with several buildings temporarily closed due to lead contamination. However, the Trump administration has denied the city's request for federal support by laying off the lead exposure team within the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health. This leaves Milwaukee to manage the crisis independently, without access to the federal expertise needed for epidemiological investigations. The city has been inspecting schools and replacing lead water service lines, but officials emphasize the need for state or federal funding to complete the remediation efforts. This situation highlights the potential consequences of reduced federal involvement in public health emergencies.</p>

          <p>Sean Combs, also known as Diddy, is facing a trial in Manhattan on charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault, which could result in a life sentence. The trial will feature testimony from former employees and other witnesses, with early revelations emerging from the testimony of Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, who detailed a pattern of beatings and participation in drug-fueled sexual assault marathons. The prosecution alleges that Combs coerced Ventura and another woman to participate in these events, while the defense argues that the government is twisting consensual encounters into serious federal charges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reversing course on Medicaid social services, arguing that government health insurance should not pay for them. This decision is creating chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs to include services like housing and nutrition. The administration argues that these services should be funded by other federal programs, while also proposing cuts to those programs. Health experts warn that this disinvestment will lead to more deaths, suffering, and higher healthcare costs, as social problems such as homelessness and food insecurity can worsen physical and behavioral health conditions.</p>

The division has also reported adjusted profits for two consecutive years. Ant Group, based in Hangzhou, owns Alipay, a widely used digital payments app and financial services provider in China. The company's overall profit grew by 61% in 2024 to 38.3 billion yuan (US$5.3 billion).</p>

          <p>Recent polls in the UK indicate a significant decline in support for the Labour party since their victory last summer, with the Reform party gaining traction. Reform held the lead in voting intention for the entire month of February, marking a rare challenge to the two major parties. Support for Reform has grown across all demographic groups, including the young, while Labour's share has declined across the country. Prime Minister Starmer's approval ratings have also fallen, with negative perceptions outweighing positive ones. The data is compiled from polls by various respected polling organizations.</p>

The facility, costing â‚¬400m, will be built in an isolated location deep in the Amazon jungle. Justice Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin stated that the prison will target organized crime at all levels of the drug supply chain and will house up to 500 people, with a separate wing for the most dangerous criminals. The prison aims to isolate drug lords from their criminal networks and enforce an "extremely strict carceral regime."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is emerging over what constitutes "quality" child care in America, with divides between progressives and conservatives on whether quality should be measured by caregiver credentials or children's happiness. States have implemented Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) to assess child care quality, but evidence is mixed on whether these ratings predict better outcomes for children. As regulations shift, the definition of quality and the balance between measurable outcomes and family preferences remain critical questions. The Trump administration's policies may reduce restrictions and promote lower-cost options, while de-emphasizing academic credentials.</p>

          <p>India is planning to tighten foreign ownership rules to simplify regulations and plug loopholes. The changes would redefine how India views foreign-owned companies, making them subject to foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations when it comes to share transfers or restructurings. New Delhi plans to create a new category of "foreign-owned and controlled entities" (FOCE), which will also include Indian firms with "indirect foreign investment." Any transfer of the indirect shareholding will need to be reported and will have to comply with sectoral foreign investment caps.</p>

Many of the listings did not include their license number or specify whether the owner was an individual or a company, while others listed numbers that didn't match what authorities had. This action comes as Spain grapples with a housing affordability crisis, with many Spaniards protesting rising housing and rental costs driven up by holiday rentals on platforms like Airbnb. Barcelona has also announced plans to close down all licensed short-term rentals by 2028.</p>
