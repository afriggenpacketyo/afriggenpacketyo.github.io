          <p>Jim Lovell, the esteemed commander of the near-disastrous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. NASA confirmed his death, celebrating his legacy as a four-time spaceflight veteran whose courage helped pave the way for lunar exploration. Lovell famously led his crew safely back to Earth after an onboard explosion crippled their spacecraft in 1970, an event immortalized in the film "Apollo 13." A recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, his contributions to the American space program remain foundational and widely revered.</p>

          <p>Billy Long is leaving his position as IRS commissioner after only two months, with the White House announcing his nomination to become the ambassador to Iceland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will temporarily lead the agency, which has experienced significant leadership turnover and workforce reductions under the Trump administration. Long, a former congressman without a background in accounting, was a controversial choice for the role. His brief tenure occurred amidst plans to cut the IRS workforce by up to 40% and internal disputes over data sharing and leadership appointments.</p>

          <p>Over 90 Muslim leaders and institutions in the United States have jointly called for Muslim-majority countries to take decisive action to end the conflict in Gaza. The statement urges nations to use their political and economic leverage, suggesting measures like severing diplomatic ties with Israel and imposing oil embargoes to pressure for a resolution. This call comes as the humanitarian crisis worsens, with the letter specifically asking for five concrete steps to be taken. In a related development, some US Reform Jewish leaders have also issued a statement calling for an end to the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin soon, with the location to be announced shortly. The announcement coincides with a deadline Trump imposed on Russia to cease its war in Ukraine or face significant "secondary tariffs" on its oil trade partners. While Trump expressed optimism that both sides desire peace, uncertainty remains over the potential for new sanctions. Reports suggest ongoing diplomatic efforts to broker a deal that could potentially allow Russia to retain territory it has occupied, a key point of contention in previous negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is demanding a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to restore hundreds of millions in suspended federal research funding. The move follows a Department of Justice investigation that concluded UCLA was "deliberately indifferent" to a hostile environment for Jewish students during pro-Palestinian campus protests in the spring of 2024. The university's president stated that a payment of this magnitude would be devastating to the public university system. This action marks a significant escalation in the administration's scrutiny of universities' handling of campus activism and civil rights.</p>

          <p>Shares for rare earth miner MP Materials rose after the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the second quarter, driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide.

          <p>WNBA star Caitlin Clark has opened up about the physical and mental challenges of her injury-plagued sophomore season with the Indiana Fever. Having played in just 13 of a possible 31 games due to separate quad and groin injuries, Clark described the experience as frustrating and unlike anything she has faced before. She explained that the process of constant rehab and being thrown back into games without a proper ramp-up has been difficult. Clark believes the experience, while hard, will ultimately give her a better understanding of her body and perspective on what other athletes endure.</p>

This fear can pressure individuals to accept plea deals, prevent victims from seeking protective orders, or hinder prosecutions.

She also emphasizes the value of tidying one's workspace during a break to care for the creative environment. The key insight is to work with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than fighting against them, viewing these micro-adjustments and movements as an integral part of the creative process itself.</p>

          <p>President Trump's implementation of sweeping new tariffs has led some economists to warn of an increased risk of stagflation, a period of high inflation combined with low economic growth.

This comes as the job market shows signs of wobbling and inflation is projected to inch higher, creating a challenging scenario for the Federal Reserve.

          <p>Several people were arrested for disorderly conduct during a protest outside the federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan. Demonstrators gathered to accuse U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of operating a covert and inhumane detention facility on the 10th floor of the 26 Federal Plaza building. Activists, including faith-based groups, allege that immigrants are being held in overcrowded rooms without basic amenities or legal access after their court hearings. This protest is one of several recent demonstrations demanding access to the site for officials and journalists, which authorities insist is only a processing center.</p>

          <p>The massive corporate investment in artificial intelligence is creating a clear divide in the digital advertising landscape, according to recent tech earnings reports. Giants like Meta and Alphabet are seeing significant returns, with AI helping to boost ad system efficiency and drive strong revenue growth. In contrast, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered more lukewarm results, with Snap's ad platform update faltering and Pinterest noting a pullback in spending. The trend suggests that in the AI-powered ad race, companies with the capital to invest heavily are pulling away from the competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alex Call, the Dodgers' recent trade deadline acquisition, has become one of Major League Baseball's toughest hitters to strike out, a stark contrast to his early minor-league career. After a difficult 2019 season, Call dedicated himself to revamping his approach, using the 2020 pandemic shutdown to refine his swing and adopt virtual reality training to improve his plate discipline. This transformation allowed him to cut his strikeout rate dramatically and earn his way to the major leagues. The Dodgers acquired the versatile outfielder for his ability to grind out at-bats and consistently get on base.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving brush fire, dubbed the Canyon fire, has forced thousands of evacuations in a mountainous area spanning Ventura and Los Angeles counties in Southern California. The blaze erupted Thursday and quickly grew to thousands of acres, fueled by record-low moisture levels in the vegetation and triple-digit temperatures. Hundreds of firefighters worked through the night to protect homes, achieving 25% containment by Friday morning. However, conditions remain dangerous with extreme heat and low humidity, and officials warn that the risk of extreme fire behavior remains high throughout the region.</p>

The company has been running a limited, invitation-only robotaxi pilot in Austin using Model Y vehicles with a human safety supervisor on board. This new permit, valid until 2026, allows for operation anywhere in the state, including with fully automated vehicles without a driver.

          <p>A new billboard on a Southern California freeway has injected the far-right group the Proud Boys into the controversy surrounding actor Sydney Sweeney. The banner reads "Proud Boys Love Sydney Sweeney" and references her recent American Eagle ad campaign with the phrase "She has the best blue genes." The ad, which played on the words "genes" and "jeans," had already faced criticism for allegedly invoking eugenics, while also drawing praise from conservative figures and President Trump. It is unclear who is responsible for the billboard, which uses the neo-fascist group's signature colors.</p>

          <p>Automotive analysts report a significant surge in electric vehicle sales as consumers hurry to make purchases before the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 is eliminated after September 30. New legislation signed by President Trump ended the Biden-era incentive, which was originally set to last through 2032. July saw the second-highest monthly EV sales on record, with some models like the Chevy Equinox EV hitting all-time highs.

Cape buffalo are known to be extremely dangerous and are responsible for numerous injuries and deaths each year. The incident highlights the significant risks involved in big-game hunting, a practice that remains a multi-million dollar industry in South Africa.</p>
