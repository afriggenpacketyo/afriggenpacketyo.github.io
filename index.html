          <p>The fragile trade truce between the U.S. and China is showing signs of unraveling, with both countries accusing each other of violating the agreement made in Geneva. The U.S. is concerned about China's stalling on export license approvals for rare earths, while China points to U.S. curbs on chip design software and AI chips produced by Huawei. Despite the tensions, a phone call between Trump and Xi has occurred, offering a glimmer of hope for breaking the deadlock. The situation is further complicated by a U.S. court ruling that deemed Trump's tariffs illegal, creating uncertainty about the U.S. position, and tariffs are also distracting from the tech battle between the two nations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit narrowed significantly in April, coinciding with President Trump's tariff escalations, as imports plunged, according to Commerce Department data. While Trump touts tariffs as a tool to reduce the trade deficit, economists debate their effectiveness, with some arguing it reflects U.S. consumer demand. The future of Trump's tariff policy remains uncertain due to ongoing court rulings and anxious consumers, as consumer sentiment has soured amidst tariff implementation, according to a University of Michigan survey. Despite these anxieties, key economic indicators like unemployment remain strong, and the OECD forecasts continued U.S. economic growth, although at a slower pace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article discusses how the pressure to achieve a "summer body" has evolved into a year-round focus on body image, driven by fitness trends and weight-loss drugs. While the body positivity movement made strides in challenging toxic narratives, social media continues to promote constant self-improvement. Experts note that summer remains a peak time for body-image issues, despite year-round efforts to get thinner. The accessibility of GLP-1 drugs has raised expectations and lowered the threshold for what people think they should be able to achieve with their bodies, contributing to a feeling of exclusion for those who cannot afford them.</p>

          <p>Tamir Pardo, a former Mossad director, has criticized the ongoing war in Gaza as "useless" and accomplishing nothing from Israel's point of view, stating that it is a waste of time, lives, and money. Pardo believes the government should have prioritized negotiating for the release of hostages over military action. He suggests that the main power of Hamas was largely diminished months ago and that continuing the war is creating more problems than it solves. Pardo signed an open letter with other Mossad veterans calling for an end to the war, emphasizing the need for a peaceful resolution through negotiation.</p>
