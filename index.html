        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CBS News, the U.S. government is reportedly considering deporting migrants to Libya, a country facing significant conflict and instability. U.S. officials, who wished to remain anonymous, mentioned that the U.S. military might conduct flights to transport migrants to Libya as early as this week. This plan is likely to generate controversy, given the U.S. State Department's existing warnings against travel to Libya due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. The BBC has sought comments from the U.S. State Department regarding these reports.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, with an EPS of 83 cents versus the anticipated 50 cents, but revenue fell slightly short at $11.53 billion compared to the expected $11.62 billion. Despite this, the company reported a net income of $1.78 billion, a significant increase from the previous year's net loss of $654 million. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted strong growth in Uber Eats and the increasing adoption of Uber One subscriptions, while also addressing the FTC lawsuit regarding deceptive billing practices. Uber is also expanding its autonomous vehicle technology, reaching an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips and partnering with Waymo in Austin, Texas, where Waymo vehicles are operating at a high capacity.</p>

          <p>Senator Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, is calling for an immediate investigation by the Department of Justice and the FBI into anonymous pizza deliveries sent to the homes of federal judges and their families.

He emphasized the need to protect judicial independence and the rule of law, urging the DOJ and FBI to hold those responsible accountable.

          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir that killed 26 civilians, India launched airstrikes on what it claimed were terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, marking a significant escalation in the long-standing conflict between the two nuclear powers. Pakistan retaliated by claiming to have shot down five Indian aircraft, a claim India has not confirmed, and reported casualties on its side of the border. The strikes by India targeted multiple locations, including areas in mainland Pakistan, a move not seen in over half a century, raising concerns about a potential broader conflict. The international community, including the UN and the United States, has called for restraint as tensions continue to rise in the disputed region.</p>

          <p>Danish jewelry brand Pandora is warning that U.S. tariffs could lead to significant price increases across the affordable jewelry sector. CEO Alexander Lacik noted that while current 10% tariffs are manageable, reverting to higher "reciprocal" rates would be a game-changer for manufacturers who import from Asia. Pandora, which relies heavily on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, could face revenue hits of around $182 million per year. The company has modeled various scenarios to determine potential price rises for consumers if tariffs remain in place.</p>

          <p>Senator Susan Collins, now chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, faces increasing pressure to challenge President Trump's policies, particularly after budgetary attacks on her home state of Maine. Despite her position of power, Collins has been criticized for not fully utilizing the appropriations committee to counteract Trump's actions. While she has publicly opposed some of Trump's policies and voted to impeach him, she is perceived as hesitant to engage in direct confrontation, leading to concerns about her ability to effectively represent Maine's interests.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed electronic warfare devices capable of creating the illusion of a fleet of warships from a single vessel.

This could trick enemy missiles into targeting these 'ghost' fleets, allowing real warships to evade detection. The development comes from the Beijing Research Institute of Telemetry, an aerospace defense contractor, and suggests a new strategy for naval warfare using electronic deception.</p>

The Terminal Islanders Assn. is working with the National Trust and the L.A. Conservancy to find preservation solutions, such as turning the structures into stores for port workers.

The proposed change would consider a player onside if any part of their body that can legally score a goal is level with the last defender. Wenger draws a comparison to a similar rule adjustment made after the 1990 World Cup, which aimed to encourage more attacking play.

          <p>President Trump's strategy of proposing large tariffs and then scaling them back has normalized significant taxes on imports, according to this article. The acceptance of the 10 percent tariff imposed on most U.S. imports reflects an increasing embrace of tariffs as a policy tool, although economists warn that these taxes may harm consumers and small businesses. While investors have reacted positively to signs of potential trade deals, the tariffs currently in effect still constitute a major change for global trade. The article also discusses the psychological effect of anchoring, in which a high number thrown out in a negotiation can reset a whole frame of reference.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan court has sentenced four men to either one year in prison or a $7,700 fine for attempting to smuggle thousands of live queen ants out of the country. The suspects, including two Belgians, a Vietnamese national, and a Kenyan, were arrested with live ants intended for collectors in Europe and Asia. The court emphasized the need to protect all creatures, citing the world's loss of species due to greed. The three foreigners were ordered to be repatriated upon paying the fine or completing their prison term.</p>

Adjusted for inflation, current oil prices are at levels seen only during two quarters since 2004, excluding the pandemic-stricken 2020.

Residents in heavily bombarded regions express skepticism, noting that shelling has intensified recently, while some acknowledge the desire for even a brief respite from the war's constant strain.
