          <p>A significant cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a key software provider, has caused major disruptions at several European airports, including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack compromised the "Muse" system, which is essential for electronic check-in and baggage drop services, forcing airlines to switch to manual processing. This has resulted in extensive queues and flight delays for thousands of passengers, with authorities working to resolve the issue and mitigate the widespread travel chaos.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a massive wave of over 600 missiles and drones across nine Ukrainian regions, resulting in at least three civilian deaths and dozens of injuries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, stating they deliberately targeted infrastructure and residential areas, including an apartment building in Dnipro struck by a missile with cluster munitions. While Ukraine's air force, aided by F-16s, intercepted a majority of the projectiles, the strikes underscore Russia's strategy of civilian intimidation.</p>

          <p>A California family's "Green Idea House" has been generating more energy than it consumes for over a decade, offering a blueprint for sustainable living at a cost comparable to traditional construction. By eliminating gas lines, installing solar panels, and employing smart design features like roof overhangs for passive heating and cooling, the home saves approximately $4,800 annually in utility bills. The project highlights the importance of meticulous planning and adapting to a changing climate, demonstrating that energy independence is achievable with off-the-shelf technology.</p>

In response, activists are exercising caution while continuing their work, asserting their First Amendment rights to document ICE operations and provide aid to immigrants amidst a climate of fear.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, critics and political scientists are expressing concern that the Trump administration is using the tragedy to justify a crackdown on political opponents. The administration has escalated rhetoric against the "radical left," considering classifying some groups as domestic terrorists, despite no evidence linking them to the killing. Experts suggest this response mirrors authoritarian tactics, where a violent event is used as a pretext to erode civil liberties and target dissent.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Major Security and Privacy Risks in Popular VPN Services</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study has uncovered alarming security flaws and opaque ownership structures in several popular VPN services, potentially exposing millions of users to surveillance. The report found that many free VPN apps, some with over 100 million downloads, are controlled by Chinese nationals and use weak security protocols with hard-coded passwords, allowing user data to be easily decrypted. Researchers warn that these services provide a false sense of security and advise users to choose transparent, paid providers with independent audits.</p>

          <p>Portugal has announced it will officially recognize a Palestinian state, becoming the latest Western nation to shift its policy amid the ongoing war in Gaza. The move comes as other countries, including France, the UK, Canada, and Australia, are reportedly preparing similar announcements ahead of the UN General Assembly. This growing trend places pressure on Israel and its key allies like the United States, who argue that such recognition prematurely rewards Hamas following its 2023 attack.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is emerging as a powerful tool to combat workplace burnout by automating repetitive tasks and helping manage workloads, but it may also be contributing to the problem. While AI can reduce stress by handling administrative duties, some studies show that frequent AI users report higher levels of burnout, potentially due to the cognitive load of learning new systems and the pressure to take on more work. Companies are now exploring how to integrate AI to support employee mental health without inadvertently increasing strain.</p>
