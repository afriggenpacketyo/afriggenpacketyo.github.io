          <p>A Maryland oral surgeon, Dr. James Ryan, is suspected of murder in the overdose death of his girlfriend, Sarah Harris. Sarah's mother, Tina Harris, immediately suspected Ryan, citing his controlling behavior and Sarah's deteriorating health. Sarah's sister, Rachel Harris, compiled 200 pages of evidence from Sarah's computer, revealing texts about drug use and Ryan administering dangerous drugs. Detective Ian Iacoviello, an expert in pharmaceutical investigations, concluded that Ryan was responsible for Sarah's death, leading to his arrest and conviction for depraved-heart murder and a 45-year prison sentence. The case highlights the complexities of overdose deaths and the need for tougher laws, as well as the devastating impact on the victim's family.</p>

Fetterman, who has faced scrutiny over his stances on Israel and his willingness to work with President Trump, is seen by Gallego as a valuable senator who fights for working-class people. While Gallego acknowledges disagreements with Fetterman, he warns that the GOP's support may be a tactic to push him further to the right.

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler in Bedfordshire, is promoting the health benefits of platonic touch through "cuddle puddles" and one-on-one therapy sessions. She believes that touch can boost serotonin and oxytocin levels while reducing cortisol, thus regulating the nervous system. While some may be skeptical, Wood emphasizes that her services are platonic and nurturing, with client safety ensured through screening and consent forms. Experts note that while touch can be beneficial, the relationship between individuals is crucial, and safety is paramount for positive outcomes, but cuddle therapy has been shown to relieve stress and promote relaxation.</p>

          <p>A livestock farmer, David Thornley, is pursuing legal action against East Midlands Airport, alleging that a leaking pipe contaminated a brook, leading to the loss of valuable pedigree lambs. Thornley claims 25 of his ewes lost their lambs after drinking from Diseworth Brook in 2022. East Midlands International Airport Ltd pleaded guilty to exceeding environmental permit limits by releasing water containing chemicals, but denies a link between the discharge and bacterial pollution in the brook. Environmental studies show de-icing chemicals can affect water quality, but the airport maintains the pollution was from sewage.</p>
