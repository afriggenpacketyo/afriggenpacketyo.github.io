            <p>President Trump addressed reporters, expressing his enthusiasm about the Supreme Court's decision to hear arguments regarding birthright citizenship. He reiterated his controversial argument that birthright citizenship is fundamentally linked to slavery, asserting that the case is widely misunderstood. Trump believes that viewing the issue through the lens of slavery makes it an easy case to win and encouraged lawyers to discuss the connection between birthright citizenship and slavery during the arguments. The Supreme Court will expedite oral arguments on Trump's request to roll back injunctions against his executive order ending birthright citizenship.</p>

            <p>A press conference regarding the fatal stabbing of Austin Metcalf at a Texas high school track meet quickly dissolved into disarray. Dominique Alexander, representing the accused, Karmelo Anthony, rebuked Metcalf's father for attending, accusing him of disrespect. The conference addressed the substantial funds donated to Anthony's family and the school district's expulsion plans for Anthony. Amidst accusations of racism and bigotry, Anthony's mother spoke briefly about the threats and harassment her family has faced. The event concluded with Alexander drawing parallels between Anthony's case and those of Kyle Rittenhouse and Daniel Penny.</p>

            <p>A federal appeals court sharply criticized the Trump administration's handling of the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The court deemed the administration's claims as "shocking" and appealed to the executive branch to uphold the rule of law. Judge Wilkinson expressed concern that the administration's actions could set a dangerous precedent, potentially endangering U.S. citizens. The court ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return from detention in El Salvador, emphasizing that the government cannot do "essentially nothing."</p>

            <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has initiated layoffs as part of a restructuring effort under the Trump administration, aimed at reducing the agency's size and scope. This follows a court ruling that allowed the agency to proceed with reduction-in-force actions. The CFPB will lean on states for enforcement, prioritize banks, and deprioritize areas like medical debt and digital payments. This shift has drawn criticism from consumer organizations, who argue that the CFPB cannot shirk its responsibilities and expect states to enforce federal law.</p>

            <p>Luigi Mangione has been indicted on federal charges, including stalking and murder through the use of a firearm, in connection with the death of UnitedHealth Group CEO Brian Thompson. The indictment makes Mangione eligible for the death penalty. Attorney General Pam Bondi has signaled her intention to pursue the death penalty, aligning with President Trump's agenda to combat violent crime. The defense argues that Bondi's statement prejudiced the grand jury process and is seeking to prevent the government from seeking the death penalty.

            <p>The National Weather Service is facing significant staffing cuts under the Trump administration, leading to concerns about the quality of forecasts and public safety. The agency announced potential reductions or suspensions of weather balloon launches due to staffing limitations.

Experts warn that these cuts will degrade weather forecasts and negatively impact the agency's ability to provide critical alerts during weather emergencies. The American Meteorologist Society and the National Weather Association have jointly stated that the cuts will drastically undercut the scientific workforce needed for effective weather forecasting.</p>

            <p>President Trump has indicated that he expects to make a second state visit to the United Kingdom in September, hosted by King Charles. The visit aims to strengthen transatlantic ties amidst ongoing trade disputes. Trump mentioned that Buckingham Palace is "setting a date for September." Prime Minister Starmer is understood to have discussed the visit with Trump during a phone call. This visit would be unusual, as second-term US presidents are typically not offered a state visit.</p>

            <p>Brazil experienced a trade deficit with China for the first two months of 2025, a rare occurrence driven by a surge in Chinese imports. However, the trade balance shifted by the end of the first quarter, with Brazil reporting a $700 million surplus. The initial deficit was attributed to a record-breaking increase in Chinese imports, including solar panels and petroleum drilling platforms. Analysts believe that concerns about the growing trade war between the U.S. and China contributed to the import surge.</p>
