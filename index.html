          <p>Aviation experts suspect a co-pilot error may have caused the Air India Flight AI171 crash, which killed 241 people.  Former pilot Steve Scheibner suggests the co-pilot may have raised the flaps instead of retracting the landing gear.  Investigators are analyzing the black box data and interviewing crew members.  Theories about the crash also include mechanical failure and the possibility of air strikes, though the latter is considered unlikely.</p>
