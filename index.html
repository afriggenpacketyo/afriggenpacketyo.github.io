          <p>Facing the challenges of fluctuating tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, companies are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to manage their global supply chains. AI tools are being deployed to visualize supply chains, assess the impact of tariffs, and make quicker decisions on adjustments. Salesforce has developed an AI agent capable of processing tariff changes, while Kinaxis uses machine learning to simulate the effects of switching parts. Despite AI's potential, experts caution it is not a 'silver bullet' and relies on the quality of available data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing limited humanitarian aid into Gaza, aid agencies warn of an impending famine due to insufficient supplies and logistical hurdles. While nearly 200 trucks carrying aid have crossed the Kerem Shalom crossing, this is a fraction of the 500 trucks needed daily to sustain the population. Supplies are delayed by security checks, damaged infrastructure, and fuel shortages, hindering distribution efforts. The UN criticizes Israel's plans to involve private security firms in aid distribution, while Israel blames Hamas for looting supplies. The lack of access to essential resources threatens the lives of millions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially expected in the spring, raising concerns among advocacy groups. The Child Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, is still deliberating on measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Critics have condemned the delay, while others suggest it may allow for a more substantive strategy. The government insists it is committed to tackling child poverty and will publish an ambitious, fully-funded strategy later this year.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are embracing 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement. A study indicates that nearly half of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum at their jobs, motivated by a desire for more 'me time' and a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations. This shift reflects a changing attitude towards work, with young people valuing personal fulfillment and questioning the traditional concept of lifetime commitment to a company. Experts see this trend as a positive development, potentially leading to happier individuals and a healthier economy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets in a 13-inning marathon, overcoming a blown save by closer Tanner Scott. The game was further complicated by a rain delay that shortened Clayton Kershaw's start and strained the already depleted pitching staff. Teoscar Hernández delivered the game-winning RBI double in the 13th, securing the victory for the Dodgers. Despite the win, the Dodgers' pitching depth remains a concern as they navigate a challenging stretch against playoff-contending teams.</p>

Jamie Carragher notes that players don't always think like supporters, and decisions to move to bigger clubs can impact their relationship with the fans who once idolized them.</p>

          <p>The NHS is set to expand specialist mental health crisis centers across England to alleviate pressure on A&E departments. These walk-in clinics, staffed by specialists, aim to provide appropriate care in a calmer environment for those experiencing acute mental distress. While NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails the 'pioneering new model of care', Andy Bell of the Centre for Mental Health expresses skepticism and calls for careful testing and better funding of NHS mental health services. The scheme is part of a ten-year NHS plan to improve mental health support.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by a private organization in the search for New Orleans jail escapees has ignited controversy. Project N.O.L.A.'s cameras aided in the recapture of one fugitive, despite the police department's recent pause on automated alerts from the group. Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, raise concerns about privacy and constitutional rights, citing the potential for racial bias and the lack of transparency for citizens being scanned. Supporters argue the technology is crucial for public safety, while officials emphasize the need for clear legal boundaries and ethical guidelines.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter as it approached for landing, leading to two commercial jets aborting their landings at a Washington airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's location, prompting the Pentagon's tower to delay landing clearance. This incident has raised concerns about close calls between military helicopters and commercial airplanes, especially after a deadly midair collision earlier in the year. The Army has paused flights into and out of the Pentagon while addressing safety issues with the FAA.</p>
