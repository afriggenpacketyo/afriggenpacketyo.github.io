          <p>The Trump administration's escalating actions against Harvard University, including revoking international student enrollment and freezing federal contracts, are raising concerns about authoritarianism and academic freedom. Trump claims these measures address issues like antisemitism and discrimination, but critics argue they represent an attempt to control higher education. Harvard has resisted these demands, leading to legal battles and a broader debate about the role of universities in American society. The situation highlights the tension between government oversight and the autonomy of educational institutions.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led budget bill proposal to limit federal student loans for medical school could worsen the national doctor shortage, according to doctorsâ€™ associations and medical schools. The plan would limit federal student loans for professional programs to $150,000, eliminate a federal graduate loan program, and restrict loan forgiveness. Medical students rely heavily on federal loans to finance their education, and advocates warn the changes could deter low-income students from pursuing medicine. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates the U.S. will face a shortage of between 37,800 and 124,000 physicians by 2034.</p>

          <p>The White House is facing legal challenges over its practice of deporting individuals to countries other than their country of origin. This strategy, justified by the administration as necessary when home countries refuse to accept deportees, has led to individuals being sent to politically unstable nations like South Sudan. Immigration lawyers argue that deportees are not given adequate time to contest their removal to these third countries, potentially violating their due process rights. A federal judge has ruled in favor of the lawyers, arguing that migrants should get a credible fear interview where they have a chance to say they may face violence or persecution if sent to a specific country.</p>

          <h2>Stricter Voting Laws No Longer Benefit Republicans, Study Suggests</h2>

          <p>A study published in 2007 suggested that Republicans benefited from lower voter turnout due to inclement weather, but this may no longer be the case. The study found that each inch of rain on election day decreased turnout by 1%, benefiting Republicans whose affluent electorate had the resources to vote regardless of inconvenience. This axiom of American elections is being re-evaluated as demographic shifts and voter engagement strategies evolve.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is withdrawing the nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, an associate of Elon Musk, to lead NASA. Trump cited a "thorough review" of Isaacman's "prior associations" as the reason for his decision. Isaacman, the CEO of Shift4 and a SpaceX collaborator, had been approved by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Trump stated he would soon announce a new nominee who would be "Mission aligned, and put America First in Space."</p>

          <p>France is investing $1.7 billion to renovate the Luxeuil-Saint Sauveur air base, preparing it to handle nuclear-armed bombers by 2035. The upgraded base will accommodate 50 of France's Rafale fighter jets equipped with new-generation hypersonic missiles. This move underscores Europe's growing security concerns, as the base will become the fourth in France capable of storing nuclear weapons. The renovation includes expanding the base's size, modernizing infrastructure, and lengthening the runway to support the heavier Rafale jets.</p>
