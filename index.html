          <p>Columbia University requested the New York City Police Department's assistance to remove pro-Palestinian demonstrators from the campus library after they occupied the building and vandalized property. Acting University President Claire Shipman cited safety concerns due to the number of participants, the attempt to force entry into Butler Library, and the presence of individuals not affiliated with the university as reasons for the request. Demonstrations outside the campus also intensified, with clashes between protesters and police. Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams condemned violence and vandalism, emphasizing the right to peaceful protest while ensuring the safety of students and the community. The university stated that individuals found in violation of university rules would face disciplinary consequences, as the incident disrupted academic activities during the pre-final exams reading week.</p>

          <p>Pakistan claimed it deployed Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets against India's air force during a recent military encounter, with Pakistani officials stating that five Indian aircraft were shot down. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar specified that the J-10C jets were responsible for downing the Indian warplanes, including three Rafale fighter jets. India has yet to comment on the claim, and if confirmed, this would mark the first known air-to-air combat kill for the Chinese fighter jet and the first loss of Rafale aircraft in combat.

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, leading to military strikes and reported aircraft losses on both sides. India launched attacks inside Pakistan, claiming retaliation for the earlier terrorist attack, while Pakistan asserted it shot down five Indian planes and one drone. The New York Times could not independently verify the exact number and types of aircraft downed, but officials reported that two or three Indian aircraft went down within India's border. Pakistan claimed its forces downed three Rafale fighter jets, one MIG-29 fighter aircraft, one Su-30 fighter jet, and one Heron drone. The situation remains tense, with both sides making conflicting claims about the extent of the damage inflicted.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to finalize a bill renewing tax cuts and slashing spending, facing internal disagreements over key provisions such as the SALT deduction and entitlement program changes. Moderate Republicans are demanding the SALT deduction, while conservatives are pushing for deeper cuts to Medicaid and other programs. President Trump is also insisting on including items like no tax on tips or overtime. The debate highlights the challenges of passing complex legislation with a narrow majority, with Democrats arguing that Republicans are manipulating figures to cover the costs of tax breaks and deficit holes. The article also notes the looming debt ceiling issue and the need for bipartisan compromise to avoid a potential government default.</p>

          <p>West Virginia coal miners are losing access to free black lung screenings due to President Trump's budget cuts to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The cuts have led to job losses at the NIOSH facility in Morgantown, impacting mine safety and research on cancer-causing chemicals. Critics argue that these cuts will endanger workers and increase the incidence of black lung, while the administration defends the cuts as eliminating wasteful bureaucracy. Despite West Virginia's strong support for Trump, some residents express concern over the impact of these cuts on worker safety.</p>

The FAA is working to address the issues, which have been attributed to technical glitches and a "fried" copper wire, and is planning an air traffic control overhaul.

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs as policymakers assess the economic impact of his trade policies. The Fed cited rising economic risks and concerns that Trump's tariffs could spur higher inflation and unemployment. Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the economy's path under the Trump administration's trade policies, leading the central bank to adopt a wait-and-see approach. The decision reflects concerns about a potential stagflation scenario, where inflation and unemployment simultaneously spike, requiring the Fed to prioritize one aspect of its dual mandate.</p>

          <p>The 2024-25 influenza season has been particularly severe, with 216 pediatric deaths nationwide, including 25 in New York State, the highest number in recent years. Health authorities attribute the heavy toll to declining vaccination rates and the circulation of more intense flu strains. The CDC estimates that over 47 million people nationwide contracted the flu, with hospitalization rates reaching a 15-year high. The decline in flu vaccinations reflects a rising distrust of the scientific establishment and vaccine hesitancy. Only one of the 25 children who died in New York State had been vaccinated, highlighting the importance of vaccination in preventing severe outcomes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to eliminate the EPA's Energy Star offices, a move that would end a decades-old program promoting energy-efficient appliances and electronics. The program has helped consumers save money on energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Critics argue that cutting the program would harm consumers by making it harder to access trustworthy information about energy use and would undermine efforts to combat climate change. The administration defends the cuts as eliminating unnecessary regulations and promoting economic growth. The proposed budget seeks to eliminate the EPA's Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the Energy Star offices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The current charitable tax deduction system in the U.S. favors wealthy donors, providing larger tax breaks for each dollar donated compared to lower-income individuals. This disparity incentivizes charities to cater to wealthy donors, potentially skewing philanthropic efforts away from community groups and other causes supported by less affluent individuals. One proposed solution is to replace the charitable deduction with a tax incentive based on the donation amount rather than the donor's income, such as government matching programs or tax credits, to create a more equitable system. The current system disproportionately benefits institutions favored by the wealthy, like museums and universities, over grassroots organizations.</p>
