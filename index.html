          <p>The NTSB reported that the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) failed to conduct a critical vulnerability assessment of the Francis Scott Key Bridge before its collapse.  This omission, the NTSB stated, could have allowed for proactive identification of risks and implementation of preventative measures, though it would not have prevented the collapse itself. The NTSB issued urgent safety recommendations to prevent similar future incidents.</p>
