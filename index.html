        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labor Department reported that the annual inflation rate in April was 2.3%, slightly below the anticipated 2.4%, indicating a potentially slowing U.S. economy affected by President Trump's tariffs. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% for the month, aligning with Dow Jones consensus estimates. Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, also increased by 0.2% monthly and 2.8% year-over-year, matching forecasts. This data provides an early look at the economic impacts of the tariffs, though economists suggest the full effects may take several months to materialize due to front-loading of purchases by consumers and businesses.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended Prime Minister Keir Starmer's use of the phrase "island of strangers" in a speech about cutting immigration, arguing he aimed to highlight the impact of rising migration and support for integration. Starmer's remarks drew criticism from some Labour MPs who compared the language to that of Enoch Powell, but Cooper dismissed these comparisons. Downing Street also rejected the comparison, emphasizing Starmer's argument that migrants contribute to the country but migration needs control. Other politicians weighed in, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan stating he would not have used the same phrase, and Conservative Robert Jenrick claiming the warning was "already" true in parts of the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% for a limited time, signaling a potential shift in trade strategy amid concerns about rising prices and economic strain. This move comes after President Trump initially imposed high tariffs, leading to warnings from retailers about potential price increases and supply shortages. China is reciprocating by lowering its tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%, and both sides will continue trade negotiations. Despite the reduction, tariffs remain higher than pre-Trump's second term, impacting prices on various imported goods. </p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.3% in April, indicating that inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Economists are closely monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, as tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies, which are typically passed on to consumers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the central bank is adopting a wait-and-see approach to the tariffs, acknowledging their potential to increase inflation and slow economic growth. Some consumers and businesses have accelerated orders to avoid the tariffs, potentially delaying the tariffs' impact on economic data.</p>

          <p>Consumer prices increased by 2.3% in April compared to the previous year, slightly cooling down and defying initial concerns about an inflation surge following President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. While economists initially worried about price hikes, government data indicates that significant price increases have not yet occurred. However, analysts anticipate a potential resurgence of inflation as retailers restock inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect. The Trump administration has since rolled back some tariffs, including temporarily reducing tariffs on China from 145% to 30%, which is expected to reduce the average cost of tariffs per household this year.</p>

          <p>Economists and policymakers are preparing for a potential re-acceleration of inflation as companies adjust to President Trumpâ€™s trade war, despite U.S. inflation holding steady in April. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.3% from a year earlier, with a slight monthly increase of 0.2%. A key measure of underlying inflation, excluding volatile food and energy, climbed 2.8% year-over-year. While the Trump administration has temporarily reduced tariffs on Chinese products, economists warn that the remaining tariffs will likely fuel inflation while simultaneously slowing economic growth. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation and has paused interest rate cuts until the economic impact of Trump's policies becomes clearer.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, who served 38 years in prison for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, has had his conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal due to new DNA evidence. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred Sullivan's case back to the court after fresh testing revealed a DNA profile from semen samples that pointed to an unknown attacker. Sullivan, now 68, is believed to be the victim of the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history, and he was visibly emotional upon hearing the news of his release. The Crown Prosecution Service agreed that the DNA evidence undermined Sullivan's conviction and would not seek a retrial.</p>

The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index indicated a sharp decline in April purchasing activity following a rush to stockpile supplies. While the tariff pause offers a temporary respite, concerns remain about long-term risks associated with China. North American companies have been aggressively stockpiling inventory, while manufacturing activity in Asia has weakened.

These latest cutbacks bring the total number of layoffs announced by Nissan in the past year to approximately 20,000, representing about 15% of its workforce. In addition, a proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi collapsed earlier this year. The company's chief executive cited rising costs and an uncertain environment as contributing factors.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. announced it will close seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally to accelerate restructuring efforts after reporting a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The company, facing poor sales in the U.S. and China, will reduce its global workforce by approximately 15%. Vehicle plants will be reduced from 17 to 10 by fiscal 2027 to address overcapacity. Nissan plans to reduce global output capacity excluding China by 30% and expects cost-saving measures to help restore profitability by fiscal 2026. The company cited uncertainty related to U.S. tariff policy as a significant factor.</p>

          <p>Germany's largest reinsurers, Munich Re and Hannover Re, experienced a $1.9 billion profit hit in the first quarter due to claims related to the recent Los Angeles wildfires. Munich Re anticipates total claims of around 1.1 billion euros, while Hannover Re reported a net individual loss of 631.4 million euros. The influx of wildfire claims significantly increased overall claims expenditure in Munich Re's property-casualty segment, leading to a 72% decrease in quarterly net profit. Despite the financial impact, Munich Re reported an overall net profit of 1.1 billion euros, demonstrating resilience in its business portfolio.</p>

This change reflects President Trumpâ€™s main national security priorities and has their roots in the outset of his previous term.

          <p>Toyota Motor has unveiled a redesigned version of its sole all-electric vehicle in the U.S., renaming it the "bZ" from the previous "bZ4X." The name change is intended to simplify the brand for customers and distance the updated model from its predecessor, which received lackluster reviews and faced a recall. The 2026 model year updates include a 25% increase in EV range, up to a 50% improvement in horsepower, and fast-charging capabilities. These improvements aim to address concerns about the first-generation EV and enhance its market appeal.</p>

          <p>The temporary tariff pause by the U.S. is providing Shein and Temu with a chance to restock U.S.-based warehouses and re-evaluate their supply chain management. The U.S. and China agreed to lower tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30% for 90 days, and low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China will now be taxed at 54%, down from 120%. This tariff cut is expected to allow the companies to increase shipments from China and fulfill existing orders, and experts suggest that it will help them reassess their long-term strategies. Prior to this, Temu had halted direct shipments from China, causing disruptions in fulfilling U.S. orders.</p>

New DNA evidence has since exonerated Sullivan, revealing a DNA profile that does not match him, leading to his release and renewed concerns about the actual killer remaining at large.

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a 90-day truce, temporarily reducing tariffs and lifting retaliatory curbs, but the underlying trade relationship remains fragile. While this pause has been greeted with relief, it may only be the eye of the hurricane, with the potential for re-escalation looming. China is using this window to strengthen its supply chains and innovation ecosystems, while the U.S. intends to de-risk and decouple in key sectors. Businesses should use this opportunity to fortify short-term plans and accelerate long-term diversification strategies, as structural dependence on China is now a strategic liability.</p>
