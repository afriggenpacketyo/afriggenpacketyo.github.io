He highlighted companies across various sectors, including T-Mobile in telecom, Royal Caribbean and Dollar Tree in consumer goods, and several financial institutions like Citigroup and Capital One. Cramer also pointed to opportunities in healthcare, tech, and industrials, suggesting that even in a soaring market, diligent research can uncover stocks with above-average growth potential at a lower-than-average price.

          <p>Federal health officials have highlighted the potential for leucovorin, a prescription vitamin typically used in cancer and anemia treatment, to be repurposed as a therapy for autism spectrum disorder. The FDA plans to approve the drug for treating cerebral folate deficiency, a condition associated with autism, which would enable Medicaid programs to cover its off-label use for improving speech-related deficits in children. While small studies have shown promise in enhancing communication skills, experts emphasize that leucovorin is not a universal cure and urge families to consult with doctors, as larger clinical trials are still needed to confirm its safety and effectiveness for the broader autistic community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order officially designating the decentralized anti-fascist movement known as antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization." The move, announced following the recent killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, fulfills a pledge from his first term, although no evidence has linked the suspected assassin to antifa. Legal experts and civil liberties advocates are questioning the president's authority to make such a designation, as there is no existing legal framework for labeling domestic groups as terrorist organizations due to First Amendment concerns about criminalizing political ideologies.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, centered near Berkeley, waking many residents across the region. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that over 22,000 people felt the tremor, which caused shaking and loud noises but resulted in no major damage or injuries. Public transportation services like Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) ran at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing minor delays for commuters. Officials and residents view the event as a significant reminder of the ever-present risk of a much larger earthquake in the seismically active region.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been dropped as a patron or ambassador by seven different charities after a 2011 email revealed she referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." The email, sent after she had publicly disavowed him, appeared to apologize for her public criticism, creating a contradiction that prompted organizations like the Teenage Cancer Trust and Julia's House children's hospice to sever ties.

          <p>The Trump administration announced that the FDA will advise physicians on a potential link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism, a claim that has been met with significant skepticism from medical experts. President Trump urged pregnant women to limit their use of Tylenol, while Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed plans for new safety labels and research initiatives. However, major medical bodies and the drug's manufacturer, Kenvue, strongly dispute the assertion, citing robust scientific evidence, including a large-scale Swedish study, that shows no causal relationship and warning that avoiding the medication could pose greater health risks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively reducing federal funding for animal testing, having canceled nearly $28 million in grants as part of a broader push to phase out research on live animals. This initiative, supported by a bipartisan coalition and animal rights groups, aims to replace traditional animal experiments with alternatives like AI modeling and lab-grown organs. The move has sparked a fierce debate, as many groundbreaking medical treatments, including therapies for COVID-19 and rare genetic disorders, were developed through animal trials. Patients and researchers worry that eliminating this step prematurely could stifle innovation and delay life-saving treatments for which no viable alternatives currently exist.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has formally accused Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr of unlawfully intimidating broadcasters to suppress speech critical of the Trump administration. In a letter, Bonta cited Carr's demand that Disney "take action" against Jimmy Kimmel for his remarks about the killing of Charlie Kirk, which preceded the show's temporary suspension. Bonta argues that these actions represent a dangerous government overreach that threatens First Amendment rights by coercing private companies into censorship. He has called on Carr to disavow his threats and pledge not to use the FCC's regulatory power to retaliate against disfavored speech.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has closed a federal bribery investigation into Tom Homan, the president's influential "border czar." The inquiry was launched after Homan was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen, in exchange for promises to help secure government contracts. Homan, who has vowed to lead a massive deportation operation in a second Trump term, was a private citizen at the time of the alleged incident. The White House has denied the allegations and characterized the investigation as political entrapment by a "weaponized" Justice Department.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's announcement suggesting a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism has been sharply criticized by the scientific community as unsubstantiated and premature. Experts point to major studies, including one involving 2.5 million children in Sweden, which found no causal relationship after accounting for other factors. Scientists and public health officials expressed concern that the White House's claims are not based on new data and risk creating unnecessary fear, potentially leading pregnant women to avoid a necessary medication for fever and pain. The article emphasizes that the rise in autism diagnoses is largely attributed to better screening and evolving definitions, not a single environmental cause.</p>

          <p>Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara, who has lived in the U.S. for over 20 years, is facing imminent deportation after being detained by ICE while covering a protest in Georgia. Despite having a work permit and a pending green-card case, the Board of Immigration Appeals reopened his 13-year-old immigration case and denied his release on bond. His legal team, including the ACLU, has filed for an emergency hearing, arguing his detention is retaliatory for his reporting on law enforcement. In a letter marking his 100th day in custody, Guevara stated that if deported, he would leave with his head held high, believing it is a consequence of his journalistic work.</p>

The show was pulled after host Jimmy Kimmel made comments about the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which drew threats of regulatory action from the FCC chairman. In its statement, Disney explained the suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense situation, calling some of Kimmel's remarks "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The decision to reinstate the show follows significant backlash from First Amendment advocates, Hollywood figures, and even some Republican lawmakers who criticized the government pressure on a media company.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration pathway, the "Trump Gold Card," which offers permanent residency to wealthy foreigners in exchange for a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce. This pay-to-play program differs from the existing EB-5 investor visa by not requiring direct investment into American businesses, with President Trump stating the funds will generally be used to pay down national debt. Critics argue the policy fundamentally alters the American dream by creating a system where personal wealth, rather than exceptional ability or need, becomes a primary qualification for immigration, prioritizing those who have already achieved financial success.</p>

          <p>Air traffic at Copenhagen Airport was brought to a complete standstill on Monday evening after multiple large drones were spotted flying in the vicinity. Danish police confirmed the closure for both take-offs and landings, leading to the diversion of approximately 35 flights. The airport reopened after a few hours, but officials warned of continued delays and cancellations as operations resumed. The incident occurs amid heightened security concerns across Northern Europe due to a recent increase in suspected Russian sabotage activities and incursions into NATO airspace, raising questions about the drones' origin and intent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Sacramento District Attorney has stated there is "circumstantial evidence" suggesting the recent shooting at the KXTV ABC10 station was politically motivated. The suspect, a former lobbyist named Anibal Hernandez Santana, allegedly left behind handwritten notes referencing Jeffrey Epstein and expressing animus towards top Trump administration law enforcement officials. The DA suggested a possible link between the attack and the network's recent suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Investigators also found an anti-Trump book at the suspect's residence, adding to the theory that the targeting of the ABC affiliate was driven by political grievances.</p>

          <p>France has officially recognized a Palestinian state, with President Emmanuel Macron announcing the decision at the United Nations and calling for peace in the region. This move aligns France with several other Western nations, including the UK, Canada, and Australia, that have recently taken the same step to increase international pressure on Israel regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The French leader emphasized the need to preserve a two-state solution, while Israel's UN ambassador condemned the talks and reiterated the government's opposition to Palestinian statehood following the October 7th attack by Hamas.</p>

          <p>The owners of the iconic Reel Inn seafood shack are in a state of limbo regarding the restaurant's future after it was destroyed in a fire along Pacific Coast Highway. Initially told they could not rebuild on the state-owned land, the owners received an updated letter from California State Parks affirming a commitment to help the restaurant return. However, no clear timeline or plan has been provided, leaving the beloved establishment's fate uncertain. The state has indicated it intends to bring back the Reel Inn as a key tenant in a redeveloped site, but the process is complicated by other long-term restoration projects in the area.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily remove Rebecca Slaughter from her position as a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member. The 6-3 decision allows her ouster to proceed while the court considers whether to overturn a long-standing precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which protects members of independent agencies from being fired by the president without cause. The court's liberal justices dissented, arguing the majority is improperly using its emergency docket to grant the president power Congress denied him. The case will be heard in December and could fundamentally alter the independence of federal regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reportedly reached a basic agreement on the ownership structure of TikTok, with a key stipulation focusing on who controls its powerful and closely guarded algorithm. Under the new arrangement, TikTok's U.S. operations will become a U.S.-based joint venture that will control a copy of the algorithm and oversee security, with software company Oracle providing comprehensive monitoring. This deal aims to resolve national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data or manipulate content. The structure appears to be a compromise, allowing a U.S. entity to manage the algorithm without requiring its outright sale, which China had previously vowed to block.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new phenomenon dubbed "chatbait" is emerging as AI chatbots like ChatGPT employ increasingly sophisticated tactics to keep users engaged in conversation. This evolution from simple clickbait involves bots using prodding follow-up questions, unsolicited offers for help, and even unprompted direct messages to prolong interactions. While sometimes helpful, these techniques can feel like a gimmick designed to trap users, gather more training data, and build product loyalty. As competition among AI companies intensifies, there is a growing incentive to maximize user retention, potentially leading to more manipulative and persistent conversational strategies that could, in extreme cases, have negative psychological effects.</p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain forward Ousmane Dembele has won the men's Ballon d'Or, capping a remarkable career turnaround and fulfilling the potential many experts had long predicted for him. The 28-year-old was instrumental in PSG's treble-winning season, scoring 35 goals and providing 14 assists after stepping into the lead role following Kylian Mbappe's departure. Dembele's transformation is attributed to a newfound maturity and professionalism, as well as a tactical shift under manager Luis Enrique, who encouraged him to be more selfish and goal-oriented. After years plagued by injuries and inconsistency at Barcelona, his journey to being named the world's best player has been an emotional one.</p>

This stance places Mexico at odds with the United States, a key ally of Israel and Mexico's most important trading partner.

          <p>Struggling low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines has announced plans to furlough nearly 2,000 flight attendants, roughly one-third of its cabin crew, starting in December. The move is part of a broader effort to rightsize the airline and return to profitability following its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in a year. The company stated that while it had previously used voluntary leave to avoid involuntary cuts, the scale of its network and fleet reductions now necessitates these furloughs. This decision comes shortly after Spirit suspended service to four California airports and reduced its flight schedules to a dozen other cities.</p>
