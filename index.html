          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end its run in May 2026, coinciding with the end of the broadcast season. In a statement, the network clarified that the decision to retire the entire "Late Show" franchise is purely financial and unrelated to the show's performance or content. Stephen Colbert, who informed his audience during a taping, is considered irreplaceable by the network, which praised his contribution to late-night television. Paramount, the parent company of CBS, emphasized the challenging economic backdrop for the late-night television format.</p>

          <h2>UK Professional Cricketers' Association Advocates for Reduced County Championship Schedule</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 19:17:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) is pushing for the County Championship season to be shortened from 14 to 12 games per team. The association argues this reduction is the "only reasonable option" to protect player welfare and enhance the quality of the competition. Citing research where 83% of players expressed concern for their physical wellbeing under the current schedule, the PCA supports a new conference-style model or a traditional divisional structure, as long as the number of matches is reduced. This proposal comes as a broader review of England's domestic cricket structure is nearing its conclusion.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the killings of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca, has been charged with two counts of murder and residential burglary. Raymond Boodarian, 22, appeared in court, where his arraignment was postponed until August; he remains jailed without bail. Investigators allege Boodarian entered the couple's Encino home through an unlocked door and shot them when they returned from grocery shopping. The bodies were discovered days later during a welfare check, with police using security footage and facial recognition to identify the suspect.</p>

          <p>A top Trump administration official has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of overseeing an "ostentatious" and potentially unlawful office renovation, escalating a conflict over interest rates. The Office of Management and Budget questioned the project's expenses, which reportedly included premium materials and exclusive amenities, and suggested the Fed may have altered plans without proper approval. Powell has refuted these claims, stating the descriptions are inaccurate and that the renovations are necessary for buildings not updated since the 1930s. This dispute occurs as President Trump continues to criticize Powell for not lowering interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

A letter from his physician described the condition as "benign" and common in adults over 70. Chronic venous insufficiency is a circulatory issue where damaged valves in leg veins hinder blood return to the heart, causing blood to pool. Treatment typically involves non-surgical methods like wearing compression stockings and exercise to strengthen calf muscles, which help pump blood.

          <p>The UK Labour Party has suspended longtime Member of Parliament Diane Abbott pending an investigation into her recent comments about racism. During a BBC interview, Abbott reiterated controversial views she had previously expressed, suggesting that racism against Black people is different from prejudice faced by other groups like Jewish people or Travellers because skin color is immediately visible. The suspension means she will now sit as an independent MP. The party leadership and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner criticized her for doubling down on the comments, while some colleagues defended her.</p>

          <p>Legal analysts are expressing concern over the U.S. Supreme Court's increasing use of its emergency "shadow docket" to issue major rulings without providing detailed reasoning. This practice has been prominent in cases involving the Trump administration, where the Court has frequently granted emergency relief to allow contested policies, such as dismantling the Department of Education, to proceed while litigation continues. Critics argue this approach undermines transparency and judicial norms, as it allows significant policy changes to take effect before lower courts have fully resolved the underlying legal questions, often with little to no explanation from the justices.</p>

          <p>Financial and geopolitical analysts suggest that the issue of fentanyl trafficking could become a key topic in upcoming U.S.-China negotiations, potentially easing bilateral tensions. With fentanyl being a leading cause of death for young adults in the U.S., its inclusion in trade talks is seen as politically significant in Washington. Some experts believe addressing the crisis could be leveraged in broader discussions, possibly leading to a relaxation of trade disputes. Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, has been elevated to a national security and public health crisis in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

A report from the China-Brazil Business Council noted that as trade barriers between Washington and Beijing harden, emerging economies like Brazil are absorbing some of the impact.

Newsom argues that Democrats must play hardball as Republicans defy democratic norms, but the plan faces significant legal hurdles and criticism from watchdog groups.
