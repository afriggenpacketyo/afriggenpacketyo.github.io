          <p>South Korean prosecutors have indicted former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo for his alleged role in ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law declaration. Separately, former first lady Kim Keon Hee faces charges of corruption and bribery, including accusations of receiving luxury gifts and funding a stock manipulation scheme. These indictments are part of a broader investigation into Yoon's administration, which was approved by the new government after Yoon's impeachment and removal from office earlier this year. The developments follow Yoon's own arrest on insurrection charges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially ended the "de minimis" tariff exemption for international packages valued under $800, a policy that had been in place since 1938. Officials state the change is permanent and aims to curb the flow of narcotics like fentanyl and generate up to $10 billion in annual tariff revenue. The move follows an earlier cancellation of the exemption for China and Hong Kong, which was blamed for the rapid growth of e-commerce firms like Shein and Temu. A six-month transition period allows foreign postal services to pay a flat duty rate per package. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29, 2005, news outlets are reflecting on the storm's devastating impact on New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. The hurricane caused nearly 1,400 deaths and remains the costliest storm in U.S. history, with damages estimated at around $200 billion in today's dollars. Photo essays and retrospectives highlight the destruction, particularly in communities like the Lower 9th Ward, and commemorate the long-term legacy of the disaster. The anniversary serves as a somber reminder of the human and economic toll.</p>

          <p>Small businesses in the United Kingdom are expressing concern over new US tariffs on low-value parcels, which eliminate the previous $800 duty-free exemption. The Federation of Small Businesses warns the change will create new barriers and increase costs, making it harder for small UK firms to compete in the American market. Some business owners, who rely on the US for a significant portion of their sales, have already suspended shipping due to the uncertainty and inability to provide customers with upfront cost estimates. This policy shift is forcing many to reconsider their business models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elderly survivors of Japan's wartime sexual slavery, known as "comfort women," are still awaiting a response from Chinese provincial high courts after filing landmark lawsuits against the Japanese government. The plaintiffs, now averaging 96 years old, are demanding a formal apology and financial compensation for the atrocities they endured. Despite the cases being filed months ago, the courts in Shanxi and Hunan have not indicated whether they will accept or dismiss the lawsuits. Legal representatives for the women emphasize the urgency of the situation, as the survivors are fighting for recognition before it is too late.</p>

          <p>Public health officials have linked a multi-state salmonella outbreak to large, brown cage-free eggs from Country Eggs LLC, a farm in San Bernardino County, California. The CDC reports that at least 95 people in 14 states have been infected, with 18 hospitalizations. Following an FDA investigation that traced the illnesses back to the supplier, the company has agreed to recall eggs sold under several brand names. Consumers are advised to check their cartons for the code CA 7695 and discard or return any affected products.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers convicted on federal charges related to the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. The decision was made due to concerns of potential bias after the original presiding judge allegedly made prejudicial comments, suggesting the police department was infiltrated by gang members. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith Jr. were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of violating Nichols's civil rights by causing his death. The ruling affects only their federal case, not their prior acquittal on state charges.</p>

The incident occurred in August when Dunn allegedly shouted expletives at officers deployed by President Trump to address crime in the city. Dunn was fired from his job following the arrest in a move touted by the Attorney General as an example of cracking down on the "Deep State."</p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic, he voiced support for unproven treatments and promoted conspiratorial theories on social media. His appointment is seen as a move that will bolster Kennedy's agenda to remake federal vaccine policy, further fueling turmoil within the public health agency.</p>

This is one of 254 Katrina relief projects across Louisiana and Mississippi that remain unfinished.

The attack, which killed at least 20 people including journalists, has drawn international condemnation.
