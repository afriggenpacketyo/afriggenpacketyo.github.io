          <p>President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva held a phone call described as "very good," signaling a move to mend their strained relationship. The conversation was their first since clashing over U.S. tariffs and the prosecution of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. The discussion marks a potential diplomatic thaw, with both leaders agreeing to future meetings to improve cooperation between their nations on trade and political matters. The call aims to resolve tensions that had escalated into one of the more contentious relationships in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially priced its new standard Model Y variant below $40,000, aiming to make its popular electric SUV more accessible to a wider range of consumers. This move comes as the company faces a multi-quarter slump in auto sales and increased competition from other automakers. The announcement is part of a broader strategy to rejuvenate sales and shift investor focus towards Tesla's future in robotics and self-driving technology. The company hopes the more affordable model will stimulate demand amid an aging vehicle lineup and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is causing significant disruptions to air travel, as air traffic controllers working without pay have begun calling in sick, leading to staffing shortages. Major airports, including Burbank Airport which had to close its tower for several hours, experienced extensive delays and cancellations. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the financial stress on these essential workers, warning that the situation could worsen if the shutdown continues. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association highlighted the fragility of the aviation system, which is already facing a national shortage of controllers.</p>

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker condemned the deployment as an "authoritarian march" by the Trump administration and has filed a lawsuit to block the move, calling it unconstitutional and dangerous. The deployment follows Texas Governor Greg Abbott's authorization for the troops to be sent to ensure safety for federal officials.

          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham has been found guilty of stalking television and radio presenter Myleene Klass after sending her numerous disturbing items, including a gun, handcuffs, and a police uniform. The court heard that the man's actions caused Ms. Klass "serious alarm or distress" and "sheer terror" over a period of four years. The defendant, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, also targeted another Classic FM presenter. The verdict brings a conclusion to what Ms. Klass described as a horrific year for her and her family.</p>

          <p>During a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Donald Trump characterized the U.S.-Canada relationship as having both "mutual love" and "natural conflict." The leaders discussed ongoing trade disputes and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is scheduled for review next year. Trump suggested he might renegotiate the agreement or pursue different deals, while maintaining a cordial tone with Carney. The meeting occurs amid fractured relations over steep U.S. tariffs, with Canadian officials seeking relief for key industries.</p>

          <p>A large-scale rescue operation in Tibet successfully guided 580 hikers and 300 support staff to safety after they were stranded by a severe blizzard near Mount Everest. The trekkers were caught off guard by heavy snowfall on the mountain's eastern slopes during a peak holiday season. The rescue effort involved police, firefighters, and hundreds of local Tibetan volunteers who mobilized to reach the stranded groups at high altitudes. The unexpected weather, which caused some hikers to experience hypothermia, was described by a veteran trekker as unprecedented for the region.</p>

While it offers financial flexibility, the process requires a substantial down payment, typically between 45% and 62% of the home's price, and borrowers must still cover property taxes and insurance.

Researchers analyzed deep-sea sediment cores and found evidence that this back-to-back disaster scenario may have occurred multiple times over the past 2,500 years, including after the great Cascadia earthquake of 1700. The findings imply that emergency preparedness plans may need to account for the possibility of two catastrophic events happening in quick succession.</p>

          <p>In a major blow to the proposed breakaway R360 rugby competition, a coalition of the sport's leading nations has announced that any player who joins the league will be ineligible for international selection. The unified stance from unions including England, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia effectively forces players to choose between their national team careers and the lucrative contracts offered by R360. The unions stated that the new league threatens to fragment the sport and has not engaged collaboratively on critical issues like player welfare and scheduling.</p>

          <p>After two years of war, the Gaza Strip has suffered catastrophic devastation, with data illustrating a profound humanitarian crisis. Approximately 11% of the population has been killed or injured, and nearly all 2.1 million residents have been displaced, many multiple times. The conflict has destroyed over 80% of buildings and homes, razed agricultural land, and pushed the territory into famine, according to the world's leading authority on food crises. The scale of destruction has left cemeteries overflowing and the healthcare system completely overwhelmed, creating what the U.N. calls a catastrophe beyond comprehension.</p>

          <p>Orlando Bravo, a prominent tech investor and co-founder of Thoma Bravo, has stated that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently "at a bubble," drawing parallels to the dot-com era. He cautioned that it is unsustainable for a company with $50 million in annual recurring revenue to be valued at $10 billion. However, Bravo also highlighted a crucial difference from the past: the current AI boom is being financed by large, financially healthy corporations, which provides a more stable foundation than the speculative venture capital of the late 1990s.

          <p>A youth-led protest movement in Morocco, known as Gen Z 212, is using the online chat platform Discord to anonymously organize the country's largest anti-government demonstrations in years. The group, which began with just four people and has grown to nearly a quarter of a million members, calls for the prime minister's resignation and reforms in education and healthcare. Organizers leverage Discord's decentralized and secure features to coordinate protest locations, hold online votes on strategy, and maintain anonymity to avoid reprisal from security forces.</p>

          <p>The European Union has proposed new measures that would cut tariff-free steel import quotas by nearly half and apply a 50% tariff on any steel imported beyond that limit. This move has been labeled "perhaps the biggest crisis" and an "existential threat" by the UK steel industry, as the EU represents 78% of its export market. The EU's action is a response to pressure from member states struggling to compete with cheap imports from countries like China. The UK government is now seeking urgent clarification and potential exemptions to avoid disastrous consequences for its already struggling steel sector.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of using its "shadow fleet" of oil tankers for purposes beyond evading sanctions, claiming the vessels are being used for intelligence gathering and sabotage. According to Zelenskyy, these tankers are part of a broader strategy to destabilize Europe. He stated that Ukrainian intelligence is actively collaborating with international partners to provide information and counter this threat. The accusation suggests a new dimension to the ongoing conflict, extending into unconventional and covert maritime operations.</p>

          <p>During a public parole hearing, David Norris, one of two men convicted for the 1993 racist murder of Black teenager Stephen Lawrence, admitted for the first time that he was part of the attacking group. However, Norris refused to name his accomplices, citing risks to himself and his family, thus leaving the case only partially resolved. Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, argued that Norris remains a danger to the public and should not be released, as he has not shown full contrition or taken complete responsibility by identifying the other killers.</p>
