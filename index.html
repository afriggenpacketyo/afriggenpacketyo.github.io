          <p>A 39-year-old suspect in a Hamburg knife attack, which injured 18 people, was known to police for showing signs of mental illness since 2021. The German national had been released from a psychiatric hospital in Lower Saxony just a day before the stabbing incident at the city's central train station. Authorities had initiated criminal proceedings against her in several cases last year, and she had been treated in a psychiatric institution for three weeks in May, but doctors found no medical justification to keep her there. The suspect is now accused of 15 cases of attempted manslaughter combined with grievous bodily harm, with the charges relating to those directly injured by the knife, while others sustained injuries due to shock or falls. </p>

          <p>Aston Villa plans to file a complaint with the Premier League following a controversial refereeing decision during their 2-0 loss to Manchester United, which cost them a spot in the Champions League. A disallowed goal, due to referee Thomas Bramall's perceived foul on United's goalkeeper, sparked outrage as replays showed the goalkeeper did not have full possession. Because Bramall stopped play before the ball entered the net, the video assistant referee (VAR) could not intervene. Villa's director of football operations expressed discontent over the selection of an inexperienced referee for such a crucial game, questioning why international referees were not assigned.</p>

Alexander Rossi's pit stop was also eventful as smoke turned into flames, and Robert Shwartzman hit his pit crew after losing control of his car.

          <p>Russia launched one of its largest air assaults on Ukraine, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across the country. Ukrainian officials described the attack as evidence that Moscow is uninterested in a truce, despite ongoing cease-fire negotiations initiated in February. Ukrainian civilian deaths have been on the rise since February, with 209 fatalities recorded in April, marking one of the highest monthly tolls in two years. The air force reported shooting down approximately two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all of the drones used in the bombardment.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," arguing they have a "moral component" because people on Medicaid who "refuse" to work are "defrauding the system." Johnson stated that the bill aims to address fraud, waste, and abuse within Medicaid, rather than cutting the program. He claimed that 4.8 million Americans on Medicaid are able-bodied workers taking advantage of the system, while critics argue that the requirements could cause many to lose coverage. Senator Hawley has called the bill "both morally wrong and politically suicidal" due to the proposed Medicaid changes.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns that the Trump administration is failing to protect them, federal judges are considering creating their own armed security force. This proposal involves shifting control of the armed security personnel from the Department of Justice to the judiciary, with concerns that the current administration might withdraw protection from judges ruling against Trump's policies. The idea emerged during a meeting of federal judges, where anxieties were raised about the increasing number of threats against judges. Currently, federal judges are protected by the US Marshals Service, managed by the Justice Department, which is under the control of a Trump appointee.</p>

The author contends that the court's intervention in cases involving presidential authority effectively overrules established precedents without proper deliberation. This trend, according to the piece, risks consolidating additional power in the presidency and normalizing a disregard for constitutional norms. The author expresses concern that the court's actions may embolden the administration to act outside traditional legal boundaries, potentially leading to further erosion of checks and balances.</p>

Senator Ron Johnson voiced concerns that the bill increases the deficit and urged deeper spending cuts to return to pre-pandemic levels. The bill's passage through the House was narrow, and any Senate amendments would require another House vote, creating a delicate balance. The bill also faces criticism for raising the debt ceiling, with Senator Rand Paul opposing the legislation unless this provision is removed.

          <p>A Georgia police officer resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and facing deportation. Officer Leslie O’Neal pulled over Ximena Arias-Cristobal for a traffic violation that was later dropped, but the arrest led to her being turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Arias-Cristobal, who was brought to the US as a child, narrowly missed the deadline for Daca eligibility, and her plight gained national attention. The incident also highlighted the increasing collaboration between local law enforcement and Ice through 287(g) contracts, which have been criticized by immigration advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer for the movie "Rust," has been released from prison after serving 14 months for involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Gutierrez was convicted for her reckless handling of firearms and ammunition on set, although she denies bringing live bullets to the location. Alec Baldwin, who pointed the gun at Hutchins, was also charged, but the charge was later dismissed. Gutierrez's release marks the conclusion of the criminal phase of the "Rust" saga, though several civil lawsuits remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>Rwanda's support for M23 rebels in eastern Congo, including their capture of Goma, has drawn international condemnation and comparisons to Vladimir Putin. Despite long-standing denials, Rwanda's actions have raised questions about its motives and the potential for long-term instability in the region. While some argue that Rwanda's interventions are driven by mineral greed, others point to changing power dynamics and security concerns. Western leaders are now reassessing their relationship with Rwanda, and the conflict's future depends largely on President Trump's engagement in the region.</p>

Neumayer arrived in Israel in April and was found with Molotov cocktails in a backpack near the embassy.

          <p>A West Point professor resigned in protest after President Trump's administration purged diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs at the academy. Graham Parsons objected to Trump wearing a Make America Great Again hat while addressing graduating cadets, viewing it as a blurring of the lines between the presidency and personal politics. Parsons said West Point began eliminating courses and censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideology, making his position professionally untenable. Parsons described the orders as indoctrination, not education, and a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education.</p>

Johnson insisted that the bill does not cut Medicaid or SNAP, but rather targets fraud, waste, and abuse within those programs.

          <p>Despite its climate-friendly promises and a pledge to halt funding for fossil fuel projects, Japan continues to heavily invest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. From 2013 to 2024, Japanese public financial institutions invested $93 billion in oil and gas projects, with $56 billion allocated to LNG development. This is part of a strategy where Japan benefits from having more access to the LNG supply for its domestic energy needs, and improved access to "demand centers where Japan can resell surplus LNG." Critics argue that Japan's promotion of LNG as a "transitional fuel" is a form of greenwashing, as LNG involves more emissions than coal when processing and shipping are considered.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert has identified "emotionally safe parenting" as a new approach, prioritizing emotional attunement and open communication to foster resilience, trust, and connection. This method involves accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents also take responsibility for their actions after conflicts, apologize, and reconnect with their child, creating an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves. This approach encourages parents to reflect on their own childhood experiences and triggers to become less reactive and more empathetic.</p>
