          <p>A robotics laboratory at China's National University of Defence Technology (NUDT) has created a microdrone about the size of a mosquito for covert military operations. The drone, showcased on CCTV 7, features tiny wings and hair-thin legs, making it suitable for information reconnaissance and special missions. Researchers are also working on smartphone-controlled prototypes. The challenge lies in fitting sensors, power devices, and control circuits into such a small space, requiring collaboration across multiple scientific disciplines.</p>

          <p>Official figures indicate a significant drop in retail sales during May, primarily driven by a "dismal" performance from supermarkets.

Food retailers experienced reduced sales in alcohol and tobacco, while clothing and household goods stores reported sluggish trading. Separate data revealed that government borrowing increased last month, reaching the second-highest level for May since 1993. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Right-wing populists are increasingly expressing anger towards cities, citing their liberal elites, immigrants, and progressive policies as provocations. The article suggests this animosity stems from a sense of defeat, as many major cities have shifted from conservative strongholds to centers of the left. Populist politicians often rely on support from more conservative areas and view cities as symbols of a future they reject. This sentiment is evident in the rhetoric and actions of leaders like Donald Trump and others who seek to undermine urban centers.</p>
