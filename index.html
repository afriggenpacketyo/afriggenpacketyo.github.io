          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a Â£122.7 million fine, the largest ever issued by the water regulator Ofwat, for breaches related to its wastewater operations and dividend payments. The regulator's investigation, described as its "biggest and most complex," determined that the fines would be paid by the company and its investors, not by customers. A Thames Water spokesperson stated that the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously and is committed to improving its performance in this area, although specific details of the breaches were not provided in the article. The penalty underscores the increased scrutiny and accountability placed on utility companies regarding environmental compliance.</p>

          <p>Japan's bond market is causing apprehension about potential capital flight from the U.S. and a carry trade unwind as long-dated yields rise. Demand for 40-year government bonds has weakened, pushing yields near record highs, leading analysts to fear that Japanese investors may repatriate funds from the U.S. A significant shift could trigger a global financial market downturn, impacting U.S. tech stocks and increasing borrowing costs worldwide. While some analysts predict a gradual unwind, others caution about the strengthening yen's unsustainability for Japan's economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A former police chief convicted of murder and sexual assault escaped from an Arkansas prison by impersonating a corrections officer. Grant Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," walked out of the medium-security facility after a prison officer opened a secure gate for him. Authorities are searching the rugged Ozark Mountains using canines, drones, and helicopters. The sister of one of Hardin's victims expressed alarm, as she and other relatives were witnesses in his trial. Heavy rain in the area is complicating the search efforts.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' weather agency reports a 70% chance that average warming from 2025 to 2029 will exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius benchmark, indicating that the Earth will remain at historically high levels of warming. This follows the two hottest years on record in 2023 and 2024, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO forecasts that global temperatures will be between 1.2 and 1.9 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average for each year between 2025 and 2029. Climate researchers anticipate that the probability of exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius on a long-term basis will reach 100% in the late 2020s or early 2030s.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan recommends the decriminalisation of possessing small quantities of cannabis for personal use. The report, by the London Drugs Commission, suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act and regulating it under the Psychoactive Substances Act. The report also calls for improved public health services for cannabis-related harm, enhanced education, and fair access to medical cannabis. Critics argue that decriminalisation would send the wrong message about the harm associated with cannabis, while supporters say it would create a more equitable and just system.</p>
