            <p>The LA Galaxy celebrated their 30th anniversary in the MLS with a 1-1 draw against the Houston Dynamo. Despite the celebratory atmosphere, the game was frustrating for Galaxy fans as the team extended their winless streak. The Galaxy honored Cobi Jones, who scored the team's first goal in 1996, during the event. Diego Fagundez scored a free-kick goal for the Galaxy, salvaging a point for the team in a match marked by nostalgia and a tough on-field battle.</p>

            <p>An Israeli strike reportedly damaged the intensive care and surgery departments of Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, according to Hamas. Initial reports indicate no casualties, but the incident prompted evacuation warnings and the relocation of patients and displaced people seeking shelter at the facility. Al-Ahli is now the only functioning hospital in Gaza City, following the destruction of other medical complexes.

            <p>California crab fishermen are experimenting with 'pop-up' gear to reduce whale entanglements and extend the crab fishing season. The gear uses remote-operated devices to retrieve crab pots, eliminating vertical lines that pose a risk to migrating whales. The pilot program is expected to be fully authorized in 2026 and is also being tested in other fisheries. While some fishermen are hesitant due to cost, the new technology offers a potential solution to balance economic needs with environmental protection.</p>

            <p>Luxury malls in Beijing and Shanghai are reducing rents and altering tenant mixes due to a decline in consumer spending on luxury goods. Malls like Parkview Green and K11 are seeking mid-market retailers to attract middle-class shoppers and address rising vacancy rates. Parkview Green is even for sale due to high mortgage payments and low occupancy. This shift reflects the challenges facing high-end consumption in China.</p>
