          <p>Spirit Airlines has issued a stark warning about its financial viability, stating there is "substantial doubt" it can continue as a going concern without securing additional cash. This comes five months after emerging from bankruptcy, as the carrier struggles with adverse market conditions, including high domestic capacity and weak leisure travel demand. The company is exploring the sale of assets like aircraft and airport gates to raise necessary funds and avoid defaulting on creditor agreements, highlighting its precarious position in a challenging airline industry.</p>

          <p>A United Kingdom law requiring age verification for adult websites and other platforms is facing significant backlash from users, tech companies, and U.S. politicians. The Online Safety Act, intended to protect children from harmful content, has led major sites like Pornhub, Reddit, and X to implement systems requiring personal data for access. Critics argue these measures infringe on privacy and could lead to censorship, while U.S. officials express concern over the law's impact on American tech firms and free speech principles, even as other countries consider similar legislation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threatening a "major lawsuit" against Chairman Jerome Powell over the rising costs of renovating the central bank's headquarters. In a social media post, Trump called Powell a "loser" and demanded an immediate interest rate cut, blaming his own former Treasury Secretary for recommending Powell. The president claimed the renovation costs are grossly inflated, a point Powell has previously disputed, marking a significant intensification of political pressure on the independent financial institution.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly increasing its efforts to sign Crystal Palace and England national team center-back Marc Guehi before the summer transfer window closes. With only a year left on his contract, Crystal Palace's chairman has indicated a sale is possible to avoid losing him on a free transfer next year. Initial talks have reportedly taken place, with Palace seeking around £40 million for the 25-year-old defender. The potential signing is part of Liverpool's significant summer spending spree aimed at reinforcing their squad for the upcoming season.</p>

Despite a recent dip in net income, E.l.f.'s CEO remains focused on the company's long-term growth, which includes 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth and this major acquisition. The deal, financed partly by debt, is seen as a strategic move to enter Sephora stores and further challenge legacy beauty players.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 10:18:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent legislation is set to reduce federal support for Medicaid, potentially leaving 10 million Americans uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. While presented as a cost-saving measure, this article argues the cuts will shift financial burdens onto other parts of society, including community health centers and hospitals, which act as a last resort for the uninsured. This could lead to increased uncompensated care costs for hospitals, rising medical debt for individuals, and ultimately, negative economic consequences from a sicker, less productive workforce.</p>

          <p>Nine-time Grand Slam champion Monica Seles has publicly revealed her diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease. The 51-year-old tennis icon shared her three-year journey with the condition to raise awareness ahead of the U.S. Open. Seles experienced symptoms like double vision and muscle weakness in her arms and legs, which are characteristic of the disease that affects communication between nerves and muscles. While there is no cure, various treatments can help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life for those affected.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour party came to power in the UK last summer. The milestone was reached after 474 people arrived on Monday, a day which also saw a woman die while attempting the journey from France. The figures present a significant political challenge for the government, which has pledged to stop the crossings. The Conservative opposition criticized Labour's approach, while the government maintains it is implementing measures to dismantle smuggling gangs and manage the situation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% in July and 2.7% over the past 12 months, a slightly cooler annual rate than economists had predicted.

The data suggests that the price impacts from tariffs have been modest so far, with a drop in energy costs helping to offset increases in other areas.

These include reinvesting the proceeds into a tax-efficient brokerage account, often using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to minimize annual tax burdens. Another popular option is making a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a non-profit that also satisfies the RMD.

          <p>President Trump's recent actions, including imposing steep tariffs on India and using harsh rhetoric, are straining ties with key Asian partners and threatening the stability of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad). The alliance, which also includes Japan and Australia, is a cornerstone of the U.S. strategy to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. By targeting India with tariffs and sanctions threats over its trade with Russia, the Trump administration has pushed U.S.-India relations to a low point, potentially unraveling a key foreign policy achievement of his first term.</p>

          <p>A new law championed by the Trump administration will result in 2.4 million fewer Americans receiving food stamp benefits, according to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis. The legislation expands work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to new groups, including parents of older children and adults up to age 64. The CBO projects that these changes will decrease resources for households at the bottom of the income distribution while increasing them for those in the middle and top, sparking criticism from anti-hunger advocates.</p>

          <p>Aimee Betro, a woman from Wisconsin, has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder for her role as a hired assassin in a 2019 plot in Birmingham, UK. The attack, which stemmed from a family feud, failed when her gun jammed as she attempted to shoot a man at point-blank range while disguised in a niqab. After the botched attempt, Betro fired shots at the family's home before fleeing the country, remaining on the run for nearly five years until her capture in Armenia. Her two co-conspirators were previously convicted and jailed for their roles in the plot.</p>

          <p>The European team for the 2025 Ryder Cup is shaping up to be very similar to the victorious 2023 squad, providing a sense of continuity that captain Luke Donald likely welcomes. Key players like Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, and Tommy Fleetwood have already secured their spots, with others like Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry expected to follow. This settled roster contrasts with the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. team and its captaincy.

          <p>In Colombia's volatile Cauca region, the unarmed Indigenous Guard of the Nasa people is undertaking dangerous missions to rescue children recruited by guerrilla groups. These armed factions lure youths with promises of money to expand their control over territories used for illicit crop cultivation. The Guard, armed only with sacred staffs symbolizing their authority, confronts heavily armed fighters to reclaim their children in a desperate struggle against exploitation. Once inside the camps, many youths suffer physical abuse, sexual assault, and political indoctrination, making escape incredibly difficult.</p>
