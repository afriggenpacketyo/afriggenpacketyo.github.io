          <p>President Trump cut his trip to Canada for the G7 summit short due to ongoing events in the Middle East, specifically mentioning the Israel-Iran conflict. He arrived in Canada on Sunday and met with leaders from Canada and the United Kingdom earlier on Monday. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced his early departure on X, noting that much had been accomplished. The decision appeared to be influenced by the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, requiring Trump's attention back in Washington. Optimism here is tempered by the seriousness of the geopolitical situation. </p>

          <p>A federal jury determined that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed Eric Coomer, a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems, awarding Coomer $2.3 million in damages. The lawsuit stemmed from Lindell's false accusations that Coomer stole the 2020 presidential election. Lindell, who continues to claim the election was fraudulent, said he went to trial to highlight the need to eliminate electronic voting machines. Coomer's lawyers successfully argued that Lindell's statements were either knowingly false or recklessly made without verifying their truth. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans released details of President Trump's tax bill, which includes changes to tax and Medicaid provisions. Key sticking points include Medicaid funding, the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and the debt ceiling increase. The Senate version proposes steeper cuts to Medicaid, permanently extends the $10,000 SALT deduction, and calls for a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling. House Republicans have threatened to vote against the bill if the SALT cap is not raised. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump faces several options regarding the Israel-Iran conflict, ranging from escalating involvement to pulling back. He could bow to pressure from Netanyahu and escalate attacks, maintain a middle ground by reiterating non-involvement, or heed MAGA voices and withdraw support. His unpredictability complicates the situation, with some advisors supporting maximum pressure while others caution against intensifying attacks. The conflict has led to canceled talks and increased pressure from both domestic and international factions. </p>
