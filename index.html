          <p>Austria held a vigil to mourn the ten victims of a school shooting in Graz, where thousands gathered to light candles and offer condolences. The 21-year-old suspect, a former student, committed suicide after the attack, which is the deadliest in Austria's recent history. Authorities are investigating the motive and found a "farewell letter" and a non-functional pipe bomb at the suspect's home. The incident prompted nationwide mourning, with flags at half-mast and the school closed until further notice, as the country grapples with the tragedy. The community has come together in solidarity to grieve and support those affected by the senseless violence. Optimism score is 10.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second night of unrest with petrol bombs and fireworks thrown at police after a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault.

Politicians condemned the violence, fearing fatalities, while some accused others of exploiting the situation.

          <p>During Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial for sex crimes, testimony from his ex-girlfriend, "Jane," revealed details about his personal life. While her claims portrayed Combs as a sexual deviant, an attorney suggested they did little to prove the specific charges he faces. The case hinges on coercion versus consent, with Combs' lawyers suggesting the alleged victim willingly participated in the encounters. The testimony highlights the challenges in prosecuting sex crimes and the complexities of proving coercion. Optimism score is 35.</p>
