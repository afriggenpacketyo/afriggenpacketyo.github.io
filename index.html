          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semi-finals via a walkover after her opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, withdrew due to a knee injury. This sets up a highly anticipated rematch of last year's final against American player Jessica Pegula. Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets, showcasing strong form despite a challenging season leading up to the tournament.</p>

The bill authorizes nearly $925 billion in defense spending, representing a 3% increase from the previous year, and now awaits reconciliation with the House's competing version.

          <p>This article analyzes former President Donald Trump's repeated claims that he ended six or seven wars and deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. The White House identified conflicts including those between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and India and Pakistan as examples of his diplomatic successes. Foreign policy experts acknowledge that the Trump administration helped broker some ceasefires and agreements, but they also note that many of these conflicts were not full-scale wars and several remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.3 billion, a data analysis explores the financial outcomes for potential winners based on their location. The report highlights that winners in states with no income tax on lottery prizes, such as Florida and Texas, would take home significantly more money after federal taxes. Conversely, states with high income taxes, like New York, would see the lowest net payout, illustrating the major impact of state-level taxation on large lottery winnings.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan in Britain for allegedly "inciting violence" through social media posts has ignited a debate about free speech in Europe. The article argues that his arrest is symptomatic of a wider trend where vaguely defined hate speech and harassment laws are selectively enforced, giving police significant discretionary power. This situation creates a perception of "two-tier justice," where authorities are seen as protecting certain groups while prosecuting others, a dynamic the far-right can exploit.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a "kinetic strike" in international waters against a boat from Venezuela, resulting in the deaths of 11 individuals described as drug traffickers. The operation occurred amid heightened tensions, as the U.S. has increased its naval presence in the Caribbean for counter-narcotics missions, which Venezuela views as a threat. Trump stated the individuals killed were members of the Tren de Aragua crime group and warned against trafficking drugs into the United States.</p>

          <p>Air Lease, a major aircraft leasing company founded by industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal led by a consortium of investors including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital. The acquisition, valued at about $28.2 billion including debt, reflects a growing trend of consolidation within the aircraft leasing sector. This industry has seen increased profitability due to a shortage of new aircraft, which has driven up rental rates for both new and used planes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a sharply critical open letter, nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have condemned the policies of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. They argue that his actions, including restricting vaccine access and cutting research funding, are "endangering every American's health." The letter also cites the recent removal of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez as a move that has further destabilized the public health agency and fueled a "raging fire" of turmoil.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration will ask the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to overturn a recent appeals court decision that found most of his tariffs illegal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the authority to impose tariffs rests exclusively with Congress, a decision Trump claims would be devastating for the country if upheld. Trump argued that tariffs are essential to the nation's financial fabric and that their potential removal was negatively affecting the stock market. (not investment advice)</p>
