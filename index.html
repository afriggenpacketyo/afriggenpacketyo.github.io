          <p>The International Chess Federation is reviewing potential disciplinary action against Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik. For over a year, Kramnik had made unsubstantiated cheating allegations against American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who died at age 29. Naroditsky had denied the claims, stating they were ruining his life, and his death has prompted calls from prominent chess figures for Kramnik to be held accountable for harassment. The federation has acknowledged the growing toxicity in online chess and will also establish a prize in Naroditsky's memory.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has given Thames Water its lowest possible one-star rating for poor environmental performance in 2024, citing repeated sewage spills. This rating is part of a broader, scathing assessment of England's water companies, where nearly all were found to require improvement and serious pollution incidents rose by 60% from the previous year. While industry bodies acknowledged poor performance, the EA's chair noted that companies' stated focus on improvement is not reflected in the data. Thames Water stated that its required transformation will take at least a decade to complete.</p>

          <p>Starbucks Workers United, representing over 12,000 baristas across more than 650 cafes, is initiating a strike authorization vote as it seeks to secure its first contract with the coffee giant. The union is demanding better staffing hours, increased take-home pay, and a resolution for numerous unfair labor practice charges, with negotiations having stalled since December 2024. As voting proceeds, the union plans a series of nationwide rallies to increase pressure on the company. Starbucks maintains that it offers competitive pay and benefits and has urged the union to return to the bargaining table.</p>

          <p>Shares in French luxury group Kering rose over 9% after the company reported a smaller-than-expected sales decline in its third quarter, signaling a potential turnaround. While sales at its main brand, Gucci, were down, the 14% drop marked a significant sequential improvement from the previous quarter's 25% plunge, beating analyst expectations. This positive development, along with Kering's recent decision to sell its beauty unit to focus on core fashion businesses, has built optimism among investors. Analysts see the results as evidence that management's actions to revive the brand are beginning to show success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars saw its stock price soar by approximately 40% in a single day, marking its best trading performance since its public listing. The dramatic rally was triggered by the company's third-quarter operating income report, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations at 6.4 billion Swedish kronor. The strong financial results were attributed to a successful cost-saving program and several one-off financial items. This performance has provided a major boost to investor confidence in the Geely-owned car manufacturer's financial health and strategic direction.</p>

          <p>A second night of disorder outside a Dublin hotel housing asylum seekers has resulted in three police officers being injured and 24 arrests. The violence, which included stones and fireworks being thrown at police, erupted from a protest concerning an alleged sexual assault of a young girl in the area. Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly condemned the events as "totally unacceptable" thuggery, distinct from peaceful protest, and promised a robust response to any further violence. The incidents have created a tense atmosphere, with a heavy police presence and steel barriers now surrounding the hotel complex.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Sanctions on Russian Oil Giants Poised to Disrupt Supply to China and India</h2>

          <p>The recent U.S. sanctions targeting Russian oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil are expected to cause significant disruptions for their largest customers, China and India. These Asian nations have become the primary buyers of Russian crude since Western price caps were imposed, with Russia supplying about 20% of China's oil imports. The sanctions, which require a wind-down of transactions by November 21, will force refiners in both countries to navigate complex payment and shipping challenges or seek alternative supplies. This could lead to increased costs and a potential shift towards Middle Eastern crude.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to deploy a team of Border Patrol agents to the San Francisco area as part of its expanding nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration. According to U.S. officials, the operation could begin as early as this week and will be staged from a U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda. This move follows similar deployments in other Democratic-led cities far from the U.S. border, utilizing Border Patrol's authority to make immigration arrests anywhere in the country. California Governor Gavin Newsom and other local leaders have denounced the plan as an abuse of power intended to create fear.</p>

          <p>China's space agency has announced that its Chang'e-7 lunar mission will be a pioneering effort to search for water ice at the moon's south pole. The mission, slated to be the most complex in China's lunar program history, will deploy an orbiter, lander, rover, and a smaller hopping probe to study the polar environment. Finding water ice is considered crucial for future crewed space exploration, as it could be converted into drinking water, oxygen, and rocket fuel. The landing site will be chosen in an area with over 100 days of continuous sunlight to support long-term operations.</p>
