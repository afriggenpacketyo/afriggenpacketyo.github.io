        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle publicly rebuked comments from United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who had declared the ultra-low-cost carrier business model dead. Biffle highlighted Frontier's lower operational costs per seat mile compared to United, arguing that budget airlines cater to a distinct market segment seeking value. The dispute comes as discount carriers like Spirit and Frontier face financial headwinds from rising costs and increased competition from major airlines that have adopted similar no-frills basic economy fares, leading to an oversupply of domestic flights and downward pressure on ticket prices.</p>

          <p>Christian singer Forrest Frank released an emotional new song with religious themes after speaking out about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Frank revealed he lost approximately 30,000 Instagram followers following his comments, in which he stated his primary message was his faith in Jesus Christ. In a video, he asserted that he did not want followers who did not share his core beliefs, emphasizing a shift in his platform's focus towards his faith. The new song's lyrics appear to reflect his recent statements on societal division and the importance of religious conviction.</p>

          <p>Lithuanian prosecutors announced the disruption of a Russian-led operation that planned to carry out bomb attacks across Europe using mail parcels. The plot involved suspects with ties to Russian military intelligence who concealed homemade incendiary devices in items like massage cushions. Several parcels, shipped via carriers DHL and DPD, exploded at facilities in Germany, Poland, and the UK, while others were intercepted. The international investigation, involving multiple countries and coordinated by Eurojust, revealed that suspects were recruited via Telegram and paid in cryptocurrency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent drop in the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to its lowest point since 2022 has triggered a nearly 60% weekly surge in refinancing applications. The trend is largely driven by homeowner expectations of an impending Federal Reserve rate cut. The article suggests that homeowners who purchased homes in 2023 or 2024 at higher rates, those with large outstanding balances, and borrowers with good credit and significant home equity stand to benefit most. Refinancing into a stable, long-term fixed mortgage is also presented as a strategic move for those with adjustable-rate mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jair Bolsonaro, the former president of Brazil, has been diagnosed with an early form of skin cancer, according to his doctor. The diagnosis followed the removal and testing of two skin lesions while he was briefly hospitalized for unrelated issues including dizziness and low blood pressure. Bolsonaro is currently under house arrest after being convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for plotting a coup to overthrow the current government following his 2022 election loss. His medical team stated that he will require regular monitoring to ensure no new lesions appear.</p>

          <p>In a late-stage clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral diabetes pill, orforglipron, demonstrated superior efficacy in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved oral drug, Rybelsus. The study found that the highest dose of orforglipron reduced hemoglobin A1c levels by 2.2% and led to an average weight loss of 9.2%, outperforming the results from Novo Nordisk's pill. While these results position Eli Lilly's drug as a strong contender in the growing market for convenient GLP-1 treatments, experts note the trial did not compare it against higher, yet-to-be-approved doses of Novo Nordisk's medication.</p>

The rally, organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, included a diverse range of groups protesting against what they described as Trump's politics of racism and division. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as "no to racism" and displayed smaller versions of the "Trump Baby" blimp famous from his 2019 visit. The demonstration reflects significant public opposition to the British government's decision to host the U.S. President for another formal state visit.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that U.S. government economic statistics are growing less reliable, creating a "black box" for policymakers and businesses. This is attributed to declining response rates for crucial surveys, chronic underfunding of statistical agencies, and significant lags in data reporting. For example, recent revisions to jobs data showed 911,000 fewer jobs were created than initially reported. The article suggests that while a wealth of real-time private-sector data exists from sources like payroll processors and consumer spending databases, the government has failed to integrate these to create a more accurate and timely economic picture.</p>

Additionally, rising inflation and general market uncertainty are prompting investors to seek safe-haven assets.

          <p>The BBC has rescheduled the broadcast of its documentary "Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home" for October 2nd. The film, which follows the final years of the rock legend's life, was originally postponed from its August air date out of respect for the Osbourne family following the musician's death at age 76. The intimate documentary covers Osbourne's move back to the UK from Los Angeles with his wife Sharon and his determined battle with health issues to perform a final farewell concert in his hometown of Birmingham. The film is described as a moving portrait of his resilience and enduring relationship.</p>

          <p>Lenin Moreno, the former president of Ecuador, has dismissed bribery charges against him as a politically motivated "farce." Prosecutors allege that Moreno and his family are linked to $76 million in illicit payments from a Chinese state-owned construction company involved in the Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric dam, a major Belt and Road Initiative project. Moreno claims the accusations are a vendetta orchestrated by his predecessor and political rival, Rafael Correa, under whose administration the controversial project was initiated. Moreno insists the case is retaliation for his efforts to curb Correa's political influence in the country.</p>

          <p>The Unite union reports that workers in the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) supply chain are being laid off with reduced or no pay and told to apply for universal credit. This follows a major cyber attack that forced JLR to halt production, with disruptions potentially lasting for months. The union is calling on the UK government to establish a furlough scheme to protect the thousands of jobs supported by the automaker's supply chain. The production shutdown is estimated to be costing JLR at least £50 million per week, raising concerns about the viability of smaller suppliers.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Current forecasts from the National Hurricane Center predict the storm will track northwest over open waters, staying north of the Caribbean and away from land for the next several days. While no immediate hazards to land have been issued, meteorologists suggest Gabrielle could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. The storm's formation comes about a week after the historical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which has so far been quieter than initially predicted.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service is set to announce its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets, which could provide financial relief for many households in 2026. Experts project the IRS will apply an inflation rate of about 2.7%, increasing the income thresholds for each tax bracket to prevent "bracket creep," where cost-of-living pay raises push workers into higher tax rates. This means taxpayers will be able to earn more income before moving into a higher marginal tax bracket. The official adjustments are typically announced by the IRS in October or November.

The bill also raises the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds and establishes a specialized court for sexual offenses. Critics of the "not proven" verdict argued it was confusing and failed to provide closure for victims, while supporters claimed it was a safeguard against wrongful convictions.</p>
