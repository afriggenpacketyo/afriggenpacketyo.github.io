          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a black-tie gala for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, $TRUMP, drawing criticism for potential pay-for-play practices. The event, held at Trump's private golf club, offered exclusive access to the president for those who invested heavily in the coin. Critics, including some Republican lawmakers, have condemned the arrangement as an opportunity for the president and his family to improperly benefit from his position. Data analysis reveals that while some investors profited, the majority of $TRUMP holders have incurred losses since the gala's announcement. (not investment advice)</p>
