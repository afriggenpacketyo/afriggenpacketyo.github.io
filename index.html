          <p>During his second state visit to the U.K., former President Donald Trump expressed that Russian President Vladimir Putin has "really let me down." The comment came as he concluded a historic trip filled with diplomatic meetings and royal engagements, including discussions with King Charles and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The visit also touched upon key geopolitical issues such as trade, the war in Gaza, and ongoing support for Ukraine, highlighting the complex international landscape. The statement regarding Putin adds another layer to the evolving relationship between the two leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of 2025, retirees considering reverse mortgages face a more complex situation than traditional borrowers. While standard mortgage rates have dropped, reverse mortgage rates are influenced by a wider range of factors, including lender margins and program rules, meaning they may not fall as quickly. However, lower rates can increase the total amount of home equity a retiree can borrow. The article advises that individuals should carefully compare fixed versus adjustable-rate options and consult multiple lenders to navigate the current financial environment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's decision that blocked the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The administration argues that the president has the authority to determine what constitutes "cause" for removal, citing allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook that predate her appointment. Solicitor General John Sauer asserted that Cook's alleged misrepresentations on mortgage documents are sufficient grounds for her dismissal. Cook has denied any wrongdoing, and the case represents a significant challenge to the independence of the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals significant disparities in property tax payments for homeowners across the United States, with median annual bills ranging from over $9,100 in New Jersey to under $800 in Alabama. Property taxes have risen 27.4% since 2019, becoming an increasing strain on household budgets, particularly for younger homeowners. The article notes that tax burdens are influenced by local home values, state tax structures, and specific policies, with some states lacking an income tax relying more heavily on property taxes to fund public services. Experts advise new buyers to budget for potential tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has stated his intention to designate the decentralized, far-left movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." In a social media post, he described the group as "sick" and "dangerous" and called for an investigation into its funding sources. This move faces significant legal and constitutional hurdles, as the U.S. does not have a domestic terrorist organization list, partly due to First Amendment protections for freedom of speech and association.

          <p>The United Kingdom has deported the first migrant to France under a new "one in one out" pilot program aimed at deterring small boat crossings over the English Channel. The individual, an Indian national, was flown to Paris, marking the start of the year-long agreement between the two nations. The move comes amid ongoing legal challenges to the scheme, including a High Court decision to temporarily block another deportation on modern slavery grounds. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood called the flight an "important first step" in securing the country's borders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid its ongoing bankruptcy restructuring, budget carrier Spirit Airlines has announced plans to cut its flight capacity by approximately 25% starting in November. In a memo to employees, CEO Dave Davis indicated that the operational changes will likely be accompanied by layoffs as the airline seeks to reduce costs and become more efficient. The airline has already halted service in a dozen U.S. cities and is in discussions with its pilots' union to achieve significant annual cost savings. These measures reflect broader challenges facing low-cost airlines in the current market.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, alleging they engaged in "illegal" ticket resale tactics that harm consumers. The suit claims the companies tacitly worked with scalpers to unlawfully purchase large quantities of tickets and used a "bait and switch" approach to inflate final prices with hidden fees. The FTC argues that these practices frustrate artists' intentions to keep ticket prices affordable and have cost fans millions of dollars. The lawsuit seeks to address the company's dominant control over the live event ticketing market.</p>

          <p>A public dispute has broken out between the founders of a new UK left-wing party, with MP Zarah Sultana accusing former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his allies of creating a "sexist boys' club." Sultana claimed she was sidelined from key decisions despite an agreement for joint leadership, prompting her to launch a membership website that Corbyn's faction then dismissed as "unauthorised." The infighting, which includes disagreements over financial control and party structure, has emerged before the party has even been officially named, causing frustration among its potential supporters.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated the news that ABC was taking "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air, calling it "great news for America" and describing the host as having "ZERO talent." The show's suspension followed Kimmel's monologue in which he criticized the right for using the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk for political points. Trump has had a long and contentious history with Kimmel, who has been a frequent and sharp critic of his presidency.

The statement from Beijing underscores the deepening geopolitical tensions in the region, as Venezuela accuses the U.S. of using its military for political purposes under the guise of counter-narcotics operations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, who faced intense criticism and rejection for his ideas, developed a method for emotional regulation that remains relevant today. He argued that by consciously observing our emotions with reason, a process now known as metacognition, we can move from being controlled by them to understanding and managing them. This approach involves pausing before reacting, analyzing the source of feelings like anger or fear, and offering oneself rational advice. By doing so, individuals can maintain equanimity and respond to censure with dignity rather than being overwhelmed by emotional turmoil.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that policies under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could effectively dismantle the U.S. vaccine market without an outright ban. The administration's actions, including firing experts, tightening regulations, defunding research, and spreading misinformation, are creating a highly unpredictable and risky environment for pharmaceutical companies. In response, manufacturers are already announcing layoffs and scaling back vaccine-related investments. Experts warn this could lead to critical shortages of routine childhood vaccines and severely hamper the nation's ability to respond to a future pandemic.</p>

          <p>The White House has signaled its approval of the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut, with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett describing the move as a "prudent call." While some within the administration had advocated for a more aggressive half-point reduction, Hassett indicated that the gradual approach is a good first step toward lower rates. This positive reception contrasts with President Trump's previous harsh criticisms of the central bank's policies. The comments suggest a temporary alignment between the administration and the Fed on monetary policy direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported mixed results for its fiscal first quarter, with earnings per share falling short of Wall Street expectations.

This performance helped compensate for continued weakness in its fine-dining segment. Despite the earnings miss, Darden raised its full-year revenue growth forecast, though its stock fell more than 9% in morning trading. (not investment advice)</p>
