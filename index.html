        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China initiated large-scale military exercises near Taiwan, simulating attacks and blockades.  This action follows Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's labeling of China as a hostile force. Beijing views the drills as a response to perceived Taiwanese provocations toward independence, reiterating its commitment to reunification, even by force. The drills also come after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's pledges to strengthen military ties with Asian countries to counter China's influence.</p>
