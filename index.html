          <p>Following threats from US President Donald Trump to impose 50% tariffs on EU goods, EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic emphasized the EU's commitment to securing a trade deal with the US based on mutual respect rather than threats. Sefcovic highlighted the unmatched EU-US trade relationship, valued at over $600 billion in goods sent from the EU to the US last year, and stressed the need for negotiations to be guided by mutual respect. European governments have cautioned that higher tariffs would be detrimental to both sides, advocating for de-escalation and negotiated solutions to avoid damaging economic consequences. The EU stands ready to defend its interests, and hopes to come to an agreement with the US.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new rules requiring journalists to have official escorts for access to much of the Department of Defense headquarters. This action follows several leaks that embarrassed the Pentagon and represents the latest in a series of limitations on mainstream media imposed by the Trump administration. President Donald Trump is also scheduled to deliver a commencement address at West Point military academy, marking his first such address since his return to office this year. The increased restrictions on press access raise concerns about transparency and freedom of the press within the US government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has endorsed a "planned partnership" between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, projecting it will generate at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the US economy. Meanwhile, Japan faces soaring rice prices, prompting the government to consider selling stockpiled rice at 2,000 yen per 5 kg to alleviate consumer burden, as supermarket operators increase sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice. A US national was arrested in Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo for allegedly using pepper spray in a shopping mall parking lot after a dispute over cigarette smoke, injuring over 40 people. A leading Japanese AI startup CEO urges Japan to focus more on developing its own AI technology for defense applications.</p>

          <p>Many women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) face a dilemma when considering pregnancy, as contraception is a primary treatment but poses challenges for those wanting to conceive. PMDD, affecting up to 8% of women, can cause severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts, with an average diagnosis wait time of 12 years. Women like Marianne and Corinne struggle with the decision to come off medication, fearing the return of debilitating symptoms, and advocate for more research into PMDD to provide better treatment options beyond contraception. The Welsh government has outlined plans to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD.</p>

          <p>Many young people in China are postponing retirement plans due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and housing pressures amidst a slowing economy. Despite government calls to prepare for retirement, young employees are more focused on immediate concerns and find retirement too distant to prioritize. They express a preference for focusing on present well-being rather than stressing about the future, with some even joking about potential robot caretakers in their old age. The Chinese government has been warning of long-term risks from an aging population and encouraging participation in the expanded personal pension system to build retirement savings.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are "quiet quitting," prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations, they are less willing to sacrifice their personal lives for their employers, with many clocking in and out on time and doing only the bare minimum required. This shift is driven by a desire for more "me time," disillusionment with corporate sacrifices, and a reevaluation of priorities following the coronavirus pandemic. Experts view this trend as a positive change, potentially leading to happier individuals and a healthier economy as young people seek fulfillment outside of work.</p>

Despite these setbacks, the Dodgers persevered, with Teoscar Hernández driving in the go-ahead run in the 13th.

Experts suggest that African nations' deepening economic alignment with Beijing is driving the diminishing presence of Taiwan on the continent.

          <p>A knife attack at the main railway station in Hamburg, Germany, has left eighteen people injured, with several sustaining life-threatening wounds. Police have arrested a 39-year-old German woman at the scene and believe she acted alone, possibly due to mental distress. The attack occurred between platforms 13 and 14, accessible via a busy main road. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed shock and thanked the emergency services for their rapid response. The homicide division is investigating the incident and the suspect's motives.</p>

This action comes as the average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms, roughly double last year's level.

          <p>President Donald Trump has endorsed a "planned partnership" between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., projecting it will create at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the US economy. This decision follows a review of the acquisition plan by a panel of federal agencies. Both steelmakers issued statements welcoming the approval, emphasizing their commitment to American workers and national security. The potential acquisition by Nippon Steel, the world's fourth-largest producer, of the iconic but struggling American steelmaker had been an issue during last year's U.S. presidential election.</p>

          <p>Germany's vigilance against historical revisionism is selective, as evidenced by the Herbert Quandt Media prize, which celebrates the legacy of an early SS supporter who played a central role in the Nazi war economy. Despite Germany's official policy of acknowledging past crimes, this reckoning is often curated and ignored when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. Wealthy families who built their empires on Nazi collaboration and forced labor are often seamlessly absorbed into German society. The government's reliance on "historical responsibility" to avoid challenging Israel's actions in Gaza further highlights this selective approach to remembrance culture.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan amid geopolitical tensions and discussions on de-dollarization. Businesses in Qatar are keen to use the yuan, leveraging Hong Kong's settlement, payment, and hedging capabilities. This trend reflects a broader shift towards alternatives to the US dollar in international trades, payments, and investments, aligning with China's efforts to mitigate risks and assert financial independence. An increase in yuan-denominated trades and investments should translate to more deals and opportunities for Hong Kong's financial sector.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail has sparked controversy, with civil rights organizations and politicians raising concerns about privacy and surveillance. Despite a recent pause in automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A., a private organization running facial recognition cameras, authorities used the technology to recapture one fugitive. Critics argue that the public is not aware they are being scanned, and the ACLU has called for a halt to the use of live-feed facial recognition.
