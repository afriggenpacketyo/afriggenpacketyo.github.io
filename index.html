          <p>Kenton Cool, a 51-year-old British mountain guide, has successfully scaled Mount Everest for the 19th time, setting a new record for the most ascents by a non-Sherpa guide. Cool reached the 8,849-meter peak on Sunday, accompanied by other climbers, and is currently descending safely. He first climbed Everest in 2004 and has made it an almost annual endeavor, save for cancellations due to the 2014 avalanche tragedy, the 2015 earthquake, and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Numerous climbers are currently attempting to summit Everest during the spring climbing season, which is expected to conclude by the end of May. </p>

          <h2>Study Finds Simple Brick Stacking Method Could Significantly Reduce Air Pollution in Bangladesh</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that changing the way bricks are stacked in kilns in Bangladesh could significantly reduce air pollution. The study, which examined over 275 kilns, found that using a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow and ensuring consistent coal delivery can reduce fuel use by 23% and lower carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by approximately 20%. This low-cost intervention also improves worker conditions and increases profits for kiln owners through reduced fuel consumption and improved brick quality. Researchers are now collaborating with the Bangladeshi government to expand this training, offering a promising solution for reducing air pollution in the region.</p>

          <p>Small religious colleges in rural areas are increasingly facing closures and mergers due to declining enrollment and financial challenges, impacting access to higher education for rural students. St. Ambrose University and Mount Mercy University are attempting to unite to avoid this fate, as over half of nonprofit colleges that have closed or merged since 2020 were religiously affiliated. These institutions often serve low-income, first-generation students and provide a supportive environment, but face challenges in balancing their mission with financial realities. Efforts are underway to foster collaboration among religious colleges and universities to address these threats and ensure their continued survival.</p>

Additionally, 87.1 percent of respondents feel that the government's efforts to control rising rice prices are insufficient.</p>

          <p>A new internal study by the Bundeswehr indicates that the German military does not have "systemic" extremism, with only a small percentage of soldiers exhibiting right-wing extremist views. However, the study also revealed that some soldiers hold chauvinistic and xenophobic attitudes. While the findings offer some relief, concerns remain about the effectiveness of safeguards against extremism, particularly in the context of broader societal normalization of right-wing views. Experts suggest that the military needs to enhance its awareness of modern right-wing mindsets and continue to prioritize extremism prevention.</p>

          <p>The housing market continues to face significant challenges due to a volatile economy, high mortgage rates, and elevated home prices, making it difficult for buyers and sellers. Despite expectations of a spring and summer surge in home sales, rising interest rates and President Trump's tariff plan have dampened activity. Existing-home sales are expected to show a slight increase, while new-home sales are projected to decrease. The primary issue is the widening gap between home prices and incomes, making down payments and monthly mortgage expenses increasingly burdensome for potential buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential election amid heightened security concerns related to the war in Ukraine and worries about the U.S.'s commitment to European security. The main candidates are RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski, aligned with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and Karol Nawrocki, supported by the Law and Justice party. Recent polls suggest a likely runoff between the two. The election is also a test of strength for other political forces, including the far-right candidate SÅ‚awomir Mentzen. The presidency carries substantial power, including serving as commander of the armed forces and the ability to veto legislation.</p>

          <p>A bloody, bare footprint discovered at the scene of a 1993 murder in Minneapolis led to the arrest of Jerry Westrom, decades after the crime. The victim, Jeanie Childs, was found stabbed to death in her apartment, with the footprint indicating the killer was barefoot. Despite initial suspects, the case went cold until 2015, when DNA evidence linked Westrom to the scene. The evidence included semen, but there was also other male DNA at the crime scene. Westrom was eventually convicted, highlighting the impact of forensic technology in solving cold cases.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to delay the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charge current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027. These changes are part of a revised state budget aimed at addressing a $12 billion deficit, attributed to President Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. The governor claims that while no one will be removed from Medi-Cal, these measures are necessary to balance fiscal responsibility and preserve key investments, with the two policies expected to save California $5.4 billion by fiscal year 2028-29.</p>
