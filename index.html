          <h2>Newsom Sues Trump Administration Over National Guard Deployment in Los Angeles</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles, arguing that the federal government illegally federalized the Guard without his consent. Newsom asserts that Trump's actions are a political move to exacerbate tensions and create chaos, while Trump claims the deployment is necessary to address violent protests. The lawsuit alleges that Trump's action violates the U.S. Constitution and exceeds his authority under federal law related to the National Guard because it occurred without Newsom's consent or input, and because it was not warranted, Bonta said. Newsom has characterized Trump's actions as a step toward authoritarianism. The legal battle underscores the escalating conflict between California and the federal government over immigration enforcement and states' rights. Optimism regarding a swift and peaceful resolution seems low, considering the entrenched positions on both sides.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee (ACIP), replacing them with new members. Kennedy stated that this decision aims to restore public trust in vaccine science and ensure unbiased recommendations, claiming the previous committee was plagued by conflicts of interest. Critics, including medical organizations and former CDC directors, have condemned the move, expressing concerns about undermining a trusted source of guidance and fueling vaccine hesitancy. Kennedy's actions follow previous controversial moves, such as announcing the COVID-19 vaccine would be removed from the CDC's immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women, further intensifying the debate surrounding vaccine policies and public health decision-making. The potential ramifications of this overhaul on public health and vaccine confidence remain a subject of intense scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Baseball Game, a tradition since 1909, pits Democrats against Republicans in a friendly competition at Nationals Park. Representative Roger Williams, a former Atlanta Braves farmhand, coaches the Republican team, while Representative Linda Sanchez manages the Democrats. The game, which raises money for children's charities in the DC area, is known for its competitive spirit and occasional trash talk. This year, the Republicans are aiming for their fifth consecutive win, while the Democrats hope to break their losing streak, despite facing challenges such as injuries and the departure of star player Cedric Richmond. The Congressional Baseball Game offers a unique blend of politics and sports, providing a lighthearted break from the usual Washington gridlock.</p>

          <p>According to JPMorgan Asset Management, Chinese equities are not as inexpensive as they appear because the country's economic slowdown has weakened corporate earnings. Mark Davids, co-head of Asia-Pacific equities, emphasized the importance of investors carefully screening stocks and sectors to identify winners. While Chinese stocks have rallied this year, global investors remain underweight, suggesting limited further upside without improved profitability. The article suggests that for Chinese stocks to be truly attractive, there needs to be a significant improvement in the profitability of Chinese companies, which is challenging given the weak economic conditions.

          <p>Families and lawyers are struggling to contact workers arrested in recent ICE raids in Los Angeles, describing the situation as a "kidnapping." The raids, which occurred in the fashion district and other locations, have sparked protests and led to the deployment of the National Guard. Lawyers report that detainees are being held in deplorable conditions without adequate food, water, or access to legal counsel, with some being deported without proper paperwork. The ACLU held a rally demanding humane treatment and access to lawyers for all detainees, while lawyers condemned the workplace raids as a violation of constitutional rights. The families of those detained are demanding their release and expressing concerns about their well-being and the impact on their communities.</p>

          <p>The presence of Dr. Phil McGraw alongside President Trump's border czar during immigration raids in Los Angeles has sparked controversy and raised questions about the intersection of reality TV and immigration policy. McGraw, who is neither a journalist nor an immigration expert, was there to get a "first-hand look" at the operations and interview Tom Homan for his MeritTV network. Critics argue that McGraw's involvement normalizes the raids and provides a platform for Trump's divisive immigration policies.

The National Guard was largely absent from policing the protests, with neighboring police forces assisting. Union members and local officials protested in Grand Park, demanding the release of union leader David Huerta, who was arrested during an immigration raid.

However, Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C condemned the announcement, fearing it would add to consumer bills and questioned the project's value for money. The final investment decision on the funding model is expected later this summer, with the project facing opposition due to concerns over cost and potential impact on the environment.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric car manufacturers, like BYD, are rapidly expanding into global markets with cheaper and technologically advanced vehicles. This expansion is raising concerns about security risks, potential espionage, and the competitive disadvantage faced by established European and American automakers. While consumers may benefit from more affordable EVs, governments are grappling with how to balance economic opportunities with national security and fair competition. The US has already imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, while the EU is also considering measures to protect its domestic industry.

The Los Angeles Police Department has expressed concerns about the logistical challenges of coordinating with federal military forces.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court for the authority to deport immigrants to countries where they may face torture, even if immigration judges have previously ruled against deporting them to those countries. The administration argues it can bypass the Convention Against Torture by deporting immigrants to previously unmentioned countries after their hearings. Critics argue this would deny due process and violate international law, while Trump's lawyers claim federal courts lack jurisdiction to intervene. The case, Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D., could significantly weaken protections against deportation to dangerous countries if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent federalization of the California National Guard, against the wishes of Governor Gavin Newsom, is drawing comparisons to President Lyndon B. Johnson's actions in 1965. Johnson federalized the Alabama National Guard to protect civil rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery after Governor George Wallace refused to provide adequate protection. The article explores the historical context of Johnson's decision and other instances where presidents have used federal troops in times of domestic unrest.

          <p>President Trump's decision to send the National Guard into Los Angeles to quell protests over immigration raids represents a departure from the traditional presidential role of reconciliation and calming unrest. Unlike past presidents who sought to address underlying issues and reassure the public during times of crisis, Trump has chosen to inflame tensions and escalate conflict. The president's actions are seen as a political move to target California and his political nemesis, Governor Gavin Newsom, while using immigration as a central issue. This approach deviates from the historical precedent of presidents acting as consoler-in-chief during times of domestic turmoil.</p>

He noted that China “already has the world’s largest navy, and this battle force is expected to grow to 435 ships by 2030. China is also building up its nuclear arsenal, and it aims to have more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads also by 2030. The PLA navy is the world’s largest, with 234 warships to the US Navy’s 219, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
