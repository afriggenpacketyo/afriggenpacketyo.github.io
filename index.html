          <p>Ahead of a US-Russia summit in Alaska, 26 of 27 EU leaders have publicly appealed to President Donald Trump to ensure Ukraine's right to self-determination is upheld in any peace negotiations. The appeal, which Hungary's Viktor Orban did not sign, expresses concern over recent statements by Trump suggesting both sides would need to cede territory. European leaders fear being sidelined in talks that could reward Russian aggression and compromise continental security, especially as Kyiv reports minor military advances in the Sumy region.</p>

          <p>The US and China have extended their trade truce, suspending planned tariff hikes for another 90 days until November 10. Under the agreement, the US will maintain its 30% tariff on Chinese imports, while China will keep a 10% tariff on American goods, avoiding a significant escalation. The extension provides more time for negotiations on trade imbalances, market access for US exporters, and national security issues like semiconductor sales. Despite the pause, some US business owners express frustration over the prolonged uncertainty impacting their ability to plan for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level in over two years, while also downgrading the country's annual economic growth forecast to 1.7%. The RBA cited a substantial drop in inflation and weaker-than-expected public demand as key factors for the decision. While the bank noted that the risk of a major trade war has diminished, it attributed the lower GDP outlook primarily to reduced productivity growth rather than trade disruptions.

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along 1,500km of Western Australia's coast have experienced their worst-ever bleaching event due to an unprecedented marine heatwave. The prolonged heat stress has impacted previously resilient areas like the World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Reef and the Rowley Shoals. This event is part of a two-year global coral bleaching crisis driven by record-high ocean temperatures. Experts warn that climate change is causing more frequent and intense bleaching, leaving reefs with insufficient time to recover, threatening their long-term survival.</p>

She discusses the intense political and personal toll of major events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which she says brought her close to a breakdown. The book also delves into her fractured relationship with her predecessor Alex Salmond, the emotional strain of the police investigation into SNP finances, and personal challenges like misogyny and a miscarriage.</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved after the new girlfriend of his killer, Alexander McKellar, led police to his shallow grave. After McKellar confessed to the 2017 hit-and-run, Dr. Caroline Muirhead was taken to the burial site, where she secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker. She later contacted authorities, enabling them to recover Parsons' body from the remote estate in Argyll, Scotland. The victim's family expressed immense gratitude for her quick thinking, which was crucial in bringing them answers and justice.</p>

          <p>Spain is taking a notably independent foreign policy path, creating tensions with the Trump administration by rejecting US aircraft purchases and resisting pressure to meet NATO's new defense spending targets. The Spanish government, led by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, has also pursued closer economic ties with China, including awarding a contract to Huawei. Analysts suggest Spain's position as an EU member shields it from direct retaliatory tariffs, allowing it to antagonize President Trump more openly than many other nations, a move some see as a high-stakes gamble.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The move comes shortly after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, blaming her for a weak July jobs report and making unsubstantiated claims of data manipulation. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has defended Trump's economic policies. The nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, has raised concerns among some economists about the potential politicization of the independent statistical agency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost tourism, Nepal has announced it will waive climbing fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years. The selected mountains are located in the country's poorer and less-developed western provinces, which see very few visitors despite their natural beauty. This initiative contrasts with a recent decision to increase the permit fee for Mount Everest to $15,000 during peak season, its first hike in nearly a decade. The move aims to decentralize mountaineering revenue and highlight unexplored destinations within the country.</p>

          <p>Two armed suspects led authorities on a chaotic two-hour pursuit from Lancaster to downtown Los Angeles, managing to escape after a series of brazen crimes. The chase began with the carjacking of a pickup truck, followed by the theft of a big-rig, which the suspects drove the wrong way on the 10 Freeway. After abandoning the semi-truck, they carjacked a third vehicle before finally fleeing on foot. Authorities recovered a loaded firearm from the first stolen vehicle and believe other suspects may have assisted in the escape.</p>

According to the FBI report, the whistleblower, who was interviewed as recently as 2023, called the alleged plan "treasonous" and "illegal" and claimed to have personally attended the meeting where Schiff greenlit the leak.</p>

          <p>The city of Huntington Park, California, a predominantly Latino community, is experiencing significant disruption due to fear of increased raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). A local council member described the once-vibrant main commercial street as a "ghost town," with businesses locking their doors during operating hours to protect customers. This climate of fear is having a tangible economic impact, as residents stay home, leading to lower sales tax revenue and fewer resources for community services in a city where a large portion of the population is undocumented.</p>

The post-conviction effort to overturn the case, initiated by the new U.S. Attorney, was described by the judge as "contrary to the public interest" and an attempt to subvert the court's prior sentencing decision, bringing a close to the controversial case.</p>
