          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, has been brought back to the United States to face charges of illegally transporting migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts related to a conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants within the U.S. over nearly a decade. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked the Salvadoran president for agreeing to return him, stating that upon conviction, he will be deported after serving his sentence. Abrego Garcia's attorney claims the government played games and is fighting to ensure due process rights are protected, emphasizing the power to bring him back existed all along.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota softball player, M.S., is part of a federal lawsuit challenging the state's policy allowing trans-identifying male athletes to compete in girls' sports. M.S. left her club team after learning she would have to compete against a male teammate for pitching time. The lawsuit, filed by Alliance Defending Freedom on behalf of Female Athletes United, argues that Minnesota's gender-identity-based eligibility rules violate Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in education and athletics. The suit contends that the policy harms girls by creating safety risks and denying them equal opportunities to advance and experience victory.</p>

          <p>Fresh US sanctions are set to curb the ICC's capacity to operate, with a Slovenian judge on the blacklist, which has led to mounting calls for the EU to activate laws to block the sanctions. The move is the latest in a series of diplomatic assaults on the ICC ostensibly aimed at curtailing the court's credibility and ability to function. While the EU has long defended the court as the "cornerstone of international justice," its member states' mixed response to ICC rulings in recent months has exposed cracks in the world's main mechanism for international criminal justice, and its capacity to act. Slovenia and Belgium are leading a call for the bloc's executive to activate the same laws against the newest US sanctions against the ICC.</p>

          <p>DocuSign's stock experienced a significant drop after the company reported stronger-than-expected earnings but lowered its full-year billings outlook. While the company's earnings per share and revenue exceeded analyst expectations, billings for the fiscal first quarter fell short of both analyst predictions and the company's own forecast. For the current fiscal year, DocuSign expects billings of $3.28 billion to $3.34 billion, which is lower than the previously projected range of $3.3 billion to $3.35 billion.</p>
