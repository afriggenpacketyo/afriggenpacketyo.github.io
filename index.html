          <h2>England Planning Reform Aims to Facilitate Heat Pump Installation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 19:11:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is easing planning restrictions to promote the installation of heat pumps, a key part of its Warm Homes Plan. A previous rule requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property has been lifted, potentially benefiting millions of homes in England. While the industry welcomes the change, consumer groups note that the high upfront costs and potential need for insulation upgrades remain significant barriers, particularly for renters and those in older properties. The government hopes the changes will help lower household bills and reduce planet-warming emissions, but challenges persist in making heat pumps accessible to all.</p>

          <p>Conservative insiders are expressing concern about the leadership of Kemi Badenoch, with some describing her tenure as a 'total disaster' for the party. The comments follow poor local election results and a surge in support for Reform UK. Badenoch's strategy of delaying policy decisions and launching reviews is being criticized as allowing Reform UK to become the de facto opposition. Frustrations also stem from budget constraints and staff reductions at Conservative Campaign Headquarters, though some defend Badenoch, citing her difficult inheritance and the party's low polling numbers.</p>

This decision follows pressure from residents and the Trump administration, with the Department of Justice launching an investigation into the CIF and California's Attorney General.

          <p>Two men have been sentenced for their role in the deaths of an Indian family who froze to death while attempting to cross from Canada into the US. Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel received just over 10 years in prison, while Steve Anthony Shand was sentenced to six-and-a-half years. The family, including two young children, died in a blizzard while being smuggled across the border. The case highlights the dangers faced by migrants and the callousness of human traffickers.</p>
