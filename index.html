            <p>ASML, a Dutch semiconductor equipment firm, reported net bookings below expectations, signaling a possible demand slowdown. CEO Christophe Fouquet noted strong AI-driven demand but cited customer uncertainty due to potential tariffs. ASML anticipates 2025 revenue between 30 billion and 35 billion euros, while global chip stocks have been volatile due to tariff concerns. The U.S. Commerce Department is also investigating semiconductor technology imports for national security implications. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.K. Supreme Court is set to rule on a legal challenge concerning the definition of a woman, specifically whether a transgender person with a gender recognition certificate can be legally considered a woman under equality laws. The case stems from a 2018 Scottish law mandating 50% female representation on public boards, which included transgender women in its definition of women. The ruling could have U.K.-wide consequences for sex-based rights and single-sex services, with arguments focusing on biological sex versus gender identity.</p>
