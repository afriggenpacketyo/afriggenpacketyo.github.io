          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a new trade deal, narrowly avoiding a looming tariff deadline. The agreement establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments. Both President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the agreement as a significant achievement that will enhance stability for businesses.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the European Union, setting a 15% tariff on most EU goods, which is lower than the 30% he had previously threatened. The deal also reportedly includes commitments from the EU to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and invest an additional $600 billion. In a separate and distinct comment to reporters following the announcement, Trump addressed the humanitarian situation in Gaza, blaming Hamas for food shortages and stating that the U.S. would provide more aid but wants other countries to contribute as well. This article uniquely combines the major trade news with the president's foreign policy remarks on the Middle East.</p>

This approach is viewed by critics, including some Republicans, as an unconstitutional infringement on Congress's power of the purse.

          <p>An analysis by Ezra Klein suggests that the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein scandal poses a unique political dilemma for Donald Trump. Having built his political brand on railing against a corrupt "deep state" that covers up its crimes, Trump now presides over that very state and its secrets, yet has not fully released all related files. This creates a paradox where any deflection or attempt to distract from his own past association with Epstein only deepens suspicion among a public already primed to believe in conspiracies. The article argues that Trump is now caught in the web of the same anti-establishment narrative he successfully used to gain power.</p>

It suggests that by framing these prosecutions as political witch hunts, the administration is creating a new global order where corruption is tolerated.

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is celebrating a major box office success as two of its films, "Superman" and the Apple-produced "F1," have both crossed the $500 million mark in global ticket sales. The achievement is a significant victory for the studio's DC division, as "Superman" is the first major release under the new leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran. For Apple, the success of "F1" solidifies its position as a serious player in theatrical distribution, far surpassing the box office performance of its previous film releases. The strong performance of both movies highlights a successful summer for the studio.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna are continuing their bipartisan effort to force a House vote on the release of all Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Massie stated that their goal extends beyond any single document, seeking comprehensive financial records from Epstein's estate and details of his controversial plea bargain. Their joint legislation aims to mandate the release with the force of law, while including protections to redact the names of victims. The push for transparency comes amid public pressure and questions surrounding the full extent of Epstein's network of powerful associates.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he would have "great pause" about President Trump granting a pardon or commutation to Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. Johnson called her crimes "unforgivable" but ultimately deferred to the president's authority on the matter. His comments highlight a split within the Republican party, as Representative Thomas Massie suggested a pardon should be considered if it compelled Maxwell to provide more information about Jeffrey Epstein's criminal network. The debate underscores the complex political challenges the Epstein scandal continues to pose for the Republican party and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party would seek to ban all NHS doctors from taking strike action if they win the next election. The proposal would introduce legislation for minimum service levels, placing doctors under the same restrictive industrial action rules as police and military personnel. The announcement comes as thousands of resident doctors began a five-day strike over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) called the proposal a "desperate intervention," defending the right to strike as a last resort and arguing that doctors' pay has declined by a fifth in real terms since 2008.</p>

          <p>A growing cybersecurity threat known as "quishing" is exploiting the public's reliance on QR codes to steal personal information and install malware. Hackers are placing malicious QR code stickers on everyday items like parking meters and flyers, tricking people in a hurry into scanning them and visiting fraudulent websites. Security experts note that these scams are increasing as traditional email phishing becomes more difficult to execute. The Federal Trade Commission and various state agencies have issued warnings, advising the public to be cautious and avoid scanning unexpected or suspicious QR codes, which are difficult to verify visually.</p>

The acceptance of such a gift from a foreign state has raised constitutional questions regarding the Emoluments Clause, prompting calls for an investigation.
