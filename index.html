          <p>China has sent three astronauts to its Tiangong space station for a six-month mission, replacing the current crew and continuing its ambitious space program. The astronauts, led by veteran Chen Dong, will conduct experiments, perform maintenance, and install protective equipment against space debris, which poses an increasing threat to space activities. China aims to become a leading space power, with plans for a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030 and exploration of Mars, investing billions in its space program. Due to restrictions imposed by the US, China is seeking space partners elsewhere, including Pakistan. </p>

          <p>A program called ROMEO (Retired Older Men Eating Out) in Harpswell, Maine, is tackling the issue of social isolation among older men by providing monthly lunches and social activities. Recognizing that men are less likely to seek help or admit to loneliness, the program offers a casual and non-threatening environment for them to connect with others. The lunches feature speakers and activities, and the initiative has seen growing attendance, encouraging older men to become healthier and less isolated through human connection. This program addresses a critical need, as men over 75 have the highest suicide rates in the U.S., often due to loss, sickness, and social isolation.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twelve states, primarily led by Democratic attorneys general, has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging his authority to unilaterally impose tariffs. The states argue that the power to legislate tariffs rests solely with Congress, and the Trump administration's actions reflect a national trade policy based on the president's whims rather than lawful authority. This lawsuit follows a similar action taken by California, which also accuses the administration of escalating a trade war that is causing significant harm to the state's economy.</p>

They have been supporting families who believe social media played a role in their children's deaths and are calling for tech companies to share information from those children's phones with parents.

          <p>Existing home sales in March fell by 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.02 million units, marking the slowest March sales pace since 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors. Higher mortgage rates and broader economic concerns are contributing to a weak start to the spring housing market. Despite a sharp increase in available listings, affordability challenges are putting a chill on prices, with the median price of an existing home sold in March rising only 2.7% year-over-year, the smallest gain since August.

The 13-year-old daughter, Jade, and her parents, Jason and Gabriela, describe the traumatic experience of being separated from their belongings and held in a detention center. Human rights groups and pediatricians have criticized such facilities as inherently harmful to children, citing potential for psychological trauma and long-term mental health risks.

          <p>China is struggling to navigate the shifting landscape of U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration, particularly amid ongoing trade tensions and conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Despite its ambitions to play a larger geopolitical role, China is expected to maintain its traditional approach of remaining on the sidelines, reacting to events, and capitalizing on opportunities when the U.S. falters. Analysts believe Beijing is unlikely to take a leading role in negotiating peace terms in either conflict, instead focusing on securing reconstruction contracts once ceasefires are established.</p>
