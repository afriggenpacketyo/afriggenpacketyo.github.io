          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to levy a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to begin on August 1. The announcement, made in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, cites Canada's alleged failure to curb fentanyl trafficking and its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products. This represents a significant escalation from previous duties and could affect the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. The move is part of a broader strategy of imposing higher tariffs on numerous U.S. trading partners to address trade imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has undertaken a significant environmental project by demolishing around 300 dams and closing hydropower stations along the Red River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. The initiative aims to restore the natural habitat for rare and endemic fish species, which have been severely impacted by decades of dam construction. These structures blocked migratory routes and altered water flows, sometimes causing sections of the river to dry up. This action is part of a broader effort to address ecological damage and preserve biodiversity in the region's vital waterways.</p>

          <p>A tense confrontation occurred in Ventura County, California, as U.S. Border Patrol agents executed a warrant at a marijuana facility, leading to clashes with protesters. Agents used tear gas and less-lethal rounds to control the crowd, which was attempting to block their access to the farm. The Department of Homeland Security stated the operation was a law enforcement action, while California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned it as an inhumane raid. Authorities reported that several people were hospitalized and that 10 undocumented juveniles were discovered at the site, prompting a child labor investigation.</p>

          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player via social media. The player, widely reported to be American star Montrezl Harrell of the Adelaide 36ers, received the abuse following a match in November 2024. The man was charged with using a carriage service to menace or harass and has been released on bail. Basketball Australia hailed the arrest as a "landmark moment" in the fight against online abuse, emphasizing a zero-tolerance policy to ensure a safe and respectful environment in sports.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin significant layoffs, aiming to reduce its domestic workforce by about 15%, which amounts to nearly 1,800 positions. The move is part of a broader Trump administration plan to reorganize and streamline the department by consolidating offices and focusing on diplomatic priorities. The reductions will be achieved through a combination of layoffs and voluntary departures. Critics, including the American Foreign Service Association and Democratic lawmakers, have expressed concern that these cuts could undermine American diplomatic efforts and demoralize the workforce.</p>

          <p>A report by the UK's National Audit Office (NAO) has criticized the country's F-35 stealth jet program, highlighting significant delays, infrastructure gaps, and personnel shortages that are undermining warfighting capability. While acknowledging the F-35's superiority, the NAO noted a "disappointing return" on the £11 billion spent so far and estimated the total project cost could be three times the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) forecast. The MoD responded by stating the program is within budget and that two full squadrons will be deployable by year's end, but key weapons capabilities have been delayed until the 2030s.</p>

While second-quarter growth is expected to meet the 5% target, concerns remain about underlying weaknesses in domestic demand and employment. Economists argue that the headline figure could mask these structural issues and that stronger government support is needed to navigate rising trade uncertainties. The debate centers on whether proactive fiscal policy is required to ensure the full-year growth target is achieved amid significant challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a rapid increase in the market share of electric heavy trucks, a trend that is significantly reducing the country's diesel consumption and impacting oil demand. Driven by government subsidies and an expanding charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged by 175% in the first half of the year. This boom, primarily in short-haul vehicles for industrial use, has led analysts to revise diesel demand forecasts downward and accelerate predictions for when China's oil consumption will peak.

President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance, attributing its 47% rise to his administration's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, a move he explicitly linked to the country's prosecution of its former right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro. In a letter to Brazil's current president, Trump called the trial a "Witch Hunt" and cited "insidious attacks on Free Elections" as justification for the levy. The administration is invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the same authority used for other recent tariffs that is currently facing a legal challenge. Critics argue this is an abuse of power, noting the U.S. actually runs a trade surplus with Brazil. (not investment advice)</p>

The plaintiff, Lauren Pisciotta, claims that during her employment, the rapper forced her to perform oral sex, sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions, and engaged in sexual acts with other employees in the office. The amended complaint also details alleged stalking behavior and a "swatting" incident at her home after her initial lawsuit was filed in 2024. The lawsuit paints a disturbing picture of the workplace culture at Ye's company, Yeezy.</p>

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris have started turning again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds in April 2024. The iconic nightclub celebrated the occasion with a street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display. The original blades collapsed due to a failure in the central axis, but new aluminum sails were installed in time for the Paris Olympics. However, delays in acquiring a new electric motor, which also powers the landmark's lights, kept them motionless until now. The restoration returns a beloved symbol to the Parisian skyline.</p>

The 31-year-old singer pleaded guilty in June to the special quasi-sexual assault of an intoxicated woman in 2024. Two other men involved in the assault received the same sentence. The court ordered the men to complete a sexual violence treatment program. Taeil was removed from the popular music group in August 2024 after his agency, SM Entertainment, confirmed he was under investigation for a sex crime.</p>

          <p>A political strategist claims to have identified a formula for effective campaign slogans by analyzing 20,000 messages from around the world. The analysis revealed eight words that consistently resonate with voters: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. These words act as "emotional shortcuts," though they don't guarantee victory on their own. While famous bespoke slogans like "Get Brexit Done" exist, the most effective ones often use these building blocks. The article also notes that the future of slogans may be changing due to AI, which allows for micro-targeted messaging tailored to individual voters.</p>

The author, Ed Husic, shares the story of a Srebrenica survivor and questions the recurring cycle of witnessing atrocities, acting too late, and then declaring "never again." The piece highlights the international community's failure to prevent genocides in places like Rwanda and Bosnia. It challenges readers to consider when the world will move beyond being inert spectators and apply the lesson of "never again" to the ongoing suffering of civilians in Gaza.</p>

This move follows Tesla's recent pilot program launch in Austin, Texas, where supervised Robotaxis have encountered some issues, including a minor accident. The expansion effort is part of Elon Musk's push to catch up in the autonomous vehicle race, relying on a camera-based system that differs from the sensor-heavy approach of rivals.</p>

          <p>An analysis of UK weather patterns explores whether the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves are a sign of climate change or simply a feature of summer. The article notes that 2025 has already seen a record-warm spring and the warmest June on record for England, with multiple heatwaves occurring before mid-July. Scientists state that human-influenced global warming of over 1.3°C has made heatwaves significantly hotter and more common than in the past, such as the famed 1976 heatwave. Projections indicate this trend will continue, making extreme heat a more regular part of UK summers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel for their roles in what an internal report called an "operational failure" during the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in July 2024. The incident in Butler, Pennsylvania, saw a gunman fire at Trump, grazing his ear and killing a rally attendee. The suspended staff received penalties of 10 to 42 days of unpaid leave. The agency acknowledged its accountability and stated it is implementing reforms, including improved technology and clearer lines of command, to ensure such a failure does not happen again.

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at an accelerating rate, outpacing the general trend of global warming. This means that even small increases in the planet's average temperature can lead to a disproportionately higher risk of longer, more dangerous heat waves. The study, published in Nature Geoscience, found that the longest and rarest heat events are changing the fastest, posing significant threats to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure. The researchers warn that adaptation strategies must accelerate to keep pace with these rapidly escalating risks, especially in tropical regions.</p>

          <p>A new report from the United Nations Aids Agency (UNAIDS) warns that decades of progress in combating HIV/AIDS are at risk due to sharp funding cuts, particularly from the United States. The sudden withdrawal of most U.S. funding for the PEPFAR program has left the agency with a nearly 50% shortfall, threatening treatment and research efforts worldwide. UNAIDS estimates that without this funding, there could be an additional six million new infections and four million AIDS-related deaths in the next four years. The cuts are already impacting countries like South Africa, which has the world's largest HIV-positive population.</p>
