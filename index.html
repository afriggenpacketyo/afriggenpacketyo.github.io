          <p>President Donald Trump has inaugurated a "Presidential Walk of Fame" on the White House exterior, controversially featuring an autopen photo instead of a traditional portrait of Joe Biden. This action is the latest in Trump's consistent efforts to delegitimize his predecessor, frequently belittling him and falsely claiming the 2020 election was due to voter fraud. Trump's allegations, made without evidence, suggest Biden administration officials might have forged signatures, a claim under investigation by a Republican-led House committee, despite other presidents also using autopen devices. This display is part of broader design changes Trump has implemented at the White House since resuming office, including significant renovations to the Oval Office and Rose Garden.</p>

          <p>A colossal sinkhole has opened on a major road in Bangkok, causing significant traffic disruption, damaging infrastructure, and necessitating evacuations in the surrounding vicinity. Although no casualties were reported, three vehicles sustained damage, and officials, including regional Governor Chadchart Sittipunt, suspect ongoing construction work at an underground train station as the cause. Videos depict the road slowly collapsing, pulling down electricity poles and severing the four-lane thoroughfare, exposing the underground structure of a nearby police station. Emergency crews are working diligently to repair the roughly 160-foot-deep hole as quickly as possible, expressing concerns that heavy rain during Bangkok's current rainy season could exacerbate the damage.</p>

          <p>Denmark's Defense Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, has officially categorized the recent drone incursions witnessed over several Danish airports as a "hybrid attack." Poulsen asserted that these incidents were likely orchestrated by a highly professional actor, suggesting a sophisticated and potentially state-sponsored operation rather than isolated rogue activity. This designation carries significant implications for national security, highlighting the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to advanced and unconventional threats. The Danish government is now facing serious security challenges, necessitating thorough investigations into the precise origins and responsible parties behind these concerning aerial intrusions.</p>

This unprecedented situation has raised fears that many smaller suppliers, heavily dependent on JLR's business, could face bankruptcy without intervention. Potential solutions include the government buying and stockpiling component parts to keep these businesses viable, or providing government-backed loans, though the latter is less popular with suppliers. This move would be a landmark instance of government aid in response to a cyber-attack, underscoring the severe economic disruption and national security concerns posed by such incidents, which have also affected other major UK institutions like Co-op and Marks & Spencer.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has publicly stated that numerous Labour MPs have privately urged him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the role of prime minister. Despite not currently holding a parliamentary seat and denying active "plotting" for a return to Westminster, Burnham conspicuously refrained from ruling out a future leadership bid. These remarks surface just before Labour's autumn conference, amidst existing internal party tensions exacerbated by recent high-profile resignations and dismissals. While critics point to his two previous unsuccessful leadership campaigns, Burnham's assertion of a "climate of fear" among some MPs suggests a significant undercurrent of dissatisfaction within the party, potentially signaling future political instability.</p>

          <p>Blaine Milam, 35, faces execution in Texas for the December 2008 murder of Amora Carson, his girlfriend's 13-month-old daughter, during what the couple described as an "exorcism." Prosecutors presented evidence that Milam savagely beat, bit, strangled, and mutilated the child over 30 hours, causing numerous potentially fatal injuries, including multiple skull fractures and broken bones. Milam has consistently claimed innocence, blaming his then-girlfriend and arguing his conviction relied on "now-discredited" bite mark evidence, unreliable DNA, and that he is intellectually disabled. Despite multiple appeals to higher courts and a request to commute his sentence, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles denied clemency, citing other evidence and previous rejections of his disability claims.</p>

          <p>The Co-op has announced that a severe cyber-attack it suffered earlier this year cost the retailer at least £206 million in lost revenues, profoundly impacting its financial stability. The infiltration of its IT networks in April led to extensive disruptions, including payment problems, widespread shortages of goods across its shops, and the compromise of data belonging to all 6.5 million member customers. This "malicious" attack was a key factor in the reported £75 million underlying pre-tax loss for the first half of 2025, a stark contrast to the previous year's profit. The incident highlights the critical and costly vulnerabilities businesses face from cyber threats, prompting the Co-op to focus on robust recovery and future resilience.</p>

          <p>Thousands of disabled children across the UK are confronting a "national crisis" as they endure extensive waits for vital wheelchairs, exacerbated by a rise in NHS rejections for specialist equipment due to cost concerns. Whizz Kids, the country's primary charity for specialist wheelchair services, has been compelled to close its doors to new referrals for the first time in over three decades, experiencing a 12.5% annual increase in demand. This systemic failure means many children, including eight-year-old Charlie Drinkwater, are denied appropriate chairs and offered unsuitable alternatives, leading to significant discomfort, pain, and a profound loss of independence during critical developmental years. Charities are now launching urgent appeals for funding to alleviate the escalating waiting lists and address this pressing social issue.</p>

Sarkozy, who served from 2007 to 2012, stands accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions from the late Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, allegedly facilitated by Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine. Takieddine, the key accuser who recently passed away, had claimed to have delivered €5 million in cash to Sarkozy's chief of staff between 2006 and 2007, purportedly in exchange for efforts to rehabilitate Gadhafi's international image. This trial, characterized by a series of twists and turns including Takieddine's conflicting testimonies, marks the latest in several corruption cases against the former French president.</p>

          <p>The Australian horror film "Together," starring Dave Franco and Alison Brie, has sparked controversy in China after advance screenings revealed digital alterations to change a same-sex couple to a heterosexual one. Viewers noticed modifications, including added steam to obscure nudity and a man's face replaced by a woman's in a key scene, along with removed references to the gay relationship. This use of what appears to be AI-generated alterations, amid China's strict censorship of LGBTQ+ content, drew significant backlash from moviegoers. The film's global distributor, Neon, condemned the "unauthorized edit" and demanded a halt to its distribution, highlighting growing concerns over content distortion.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers significantly reduced their magic number to just one, bringing them to the cusp of another National League West division championship, with a resilient 5-4 extra-innings victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game highlighted the team's adaptive strategies, notably featuring starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw in unexpected but effective relief roles, addressing the bullpen's recent inconsistencies. Sasaki, making his first major league appearance since an early May shoulder injury, flashed promising signs with a scoreless seventh inning, while Kershaw, in his first relief outing since 2019, calmly navigated the ninth. Tommy Edman's decisive RBI single in the 11th inning secured the hard-fought win, underscoring the team's improvisation and determination as they fine-tune their approach for the upcoming postseason.</p>

They stressed the importance of a consistent approach to bank regulation, capitalization, and taxation to maintain London's global competitiveness. The calls come as the Finance Minister faces pressure to address a £62 billion budgetary deficit, leading to speculation over further tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

This situation highlights the challenges police and councils face in tackling persistent youth crime, as current measures like "respect orders" may not apply to younger offenders.

Egyptian and Iraqi officials have proposed collective security approaches, and the GCC members agreed to activate a joint defense provision similar to NATO's Article 5.
