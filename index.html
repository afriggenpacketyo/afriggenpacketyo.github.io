          <h2>China's Support for Iran Tempered by Limited Influence Amidst US-Iran Conflict</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the United States launched strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, marking its entry into the conflict between Israel and Iran, China's support for Tehran remains steadfast but restrained. Beijing's economic interests are primarily tied to its access to Iranian oil and the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial trade route for global crude oil flows. China's limited influence over Israel and its strategic calculus regarding Washington's intervention will likely keep it from direct involvement. China's economic partnership with Iran, including a 25-year strategic agreement, is motivated by access to Iranian oil and a desire to counter U.S. influence, but its actions will be carefully weighed to avoid escalating tensions or harming its own interests. The situation is complex, and China's role will be defined by its need to balance its allegiances with its own strategic priorities.</p>

          <p>Travis Hunter, the Jaguars' No. 2 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, has secured a fully guaranteed four-year, $46.65 million rookie deal. The Jaguars uniquely announced the deal twice, once listing Hunter as a defensive back and again as a wide receiver, confirming their intent to utilize his talents on both sides of the ball. Hunter's contract includes a $30.57 million signing bonus paid entirely upfront, a first for a non-quarterback drafted outside the top spot. The Jaguars, led by new GM James Gladstone, are showing their confidence in Hunter as a potentially franchise-altering player, aiming to return to the playoffs after missing out for the past two seasons.</p>

          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy has called on Iran to de-escalate tensions and return to negotiations following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Lammy cautioned Iran against retaliating by attacking U.S. bases or blockading the Strait of Hormuz, warning of "catastrophic consequences." Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the UK's non-involvement in the U.S. strikes while stressing the need for de-escalation to protect the UK economy from energy price increases. The IAEA is demanding access to Iran's enriched uranium stockpiles, and the UK government faces difficult trade-offs between preventing a nuclear-armed Iran and supporting Washington's military actions.</p>

          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil transit chokepoint, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Experts say that this action risks alienating neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. The decision now rests with Iran's national security council, but a closure could lead to higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions. While the Joint Maritime Information Center reports no current threats to commercial shipping, the potential disruption to global oil supplies remains a concern.</p>

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethical implications of students using AI to generate writing, questioning the value of enforcing institutional rules that students don't take seriously. The real value of a humanities education lies in the formation of human persons, not merely the creation of products. The rise of AI challenges the utilitarian vision for the humanities, removing cognitive friction from education. The author suggests adding friction back in by prompting students to reflect on how AI changes their thinking and learning process, emphasizing the cultivation of practical wisdom in navigating emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>Amidst escalating tensions, speculation is rising about Iran potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil shipping channel. A blockade would have profound consequences for the global economy, disrupting international trade and driving up oil prices. The strait is vital for oil and gas producers in the Middle East and their customers in Asia, including China, India, and Japan. While Iran has threatened closure in the past, such a move would risk economic suicide, according to U.S. officials.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in the Senate, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” would require asylum seekers to pay a $1,000 fee to seek asylum in the United States, a move criticized as creating two classes of those seeking refuge. The bill would also impose additional fees for work permits and for each year an asylum application remains pending. Critics argue this legislation would make asylum inaccessible for poor people, violating the right to seek asylum regardless of ability to pay. The bill includes funding for increased ICE detention capacity and border security.</p>

          <p>A German lawmaker has criticized the country's top-up benefit system for encouraging low wages, as figures reveal over 800,000 workers rely on state aid despite being employed. These payments cost the German state around €7 billion per year, raising concerns about the exploitation of laborers. The government has agreed to target a €15 minimum wage by 2026 in an effort to address the issue. The current system is seen as maintaining low wages rather than investing in social programs that could help people escape part-time employment.</p>
