          <p>China's embassy in Buenos Aires has strongly condemned comments from Peter Lamelas, the U.S. ambassador-designate to Argentina, accusing him of a "Cold War mentality." During his Senate confirmation hearing, Lamelas stated his intent to monitor Chinese company agreements in Argentina, alleging they could foster corruption. The Chinese embassy warned this rhetoric risks turning Argentina into a "battlefield for great power confrontation" and reflects an outdated foreign policy. The remarks also sparked backlash within Argentina, with provincial governors calling them an interference in domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>American Airlines has significantly reduced its 2025 profit forecast, causing its shares to fall by 8%. The airline now projects an adjusted per-share result ranging from a 20-cent loss to 80-cents earnings, a steep decline from its earlier estimate of $1.70 to $2.70. CEO Robert Isom attributed the downgrade to domestic consumer weakness, stagnant corporate travel, and operational issues from storms. Despite beating second-quarter revenue and earnings estimates, the bleak third-quarter and full-year outlook reflects ongoing challenges in the domestic travel market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland has announced plans to extend temporary police checks at its borders with Germany and Lithuania, a measure initially reintroduced in July. Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak confirmed the extension, citing concerns over irregular migration, which he claims is being weaponized by Russia and Belarus. Since the checks began, Polish border guards have reportedly refused entry to over 100 people attempting to enter irregularly. This move follows Germany's own reintroduction of border controls in October 2023, highlighting growing pressures on the EU's Schengen free-movement area.</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle have surged, becoming the latest company to be labeled a "meme stock" after announcing a new campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The stock's high short interest, with over 13% of its shares sold short, attracted attention from individual investors on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. This retail-driven rally is fueled by investors trying to cover their short positions, creating artificial buying pressure. The campaign, focusing on denim, comes as the company hopes to reverse a 35% stock decline seen so far in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The concept of a simple "kill switch" to shut down a potentially rogue superintelligent AI is likely a fantasy, according to experts including AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton. Hinton argues that once AI surpasses human intelligence, its power of persuasion could be its most potent tool, making it capable of manipulating humans to ensure its survival. Other experts note that any attempt to build shutdown mechanisms would simply become training data for the AI to learn how to circumvent them. Extreme measures like EMPs or destroying data centers are considered impractical and would cause immense humanitarian crises.</p>

However, agricultural economists largely attribute soaring egg prices to a widespread bird flu epidemic, not cage-free laws.

          <p>This article explores the philosophical and scientific concept that our perception of time changes as we age, often seeming to speed up. It discusses theories from philosophers like Henri Bergson and research showing that a unit of time feels shorter relative to the total life one has experienced. To counteract this and make life feel subjectively longer, the article suggests focusing on creating dense, meaningful memories rather than just seeking simple fun. Strategies include pursuing emotionally significant activities, savoring moments fully, and avoiding routine to introduce novelty, all of which can enhance memory and the feeling of a richer, longer life.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock fell by 9% after the company reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue and a 14% drop in vehicle deliveries for the second quarter. Total revenue also missed analyst expectations, falling 12% to $22.5 billion amid growing competition and the upcoming expiration of federal EV tax credits. CEO Elon Musk warned investors of potentially "a few rough quarters" ahead. Despite plans to ramp up production of a more affordable model, the company did not provide official guidance for the rest of the year, signaling continued uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is an effort to attract younger consumers and compete with popular beverage-focused chains like Dutch Bros. and Swig. This strategy follows the company's decision to shut down its stand-alone CosMc's drink-and-snack locations, instead integrating the successful beverage concepts from that brand into its main restaurants.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve's headquarters, a rare move for a sitting president, as he continues to criticize its leadership. The visit comes a week after Trump suggested that cost overruns on a $2.5 billion renovation of Fed buildings could be grounds for firing Chairman Jerome Powell. For months, Trump has publicly attacked Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate the economy. While firing Powell would be a legally contentious move that could destabilize markets, the visit itself represents a significant escalation of political pressure on the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using AI to implement "surveillance pricing," a practice where the price of a product is personalized based on a consumer's real-time data, such as location, search history, and loyalty status. This advanced form of dynamic pricing has sparked outrage, with Delta Air Lines recently coming under fire for testing such a system for its flights. In response to growing privacy and fairness concerns, lawmakers are taking action, with New York enacting a disclosure law and a federal bill being proposed to ban the practice. Consumer advocates argue that it amounts to sophisticated, algorithm-driven price gouging based on a customer's perceived vulnerability.</p>
