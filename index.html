          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed a United Nations working group that the United States is legally responsible for over 200 migrants sent to the CECOT mega-prison. This declaration contradicts the Trump administration's claims that it cannot intervene because the individuals are under Salvadoran authority. El Salvador's report states it merely provided prison infrastructure as part of a bilateral agreement, while legal jurisdiction remains with the U.S. The ACLU, representing the migrants, argues this confirms the U.S. controls the fate of these individuals who were deported with limited due process.</p>

          <p>A mother and her two young sons have shared their story of survival after being caught in the deadly Texas floods at a summer camp near the Guadalupe River. One of the boys, aged seven, had to climb to the rafters of his cabin to escape the rapidly rising water. Their mother, Keli Rabon, described the immense relief of their reunion, which was tempered by a sense of "survivor's guilt" knowing many other families were still searching for their children. The family's account highlights the personal trauma experienced by survivors of the widespread natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 104 fatalities, with dozens of people, including summer campers, still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, overwhelming communities and causing extensive damage, particularly in Kerr County where a girls' summer camp was severely impacted. The event has prompted a major disaster declaration, mobilizing extensive search and rescue operations involving state and federal agencies. Officials are now facing questions about the effectiveness and timeliness of the emergency warnings issued to residents.</p>

However, the analysis also points out potential weaknesses, as they have conceded goals in moments of vulnerability. While formidable, rivals may find hope in exploiting these defensive lapses as the tournament progresses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California, along with a coalition of 17 other states, has filed a legal challenge against recent immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles. The lawsuit argues that masked federal agents have been conducting "suspicionless" stops, violating constitutional rights and creating a climate of fear that disrupts communities and public safety. The states are seeking a temporary restraining order to halt these operations, which they describe as part of a "cruel" pattern of targeting immigrant communities. This action adds significant weight to an existing lawsuit filed by advocacy groups and detained individuals.</p>

          <p>Kelly Osbourne is engaged to Sid Wilson, the DJ for the band Slipknot, after he proposed backstage at her father Ozzy Osbourne's final concert. A video of the moment captures Ozzy jokingly telling Wilson "you're not marrying my daughter" before Wilson got down on one knee to ask a visibly shocked Kelly to marry him. The couple, who have known each other for over two decades, welcomed their first child together in late 2022. Their relationship developed from a long-standing friendship that began when Slipknot toured as part of the Osbourne family's Ozzfest.</p>

          <p>A recent error with the electronic line-calling system at Wimbledon has renewed the debate about the role and reliability of technology in officiating sports. The incident, where the system failed to make a call on a crucial point because it was accidentally switched off, highlights the tension between human and machine judgment. While technology like Hawk-Eye is demonstrably more accurate than the human eye, its failures can undermine trust. The article explores the broader psychological reasons for our skepticism, including our innate sense of fairness and the desire for human context in decision-making.</p>

The attorney stated that the victory was seen by other incarcerated men as a rare instance of someone successfully challenging the government. While Combs was acquitted of the most serious charges, he remains jailed after being convicted on lesser prostitution-related offenses. The defense's strategy involved frankly admitting to Combs' abusive behavior and drug problems while arguing it did not constitute trafficking.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Economist suggests that significant funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a key enabler of the administration's mass deportation agenda. The article points to the numerous, ongoing immigration raids in Los Angeles as a prime example of this strategy in action. It describes scenes of masked federal agents targeting public spaces like car washes and street markets to detain individuals. This sustained enforcement activity, backed by a robust budget, is presented as the mechanism making the administration's large-scale deportation goals operationally possible.</p>

          <p>A single block in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is serving as an "urban laboratory" for solutions to combat the urban heat island effect, where dense development traps heat. A local environmental group, GreenRoots, has implemented numerous cooling strategies, including planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with reflective materials, and painting rooftops white. Research shows such green infrastructure can lower peak temperatures significantly, a crucial intervention as climate change intensifies heat waves. The "cool block" initiative provides a potential template for other cities seeking to protect vulnerable neighborhoods from extreme heat.</p>
