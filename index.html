          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that if the U.S. continues AI semiconductor restrictions on China, Huawei will capitalize on its position in the Chinese market. While acknowledging Nvidia's technology is ahead, Huang cautioned that restricting U.S. participation could lead to Huawei dominating China's AI development. He emphasized the importance of global AI developers using American technology and cautioned against unintended consequences of near-term actions on long-term goals. The CEO also mentioned informing the Trump administration about Nvidia's tech and industry dynamics, expressing trust in Trump's plan. Optimism is moderate given the potential shifts in global tech dominance.</p>

          <p>Protests erupted in Nairobi after blogger Albert Ojwang died in police custody, with demonstrators angered by discrepancies between police claims and autopsy results. Police initially claimed Ojwang died from hitting his head, but an autopsy indicated assault as the cause of death, including head injury and neck compression. President Ruto condemned Ojwang's death, acknowledging it occurred "at the hands of the police" and apologizing for implying suicide. Protesters blocked roads demanding accountability, leading to clashes with police and vehicles being set on fire as investigations continue into the circumstances surrounding the blogger's death. The situation is grim given the allegations of police brutality and government response.</p>

CIA Director John Ratcliffe stated this release delivers on Trump's commitment to maximum transparency, allowing the CIA to shed light on information of public interest. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. welcomed the release, emphasizing it as a necessary step toward restoring trust in American government.

          <p>Former New York Jets General Manager Mike Tannenbaum made a "bold prediction" that Aaron Rodgers will be irrelevant by Thanksgiving, suggesting the Steelers will be a non-playoff team. Tannenbaum believes the Steelers are the third-best team in their division and will need to focus on developing Will Howard, their drafted quarterback. Since Ben Roethlisberger's retirement, the Steelers' quarterback situation has been unstable, but the team has remained competitive under coach Mike Tomlin. While Tannenbaum's prediction is pessimistic, the Steelers' proven defense and Tomlin's leadership offer some hope for their season. The outlook is cautiously neutral, pending the Steelers' performance.</p>

Iran condemned the resolution as "political" and announced plans to establish a new uranium enrichment facility and replace centrifuges with more advanced machines. The resolution could complicate talks between Tehran and Washington, with tensions escalating in the Middle East.

          <p>Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island erupted for the 25th time since December, spewing lava fountains reaching heights of over 330 feet. The latest event was preceded by gas-pistoning, causing the lava surface to rise and erupt, with this process occurring up to 10 times an hour. The USGS has set up summit livestream videos, and warns of high levels of volcanic gas affecting downwind areas. Additional hazards include Pele's hair and other volcanic fragments falling near the eruptive vents. The situation is moderately concerning, given the ongoing volcanic activity and potential hazards.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education planned for the Treasury Department to take over managing the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio, according to recent court documents. The agreement involved moving nine Education Dept. employees to Treasury to discuss collections activities. However, these plans are now on hold after a U.S. District Judge blocked the Trump administration from dismantling the Education Department. Experts say the Treasury talks are further evidence that the Trump administration aims to reduce the Education Department's role. The situation is uncertain, pending the resolution of legal challenges and the future direction of student loan management.</p>

          <p>This article discusses current CD interest rates, noting that leading accounts offer higher returns than the current inflation rate. As of June 12, 2025, the national average for a 1-year CD yield is 2.00% APY, while some banks offer rates as high as 4.41% APY for a 6-month CD. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering online banks and short-term CDs. The inverted yield curve means short-term CDs currently have higher interest rates than longer terms. The outlook is moderately positive, with opportunities to lock in great rates with flexible terms. (not investment advice)</p>
