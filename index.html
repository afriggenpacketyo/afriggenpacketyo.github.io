          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S.-led ceasefire proposal for Gaza, seeking amendments to ensure a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid. A senior Hamas official indicated the amendments pertain to U.S. guarantees, hostage release timing, aid delivery, and Israeli troop withdrawal. The U.S. envoy to the Middle East deemed Hamas's response "totally unacceptable," while a draft deal outlines prisoner releases and aid provisions. Meanwhile, the U.N. Food Program reported that desperate Palestinians intercepted and offloaded 77 aid trucks, highlighting the dire humanitarian situation after nearly three months of Israeli blockade, while Israel continues its military campaign across Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Independent reports that obese patients in England and Wales are being denied hip and knee replacements based on their BMI, despite NICE guidance advising against this practice. Patients are required to lose weight before becoming eligible, but NHS weight loss programs face extensive waiting lists, leaving many in pain. The Royal College of Surgeons has criticized the policy, warning it could worsen patients' health, while a former health minister calls for government action on obesity. This comes as NHS waiting lists are at 7.4 million, and healthcare leaders are forced to cut services to meet savings demands, sparking concerns about discriminatory practices and inequalities in healthcare access.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has launched a federal effort to identify environmental toxins as the cause of rising autism rates, but many autism scientists disagree with this approach. Experts argue that genetics are the primary driver of autism, citing hundreds of identified genes associated with the condition. They fear Kennedy's focus on toxins could divert resources from genetic research, which has led to promising new therapies. Scientists emphasize that autism is a complex disorder with multiple genetic factors, and Kennedy's search for a single environmental cause is misguided.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing to unveil a major review of the military, amid growing concerns about a more dangerous era with a malevolent Russia and China. The strategic defence review will emphasize the importance of nuclear weapons, NATO commitment, and modernizing the forces. There are also suggestions of a new civilian force to protect infrastructure and a "whole society approach" to national resilience. However, questions remain about whether the proposed measures and increased spending will be sufficient to address the urgent threats, particularly in comparison to other NATO allies.</p>
