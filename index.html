        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 'dirty soda' trend, which involves adding flavored syrups and cream to soft drinks, has surged from its origins at the Utah-based chain Swig into a national phenomenon. Major corporations like PepsiCo, Taco Bell, and McDonald's are now embracing the concept, launching their own versions to revitalize the soda category and attract younger consumers. This foodservice trend is credited with helping to reverse a decades-long decline in soda consumption by offering a customizable and affordable treat that appeals to a broad demographic.</p>

          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is testing an advanced cockpit alert system, named SURF-A, designed to give pilots critical extra seconds to avoid runway incursions. By recreating recent near-disasters in simulations, the technology demonstrated its potential to significantly enhance airport safety amid rising concerns over serious close calls. While not yet mandated by regulators, some airlines are adopting similar systems, viewing the cost as a worthwhile investment against catastrophic accidents and a key layer in the industry's safety model.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis became key figures in the fight against AI-generated deepfake pornography after discovering a man had used their social media photos to create explicit content using a 'nudify' site. The article details their emotional trauma, the realization that the man's actions may not have been illegal due to legal loopholes, and their subsequent efforts to advocate for new legislation. Their story highlights the rapid proliferation of accessible AI tools that can be used for malicious purposes and the urgent need for laws to address this emerging form of nonconsensual violation.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the complexities of the First Amendment through the historical lens of a 1977 case where the ACLU defended a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors. The piece revisits the painful debate over whether hateful speech is protected and interviews the Jewish ACLU lawyer who argued the case, David Goldberger. He reflects on the personal pain the case caused survivors but stands by the principle that free speech cannot be denied simply because it is offensive, as that would allow officials to suppress any speech they dislike.</p>

          <p>West Ham has dismissed manager Graham Potter after only eight months, with the club positioned 19th in the Premier League table following a poor start to the season. The club announced that former Nottingham Forest and Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo is set to be appointed as his replacement. Potter's tenure saw a high loss rate of 52%, and the decision comes amid fan discontent over the team's performance and results, which the board stated had not matched expectations.</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Suggest Trump's Public Attacks Could Undermine Case Against James Comey</h2>

          <p>Following the federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, legal experts suggest the prosecution could be vulnerable to dismissal. They point to President Trump's years of public animosity towards Comey and recent leadership changes in the prosecuting office as potential evidence of selective or vindictive prosecution. The president's continued comments cheering the indictment, combined with reported opposition from career prosecutors, may provide strong grounds for Comey's defense team to challenge the legitimacy of the charges in court.</p>

          <p>A recent large-scale study from Mass General Brigham indicates that daily consumption of cocoa extract could help slow down the aging process in older adults. Researchers found that participants taking 500 milligrams of cocoa flavanols experienced a significantly slower increase in a key blood marker for systemic inflammation compared to a placebo group. While the findings are promising for reducing the risk of age-related diseases like cardiovascular disease, experts caution that the extract is not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle and a diverse, plant-based diet.</p>

Wharton School economist Britta Glennon argues the policy is based on the flawed idea that there is a fixed number of jobs and that it will discourage highly skilled immigrants from coming to the U.S. Instead of protecting American workers, she suggests the steep fee will likely push companies to offshore jobs and will ultimately erode America's innovative capacity.

This language reflects the growing influence of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a charismatic Christian movement that views politics as a cosmic battle between good and evil.

The survey shows a stark partisan divide, with most Republicans supporting the tactic while a similar majority of Democrats and over half of independents oppose it.

The fully professional English team, known as the Red Roses, is on a record 32-match winning streak and is favored to win its third title. However, Canada, which is not fully professional, has been in impressive form, notably defeating the defending champions, New Zealand, to reach their second-ever final. The match represents a significant moment for the sport, with a record crowd expected.</p>

          <h2>Simple 'Thumb Test' May Help Identify Risk for Aortic Aneurysm</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 05:16:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A simple self-check known as the 'thumb test' could offer a clue about one's risk for an aortic aneurysm. The test involves placing your thumb across your flat palm; if the thumb extends beyond the edge of the palm, it may indicate joint laxity associated with connective tissue diseases that weaken blood vessel walls. However, cardiologists caution that the test is not a diagnostic tool, as many healthy people have a positive result and most aneurysm patients do not. It should not replace medical evaluation but can prompt a conversation with a doctor.</p>

          <p>A 53-year-old man from Albany, New York, has been charged with murdering his parents after he confessed to the killings during a televised interview with a local news station. Lorenz Kraus told the anchor that he had suffocated his parents, Franz and Theresia, eight years ago and buried their bodies in the backyard of their home, claiming it was a mercy killing. Police, who had already discovered human remains at the property during a financial crimes investigation, arrested Kraus immediately following the on-air confession.</p>

          <p>The American state fair, a beloved seasonal tradition, has evolved significantly since its inception in the 19th century.

Despite this modernization, the core agricultural roots remain visible in food offerings, craft competitions, and animal exhibits, continuing to connect the public with the country's farming heritage while contributing billions to the economy.</p>

          <p>A specialist UK Ministry of Defence unit, nicknamed the 'war detectives,' has successfully identified the remains of two Scottish soldiers killed in the 1915 Battle of Loos. The investigation began after more than 100 bodies were discovered at a construction site in France. Using artefacts found with the remains, including regimental badges and distinctive tramway buttons, along with historical records and DNA testing with living relatives, the team identified Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan, allowing them to be laid to rest with full military honors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced it will revoke the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro following his 'reckless and incendiary' remarks at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York. During the demonstration, Petro called on U.S. soldiers to disobey President Trump's orders, particularly in relation to potential military actions against drug traffickers in the Caribbean. The move marks a significant escalation in the souring relations between the U.S. and Colombia, a key ally in counter-narcotics efforts, under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>South Korea is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate, one of the lowest in the world, threatens to undermine the nation's economic stability. Despite the government spending hundreds of billions on pro-natalist incentives, the fertility rate remains drastically below the replacement level needed to maintain its population. Economic studies project that the shrinking workforce will lead to a sustained slowdown and could even cause the economy to contract by the 2040s, posing a fundamental challenge to the 'Miracle on the Han River.'
