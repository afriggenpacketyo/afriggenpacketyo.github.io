          <p>Senate Republicans are scheduled to meet to discuss President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' with the Senate Finance Committee meeting at the White House with the president to discuss the tax policy components, including the extension of the 2017 tax cuts. The entire committee, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and GOP Whip John Barrasso, are expected to attend the meeting. Senate Republicans will also meet behind closed doors to discuss the bill's parameters, as GOP leadership aims to expedite its progress in the upper chamber. The Finance Committee is responsible for writing the tax policy components of the bill, including the extension of the Trump 2017 tax cuts, a key priority for the package.</p>

Eric Trump claimed to have no knowledge of the project despite his leadership roles in other crypto ventures of his father's. The project, promoted as the first crypto wallet for Trump fans, promises a share in $1 million in $TRUMP rewards for users who sign up and refer friends. Magic Eden pointed to the TrumpMeme X account, which reposted the $TRUMP Wallet announcement, but the company didn't provide additional comment.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese nationals, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, have been charged with smuggling a fungus, Fusarium graminearum, classified as a potential agroterrorism weapon, into the U.S. They allegedly received Chinese government funding for their research, some conducted at the University of Michigan, with Jian's electronics containing information indicating her membership in and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. Liu admitted to smuggling the fungus through the Detroit Metropolitan Airport to conduct research at the University of Michigan laboratory where Jian worked.

          <p>President Trump has privately expressed frustration with his Supreme Court appointees, particularly Justice Amy Coney Barrett, feeling they are not sufficiently supportive of his agenda. Several Trump allies have also criticized Barrett directly to the president, labeling her as "weak." Trump is reportedly seeking to nominate judges similar to Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and the late Antonin Scalia in the future. While Trump has not publicly attacked Barrett, he has criticized Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo, who advised him on judicial nominations during his first term.</p>

The campaign is expected to face opposition from business groups, who warn that increasing labor costs could force businesses to close or reduce services.

          <p>Concerns are being raised about FEMA's preparedness for the upcoming hurricane season, with reports suggesting the agency is behind schedule and lacks a clear understanding of its role. Acting FEMA head David Richardson allegedly suggested he was unaware of hurricane season's existence, though a DHS spokesperson dismissed this as a joke. An internal document reportedly warned that FEMA was badly behind schedule, leading Richardson to claim the agency was about 80-85% prepared. FEMA is also making recovery harder for the victims of past disasters, declining to declare a major disaster in Washington State and denying North Carolina more funding for cleanup after Hurricane Helene.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing transgender inmates gender-affirming care, despite an executive order from President Trump to halt funding for such care. Judge Royce Lamberth allowed a group of over 2,000 transgender inmates to pursue a lawsuit challenging the order as a class action, ordering the Bureau of Prisons to provide hormone therapy and accommodations like clothing and hair-removal devices. The ruling does not require surgical care related to gender transitions, and a White House spokesperson stated the Trump administration expects to ultimately prevail in the legal dispute.

          <p>A commencement speech at Harvard University by Yurong “Luanna” Jiang, a Chinese student, has sparked debate in China about access to elite education. Jiang's speech, which called for global unity, has led to questions about the lack of access for many ordinary students to prestigious universities, citing an uneven distribution of financial and educational resources. Some have criticized Jiang's "privileged" background and questioned whether she truly represents the broader Chinese student population. Critics have also pointed to her volunteer experience at a foundation where her father reportedly worked, which may have aided her Harvard application.</p>

          <p>Military researchers in China are developing an artificial intelligence system designed to improve the accuracy of torpedoes in submarine warfare, particularly against underwater deception tactics. The system, developed by the PLA Navy Armament Department and China State Shipbuilding Corporation, aims to distinguish real submarines from decoys, even at high speeds. Tested against data from classified high-speed torpedo ranges, the technology achieved an average 92.2% success rate, marking a significant improvement over legacy systems. This development highlights China's focus on advanced technologies for military applications.</p>

Musk's rebuke came shortly after the end of his tenure as a special advisor to President Trump. The bill, already approved by the House, faces challenges in the Senate, where multiple Republicans have expressed concerns about its impact on the deficit and Medicaid coverage.

          <p>Mondelēz International, the company behind Oreo cookies, has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying the packaging of its snacks. Mondelēz claims that Aldi's similar packaging is likely to deceive consumers and capitalize on the Oreo brand's fame and prestige. The lawsuit includes side-by-side comparisons of Mondelēz products with Aldi's versions, also targeting Wheat Thins, Nutter Butter, Chips Ahoy!, and Ritz. Mondelēz asserts that Aldi has continued to produce unacceptable copies despite previous communications, and that allowing Aldi to continue would irreparably harm the Mondelēz brand.</p>
