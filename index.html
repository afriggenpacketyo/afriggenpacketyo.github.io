          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic has indicated he is currently leaning towards only one interest rate cut this year, citing concerns about potential upward pressure on inflation due to tariffs. While the Federal Reserve projected two rate cuts in March, Bostic believes the tariffs have been larger than initially anticipated, requiring more time to assess their impact. Bostic expressed particular concern about rising inflation expectations among Americans, which he believes could complicate the Fed's efforts to maintain stable prices. Bostic is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee.</p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced turbulent trading as stocks fell, the dollar weakened, and bond yields rose following a credit rating downgrade and growing concerns about the U.S. economy. Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, citing concerns about the fiscal deficit and rising debt costs, joining other major agencies in removing the United States' top credit rating. Investors are also reacting to a bill in Congress that would make President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, potentially adding trillions to the federal debt. The combination of these factors has raised concerns about the safe-haven status of U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland saw centrist candidates halting or slowing down hard-right breakthroughs that many liberals had feared, though discontent with mainstream parties remains. In Romania, Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor, defeated George Simion, a hard-line nationalist aligned with President Trump. In Poland, Rafal Trzaskowski, a liberal mayor, secured a spot in a runoff against Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian, although the margin of victory was narrow, indicating strong support for hard-right candidates.

Moody's forecasts that federal deficits will widen to almost 9% of the U.S. economy by 2035. Analysts also highlighted apprehension that the reconciliation bill in Congress could further fuel U.S. debt. Concerns over debt come as consumer confidence continues to slip due to worries about the trade war's impact on inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joe and Jill Biden have expressed gratitude for the outpouring of "love and support" they have received following the announcement of the former president's cancer diagnosis. In a social media post, the couple shared that "Cancer touches us all," and referenced being "strongest in the broken places," a sentiment derived from Ernest Hemingway's "A Farewell to Arms." Biden's office announced on Sunday that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.</p>

          <p>Britain and Iran have summoned each others envoys after three Iranians were charged with spying in the UK. The IRNA news agency said the British charge d'affaire was asked on Sunday to give an explanation for what it said was "unjustified" and "politically motivated" arrests. On Monday, the Foreign Office responded by summoning Tehran's ambassador to the UK following the charges. Three Iranian men were arrested on 3 May and appeared in court in London on Saturday charged with spying for the Islamic republic.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is betting that the public is ready to move on from the contentious Brexit debates, as the UK and EU reach a new deal on post-Brexit relations. The agreements aim to reduce red tape and boost the British economy, but the Conservatives have criticized the deal as a "surrender." Starmer hopes that the practical benefits of the deal will outweigh objections from Brexit supporters, focusing on smoother relations with the EU without reopening major questions like single market membership. The success of this approach hinges on whether opposition parties campaign heavily against the deal, indicating continued public controversy over Brexit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health officials are renewing calls for vigilance against bird flu, but experts are puzzled by the absence of new human cases in recent months. Possible explanations include weakened surveillance due to government cuts, fear among immigrant farm workers to come forward for testing, or a natural seasonal decline in infections. While the CDC maintains that the risk to the general public remains low, the lack of detected cases raises concerns about undetected milder infections and the potential for the virus to mutate. Research continues, including blood sample collection from dairy workers to test for past H5N1 exposure.</p>

That's because today's leading accounts come with higher returns than the current inflation rate. However, strong current returns aren't the only reason to invest in these savings vehicles either. You can lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD. Moreover, they're safe investments, generally coming with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. (not investment advice)</p>
