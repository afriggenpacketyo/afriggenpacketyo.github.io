        <h2>US Department of Education Announces Major Workforce Reduction</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 20:10:00 EDT</div>

        <p>The Department of Education announced a nearly 50% workforce reduction, part of the Trump administration's plan to downsize the agency.  While the department claims this will not affect its core programs, critics argue it will harm students and teachers, particularly in low-income areas.  The move is part of a long-standing Republican effort to return education control to the states, though full dismantling requires congressional approval.</p>

        <h2>Senate Democrats Face Difficult Choice on Government Funding Bill</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 20:09:32 EDT</div>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The House narrowly passed a government funding bill, leaving Senate Democrats with a difficult decision: vote for a bill they dislike or risk a government shutdown.  The bill cuts non-defense spending but increases military and veterans' healthcare funding.  The Senate needs 60 votes for passage, and the outcome remains uncertain, with potential consequences including a government shutdown under a Trump administration already known for layoffs.</p>
