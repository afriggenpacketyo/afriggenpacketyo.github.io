          <p>The inquest into the death of Jay Slater, a 19-year-old from Lancashire who went missing in Tenerife, has been adjourned after his mother requested key witnesses to come forward. Slater disappeared after attending a music festival and his body was later found with head injuries consistent with a fall. The coroner noted that some friends and other witnesses could not be located despite police efforts. Slater's mother expressed her desire to question these witnesses to understand the circumstances surrounding her son's disappearance and death, leading to the delay of the inquest.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing significant challenges in passing a major bill that advances President Trump's legislative agenda due to internal divisions. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which includes changes to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, SNAP food assistance, and immigration policy, is facing opposition from Republican hard-liners. Disagreements primarily revolve around Medicaid work requirements and caps on state and local tax deductions. Despite Trump's efforts to persuade Republicans, the bill's passage in the House is uncertain, with potential changes being negotiated between hard-liners and moderates to secure enough votes.</p>

          <p>A New York Times investigation reveals that Russia has been using Brazil as a launchpad for its elite intelligence officers, known as "illegals," for years. These spies create elaborate cover identities, start businesses, and even have love affairs to build credible backstories before heading to the United States, Europe, or the Middle East. Brazilian counterintelligence agents have been working to dismantle this network for the past three years in an operation known as Operation East, with intelligence support from the United States, Israel, and other Western allies. The investigation has uncovered at least nine Russian officers operating under Brazilian cover identities, disrupting Moscow's espionage efforts and leading to arrests and hasty retreats.</p>

The footballer, who has played for Arsenal, Aberdeen, and Ipswich Town, acted as an intermediary between criminals in both Thailand and the UK.

Unlike Damar Hamlin, who received immediate treatment during an NFL game, most workplaces lack the resources and training to address cardiac emergencies effectively.

          <p>The FDA is planning a major policy shift to limit future COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or those with high-risk conditions, potentially excluding younger, healthy individuals unless vaccine makers fund extensive clinical trials. FDA officials argue annual booster shots may not be worth the risk for healthy people, while experts caution that lengthy trials could result in outdated vaccines. The new policy aligns with recommendations from other countries, but some experts worry about creating barriers for those wanting to protect vulnerable family members.

          <p>A recent inflation surprise suggests the economic outlook could be more challenging than previously anticipated, with higher energy and water bills contributing to a rise in prices. While pay rises are outpacing inflation for some workers, prices are rising faster than in France or Germany. The rise in gas and electricity bills is driven by higher wholesale global costs, and economists worry that rising service prices indicate that bosses are passing on wage cost increases. Government policies also risk adding to inflation, prompting economists to believe that inflation could inch up further in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, along with other tech billionaires like Bezos and Zuckerberg, shares a fondness for Iain M. Banks's Culture series, a socialist science fiction series. The Culture series presents a post-scarcity galactic society valuing empathy, pluralism, and social cooperation, which contrasts sharply with the capitalist worldview often associated with tech billionaires. The series explores the Culture's interactions with less progressive civilizations, addressing issues like intervention, slavery, and social justice. The article questions why these billionaires are drawn to a series that critiques capitalism and champions socialist ideals.</p>
