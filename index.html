          <p>The union representing over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants is continuing its strike despite a ruling from the Canada Industrial Relations Board declaring the action unlawful. The strike, which has grounded hundreds of flights and affected tens of thousands of passengers, centers on demands for higher wages and better compensation for on-ground work. Union leaders have expressed their willingness to face penalties, including fines and jail time, insisting that a negotiated settlement is the only acceptable resolution.

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's plan to build a large new embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London is a significant diplomatic and symbolic gesture. The author suggests that beyond being a planning issue, the project signals China's view of London as a crucial global partner for finance and trade. While acknowledging political opposition and security concerns, the piece posits that the embassy's construction represents a long-term commitment that contrasts with the UK's recent trend of selling diplomatic assets. The project is framed as a test of Britain's international standing and capacity.</p>

Mouncey has disputed the notion of an unfair advantage, advocating for fairness with necessary restrictions rather than blanket bans. The exchange occurs amidst ongoing debates within international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee, about policies regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes in female sports categories.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, is strengthening as it moves up the Atlantic Ocean. While the storm is not expected to make direct landfall in the United States, the National Hurricane Center warns it will likely generate life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along the entire East Coast for several days. The storm, a Category 4 hurricane, has prompted coastal flooding warnings and evacuation orders for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks.

Trump continued to advocate for a trilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a proposal Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ready for.

          <p>This article posits that the current wave of generative AI has created a widespread feeling of confusion and delusion, blurring the lines between technological progress and unsettling reality. The author uses examples like an AI-reanimated dead teenager being interviewed to illustrate a societal rush into a poorly conceived future, driven by Silicon Valley's breathless hype. The piece explores the resulting anxieties over job displacement, the psychological impact on users forming relationships with chatbots, and the massive economic reorientation around a technology whose grand promises may never fully materialize.

          <p>A new analysis from Bankrate indicates that average American wages have lagged behind the cost of living by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years, eroding household purchasing power. The study highlights that some professions, particularly educators, have fallen further behind than others, while workers in sectors like leisure and hospitality have seen wage growth outpace inflation. This persistent gap aligns with public sentiment, as a majority of Americans feel their income has not kept up with rising prices. The findings underscore the ongoing financial strain many households face despite a growing economy. (not investment advice)</p>

This development comes as the Israeli military intensifies its operations in Gaza City, and it remains unclear how the Israeli government will respond to the proposal.

          <p>This article examines whether debts from popular "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services are eligible for debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, BNPL plans can technically be included in debt settlement negotiations, similar to credit card or personal loan debts. However, eligibility can be inconsistent, as BNPL is a newer form of credit and not all providers may be willing to negotiate settlements. The piece advises consumers struggling with BNPL payments to consider direct negotiation with the provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling as alternative strategies for managing this growing form of consumer debt.</p>

The critical situation is the result of a combination of factors, including a long-term drought, extreme summer heat, and governmental mismanagement of the nation's dam systems. This convergence of environmental and administrative failures has led to dangerously low water levels across the country. The impending crisis poses a significant threat to the daily lives of Iranians and the nation's stability.</p>

          <h2>MSNBC Rebranding to 'MS NOW' Reflects Broader Media Industry Pressures</h2>

          <p>The progressive cable news network MSNBC is rebranding to "MS NOW," a move that has drawn public confusion and mockery. The article argues that this change reflects deeper trends and fears within the mainstream media industry, particularly the declining business of cable news. Both MSNBC and CNN are being spun off by their corporate parents, Comcast and Warner Bros., respectively, into new, separate companies. The author suggests a political motivation as well, positing that the spinoffs and name change create distance, insulating the parent corporations from potential political retaliation from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Leaked audio recordings have revealed that Israel's former chief of military intelligence, Aharon Haliva, stated that 50,000 deaths in Gaza were "necessary and required for future generations." In the remarks, Haliva suggested that for every Israeli killed on October 7, 50 Palestinians should die, regardless of whether they are children, to send a message. Haliva, who resigned over intelligence failures leading to the Hamas attack, has since confirmed the authenticity of the remarks from a private discussion but said they were taken out of context. The comments have drawn condemnation from human rights groups.</p>

          <h2>Retail Inventory Method Accounting May Obscure True Impact of Tariffs on Profitability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:38:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains how a specific accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, could temporarily distort their reported profitability as new tariffs take effect. Because RIM uses an average cost-to-retail ratio rather than the actual cost of each item, it is slower to reflect sudden cost increases, potentially overstating gross margins in the short term. This accounting nuance means that upcoming earnings reports may not fully capture the financial hit from the tariffs. The piece details how this method works and why it can create a disconnect between a company's operational execution and its financial statements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked more than 6,000 visas for international students due to violations of U.S. law and visa overstays. The department cited assault, DUIs, and burglary as common violations, and also included "support for terrorism" as a reason for some revocations. This action is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration and its increased scrutiny of international students, which now includes enhanced vetting of social media accounts. The policy has faced criticism from Democrats who argue it is an attack on due process for students in the country legally.</p>

          <p>The musical "& Juliet," now playing at the Ahmanson Theatre, offers a fresh, feminist take on Shakespeare's classic tragedy, set to a soundtrack of pop hits from producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Juliet choosing not to die and instead embarking on a new life of self-discovery in Paris, guided by the playwright's wife, Anne Hathaway. The review praises the production's energetic direction, clever book by David West Read, and vibrant performances, particularly from lead Rachel Webb as Juliet. Described as a euphoric and witty dance party, the musical successfully transforms the tragic tale into a feel-good celebration of second chances.</p>

          <p>This article addresses whether age limits exist for buying annuities, a retirement product gaining popularity for its guaranteed income stream. While there are no federal laws setting a maximum age, individual insurance companies often impose their own limits, typically between 80 and 85, due to risk assessment. The piece explains that the best age to purchase an annuity depends on individual retirement strategy rather than a specific number. It outlines the advantages of buying at different life stages, from one's late 50s to early 80s, balancing the benefit of higher payouts for older buyers against potential health disqualifications.</p>

          <p>The third-ever observed interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is exhibiting unusual characteristics, leading to speculation about its nature. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has pointed to Hubble Telescope observations showing a glow of light ahead of the object, but without a corresponding cometary tail, suggesting the object may be generating its own light. Loeb proposes two possibilities: it is either a rare radioactive fragment from a supernova or an artificially powered spacecraft. While acknowledging the need for more evidence, he notes the object's upcoming close pass by Mars will provide a unique opportunity for observation by NASA's orbiters.</p>

Lai, whose newspaper Apple Daily was forced to shut down, is accused of colluding with foreign forces and sedition, charges he denies. Prosecutors are focusing on his connections with U.S. political figures as evidence of his alleged crimes. The trial, which has drawn international attention and criticism, is seen by many as a key indicator of the erosion of press freedom and judicial independence in Hong Kong under the national security law imposed by Beijing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signaled a new focus on enforcing the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, specifically in relation to wind energy projects. While wind turbines do pose a threat to eagles, this article argues the administration's sudden concern is a pretext to stall the development of wind farms, a technology the president frequently criticizes. The piece points out the hypocrisy of this stance, noting that the administration has simultaneously worked to weaken broader environmental protections for migratory birds and endangered species to benefit the oil and gas industry. It also highlights that bald eagle populations have recovered robustly and are not currently at risk.</p>
