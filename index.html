          <p>Two years after devastating wildfires, Lahaina's youth continue to experience significant mental health struggles, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD, with over a third of Maui students affected by loss or injury. Many, like Mia Palacio, isolated themselves, grappling with grief and uncertainty, as the two-year mark often reveals the full psychological toll of constant change. The island faces a critical shortage of mental health specialists, with only two youth psychiatrists remaining, exacerbating the challenge of providing adequate support. Despite emerging initiatives like the Maui Hero Project and culturally-rooted approaches, pervasive stigma, particularly in Filipino and Latino communities, complicates access to these vital mental health services.</p>

          <p>British hopes at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo were dashed by several unfortunate incidents. Pole vaulter Molly Caudery, the indoor world champion, was forced to withdraw after rolling her ankle during warm-up, ending her competition prematurely. Marathon runner Emile Cairess also pulled out less than three miles from the finish due to the brutal 30C heat and intense humidity. Additionally, Sarah Tait fell during the 3,000m steeplechase, and Olympic champion Julien Alfred withdrew from the 200m due to a hamstring injury sustained in the 100m final.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy experienced a deeper slowdown in August, with key indicators like retail sales and industrial output falling below expectations, reflecting persistent weak domestic demand. Retail sales rose 3.4%, missing forecasts, while industrial output growth slowed to 5.2%, marking its weakest level since August 2024. Fixed-asset investment expanded only 0.5% year-to-date, a sharp slowdown, exacerbated by a worsening 12.9% contraction in real estate investment. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged numerous "unstable and uncertain factors" and multiple risks in the external environment, emphasizing the need for comprehensive macro policies, including deepening reform and innovation, to foster steady and healthy economic development.

          <p>The South Korean government is investigating potential human rights violations following a US immigration raid at an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, which led to the detention of over 300 South Korean workers. Seoul expressed "strong regret" to the US, requesting respect for its citizens' rights and interests. The incident, where workers were reportedly led away in chains, has strained ties, with President Lee Jae-myung warning it could deter foreign investment. The plant's opening has been delayed, and South Korean trade unions are calling for an official apology from the US.</p>

          <h2>Wayne Rooney Criticizes Manchester United's Performance Under Manager Ruben Amorim</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney asserts that the club has "got worse" under manager Ruben Amorim, who took over ten months ago. Following a dismal 3-0 derby defeat to Manchester City, Rooney expressed difficulty in seeing any progression or signs of future improvement.

          <p>Donald Trump's unpredictable foreign policy is generating global chaos, pushing allies to seek new coalitions beyond his anticipated retreat from NATO. Recent actions, such as Israel's strike against Hamas leaders in Doha and Trump's imposition of 50% tariffs on India, have alienated key partners like Qatar and India, despite prior declarations of friendship. These perceived betrayals are compelling nations to reconsider their reliance on the US, leading to hastily convened summits and public displays of solidarity among previously estranged states, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia. The article suggests that while these geopolitical shifts are nascent, they signal a significant, unsettling realignment of global power dynamics, as states seek to buffer themselves against US capriciousness.</p>

Carney must balance proposed austerity measures, aiming for 15% departmental spending cuts, with significant investment commitments, such as a multi-billion dollar increase in defense spending for NATO.

This decision, supported by City Councilmember Mary Zendejas, reflects widespread concern following recent immigration raids across Southern California and a new Supreme Court ruling bolstering agents' powers. In response, the city has reallocated parade funds to next year and significantly increased funding for the Long Beach Justice Fund, which provides legal representation for immigration actions, to help safeguard residents' constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that foreign workers are "welcome" in the United States and that he does not want to "frighten off" investors, just ten days after hundreds of South Korean workers were arrested in Georgia. In a Truth Social post, Trump explained that he wants foreign experts to temporarily share their expertise in complex product manufacturing, emphasizing the need for the US to learn from others in various industries. This statement follows a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG plant, where 475 people, mostly South Koreans, were detained, causing widespread alarm in South Korea. President Lee Jae Myung had previously called the raid "bewildering" and warned it could discourage future investment into the US, prompting calls for an official apology.</p>

          <p>A growing number of car owners are "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicle is worth, a trend reaching a four-year high. This means 26.6% of trade-ins in Q2 2025 had negative equity, averaging $6,754. Drivers often end up in this situation due to depreciation, longer loan terms, or smaller down payments, which can exacerbate the issue. The article advises consumers to keep their current vehicles if possible, research credit scores and pre-approve loans from various lenders, and consider guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance when buying a new car to mitigate financial risk.

          <p>Tens of thousands of people protested in Ankara against the Turkish government's crackdown on the opposition, ahead of a court ruling that could remove Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Ozgur Ozel. Ozel denounced the hearing as a "judicial coup" aimed at undermining the CHP, which gained significant victories in recent local elections. Protesters chanted for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's resignation, accusing his regime of governing through oppression rather than the ballot box. The article highlights that hundreds of CHP members, including Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, have been jailed on corruption and terrorism charges, intensifying political tensions in Turkey.</p>

          <p>Following the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump claimed that individuals "on the left" are already under investigation, refusing to call for national unity. Republicans have quickly attributed blame to liberals for fostering anti-conservative sentiment, despite Trump and his allies frequently using violent rhetoric themselves. This article highlights Trump's focus on casting "vicious and horrible" radicals on the left as the sole problem, intensifying political polarization after a high-profile act of violence. The ongoing investigation into suspect Tyler Robinson remains central to this contentious political discourse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a leading cause of death and infertility for the marsupials. Developed over a decade by UniSC researchers, the vaccine aims to reduce the disease's rapid spread, which affects up to 70% of some koala populations. Chlamydia causes blindness, starvation, and bladder damage, often necessitating euthanasia. This innovative vaccine, tested on hundreds of wild and captive koalas, offers protection by reducing infection, preventing clinical disease progression, and even reversing existing symptoms, offering significant hope for koala conservation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are entering the final two weeks of the regular season with crucial games ahead, particularly against the Philadelphia Phillies, to secure a top playoff seeding. While three division champions qualify for the playoffs, the top two records earn a bye into the division series, which Dodgers president Andrew Friedman believes is vital for World Series odds. The article discusses the strategic advantages of a bye, such as player recovery and rotation alignment, and the potential implications if the San Diego Padres overtake them in the NL West. The team's home advantage also plays a significant role in their playoff calculus.</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, has declined an interview request from the Metropolitan Police as he nears release from prison for a separate sexual assault offense. Brückner, a German national, denies any involvement in Madeleine's 2007 disappearance from Praia da Luz, Portugal. Despite German and Portuguese authorities considering him the prime suspect since 2020, they have not found sufficient evidence to bring charges. The Met Police confirmed they will continue to pursue viable lines of inquiry, with their investigation, Operation Grange, having received over £13.2 million in funding since 2011.</p>
