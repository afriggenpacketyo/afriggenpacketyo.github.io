          <p>Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te stated his commitment to peaceful dialogue with China but emphasized the importance of bolstering Taiwan's defenses. Lai rejected Beijing's claims of sovereignty over Taiwan, marking his first year in office with a call for reciprocal dignity in cross-strait relations. He announced plans to procure arms and develop Taiwan's domestic arms industry, while seeking to deter potential aggression through alliances. Lai also addressed trade frictions with the U.S., expressing optimism for reconciliation through trust and sincere dialogue, highlighting the longstanding cooperation between the two economies.</p>

          <p>Dawn Richard, a former member of Diddy's Danity Kane girl group, testified in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, alleging that Diddy threatened her to keep silent about the alleged abuse of Cassie Ventura. Legal experts suggest that Richard's testimony corroborates Ventura's account and could support the government's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charge against Combs. Richard claimed to have witnessed Diddy physically assaulting Ventura and recounted instances of controlling behavior. Kerry Morgan also testified, claiming Diddy physically assaulted her in 2018, leading to the end of her friendship with Cassie Ventura.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's coastguard has requested special funding to enhance coastal surveillance following multiple undetected landings by mainland Chinese residents using inflatable boats. The request was prompted by two incidents: a father and son who crossed the Taiwan Strait seeking freedom, and a man who allegedly crossed the strait, raised a Chinese flag, and returned. Authorities are investigating the authenticity of the latter incident, while acknowledging the feasibility of such crossings, which has exposed vulnerabilities in Taiwan's coastal defenses.

The managing director stated that transport activities remain unaffected, however, the attack is affecting suppliers who risk losing thousands of pounds worth of perishable products if deliveries are not restored quickly.

          <p>China is expanding its influence in Latin America by offering financial support and trade opportunities, contrasting with what is perceived as President Trump's negative agenda in the region. Xi Jinping announced a $9.1 billion credit line, infrastructure investments, and visa exemptions for several Latin American countries during a CELAC summit in Beijing. This move is seen as China positioning itself as a reliable partner, promoting free trade and multilateralism, while Trump focuses on issues like crime, drugs, and illegal immigration. Experts express concern over China's invitation to Latin American politicians to showcase its governance model, suggesting an attempt to promote autocracy.</p>

          <p>A family who fought in court to protect their daughter from her father, convicted of sexual assault offenses, criticizes a government bill intended to help similar cases. The Victims and Courts Bill amendment removes parental responsibility from convicted child abusers, but only if they abused their own children. The family expressed disappointment that the legislation does not automatically remove parental rights in all cases of serious child sexual assault offenses. The government maintains it will continue to strengthen the law.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a celebrated Russian ballet choreographer, has passed away at the age of 98. He served as the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, known for his revitalizing male dance and demanding exceptional strength and artistry. Grigorovich's productions, including "Stone Flower" and "Romeo and Juliet," redefined Soviet ballet, however, his departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 led to the first dancers' strike in the theatre's history.</p>

Attorneys argued that Ritchie suffered from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure, impairing his decision-making, however, his clemency bid was rejected.
