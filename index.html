          <p>OpenAI has been awarded a $200 million contract by the U.S. Defense Department to develop artificial intelligence tools for national security challenges, marking the first such contract for the company. The agreement falls under OpenAI's new initiative, OpenAI for Government, and aims to improve administrative operations, healthcare services for service members, and cyber defense. CEO Sam Altman expressed pride in engaging in national security areas, while emphasizing that all use cases must align with OpenAI's usage policies. This contract represents a small portion of OpenAI's revenue, which is generating over $10 billion in annualized sales, and follows Microsoft's authorization to use Azure OpenAI service with classified information.</p>

          <p>Dr. Fiona Havers, who oversaw the CDC team collecting COVID and RSV hospitalization data, resigned due to a lack of confidence that the data would be used objectively for vaccine policy decisions. This resignation occurred before a meeting of a new vaccine panel established by Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who previously dismissed the CDC's independent vaccine advisory panel and removed a recommendation for COVID shots for healthy children and pregnant women. Havers stated that her team's data had been used in numerous peer-reviewed manuscripts and CDC reports. A Health and Human Services spokesperson affirmed the agency's commitment to basing vaccine policy on objective data and transparent analysis.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly ended his trip to Canada for the G7 summit, citing escalating tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. He returned to Washington to address what he described as "many important matters" related to the conflict, which has seen increased airstrikes and missile attacks. Trump indicated awareness of messages from Iran expressing a desire to de-escalate, but insisted on a deal to limit their nuclear program. The President reiterated that the U.S. is not directly involved in Israel's strikes but has assisted in intercepting Iranian missiles.</p>

          <p>Iranian opposition activists express their disapproval of both the current Iranian regime and the recent Israeli military strikes, fearing societal collapse and destruction of Iran's infrastructure. Despite their opposition to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Republic, these activists do not support the Israeli attacks on their country, even though they are also against Iran's attacks on Israel. They worry about their safety and the broader consequences of the conflict, which they believe is destroying the economy and leading to shortages.

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are vying to end Canada's 30-year Stanley Cup drought, facing the Florida Panthers in Miami. The repeated losses have fueled a sense of unity among Canadians, especially given heightened tensions with the U.S., exemplified during the 4 Nations Face Off. Theories abound regarding the lack of Canadian victories, ranging from the NHL's focus on American franchises to tax incentives in the U.S. Some attribute it to hockey's egalitarian gameplay, where even star players have limited ice time, which might be a disadvantage.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Trump's tax bill differs from the House-passed version, potentially leading to a clash between the two chambers. Key differences include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid work requirements, and child tax credit amounts. The Senate proposes keeping the SALT cap at $10,000, while the House offers deductions up to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000 annually. The Senate bill also includes a $5 trillion increase to the federal debt limit, which some senators oppose, and phases out solar energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act at a slower rate than the House version.

          <p>A chimpanzee conservation project managed by the Jane Goodall Institute in Tanzania is facing setbacks due to funding cuts from USAID. The Hope Through Action project, which aimed to protect endangered chimpanzees and their habitats, will lose the pledged $29.5 million over five years. This work is based on Jane Goodall's research, emphasizing cooperation between local people and the natural environment. Despite the cuts, Ecosia, a search engine, has offered $100,000 to further the Gombe reforestation project, but this donation does not fully cover the original funding amount.</p>

          <p>A former Coast Guard lieutenant, Peter Stinson, has been arrested for allegedly making threats to kill President Trump. The FBI affidavit details numerous social media posts from 2020 to 2025 suggesting the use of a gun, knife, and poison against the president. Stinson also allegedly expressed willingness to provide support for a "contract hit" on Mr. Trump. He has been charged with making threats against the president and ordered to be detained pending further hearings. Investigators said Stinson has self-identified as a member of ANTIFA.</p>

The Senate Finance Committee's proposal includes steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, a permanent extension of the $10,000 state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling. House Republicans have expressed concerns over the SALT deduction cap and have urged senators to make minimal changes to the House bill. The Senate version also includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while making tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term permanent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump faces several options in dealing with the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, ranging from escalating involvement to pulling back. One option involves bowing to pressure from Netanyahu and escalating attacks, while another is to maintain the current course of limited involvement. A third option is to heed voices within the MAGA movement and withdraw from the conflict, prioritizing "America First" policies. Trump's unpredictability adds to the uncertainty, as he has expressed both support for Israel's strikes and a desire for a deal with Iran.</p>

The ABA argues that the administration is coercing lawyers to abandon clients and causes it does not like, violating the First Amendment.

          <h2>Fire Victims Sue State Farm, Claiming They Were Underinsured</h2>

          <p>Fire victims from the Pacific Palisades and Altadena are suing State Farm, claiming their homes were severely underinsured and that they don’t have the funds to rebuild or replace their homes. The lawsuit alleges negligence, breach of contract and several other causes of action, and seeks compensatory and punitive damages and reform of State Farm’s policies. This marks the second time L.A. fire victims have sued insurers because they believe they were systematically underinsured. The lawsuit comes days after State Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara announced his department is launching a formal inquiry into how State Farm General is handling thousands of claims filed by fire victims after receiving complaints.</p>
