          <p>Chinese authorities are increasing their crackdown on the illegal smuggling of rare earth minerals, which they describe as a "severe" national security issue. A special operation launched in May has led to arrests, as officials combat increasingly covert tactics like false declarations and transshipment through third countries. To strengthen enforcement, China plans to establish a joint coordination center for export controls on dual-use items. The government is emphasizing a high-pressure approach to prevent the illegal outflow of these strategic resources and related technologies.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's recent visit to China for a major supply chain expo signals a potential easing of Sino-US trade tensions. During his trip, it was announced that Washington had approved the export of a specialized, less powerful AI chip for the Chinese market. Huang's optimistic presence, along with a 15% increase in US firm participation at the expo, reflects a recent agreement on a trade negotiation framework. Despite the positive gestures, underlying concerns about the broader technology trade war between the two nations persist.</p>

          <p>Steel giant ArcelorMittal has halted its decarbonization plans in Germany, returning a €1.3 billion government subsidy and raising concerns about the country's transition to green steel. The company cited slow progress in the energy transition, the high cost of green hydrogen, and a weak European steel market as reasons for its withdrawal. This decision highlights major challenges for Germany's climate goals, including the insufficient supply and high price of green hydrogen and electricity. While some German steelmakers remain committed, the move underscores the economic and logistical hurdles facing Europe's industrial decarbonization efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim suggesting that sunscreen use increases skin cancer risk is false, according to health experts and fact-checkers. The article refutes the assertion, clarifying that there is no scientific evidence to support this link and that UV radiation remains the primary cause of melanoma. The rising number of skin cancer cases is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and more consistent reporting, not sunscreen use. While global sunscreen sales are increasing, polls indicate that many people still use it inconsistently, underscoring the importance of proper sun protection.</p>

Furthermore, the government is constrained by financial markets, massive national debt, and global instability, limiting its policy options.

Other potential cost-drivers include expanded worker benefits, ethical sourcing mandates, and progressive security strategies, which could undermine the primary goal of affordability.

          <p>Syria's interim government has announced an immediate ceasefire in the southern city of Suweida following a week of violent clashes between local Bedouin tribes and the Druze community. The sectarian violence has reportedly left hundreds dead, with graphic footage showing bodies in the streets. Interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa has called for unity as internal security forces deploy to the area to enforce the truce. The situation is complicated by the involvement of Israel, which conducted airstrikes in support of the Druze minority and has expressed doubt about the new government's commitment to protecting them.</p>

          <p>Representatives from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Rwanda-backed M23 militia have signed a provisional ceasefire agreement, committing to a permanent truce by August 18. The deal, facilitated in Qatar, represents a significant step toward ending the long-running conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, which has displaced over seven million people. The agreement calls for a halt to hate propaganda and any attempts to seize new territory by force. Key issues, such as the release of prisoners and the withdrawal of M23 troops from captured cities, will be addressed in the final peace agreement.</p>

The incidents occurred near hubs run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S. and Israeli-backed group.

The Israeli military stated it fired warning shots after suspects approached its forces and is investigating the reports, noting the incident occurred when the site was closed.</p>

          <p>Public health experts are raising alarms about what they term a "war on science" under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Recent actions, including the mass firing of staff, the ousting of a vaccine advisory committee, and the cancellation of a preventive services task force meeting, have fueled these concerns. Critics argue that Kennedy's anti-vaccine views and the administration's budget cuts are politicizing science, undermining public health institutions, and sowing distrust in medicine as measles cases rise. These moves have prompted protests, lawsuits, and a warning from researchers that the agency's core mission is being damaged.</p>

          <p>A viral social media trend known as the "Gen Z stare" has ignited a conversation about generational differences in communication. Older generations describe it as a blank, unresponsive look from younger people, particularly in customer service interactions, which they interpret as a lack of social skills or even rejection. Psychology experts suggest this may be partly due to Gen Z's social development being shaped by the internet and pandemic lockdowns, leading to different interaction styles. While some Zoomers deny its existence, the discourse highlights how technology and life experiences shape the social cues and values of each generation.</p>

          <p>Benito Flores, a 70-year-old housing activist, has died after apparently falling from a tree at a state-owned home he had occupied in El Sereno, Los Angeles. Flores was part of the "Reclaiming Our Homes" movement, which began in 2020 to protest homelessness by seizing vacant, publicly owned properties. He was the last remaining protester fighting eviction and had built elaborate treehouse defenses to resist removal. His death occurred just six weeks after he and his supporters successfully prevented sheriff's deputies from evicting him, and is being mourned by supporters as a martyrdom for the right to housing.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles city attorney has filed a lawsuit against Airbnb, accusing the platform of enabling illegal price gouging on thousands of rentals following the January wildfires. The suit alleges that Airbnb allowed hosts to increase prices by more than the 10% cap permitted during a state of emergency. It also claims the company has inadequate verification processes, leaving users vulnerable to fraudulent hosts and misrepresented locations. The city seeks a permanent halt to the practice and financial penalties that could total millions, while Airbnb maintains it has supported recovery efforts and contributed to victim aid.</p>

This service, which fielded nearly 10% of the lifeline's 16 million contacts, was created under bipartisan legislation during Trump's first term.

          <p>Scientists studying glaciers in the Swiss Alps have made a worrying discovery: the ice is not only melting from the top down but also from the bottom up. Air circulating through channels within the ice can excavate large holes from underneath, accelerating the glaciers' disappearance and increasing the risk of sudden collapse. This phenomenon was linked to a recent event where the Birch Glacier gave way, destroying the 800-year-old village of Blatten. The finding underscores the urgent need to address planet-heating pollution, as up to two-thirds of the world's glaciers could be lost by 2100.</p>

          <p>A Biden-era student loan relief measure, which paused interest accrual for borrowers in the now-defunct SAVE plan, is set to expire on August 1. As a result, many of the 7.7 million enrollees could see their monthly payments more than double if they switch to other plans like Income-Based Repayment (IBR). The SAVE plan calculated payments at 5% of discretionary income, whereas IBR uses a 10% or 15% threshold, a significant increase that many borrowers may struggle to afford. This change forces borrowers to choose between facing new interest charges or transitioning to a much more expensive repayment plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's tariff policies reveals mixed results more than 100 days after their implementation. The tariffs have generated higher-than-expected tax revenue, potentially exceeding $300 billion by the end of 2025, and have prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, economists express skepticism about the long-term reliability of these corporate commitments due to the policy's fluctuating nature. Additionally, the tariffs have started to modestly increase consumer prices on imported goods, creating a risk of inflation that could disrupt the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first authority to implement such a policy, where a person with a prognosis of less than 12 months to live is spared the tax. Advocates argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a severe income shock and additional costs, making a council tax exemption a compassionate and practical way to provide priceless peace of mind.
