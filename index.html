          <p>A 12-year-old girl, Sophia Forchas, is making a remarkable recovery after being shot in the head during a mass shooting at a Minneapolis church. Her family and medical team at Hennepin Healthcare describe her progress as "nothing short of miraculous," noting steady signs of neurological recovery. While she faces a long journey of rehabilitation, doctors are cautiously optimistic as she prepares to transition from acute care. The attack resulted in the deaths of two other children and injured 18 people.</p>

          <p>A sniper positioned on a nearby rooftop opened fire on the Dallas ICE field office, killing two detainees and wounding a third before taking his own life. The Department of Homeland Security characterized the incident as an "attack on ICE law enforcement," even though only detainees were struck. The FBI is investigating the shooting as "an act of targeted violence," noting that messages found on the shooter's ammunition were anti-ICE in nature. Federal officials have called for an end to heated rhetoric against the agency, which they suggest contributed to the violence.</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has initiated an urgent review into the practice of using expensive taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments, following a BBC investigation. The report found that some individuals were taken on journeys costing hundreds of pounds, such as a 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment valued at £600. Critics from various political parties have condemned the spending as a "ridiculous waste of taxpayer money," prompting government officials to acknowledge the practice is "questionable." The investigation also shed light on poor living conditions within asylum seeker hotels.</p>

          <p>A sniper opened fire on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, killing two detainees and critically injuring a third from a nearby rooftop. The gunman, who later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly left anti-ICE messages on shell casings, leading the FBI to investigate the incident as an act of targeted violence. Department of Homeland Security officials condemned the attack, linking it to heated political rhetoric against the agency.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Clashes between police and protesters in India's northern Ladakh region have resulted in at least four deaths and dozens of injuries. The demonstrations were sparked by demands for statehood, job quotas, and special status to protect tribal areas, following the region's loss of autonomy in 2019. The unrest intensified in solidarity with activist Sonam Wangchuck, who is on a hunger strike. Authorities reported that protesters attacked a political office and set a police vehicle on fire, prompting police to open fire in what they described as self-defense.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of an $80,000 home equity loan has slightly decreased, though the change is marginal. For a 10-year loan, the monthly payment is now approximately $989, while a 15-year term would cost around $779 per month. The article notes that while these costs are lower than earlier in the year, the small difference may not be enough to spur a major rush for homeowners to leverage their equity. It advises homeowners to carefully compare these rates with other borrowing options before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Medical professionals are expressing concern over President Trump's suggestion that pregnant women should "tough it out" instead of taking acetaminophen for fevers, a claim he made while linking the drug to autism without new evidence. Doctors and organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are refuting this, emphasizing that untreated high fevers during pregnancy pose significant risks to fetal development. They reiterate that acetaminophen remains the safest over-the-counter pain and fever reliever for pregnant women and worry that the president's comments could lead patients to use more dangerous alternatives.</p>

          <p>A vaccine advisory panel appointed by the Trump administration has issued new recommendations that weaken guidance for COVID-19 shots and alter policies for certain childhood immunizations. The committee advised COVID shots based on "shared clinical decision-making" rather than a universal recommendation and voted against the combined MMRV vaccine for children under four. The changes, which break with long-standing precedent, have raised concerns among health experts about creating public confusion and bureaucratic hurdles to access. However, several states and major insurance plans have pledged to continue following the previous, broader guidelines.</p>

          <p>The UK government has once again delayed the announcement of its plans for the Northern Powerhouse Rail project, a high-speed line intended to connect northern English cities. Concerns over the long-term costs of the proposed Liverpool-to-Manchester line have reportedly prompted an extended review to avoid the budget overruns and problems that have plagued the HS2 project. The delay is a setback for the scheme, which was first proposed in 2014 to boost the regional economy. A source close to Greater Manchester's mayor expressed frustration, stating, "Any more tyre kicking and there will be no tyre left."</p>

When asked about the culture within the Prime Minister's office, Phillipson acknowledged that some people in government and the wider party have felt left out.

The data shows a 300% spike in delinquencies of 90-119 days past due for this group, signaling that widespread economic pressures are affecting households previously considered financially stable. With credit card balances and utilization rates high, the article suggests strategies to avoid missed payments, such as debt consolidation and proactive communication with lenders.

          <p>This essay argues that the United States is transitioning into a form of modern authoritarianism where democratic institutions are hollowed out rather than overthrown, creating a "zombie democracy." The author asserts that the nation now displays key features of such regimes: a compromised judiciary, a legislature that rubber-stamps executive power, and the use of state power to reward friends and punish enemies. The piece contends that the public is kept passive through distraction and confusion, while the leader polarizes society into "us" and "them." It concludes that Americans are actively participating in this democratic erosion.</p>

          <p>Several rare and massive "pink meanie" jellyfish have washed ashore on the Texas Gulf coast, a species only officially identified in 2011. These striking creatures, which can have tentacles up to 70 feet long and weigh over 50 pounds, get their name from their bright pink color. According to researchers, their sting is relatively mild, and their primary diet consists of smaller moon jellyfish, whose populations they follow. The presence of these unusual jellyfish, which thrive in warm water, has surprised local beachgoers and researchers alike.</p>

          <p>This podcast transcript features a discussion with historian Geoffrey Kabaservice, comparing the political violence and polarization of the 1960s and 1970s to the current era in the United States. While the earlier period saw more actual violence, including numerous bombings and high-profile assassinations, it also began from a place of greater societal hope and cohesion. The analysis suggests a key difference today is that top government officials actively use division as a political resource, whereas leaders in the 1960s often adopted a public message of unity. The discussion explores how technology contributes to today's tensions.</p>

          <p>A new "Planet Health Check" report from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research warns that Earth's vital systems are under severe stress, with seven of nine key planetary boundaries now breached. The report uses a medical analogy, describing "patient Earth" as being in danger with multiple systems failing simultaneously, including the biosphere, climate, and freshwater resources. Areas like species extinction and pollution from novel substances like plastics and chemicals are in the "code red" high-risk zone. The only two boundaries remaining within a safe zone are air pollution and the ozone layer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas is intended to encourage companies to hire American workers, but economists predict a mixed outcome. Some believe it could boost domestic hiring in the short term, particularly in the tech sector, by making foreign labor significantly more expensive. However, other research suggests that restricting access to skilled immigrant workers could harm firms' growth, innovation, and overall job creation in the long run. The White House maintains the policy is a common-sense action to protect Americans from cheap foreign labor and prevent abuse of the visa system.</p>

An administration official stated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to reduce risk for taxpayers.

The woman's dismembered body was found in burlap sacks in the Willamette River in 1946, but critical evidence, including her remains, went missing from police custody in the 1950s. Investigators recently learned the remains were likely interred at a local cemetery and have now exhumed them.
