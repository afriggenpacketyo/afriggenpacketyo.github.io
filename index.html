          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the collision of a Mexican navy ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, with the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in two fatalities and multiple injuries. The NTSB is awaiting permission from the Mexican government to access the ship, and the investigation will focus on factors like wind, tide, and engine status. A timeline indicates the ship began backing away from Pier 17 with a tugboat, requested assistance from additional tugboats, and then struck the bridge within minutes. The U.S. Coast Guard clarified that its Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) was fully functional during the incident.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped nearly 17% during its Hong Kong trading debut, marking the largest global listing in 2025. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), with funds allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. CATL's global expansion occurs amidst increasing competition and trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Chinese EVs and the company's placement on a U.S. military watchlist, which CATL denies. The company's 2024 annual revenue saw a 9.7% drop due to intense competition in China, though net profit increased by 15%.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, along with the leaders of France and Canada, has joined in condemning Israel's actions in Gaza, calling for a halt to military operations and the immediate allowance of humanitarian aid. The leaders criticized Israel's blockade, which has prevented essential supplies from entering Gaza since March, describing the level of suffering as intolerable. They also urged Hamas to release the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack. The statement reiterated support for a ceasefire and a two-state solution, while Netanyahu rejected the demands, viewing them as rewarding Hamas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of CATL, the worldâ€™s largest EV battery maker, surged in their Hong Kong debut, but U.S. onshore investors were largely blocked from participating due to escalating tensions between the United States and China. The company was labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, and U.S. lawmakers had called on Wall Street banks to withdraw from the Hong Kong listing. CATL altered its share sale to a Reg S offering, preventing sales to U.S. onshore investors and exempting it from certain regulatory filings in the United States. This move is seen as a sign of increasing financial decoupling between the two countries, potentially limiting U.S. investors' access to profitable opportunities.</p>

Eto later clarified that his wife does buy rice when donated supplies run out. Factors contributing to the rice shortfall include poor harvests due to hot weather and panic-buying prompted by a "megaquake" warning.</p>

          <p>China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States. This influx contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift reflects changing global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from US dollar assets due to President Trump's trade war. The Bank of America noted that a weaker US dollar and China's economic recovery are driving investment towards emerging markets.</p>

The Minnesota fires, including the Jenkins Creek Fire, Camp House Road Fire, and Munger Shaw Fire, cover approximately 30,000 acres. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is leading the Munger Shaw fight, while the Eastern Area Complex Incident Team manages the Jenkins Creek and Camp House fires as the "Brimson Complex."

The report analyzed immigration data for a portion of those deported to El Salvadorâ€™s Terrorism Confinement Center, finding that 21 men were admitted after presenting themselves at a port of entry, 24 were granted parole, four were resettled as refugees, and one entered on a tourist visa. This contradicts the Trump administration's claim that only undocumented individuals were deported.</p>

          <p>China's central bank cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, as Beijing intensifies efforts to stimulate its economy. The 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) was reduced to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This decision follows moves by state-backed commercial lenders to reduce their deposit rates, paving the way for lower lending rates. Analysts predict further policy easing by the PBOC, with forecasts of additional lending rate cuts by year-end.</p>
