          <p>President Trump indicated a "good chance" he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to broker an end to the ongoing war. The potential summit comes as a Friday deadline approaches for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face significant new U.S. sanctions. Trump’s envoy recently had what was described as a "highly productive" meeting in Moscow, signaling a potential shift in negotiations. The administration has already increased pressure on Russia's trading partners, imposing additional tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, highlighting the use of economic leverage.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions with the United States, China is utilizing its control over the global supply of rare earths as a strategic countermeasure. These critical minerals are essential for a vast array of technologies, including consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and advanced defense systems. The article explains that with China responsible for most of the world's refining capacity and a significant portion of U.S. imports, Beijing's export controls could severely impact American industries and military readiness. This move mirrors the U.S. strategy of using export bans on technology, turning the tables in the ongoing economic rivalry.</p>

          <p>President Trump, alongside Apple CEO Tim Cook, announced that the tech giant is increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total four-year commitment to $600 billion. The investment is expected to create 20,000 new jobs and includes plans for a smart glass manufacturing line in Kentucky and a server facility in Houston. This move is part of a broader White House initiative to reshore critical supply chains and production to the United States. The announcement follows previous pressure from the president, who has threatened tariffs on iPhones made outside the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared his intention to impose a 100% tariff on all imported semiconductors and computer chips to incentivize domestic production. However, he specified that companies actively building or committed to building manufacturing facilities in the United States would be exempt from this duty. The announcement represents a significant escalation in the administration's "Made in America" trade policy, targeting a critical component used across nearly every modern industry. While the move is designed to pressure businesses to relocate production, specific details regarding the exemption criteria were not immediately provided, creating uncertainty for the tech sector.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that President Trump's repeated, unsubstantiated claims of election rigging are a form of projection, as he himself actively works to manipulate political and governmental processes. The author points to Trump's open encouragement of Republican-led states to redraw congressional maps mid-decade as a prime example of attempting to fix future elections. The piece also cites other instances, such as pressuring the Bureau of Labor Statistics and using emergency powers for tariffs, as evidence of a broader pattern of bending rules and norms.

Cuomo called on Mamdani to divest from the property, stating "silence is violence" and drawing a parallel to Mamdani's own support for sanctions against Israel. The criticism also highlighted reports of Mamdani's recent wedding in Uganda, which was protected by armed guards, a fact critics find hypocritical given his past calls to defund the police.

While both offer competitive interest rates, the CD provides a fixed rate, guaranteeing a predictable return, whereas the money market account rate is variable and could fall if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Based on current rates, the 6-month CD would earn slightly more over the period.

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Efforts to Distract from Epstein Story Only Intensify Scrutiny</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes President Trump's attempts to shift public focus away from his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The author argues that the president's tactics—including ordering supporters to stop discussing it, creating distractions, and selectively releasing information—have largely backfired by creating more suspicion. Each move, from a White House roof walk to a lawsuit against a newspaper, is interpreted by many as an effort to divert attention, which ironically brings the focus back to Epstein. The article suggests that Trump's heated denials and clumsy maneuvers are fueling public interest rather than quelling it.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended $584 million in federal grants for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), citing alleged civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The move targets funding from major bodies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. UCLA's chancellor warned the suspension would be "devastating" for life-saving research and Americans who depend on it. This action follows a similar pattern seen with other universities, like Columbia, and comes as UCLA recently settled a lawsuit with Jewish students over pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024.</p>

Investigators used the manufacturing date of the boot to link it to the 1997 cold case. White had disappeared while on a fishing trip, with only his empty boat, a shoe, and a hat found at the time. DNA from the foot was matched with a sample from his daughter, confirming the identity with near-certainty.

          <p>Claire's, the mall-based retailer known for teen accessories and ear piercing, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time since 2018.

The filing reflects the broader decline of traditional brick-and-mortar retail and the decreasing popularity of shopping malls. While its North American stores will remain open during the process, the company's future is uncertain as it contends with shifting consumer trends and the economic impact of tariffs on its imported goods.</p>

          <p>The White House's decision to block a transit stop in New York for Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats but has been met with conspicuous silence from Republicans. This muted response is a significant departure for the GOP, which has historically been a vocal supporter of high-level engagement with Taiwan. The article notes that some observers speculate the shift in Republican posture may be linked to sensitive, high-stakes trade negotiations currently underway between the U.S. and China. Three prominent House Democrats sent a letter expressing "grave concern" over the move, calling it a departure from precedent.</p>

          <p>This article explores how Democrats' previous advocacy for nonpartisan, independent redistricting commissions has left them at a disadvantage in the current political landscape. As Republicans, urged by President Trump, move to aggressively redraw congressional maps in states like Texas to secure their House majority, Democrats in states like New York and California face legal and procedural hurdles to counter-gerrymander. The very good-government reforms they championed now tie their hands, requiring lengthy processes to amend state constitutions. This has led to a reassessment within the Democratic party, with some now calling to match the GOP's tactics to prevent permanent one-party control.</p>

          <p>A power struggle has emerged within America250, the bipartisan commission established by Congress to organize the nation's 250th-anniversary celebration. The conflict began after President Trump's team politicized the event with partisan rallies and his top appointee at the commission, Ariel Abergel, asked four Republican-appointed commissioners to resign. The commissioners refused, and the move backfired, leading to discussions about removing Abergel himself. This turmoil threatens to derail the planning for the 2026 semiquincentennial, which was intended to be a unifying national event but is now mired in a fight for political control and branding.</p>

          <p>A new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has uncovered evidence of mass-produced, fraudulent scientific research being systematically published.

The study identified clusters of editors at one journal who handled a disproportionate number of retracted articles. This proliferation of fake science pollutes the academic record, makes legitimate research difficult, and threatens to erode trust in the entire scientific enterprise.</p>
