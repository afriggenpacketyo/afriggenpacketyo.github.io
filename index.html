          <h2>Retailers Warn of Price Increases Due to US Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Several major retailers, including Pandora, Puma, and Hugo Boss, are evaluating their pricing strategies in the United States and globally in response to President Trump's proposed reciprocal tariffs. These companies, heavily reliant on manufacturing in Asia, anticipate potential price increases across the affordable jewelry and sportswear industries. While some retailers are considering optimizing their supply chains, the uncertainty surrounding tariffs, recession risks, and immigration policy is dampening consumer spending, particularly in the U.S., which is the largest single market for some of these brands.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow underscores China's growing role in supporting Russia's economy, which has been weakened by Western sanctions related to the Ukraine war. China has become Russia's top economic partner, increasing bilateral trade significantly, especially in energy, with Russia now being China's top source of crude oil imports. While maintaining neutrality in the Ukraine war, China's economic support provides Russia with access to manufactured goods and technologies, helping sustain its war efforts, although US secondary sanctions pose challenges to further expansion of Sino-Russian trade. The proposed Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline is a key project under discussion, aiming to increase Russian gas exports to China, highlighting Russia's increasing dependence on China.</p>

          <p>Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers have been convicted of criminal damage for felling the Sycamore Gap tree, a landmark adjacent to Hadrian’s Wall in northern England. The tree, which stood for over a century, was illegally cut down in September 2023, causing widespread shock and anger. Prosecutors presented evidence, including video footage and messages, indicating the two men acted together in what they called a "moronic mission." Despite both men denying involvement, the jury found them guilty, and they will be sentenced in July. Sprouts have been spotted near the base of the stump, offering hope for new life.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 06:45:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite tariffs imposed by the U.S. government on imported aluminum, domestic aluminum production has not revived due to high electricity costs in the U.S. compared to global competitors. The tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, as the delivery premium now largely reflects the tariff cost. Downstream users are bearing the brunt of these costs, leading to price increases for consumers, while aluminum smelters in the U.S. struggle to compete due to the lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power, with the tech sector further increasing demand for electricity. The tariffs are causing a reshuffling of trade flows, as metal flows to other destinations where market access is less costly.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between India and Pakistan intensifies, particularly in the disputed region of Kashmir, tensions have reached levels unseen since 1971. The recent escalation involves strikes on both sides, including the unprecedented use of drones and missiles targeting populated areas. The current situation is exacerbated by a surge of disinformation on social media and television, making accurate reporting difficult and contributing to widespread panic. Despite India's economic growth and technological advancements, the risks of a broader conflict have increased, as advanced weapons and drones make borders irrelevant and turn every part of the country into a potential target.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security service (SBU) claims to have exposed a spy network run by Hungarian military intelligence, aimed at gathering information about Ukraine's defenses near the shared border. Two alleged Hungarian spies, former members of the Ukrainian military, have been detained and accused of collecting data on air defense systems and law enforcement activities in the Zakarpattia region. The SBU alleges the spies were supervised by a Hungarian intelligence officer, receiving money and communication devices in return. The Hungarian government has not yet responded to these claims, which mark the first time Ukraine has uncovered a Hungarian spy network operating against its interests.</p>

Barkley noted that the widespread criticism following Belichick's interview with "CBS News Sunday Morning," where Hudson shut down a question about their meeting, is overshadowing his accomplishments. Barkley emphasized Belichick's status as the greatest coach ever and voiced his disappointment that the current focus is on personal matters rather than his historic 24-season run with the New England Patriots.

          <p>President Trump's repeated public criticisms of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell are raising concerns about the independence of the central bank and its potential impact on the US economy. Trump has attacked Powell for not lowering interest rates, arguing that high rates are no longer necessary to curb inflation, which is now under 3 percent. Experts warn that such political interference in monetary policy could lead to undesirable boom-bust cycles and higher inflation, citing examples of countries like Venezuela and Turkey where political control over central banks led to economic crises. Independent central banks generally have a better track record than those governed by political interests.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate detained by immigration authorities after the Trump administration revoked her student visa, is awaiting a bail hearing. Ozturk's lawyers argue her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, alleging her visa was revoked due to her criticism of Israel and participation in pro-Palestinian protests. Tufts president Sunil Kumar has defended Ozturk, stating the university has no information to support the allegations against her. Ozturk, who has suffered asthma attacks in ICE detention, is currently held in Louisiana and will appear remotely for the hearing.</p>

Means cites that a large percentage of Americans suffer from metabolic dysfunction, often overlooked in favor of pills and treatments rather than prevention. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight are essential for metabolic health, although many face challenges due to limited education and access to healthy resources.</p>

          <p>A neuroscientist argues against the simple idea of instinct, stating that the term is confusing and unhelpful. He uses the phrase “species-typical” behavior instead. He says it's a behavior that is typical to a species, but it doesn’t presume anything about where it came from or what’s controlling it or whether learning is involved or whether genes are involved. He explains that habitual behaviors are not just rooted in the mind, but also shaped by the environment, learning, and physical abilities. By examining the behaviors of animals, we can learn a lot about the complexities of our own actions, especially since humans are animals.</p>

While a baby bonus may be a good idea, a renewed expansion of the child tax credit would be a more effective first step in investing in mothers and promoting the well-being of American children.</p>
