          <p>Retail investors invested over $24 million in Berkshire Hathaway's Class B stock, demonstrating confidence in incoming CEO Greg Abel despite Warren Buffett's announcement to step down as CEO at year-end. The stock experienced a 5% decline following Buffett's announcement, yet the net inflows into the stock surged, indicating strong investor belief in the company's future under Abel's leadership. Buffett, who plans to remain as chairman, praised Abel and assured shareholders he would not sell his shares, reinforcing stability. This investor behavior shows a continuing faith in Berkshire's prospects, even with the change in leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elite law firms are increasingly declining pro bono work on lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's policies, fearing retribution from the White House. This shift marks a significant change from Trump's first term, when many firms actively challenged the administration. Some firms have reached deals with the White House to avoid executive orders that could cripple their businesses, while others are avoiding involvement altogether. Public interest groups are struggling to find legal support for immigration cases and other challenges to the administration's agenda, highlighting a chilling effect on legal opposition.

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military will cease bombing Houthi rebels in Yemen after the group allegedly agreed to halt attacks on American vessels in the Red Sea. Trump stated that the Houthis "capitulated" and promised to end hostilities, leading the U.S. to take their word, though the Houthis have not publicly confirmed this agreement. Oman's foreign ministry claimed to have brokered the ceasefire, ensuring freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, a statement supported by the White House. However, the Houthis' prior statements indicated continued resistance against Israeli and American aggression, raising questions about the stability of the supposed truce.</p>

One site near Bejucal shows recent upgrades, including new antennas, enhancing Cuba's ability to monitor military and commercial activity across the southeastern US. Lawmakers are urging the Trump administration to adopt a firmer stance on this issue, highlighting the potential security implications of China's surveillance capabilities in close proximity to American territory.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can enforce a ban on transgender troops serving in the military, overturning lower court decisions that had blocked the policy. This ruling allows the ban to proceed while legal challenges continue, with the court's liberal members dissenting. The ban, initiated through an executive order, revokes a previous order that allowed transgender service members to serve openly, citing conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable lifestyle.
