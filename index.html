          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has voted for Greg Abel to become the CEO on January 1, 2026, while Warren Buffett will remain as chairman. This decision aims to provide stability and experience during the transition, especially with Berkshire Hathaway holding over $347 billion in cash. Buffett indicated he could assist with major acquisition opportunities amid volatile markets. Despite the announcement and somewhat disappointing earnings, Berkshire shares experienced only a slight dip in premarket trading, having closed at a record high the previous day. The market's reaction reflects confidence in the company's future leadership and financial position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell after OPEC+ agreed to increase production in June, adding 411,000 barrels per day to the market. This decision follows a similar production increase in May and has led to concerns about an oversupplied market. Oil prices have already fallen more than 20% this year, impacted by tariffs and fears of a recession slowing demand. Oilfield service firms anticipate reduced investment in exploration and production due to the weak price environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This change comes after criticism of the initial 100% rate, though experts still warn that even a 50% clawback can cause significant financial hardship for affected beneficiaries. Overpayments can occur for various reasons, such as unreported changes in circumstances or agency errors. Beneficiaries have 90 days to request a lower withholding rate or a waiver of recovery, otherwise, the agency will withhold up to 50% of their benefits until the overpayment is recovered.</p>

          <p>An article argues that former President Trump's policies, particularly his trade agenda, have undermined the U.S. dollar's position as the world's reserve currency. The article explains that the dollar's strength relies on America's economic and political stability, which Trump's erratic trade policies have called into question. Investors are reportedly moving capital out of U.S. assets due to concerns about Trump's approach to international agreements and economic norms. A decline in the dollar's reserve status could lead to higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government and a reduction in Americans' living standards.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry. He argues that other countries offer incentives that attract filmmakers away from Hollywood, posing a national security threat. The proposal has raised questions about its scope, including whether it would apply to American production companies filming abroad and to streaming services. Industry unions have warned that the tariffs could harm the film industry's recovery, while other countries have vowed to defend their own film sectors.</p>

          <p>An article argues that Trump's tariffs, despite lacking economic justification, signal a shift in capitalism toward protectionism. This move aims to safeguard a particular way of life, potentially at the expense of others, by purportedly generating well-paying factory jobs. The author contends that such economic strategies require a new spirit, moving beyond unbridled greed and injustice to a more democratizing approach. This new spirit should prioritize collective well-being and ensure decent lives for all, emphasizing fair trade, industrial policy, worker representation, and cooperatively owned businesses.</p>

GM President Mark Reuss has spearheaded a product renaissance, aiming to restore Cadillac's prominence through all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the flagship Escalade. The strategy involves differentiating Cadillac from other GM brands, focusing on value over volume, and prioritizing consistency in brand management. Challenges remain, including declining sales in China, but Cadillac is showing momentum in North America with increased sales and lower incentives.</p>
