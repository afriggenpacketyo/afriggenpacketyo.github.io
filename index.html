          <p>President Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners has sent global markets into a tailspin, sparking fears of economic and geopolitical instability. The plan involves slapping a 10% tariff on every U.S. trading partner, potentially rising to over 20%, a level unseen since 1910. China retaliated with 34% tariffs, and the EU considers countermeasures, leading to a massive two-day sell-off, wiping out $6 trillion in value. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the tariffs would likely boost inflation and dent economic growth, further dampening market sentiment. (not investment advice)

          <p>A recent study in Wales suggests that older adults who received the shingles vaccine were 20% less likely to develop dementia over a seven-year period. Researchers compared individuals just eligible for the vaccine (age 79) to those just ineligible (age 80), creating a natural experiment. The findings suggest a potential link between preventing shingles and reducing neural inflammation, a known factor in cognitive decline. This study supports growing research indicating that neurodegenerative diseases may be linked to viral infections, opening new avenues for preventive treatments.</p>

This new model provides an outlet for activists but may leave many dissenters without the collective impact of large-scale demonstrations.

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to dismantle environmental programs are projected to have significant negative consequences for public health and the economy. Reports indicate that repealing environmental regulations could lead to increased premature deaths, asthma attacks, and financial burdens for Americans. Critics argue that these rollbacks prioritize industry interests over the well-being of citizens and the environment. The administration defends its actions as necessary to reduce regulatory costs and stimulate economic growth, but experts warn of disproportionate impacts on vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>TikTok creators in the U.S. are experiencing emotional exhaustion due to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the app's future. The threat of a ban, followed by extensions and potential sales, has left creators feeling fatigued and disengaged. Experts attribute this fatigue to chronic stress, a lack of control, and the use of TikTok as a "political football." Strategies for coping with this emotional exhaustion include connecting with others, remembering past resilience, and taking breaks from the platform.</p>

          <p>The effort to rebuild three LA Unified schools damaged in the Palisades fire has reached a milestone with the removal of all debris from the properties. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho detailed rebuilding plans that aim to get students back to campuses quickly. The district will use a construction bond and insurance policies to fund the project and seek reimbursement from FEMA. The district is using an expedited process that could reduce the rebuilding timeline by as much as 50%.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs could make Apple's iPhones more expensive, impacting both the company and consumers. Apple relies on a global supply chain, with most iPhones manufactured in China. The tariffs could disrupt this supply chain, increasing production costs. While Apple could shift production to other countries, it would be a costly and time-consuming process. Some analysts estimate that the tariffs could add thousands of dollars to the price of an iPhone. (not investment advice)

          <p>Los Angeles' Measure ULA, a transfer tax on high-value properties, is facing calls for reform due to its negative impacts on the housing market and city revenue. The tax, intended to fund low-income housing, has led to a significant drop in high-value property sales and has failed to meet revenue projections. Critics argue that ULA's design, including its steep "cliffs," discourages sales and hinders the production of market-rate and affordable housing. State action may be needed to reduce ULA's negative effects while preserving its goal of funding affordable housing.</p>
