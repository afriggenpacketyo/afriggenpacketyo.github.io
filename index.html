          <p>Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly of Virginia passed away at the age of 75, as announced by his office on Wednesday morning. Connolly had served in Congress since 2009 and was a strong advocate for federal workers, especially in opposing actions by the Trump administration and Elon Musk. Last month, Connolly stepped down from his leadership position on the House Oversight Committee due to his cancer returning after initially being diagnosed with esophageal cancer in November. His family expressed pride in his enduring legacy and his dedication to Northern Virginia for nearly four decades.</p>

          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, buoyed by increasing sales to home professionals, which compensated for slower demand from do-it-yourself consumers. The home improvement retailer narrowly missed quarterly sales expectations but surpassed earnings estimates, leading to a nearly 2% rise in premarket trading of Lowe's shares. CEO Marvin Ellison credited investments in stores, technology, and customer service for navigating near-term market uncertainties. Lowe's anticipates full-year sales between $83.5 billion and $84.5 billion, with comparable sales projected to remain flat to increase by 1% year over year.</p>

          <p>Target CEO Brian Cornell cautioned about the substantial potential costs associated with tariffs, stating that the company would only resort to raising prices as a last measure. This announcement follows similar warnings from major retailers like Walmart and Best Buy, highlighting widespread concern over tariff impacts. Target reported a sales decline in its recent quarter, attributing it to consumer anxieties over tariffs and backlash from the rollback of its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. Sales decreased by 2.8% compared to the previous year, falling short of analyst expectations.</p>

          <p>Currently, 25 states have enacted laws regulating or banning cellphones in schools, reflecting a growing consensus that these devices negatively impact children. Connecticut State Representative Jennifer Leeper described phones as a 'cancer on our kids,' citing their role in increasing isolation and decreasing attention spans. While Florida initially banned phones only during instructional time, a new bill seeks to extend the ban throughout the entire school day for elementary and middle schools. There is a growing consensus around exceptions, with most states allowing electronic devices for medical needs and special education plans.</p>

The central bank noted atypical shifts away from traditional safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar.

          <p>The pregnancy of a brain-dead woman in Georgia has sparked legal and ethical debates concerning the state's abortion law. Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old brain-dead nurse, is being kept on life support to maintain her pregnancy, citing Georgia's LIFE Act, which bans most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected. Democratic State Senator Nabilah Islam Parkes has requested clarity from Georgia's Attorney General Chris Carr on how the abortion law should be applied in this context, calling it a 'grotesque distortion of medical ethics and human decency.'

          <p>Target has lowered its full-year sales outlook, attributing the decline to weaker consumer spending, uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and negative reactions to the company's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. First-quarter sales fell nearly 3% year-over-year, missing Wall Street expectations, with transactions and average customer spending also decreasing. CEO Brian Cornell acknowledged the challenges and announced the creation of an Enterprise Acceleration Office to streamline operations and boost growth. The company now anticipates a low-single digit sales decline for the fiscal year, and adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $7 and $9.</p>

Despite working through a lengthy committee session that extended into the early morning, they have yet to finalize changes needed to win over holdouts. The bill, known as the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, proposes tax cuts, increased military and border security funding, and reductions in Medicaid, food assistance, and clean energy programs, and it is facing criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans over its potential impact on the national debt and social programs.</p>

Meanwhile, the governor of neighboring Shizuoka Prefecture has urged the central government to find ways to cover the costs of rescue operations.</p>
