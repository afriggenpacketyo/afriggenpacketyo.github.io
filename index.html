          <p>Charles Rangel, the longtime U.S. congressman from New York City and the last surviving member of the "Gang of Four," has died at the age of 94. Rangel, a Harlem native, served in the House of Representatives for 46 years, earning a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for his service in the Korean War. He was also the first Black chair of the House's influential Ways and Means Committee and was instrumental in the creation of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation. However, Rangel's career was also marked by ethics violations, leading to a censure by the House in 2010, though he was reelected to two more terms. The passing of Rangel marks the end of an era for Harlem's political leadership and a significant loss for the community he served for decades.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests that the official unemployment rate may not accurately reflect the economic well-being of many Americans. According to LISEP, the "true rate" of unemployment, which includes those seeking full-time work but unable to find it and those in poverty-wage jobs, stood at 24.3% in April, significantly higher than the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate of 4.2%. This measure highlights that many individuals are struggling to afford basic necessities and are stuck in survival mode, particularly impacting Hispanic, Black, and women workers. This discrepancy between the official rate and the "true rate" may lead to poor policy decisions, neglecting the needs of middle- and low-income Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI will launch new investigations into several high-profile cases, including the 2023 discovery of cocaine at the White House, the pipe bombs found at Democratic and Republican party headquarters before January 6, 2021, and the leak of the Supreme Court's draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade. Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino announced the reinvestigations, stating that he and FBI Director Kash Patel have been evaluating cases of public interest. The investigation into the cocaine find drew commentary from Republicans, including Donald Trump, while the leak of the Supreme Court's opinion provoked condemnation, as investigations into both cases previously ended without identifying the responsible parties. The FBI is also dedicating more resources to the investigation into the placement of pipe bombs at the DNC and RNC headquarters.</p>

Navarro, seeded No. 9, lost to Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain in just 57 minutes, marking a significant setback for the 24-year-old, who had previously reached the fourth round in Paris last year. Fritz was the highest-seeded American man at the French Open since Andy Roddick in 2007, while Navarro had a strong start to the season before struggling on clay this spring.</p>

Magyar's 11-day, 300-kilometer walk aimed to address the concerns of Hungarians and signal the beginning of the end of the Orban era. Recent polls suggest Magyar and his Tisza Party could defeat Orban's Fidesz in the next election, due in 2026, as he campaigns against corruption and infrastructure issues. Magyar is also capitalizing on Orban's mistake of backing a pro-Russian candidate in Romania's presidential election, which has put Orban at odds with the political party of Romania's Hungarian minority.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest a potential vision of a world order where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their own sphere of influence. This approach involves seeking to normalize commerce with Russia and attempting to limit the fallout from the global trade war by urging China's leader to call him. Trump's desire to expand America's influence in the Western Hemisphere, coupled with criticism of allies and potential troop withdrawals, could benefit Russia and China. While some observers caution against attributing strategic intent to Trump's actions, there are signs that he and some aides are considering a return to a 19th-century style of imperial rule.</p>

          <p>Israel has faced increasing criticism from foreign leaders and aid groups, with even close allies like the United States beginning to express overt pressure. President Trump called for the war in Gaza to wind down, contrasting his earlier support for Israel. Germany and Italy have also voiced strong criticism of Israel's actions, while Britain, Canada, and France have warned of repercussions if Israel does not change course. Despite this, these countries continue to support Israel in practical ways, but the shift in tone indicates growing impatience with Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies.</p>

          <p>Federal budget cuts initiated by the Trump administration are disrupting wildfire recovery efforts in Los Angeles, impacting agencies like FEMA, the EPA, and the Army Corps of Engineers. These cuts have led to staff reductions and program cancellations, hindering the ability to provide crucial support to wildfire survivors. Lawsuits have been filed challenging these cuts, but the impact is already being felt in burn zones. The federal support is being pulled out, and disaster relief is composed of many different agencies at the local, state and federal levels.</p>

          <p>The European Union and the United States are set to begin a new round of negotiations after President Trump delayed the imposition of 50 percent tariffs on the bloc until July 9. Both sides are aiming to reach a trade deal, but significant differences remain, including European reluctance to change their consumption tax system or roll back key digital regulations. European negotiators hope to reduce tariffs that took effect in April, while the EU is refining lists of retaliatory tariffs on American imports. The goal is to find a solution before the new tariffs take effect, though the path to de-escalation remains challenging.</p>

The king’s visit is seen as reaffirming Canada’s distinct national identity and constitutional monarchy, and serves as a reminder of the historical differences between Canada and the United States.

The Crown argued that commercial semi drivers owe an enhanced duty to other road users, and the judge found that Singh's failure to perceive and react to multiple warnings was a marked departure from the expected standard of care.
