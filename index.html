          <p>The UK Prime Minister has labeled the decision to prohibit Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa as incorrect. This ban was advised by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group and supported by West Midlands Police, who classified the fixture as "high-risk" due to intelligence and past incidents of violence. The move has sparked a political debate, with critics arguing it sends a troubling message about the safety of Jewish people in Britain, while a local MP defended it as a necessary safety precaution amidst heightened tensions.</p>

          <p>US-based Micron Technology is reportedly planning to stop supplying server memory chips to data centers within mainland China. This decision follows a 2023 Chinese government ban on its products in critical infrastructure, from which the company's business has not recovered. Micron was the first American chipmaker targeted by Beijing in what was viewed as retaliation for US tech curbs. The company will reportedly continue supplying chips to China's automotive and smartphone sectors, as well as to Chinese customers with significant data center operations located outside of China.</p>

          <p>Nick Mackenzie, the CEO of the major UK pub chain Greene King, has identified coffee shops and food delivery apps as new rivals competing for consumers' leisure time and spending. He acknowledges that pubs must adapt to changing social trends, such as the growing number of people who do not drink alcohol, by improving their food and coffee offerings to create more comfortable and inclusive environments. Mackenzie also called on the government to provide "breathing space" and reform the business rates system to support the struggling hospitality industry.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is actively pursuing direct export channels to China for its fresh durians, aiming to significantly increase profits for its growers. Currently, Indonesian durians often transit through neighboring countries like Malaysia and Thailand, which assist with the necessary phytosanitary approvals and cold-chain storage required by Chinese customs. By establishing a direct route, Indonesia hopes to streamline the process, improve certification, and capture a larger share of China's massive durian market, which consumes over 90% of the world's supply.</p>

          <p>A recent study highlights a dual threat facing Shanghai, as the major coastal city is experiencing significant land subsidence while global sea levels are rising at an accelerated rate. Researchers indicate that delta regions like Shanghai are naturally prone to sinking due to their construction on soft sediment. The article emphasizes that anthropogenic activities are responsible for at least 94% of this rapid urban subsidence. This combination of sinking land and rising seas poses a severe long-term environmental and infrastructural challenge for the city.</p>

          <p>The first and only debate between Virginia's Attorney General candidates was dominated by discussion of violent text messages sent by Democratic challenger Jay Jones. Incumbent Republican Jason Miyares heavily criticized Jones for the texts, which included a message saying a former Republican House Speaker should get "two bullets to the head." Jones apologized for his words, calling them shameful and embarrassing, but also deflected by criticizing President Trump's rhetoric and Miyares's association with him. The contentious issue has brought national attention to the competitive statewide race.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral debate featured sharp exchanges between the three candidates, with President Trump's potential influence over the city looming large. The debate focused on key weaknesses: Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani's perceived lack of experience and Andrew Cuomo's character and integrity. Tensions also flared over the conflict in Gaza and policing strategies. Republican Curtis Sliwa positioned himself as an outsider, criticizing both of his opponents, while all candidates sought to define their ability to lead the city and manage its complex challenges.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have arrested a police officer in Hanover Park, Illinois, alleging he is an unlawful immigrant from Montenegro who overstayed a tourist visa that expired in 2015. The officer, Radule Bojovic, had recently graduated from the police academy and was in field training. The village mayor defended the hiring, stating that Bojovic held federal work authorization and that background checks from the FBI and Illinois State Police revealed no criminal history. The mayor added that the officer would be returned to duty if immigration proceedings permit.</p>

          <p>China has introduced sweeping new restrictions on its exports of rare earth minerals, a move that tightens its control over the global supply and escalates trade tensions with the United States. Under the new rules, foreign companies require government approval to export products containing any amount of these critical minerals, which are essential for manufacturing everything from smartphones to advanced military hardware. This action is seen as a significant strategic leverage point for Beijing in its ongoing trade disputes, prompting a strong reaction from Washington.</p>

          <p>A long-acting injection for preventing HIV, administered every two months, has been approved for use by the NHS in England and Wales, aligning policy with Scotland. The shot, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), provides an alternative to daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pills and is intended for high-risk individuals for whom daily tablets are not a practical option. Health officials and charities hope this new method will help the UK achieve its goal of ending new HIV cases by 2030 by improving access and adherence to preventative therapy.</p>
