          <p>Sir Keir Starmer announced that Kyiv ceasefire talks mark a 'significant moment', as he stated that the outcome of talks between Ukraine's allies in Kyiv marks a "significant moment" in the push to secure a ceasefire in its conflict with Russia, but admitted it was not "the end of the process". Around 30 global leaders reasserted their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire from Monday, threatening "massive" sanctions if it does not comply. Sir Keir said Trump was "absolutely clear that this is a demand that must be met". The leaders assembled in Kyiv warned that "new and massive" sanctions will be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire "in the air, at sea and on land".</p>
