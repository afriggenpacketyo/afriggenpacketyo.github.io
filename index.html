          <p>South Korean AI chip startup Rebellions has secured a new investment from Samsung as it prepares for a funding round aiming to raise up to $200 million. The company, which merged with Sapeon last year, is positioning itself as a major domestic competitor to Nvidia, focusing on AI inferencing chips. Rebellions plans to use the funds for product development and is collaborating with Samsung to manufacture its next-generation chip, named Rebel. Following this funding round, the company intends to pursue an initial public offering to further its global ambitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google is launching a new, optional "AI Mode" for its search engine in the UK, which will provide conversational, AI-generated answers instead of a traditional list of links. This feature, powered by the Gemini AI platform, has raised concerns among publishers and businesses who rely on search traffic for revenue. While Google suggests this will unlock new ways for users to seek information, critics worry it will reduce click-throughs to original sources. The company has not yet finalized how advertising will be integrated into the new AI-driven search results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement between the European Union and the United States could inadvertently benefit the United Kingdom's economy. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on EU goods imported to the U.S., which is higher than the 10% tariff rate the U.K. has secured. This difference could make British exports relatively cheaper, potentially boosting trade with the U.S. as American firms and consumers favor U.K. products. Some economists suggest this could also incentivize EU manufacturers to shift operations to the U.K. to avoid the higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India has become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., overtaking China for the first time, according to a report from Canalys. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, with shipment volumes soaring by 240%. This shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move its manufacturing supply chain away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. In contrast, China's share of smartphone exports to the U.S. fell from 61% to 25% during the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Qatar's bid to host the 2036 Summer Olympics is seen as a logical next step for the Gulf nation, but it faces significant hurdles. Key challenges include the extreme summer heat, which would likely necessitate a November schedule, disrupting the global sports calendar. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) prioritizes political and popular support, and questions remain about the validity of polling in a nation with a small local population and large migrant workforce. Furthermore, the IOC must consider the potential criticism regarding Qatar's human rights record and its broader global image.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a misconduct complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, accusing him of making improper comments about President Donald Trump.

This action escalates a conflict related to the administration's controversial deportation of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The DOJ is seeking a formal investigation and the reassignment of the case, claiming the judge's remarks violated judicial impartiality.</p>

SIA, which holds a 25.1% stake in the Indian airline, noted that Air India's financial performance was a primary drag on its bottom line.
