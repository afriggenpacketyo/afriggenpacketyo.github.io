          <p>American fund managers are urging Congress to revise Section 899 of President Trump's tax bill, fearing it could trigger a rapid withdrawal of foreign investments from the U.S. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the provision, intended to penalize firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," inadvertently impacts most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI suggests the bill could lead to capital outflows and depress U.S. equity markets, harming both companies and investors, and it is pushing for clarification to avoid discouraging foreign investment through investment funds. The Senate Finance Committee has so far declined to comment on the matter. (not investment advice)</p>

Hegseth defended the troop deployment on X, stating their role is to protect federal immigration officers and detention buildings.

          <p>New archaeological findings suggest that China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, may have sent an expedition westward in search of the elixir of life, in addition to the well-documented eastward expedition. A 37-character cliff inscription discovered near Zhaling Lake in Qinghai province, dating back to 221 BC, purportedly chronicles a state-sponsored mission to the mythical Mount Kunlun seeking the elixir. While some hail this discovery as potentially rewriting history, leading scholars remain skeptical, questioning its authenticity and reigniting debates about Kunlun's true location.

          <p>Following a protest over an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, disorder broke out with masked individuals throwing objects at police and setting houses on fire. Jim Allister, the area's MP, condemned the violence as "unwanted and unwarranted," linking it to demographic changes due to immigration. The protest occurred after two teenage boys appeared in court, accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl. Hundreds participated in a peaceful march earlier in the day, but violence escalated later on, requiring police intervention.</p>

Toyota has said the acquisition would allow Toyota Industries to deepen collaboration with group companies, without concerns of short-term profit targets.
