          <p>The U.S. government remains in a protracted shutdown after the Senate failed for the eighth time to advance a Republican funding bill, highlighting deep partisan divisions. This ongoing legislative impasse has left numerous federal agencies unfunded, causing widespread disruptions to essential public services and creating significant uncertainty for federal employees. The protracted stalemate underscores a critical lack of consensus on national budget priorities, raising concerns about its long-term impact on the economy and government functionality. The inability to secure funding is leading to furloughs and operational challenges across various sectors, exacerbating public frustration.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials have declared a state of emergency in response to ongoing federal immigration raids, aiming to mobilize resources and provide critical support to affected communities. The proclamation, passed by a 4-1 vote, grants the county powers to assist residents financially impacted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions, including offering rent relief and legal aid. Supervisors emphasized that these federal actions have caused widespread fear, disrupted local economies, and strained essential services like schools and hospitals. This declaration, introduced by Supervisors Lindsey P. Horvath and Janice Hahn, underscores a proactive local effort to protect and stabilize vulnerable immigrant populations and mitigate the raids' adverse effects.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed several health bills this week, primarily focusing on safeguarding children from the negative impacts of artificial intelligence and social media. New laws require AI companies to incorporate guardrails preventing chatbots from discussing self-harm with minors and to disclose their non-human nature every three hours. Additionally, penalties for creating non-consensual AI-generated sexual assault imagery are increased, and social media platforms will mandate warning labels for minors. These comprehensive legislative actions aim to enhance online safety and address growing concerns over technology's influence on youth mental health and well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sanae Takaichi's path to becoming Japan's first female prime minister has narrowed significantly following the abrupt withdrawal of coalition partner Komeito from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. This unexpected move has created an opportunity for opposition parties, particularly the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, to seek unity around a potential consensus candidate like Yuichiro Tamaki. The political landscape is now highly fluid, with the prime ministerial vote postponed and uncertainty surrounding the LDP's ability to maintain its majority. Some analysts, however, suggest that the coalition's collapse might paradoxically enable the LDP to pursue previously stalled policy goals more freely.</p>

          <p>A driver in Central California was issued a $197 fine after the California Highway Patrol stopped their Nissan Sentra for displaying a homemade license plate. The driver's creative handiwork, which mimicked official plates with "California" lettering, the DMV's website, and a registration sticker, was ultimately deemed unlawful by the CHP. While acknowledging the driver's ingenuity on social media, authorities emphasized that state law strictly requires proper, state-issued license plates for all vehicles. This unusual incident serves as a lighthearted yet firm reminder to motorists about adhering to legal vehicle registration standards and avoiding such artistic deviations.</p>

Plaintiffs argue the ban violates the Second Amendment by prohibiting commonly owned handguns, asserting that semiautomatic pistols are neither dangerous nor unusual.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Hamas must disarm and demilitarize as a non-negotiable condition for lasting peace, echoing President Trump's warning that failure to comply could lead to renewed conflict. While the recent U.S.-brokered deal secured the release of living hostages, the return of deceased remains and Hamas's disarmament remain highly contentious issues. Netanyahu expressed hope for a peaceful next phase, citing the Abraham Accords as a model for broader regional peace. This article highlights the critical and unresolved issues that continue to threaten the fragile ceasefire and future stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced his administration plans to release a list of "Democrat programs" slated for permanent closure due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, following the Senate's eighth failure to pass funding legislation. This move marks an unprecedented use of a shutdown for large-scale, permanent firings, with over 4,100 federal workers already laid off across seven agencies. The dismissals are expected to significantly disrupt government operations, including crucial disease outbreak investigations. This development intensifies the political blame game and underscores the severe, lasting impact of the protracted legislative impasse.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva stated that the global economy's resilience is significantly aided by most countries' decision not to retaliate against President Trump's tariffs, thus preventing a debilitating trade war. The IMF slightly raised its 2025 global GDP growth forecast, though it issued a warning that a renewed U.S.-China trade conflict could substantially slow output. Other factors supporting global growth include better national policies and corporate agility in rearranging supply chains. Georgieva also cautioned about stretched valuations in global markets, particularly within the tech sector, which has fueled a stellar market rally this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major three-year study has conclusively found that specially designed group singing classes are clinically effective in treating new mothers suffering from postnatal depression, offering a potentially cost-effective alternative to traditional mental health services. The "Melodies for Mums" program, which incorporates lullabies, folk, and gospel songs, helped participants significantly reduce symptoms, with improvements lasting six months post-intervention. Researchers suggest the therapeutic benefits stem from the social connection with peers, shared experiences, and the inherent relaxing effect of singing itself. This initiative represents a promising non-pharmacological approach to improving maternal mental health.</p>

Milei, facing midterm elections and economic turmoil, blamed his country's financial woes on political adversaries.
