          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest commercial flight performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 bomber while landing in Minot, North Dakota. In a calm address to passengers, the pilot explained that the military aircraft was not communicated to them by the airport's control tower, which operates visually without radar. The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover of the North Dakota State Fair. The Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force are now investigating the near-collision to determine the cause of the communication breakdown. The incident concluded without injury, with passengers applauding the pilot's quick actions.</p>

          <p>A four-year-old child was seriously injured after being attacked by a mountain lion while on a popular trail with family in Olympic National Park. Park staff and paramedics responded quickly, and the child was airlifted to a Seattle hospital for treatment. Following the incident, park rangers located and euthanized the collared cougar responsible for the attack, stating there is no longer a threat to the public. The National Park Service is conducting an investigation into the circumstances of the attack and has asked any witnesses to come forward with information. The child's specific condition has not been released to protect the family's privacy.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has issued a warning about active cyberattacks targeting a significant vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint server software, a tool widely used by businesses and governments for collaboration. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) alerted that the flaw allows attackers unauthenticated access to execute code and steal sensitive data. Security researchers at Palo Alto Networks believe thousands of organizations globally have likely been compromised, with attackers already establishing backdoors. Microsoft has released patches for the affected SharePoint versions and urged customers to apply them immediately to mitigate the serious threat.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was previously deported in what was called an administrative error, have asked a federal judge to delay his potential release from criminal custody for 30 days. Abrego Garcia is currently facing human smuggling charges in Tennessee but is also at risk of being detained by immigration authorities for deportation upon release. The requested delay would allow his legal team time to navigate the complex situation and challenge the likely removal proceedings by the Department of Homeland Security. This case highlights the intricate legal battles individuals can face between the criminal justice and immigration systems.</p>

          <p>A two-person non-profit in Connecticut is working to restore the health of the Long Island Sound by returning used oyster shells to the water. The organization, Collective Oyster Recycling and Restoration, collects discarded shells from over 50 local restaurants. These shells provide an ideal surface for new baby oysters to grow, which in turn helps filter the water, prevent erosion, and create a habitat for hundreds of other species. This initiative is part of a broader effort along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts to rebuild crucial oyster beds that have been depleted by overfishing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has publicly released over 200,000 pages of previously sealed government records related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The release was made despite objections from King's family, who urged the public to view the files within the context of the FBI's historical surveillance and disinformation campaigns against the civil rights leader. In a statement, King's children reiterated their belief that their father was the victim of a broader conspiracy and expressed concern that the documents could be weaponized to spread falsehoods.

This approach has led to an unprecedented level of tension with the judiciary, with the administration questioning judges' legitimacy and some judges facing threats.

          <h2>Trump Administration to 'Flood the Zone' in Sanctuary Cities with ICE Agents</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 18:13:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tom Homan, Donald Trump’s border czar, has announced a new operational focus on so-called sanctuary cities, vowing to “flood the zone” with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The move was framed as a response to a recent shooting of an officer in New York City, allegedly by an undocumented individual. Homan stated that if local jails do not cooperate with ICE, agents will make arrests in the community, potentially detaining others present who are in the country illegally. This aggressive new phase in the administration's deportation drive targets Democrat-run cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Presidential Pettiness Characterizes Trump's Second Term</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 18:12:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic posits that Donald Trump's second term is animated more by personal pettiness and retribution than by a coherent governing philosophy. The article argues that many administration policies and actions are driven by a small-minded vengefulness, citing examples such as renaming military bases, barring a former intelligence director from a CIA event, and the president's shifting stance on Ukraine. According to the author, this approach taints the executive branch and substitutes culture-war grievances for substantive solutions to national problems, a style that may eventually alienate even his most dedicated supporters.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has received approval from the Pentagon to use two U.S. military bases, one in New Jersey and one in Indiana, for the purpose of detaining immigrants. According to correspondence obtained by NPR, the plan also includes increasing detention capacity at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to significantly increase the number of detained immigrants as it carries out a large-scale deportation campaign. The use of military facilities for this purpose has been condemned by some lawmakers as an inappropriate use of defense resources.</p>

          <p>A brief report from NPR highlights Emil Bove, one of President Trump's most controversial judicial nominees, as a key figure in the administration's ongoing efforts to reshape the federal judiciary. The piece notes that during his first term, Trump successfully appointed numerous conservative judges, often selected with help from the Federalist Society. As the nominations process restarts, Bove's potential appointment is presented as emblematic of a new wave of judicial picks aligned with the administration's political and legal agenda. The segment frames his nomination as a significant step in the continued transformation of the nation's courts.</p>

This sentiment reflects a broader disconnect felt by households and businesses who are struggling with a weak job market and stagnant wages.

          <p>The same federal judge who presided over Donald Trump's previously dropped lawsuit against Michael Cohen has been assigned to his new $10 billion libel case against Rupert Murdoch. Judge Darrin Gayles will now handle the lawsuit, which concerns a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein. In the prior case, Trump withdrew the suit after Judge Gayles scheduled a deposition where the former president would have had to testify under oath. This new assignment raises the possibility of a similar scenario, where Trump may have to weigh the consequences of being deposed by Murdoch's legal team.</p>

          <p>Mario Guevara, a journalist from El Salvador, is speaking out from an ICE detention center in Georgia, stating he has been "emotionally destroyed" by the experience. Guevara, who founded a Spanish-language news outlet, was arrested while live-streaming his reporting on a protest and believes his detention is direct retaliation for his work covering ICE raids. His lawyer notes he has a work permit and a pathway to citizenship. Guevara's case has drawn attention to the administration's immigration policies and raised concerns about press freedom, as he feels he is being made an example of to deter others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that Donald Trump's latest tax bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, including a reduced corporate rate, while also introducing new deductions. To partially offset the $4.5 trillion in lost revenue, the legislation imposes stricter work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid and food stamps, which is estimated to save $1.1 trillion but leave 10 million more Americans uninsured by 2034. The bill also boosts funding for immigration enforcement. (not investment advice)</p>

A Pentagon spokesperson stated that with stability returning to the city, the deployment had achieved its aim of sending a message that lawlessness would not be tolerated.

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration faced off in a Boston courtroom over the decision to freeze more than $2 billion in federal grants for the university's research programs. The administration claims the funding cuts are a necessary measure to combat antisemitism on campus, an argument the presiding judge appeared skeptical of, calling the government's claims "mind-boggling." Harvard's lawyers argued the move was an attempt to control the university's inner workings and would harm vital research with no evidence of impacting antisemitism. The case highlights a major conflict between the federal government and a leading academic institution.</p>
