        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Three Gorges Corporation has activated a pioneering thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, featuring a world-first dual-tower system that concentrates sunlight from nearly 27,000 mirrors onto a single turbine. This innovative design significantly enhances efficiency by 25% compared to single-tower models, enabling continuous power generation through stored molten salt heat, even after sunset or on cloudy days. By strategically overlapping mirror fields, the plant also achieves key cost savings in construction. This advancement underscores China's commitment to leveraging high-tech solutions for sustainable and stable energy production.</p>

          <p>Citi Ventures has invested in BVNK, a stablecoin infrastructure firm, signaling a growing embrace of digital assets by major U.S. banks. BVNK's platform streamlines global transactions using stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to fiat currency and backed by real-world assets. The company is experiencing rapid growth, especially in the U.S., attributed to a more favorable regulatory landscape following the GENIUS Act. This investment positions Citi to enhance its cross-border payment services and explores issuing its own stablecoin, indicating a broader industry shift towards tokenization and blockchain technology for financial efficiency.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Sanae Takaichi prepares to helm Japan's economy, her commitment to "Abenomics" principles, particularly loose monetary policy, raises concerns about a weakening yen and potential trade friction with former U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has historically accused Japan of currency devaluation to gain trade advantages, a criticism that could resurface if the yen falls below the psychologically significant 150-mark against the dollar. While a weak yen aids exporters, it exacerbates imported inflation and the cost-of-living crisis for Japanese households. Analysts predict Takaichi will tread carefully to avoid antagonizing Washington, suggesting the Bank of Japan may still implement rate hikes to manage inflation, regardless of her stance.

Illinois Governor Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Johnson are challenging the Trump administration's decision, asserting no crisis warrants the deployment. These troops are tasked with security perimeters and crowd control, with strict instructions against arresting protesters, though they can temporarily detain individuals to prevent interference. A federal judge is currently reviewing a request for a temporary restraining order, underscoring the contentious nature of federalized forces operating within states without local consent.</p>

The agreement, facilitated by U.S., Egyptian, Qatari, and Turkish mediators, stipulates the release of all hostages by Hamas and a withdrawal of Israeli troops to a designated line. While the deal brings immediate relief, critical issues such as Hamas's disarmament and the long-term governance of Gaza are yet to be resolved in subsequent phases. The Israeli government is scheduled to vote on the agreement, with hostage releases anticipated to commence within 72 hours of its formal approval and troop redeployment.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has formally accused Russia of waging "hybrid warfare" against the continent, detailing a pattern of airspace violations, cyberattacks, and election interference designed to destabilize the bloc. This form of warfare combines conventional military actions with subversive tactics, often maintaining a veneer of deniability, to disrupt and undermine adversaries. Incidents, ranging from the sabotage of undersea cables to unauthorized drone flights over critical infrastructure, have escalated dramatically since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. European leaders are now prioritizing enhanced regional security and defense measures, including exploring concepts like a "drone wall," to counter these persistent and evolving threats.</p>

          <p>China has enacted stricter export controls on rare earths and associated processing technologies, citing national security as the rationale, a move poised to impact global high-tech industries. These new regulations formalize existing restrictions and are anticipated to prohibit exports to foreign arms manufacturers and specific semiconductor companies. Given China's near-monopoly on rare earth extraction and refining, the requirement for government permission on mining, smelting, magnetic material production, and recycling technologies grants Beijing significant leverage.

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has alleged that a boat recently bombed by the U.S. military in the Caribbean, part of an aggressive anti-drug trafficking campaign, was carrying Colombian citizens. The White House vehemently rejected Petro's claim as "baseless and reprehensible," demanding a public retraction to preserve constructive bilateral relations. This accusation further inflames the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug vessels, which critics, including some members of Congress, contend are being carried out without proper legal authority. Petro has previously clashed with the U.S. over these operations, leading to heightened diplomatic friction.</p>

          <p>The Senate rejected a resolution intended to halt the Trump administration's military strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off Venezuela, despite bipartisan concerns regarding their legal justification. The measure, introduced under the War Powers Act, failed with a 48-51 vote, underscoring the ongoing debate about presidential authority in military actions. Critics argue that Congress has not authorized force against drug cartels, challenging the administration's assertion of a "non-international armed conflict." Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the strikes as responses to "imminent threats," while Senator Rand Paul criticized the lack of evidence and due process, highlighting a significant constitutional and ethical dilemma.</p>
