          <p>General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson announced the company anticipates its 2026 earnings will exceed its 2025 results, which have already surpassed Wall Street expectations. This positive outlook is attributed to several factors, including reduced electric vehicle losses, lower warranty costs, and improved fixed-cost management. Following the announcement and an upgraded 2025 guidance, GM's shares rose over 10%. The company also affirmed its commitment to continue its aggressive share repurchase program, signaling confidence in its long-term financial strategy and operational efficiency.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has instructed its employees to refrain from taking and sharing photos of the demolition work in the White House's East Wing. The construction is part of President Donald Trump's plan to build a new, privately financed $250 million ballroom. This directive was issued after images of excavators at the site circulated online, raising security concerns. A Treasury spokesperson stated the caution is to prevent the accidental exposure of sensitive security features or confidential structural details of the White House complex.</p>

          <p>Cas Holman, a designer and author who has worked with executives from Google and Nike, argues that play is the most overlooked skill for effective leadership, especially during uncertain times. She posits that engaging in playful activities shifts focus from outcomes to curiosity, reframing failure as a part of exploration and fostering creativity and resilience. The article suggests that play unlocks stronger team collaboration and connection by lowering the stakes and encouraging experimentation. Holman provides five practical steps for leaders to reintroduce play into their professional lives, such as revisiting childhood activities and incorporating lighthearted icebreakers in meetings.</p>

          <p>Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas that traps approximately 84 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, contributing to 20-30% of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. While it has a shorter atmospheric lifespan than CO2, its impact is significant. About 60% of methane emissions stem from human activities, including agriculture, landfills, and the energy sector, where it is released during the production and transport of oil and gas. The article notes that simple solutions, such as fixing leaks in fossil fuel infrastructure, could drastically reduce emissions, highlighting recent EU regulations aimed at forcing companies to do so.</p>

          <p>A third abuse survivor has resigned from the advisory panel for the UK government's inquiry into grooming gangs, intensifying the crisis surrounding the investigation. The survivor, known as "Elizabeth," stated the process feels like a "cover-up" and has created a "toxic environment." Her departure follows two other panel members who quit over concerns about the inquiry's potential leadership and a perceived attempt to widen its scope, which they fear will downplay the racial motivations behind their abuse. Critics, including the Conservative opposition, describe the inquiry as "descending into chaos," while the government insists it is committed to exposing failures.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a conservative politician and admirer of Margaret Thatcher, has been elected as Japan's first female prime minister by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The 64-year-old is known for her hard-line conservative views, including strengthening Japan's defense, a hawkish stance on China, and support for revising the constitution. Her election is seen by analysts as a move by the LDP to solidify its conservative base after recent political turbulence. While her rise is a milestone for female representation in Japan, Takaichi holds conservative social positions, opposing same-sex marriage and supporting the male-only imperial succession.</p>

Analysts view this as a significant step toward developing an independent supply chain, though they estimate it could take 10 to 20 years for the U.S. to fully achieve this goal.

          <p>A retrospective analysis of the classic 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" examines a central plot point that is now viewed as highly problematic: the romantic relationship between the adult male coach and a teenage player. The article points out that while the film brilliantly addresses issues of racism, culture, and gender, it normalizes an inappropriate power dynamic that has since been exposed as a widespread issue in women's soccer. It notes that scenes depicting the coach pursuing the young player would be seen very differently today, in light of real-life abuse scandals detailed in reports like the Yates Report, making the film a time capsule of how such behavior was once overlooked.</p>

This means he pays only a token annual rent for the 75-year lease, explaining how he can afford the residence despite no longer being a working royal.
