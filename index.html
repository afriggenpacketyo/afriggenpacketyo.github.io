          <h2>British Film Industry Anxious Over Potential Trump Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 00:01:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British film and TV industry is expressing concern over President Trump's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands." This comes after the industry already struggled through pandemic shutdowns and twin Hollywood strikes. The industry is heavily reliant on American productions, with nearly 90 percent of the 5.6 billion pounds spent on film and high-end TV production in Britain coming from abroad, mostly from the United States. The British government is reportedly in discussions with the U.S. administration about these potential tariffs, but many trade experts question how such tariffs could be enforced, as film productions are increasingly international.</p>

          <p>An Israeli military operation in the West Bank has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, leading to fears that Israel may be preparing to annex the territory. The operation, which began in January, has targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad, with the military maintaining its longest-running presence in West Bank cities in decades. The Israeli military has demolished homes and expanded roads in Jenin and Tulkarm, which it says are necessary to combat militancy. Palestinians fear the extended presence is undermining the Palestinian Authority and may signal an intent to annex the West Bank, with some drawing parallels to the 1948 Nakba.</p>

          <p>An avatar of Agatha Christie, created using AI, is teaching an online writing course with BBC Maestro, raising ethical questions about resurrecting the dead with technology. The course uses Christie's own words and archival interviews, with her family's approval, but some ethicists argue that it's still a deepfake because Christie herself did not consent. The creators maintain they are not trying to deceive anyone, but rather offer fans a new way to engage with her work. The use of AI in this context sparks a debate about the boundaries between fact, fiction, and the future of entertainment and education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global capitalism is facing a crisis of legitimacy due to inequality, rising debt, authoritarianism, and climate change. While critics have long predicted its demise, the current state of affairs is marked by the dominance of big tech, an intensifying climate crisis, and a global pandemic. Even in the United States, public attitudes have shifted, with almost half of Americans saying capitalism is on the wrong path. There are ongoing efforts to imagine a new economic paradigm, including degrowth and green growth, but the challenge remains to construct a new managed capitalism for a globalized, tech-dominated world.</p>

          <p>Vice-Premier He Lifeng has expressed confidence in China's economy ahead of crucial trade talks with US officials.

These will be the first official trade negotiations between China and the United States since US President Donald Trump’s return to office in January, with hopes of de-escalating the trade war.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are employing powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world’s largest radio telescope and advanced radar systems, to search for water ice at the moon’s south pole. A recent study suggests that ice constitutes no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil in the region, existing as fragmented chunks buried 5-7 meters underground. These findings could assist in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and designing China's proposed research base on the moon. The use of newly built incoherent scatter radar alongside the FAST telescope represents a creative approach to investigating water abundances on the moon.</p>

          <p>Selmer, Tennessee is struggling with cleanup efforts after a strong EF-3 tornado caused extensive damage over a month ago. The tornado, with winds of 160 mph, destroyed homes and businesses, causing an estimated $30 million in damage. The cleanup process is expected to take up to a year, with about 10,000 tons of natural debris already taken to the county landfill. The weather event resulted in five fatalities, including a man who died two days before his daughter's 16th birthday.</p>

The judge clarified that any "allegedly imminent removals" to a country like Libya would violate the preliminary injunction he issued last month. Lawyers representing the migrants argued that sending noncitizens to Libya or Saudi Arabia without giving them a chance to raise concerns about their safety "blatantly defies this Court's preliminary injunctions."

          <p>Tarek Bazrouk, a 20-year-old New York man, has been charged with federal hate crimes for assaulting Jewish protesters at demonstrations over the war in Gaza. The assaults occurred at three separate protests in Manhattan, where Bazrouk allegedly kicked and punched Jewish protesters wearing religious attire or carrying Israeli flags. A search of his cellphone revealed pro-Hamas propaganda and text messages in which he identified himself as a “Jew hater,”. The charges come amid an aggressive posture by the Trump administration toward pro-Palestinian demonstrations, accusing them of antisemitism and seeking to deport some protesters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to announce his first trade agreement since imposing tariffs that sent markets reeling. The announcement is expected to take place in the Oval Office, but the name of the country and specific terms have not been disclosed. Since implementing a 10% tariff on all imported goods, the administration has engaged in trade talks with countries including Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and India. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with China's He Lifeng in Switzerland.</p>

          <p>A family-run business in Sacramento made more than $38 million by buying stolen catalytic converters and selling them to a New Jersey buyer. Tou Sue Vang was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in the theft ring, and his brother and mother are awaiting sentencing. The family shipped more than 1,000 pounds of goods to DG Auto in New Jersey, which then sold the converters and precious metals to a metal refinery for more than $600 million. Vang used some of the money to buy a five-acre home, another home in Sacramento, as well as more than a dozen cars and personal watercraft.</p>

          <p>Apple is seeking a stay on a recent court decision in its case against Epic Games, arguing that the required changes to its App Store policies will cost the company "substantial sums." The ruling found Apple in contempt of court for violating a previous order related to linking out policies, and Apple says the ruling was punitive. If successful, the stay would allow Apple to continue charging commissions on in-app transactions that link out for payment.
