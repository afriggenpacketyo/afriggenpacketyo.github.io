          <h2>Combating Attention Capitalism Through Education</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This piece argues that the challenges of attention capitalism can be addressed through a renewed focus on traditional liberal education.  The author advocates for smaller class sizes, face-to-face interaction, and a curriculum that prioritizes deep engagement with books and other complex materials to cultivate attention and self-possession.  This approach, he contends, is a remedy to the vulnerabilities that attention capitalism exploits.</p>
