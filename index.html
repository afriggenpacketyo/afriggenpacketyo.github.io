          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump in September 2024, began with an unusual opening statement from the defendant, who is representing himself. Routh's philosophical musings led the judge to suspend his remarks. The prosecution presented its case, outlining evidence including cellphone data and eyewitness testimony, and called five witnesses on the first day. Key testimony came from a Secret Service agent who discovered Routh at Trump's golf course and a civilian who followed the suspect's vehicle after the incident.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament denied a request from conservative members to hold a minute of silence for assassinated American activist Charlie Kirk. Parliament President Roberta Metsola cited procedural rules, stating that such tributes must be formally submitted at the start of a plenary session, and offered to schedule one for October. The decision sparked protests from right-wing lawmakers, who banged on their desks after the presiding vice-president cut off an attempt to hold an impromptu moment of silence. Critics contrasted the refusal with a past tribute held for George Floyd.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, prominent U.S. politicians from both Democratic and Republican parties issued statements condemning the act of political violence. President Trump, who announced Kirk's death, blamed "radical left" rhetoric for the attack, while former Presidents Biden, Obama, and Bush called for an end to such violence. The event also caused friction in Congress, where an attempt to hold a moment of prayer on the House floor devolved into a heated argument. The widespread condemnation highlighted a rare moment of bipartisan agreement on the unacceptability of political assassinations.</p>

          <p>The father of Vadim Kruglov, a 37-year-old Russian man killed at the Burning Man festival, has publicly appealed to President Trump to have the FBI take over the investigation. Kruglov was found dead from what friends describe as a "professional knife strike" on August 30th, but ten days later, the case remains under the jurisdiction of the local Pershing County Sheriff's Department. In a video published by Russian media, Igor Kruglov expressed frustration with the pace of the investigation, which is being handled by a single local sheriff. He urged the president to intervene to ensure justice is served.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup. The ruling determined he plotted to remain in power after his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The court also barred the 70-year-old politician from running for public office until 2033. The verdict drew criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called it a "witch hunt," prompting a sharp rebuke from Brazil's foreign ministry defending the nation's democracy.</p>

          <p>Educators in England are expressing growing concern over the number of children starting reception class without fundamental developmental skills, according to a recent survey of over 1,000 primary school teachers. The survey revealed that 92% of respondents have seen a decline in speech and language abilities among new students over the past two years. Additionally, a third of teachers reported having at least five children in their class who require assistance with using the toilet independently. Teaching unions state that schools are being left to "pick up the pieces" due to eroded local support services.</p>

          <p>Fussy eating is a normal developmental stage for more than half of children, and parents should not blame themselves, according to child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed. She recommends five key strategies to make mealtimes less stressful, including letting children choose whether to eat and avoiding labels like "good" or "bad" for food. Other tips include making mealtime enjoyable with non-food activities, being mindful of a child's fluctuating appetite, and involving them in food preparation to build familiarity. The focus should be on modeling a balanced diet rather than pressuring the child to eat.</p>

The article notes the inclusion of instruments like the sitar and tabla, and a collaboration with Indian superstar Arjit Singh. However, the review suggests that while these elements add new flavors, they are largely assimilated into Sheeran's familiar, frictionless pop style rather than deeply exploring new musical traditions. The album is seen as a commercially savvy effort that plays to his strengths but misses an opportunity for greater artistic adventure.</p>

The Trump administration has justified the strike as self-defense against members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which it designated a terrorist organization.

The article highlights that despite deep political disagreements, many on both sides have condemned the act of political violence itself.

          <p>In the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, security measures have been heightened for political figures across the United States amid rising concerns over political violence. President Trump's security detail changed the location of a 9/11 commemoration speech and enhanced protocols for a planned appearance at a baseball game. Several high-profile politicians, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have canceled public events, while others, like Rep. Nancy Mace, have vowed to start carrying a firearm for personal protection. The ongoing manhunt for Kirk's killer has contributed to a general sense of unease.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking a federal appeals court to allow the president to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook ahead of a critical interest rate meeting next week. A lower court had previously blocked the firing, ruling that the president had not provided a legally permissible "for cause" reason for her removal, as required by law. The administration alleges Cook misrepresented her primary residence on mortgage documents, while her attorney calls the claims unsubstantiated. The legal battle comes as President Trump has been publicly critical of the Fed's decisions to keep interest rates high.</p>

          <p>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has fired Kevin Struthers, a senior director of music programming and a 30-year veteran of the institution. This dismissal is the latest in a series of firings and resignations since President Trump became the Center's chair and appointed Richard Grennell as its new president in February. Struthers had been the administrative director for the Center's jazz programming, whose former artistic director, Jason Moran, departed in July. The changes have raised questions about the future direction of jazz and other programming at the beleaguered arts institution.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have successfully voted to change the chamber's rules, a move often called the "nuclear option," to speed up the confirmation process for President Trump's executive branch nominees. The new rule allows for non-cabinet level nominees to be considered in batches rather than through individual, time-consuming votes. Republican leaders argued the change was necessary to overcome Democratic obstruction and allow the president to staff his administration. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the move, calling it an act of "genuflection to the executive branch" rather than a genuine effort to end obstruction.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted the demise of rival Spirit Airlines, stating that the ultra-low-cost carrier's business model is no longer viable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby argued that the model of charging low base fares while adding fees for all other services is one that "customers hate" and cannot be sustained. His comments come after Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in a year amid weak demand and high costs. Kirby's critique reflects a broader challenge for discount airlines as larger carriers successfully compete with their own basic economy fares.</p>
