        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of bees escaped after a truck hauling approximately 70,000 pounds of active honey bee hives overturned in Washington state near the Canadian border. Authorities issued warnings for the public to avoid the swarm, and several master beekeepers were called in to assist. The Whatcom County Sheriff's Office stated that the primary goal is to save as many bees as possible, and the site of the crash will remain closed until the rescue operation is complete. The incident highlights the challenges and importance of safely transporting large quantities of bees, which are crucial for pollination and honey production. The situation underscores the need for caution and expertise in handling such incidents to minimize harm to both the public and the bee population, and to keep the bees from flying into Canada. The efforts to rescue the bees demonstrate a commitment to preserving these vital insects. </p>

Henderson State mourned Brown's death, highlighting his profound impact on the campus during his single season with the team. The university and coach emphasized Brown's warm spirit, deep commitment to family, and passion for basketball, noting the tremendous void his loss leaves on the campus. The authorities responded to multiple calls reporting a shooting at the pool party, and Brown was transported to a nearby hospital before being flown to another in Tyler, where he was pronounced dead. </p>

          <p>The European Union has voiced strong disapproval of the United States' plan to double tariffs on steel and aluminum, a move announced by President Donald Trump at a rally in Pittsburgh. The EU views this decision as undermining ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution on trade, with the European Commission warning of potential countermeasures. The UK government is also engaging with the US to clarify the implications of the tariff announcement for its industry, especially concerning the UK's zero tariff deal with the US on steel and aluminum. The EU paused its countermeasures on April 14 to facilitate continued negotiations, but is now prepared to reimpose them in response to the increased tariffs. </p>

          <p>The popular Mexican band Grupo Firme canceled a performance in California after the U.S. government suspended the musicians' visas, adding to a series of moves targeting Mexican artists playing music that glorifies cartel violence. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico cited confidentiality laws when declining to comment on the specific case, but Grupo Firme stated that their visas are under "administrative review." This action follows increased scrutiny of the "narco-corridos" genre, with some artists facing sanctions for projecting images of cartel leaders during concerts. While Grupo Firme has recently distanced itself from glorifying criminal groups, the visa suspensions highlight the ongoing tensions between artistic expression and U.S. efforts to combat cartel influence. </p>

          <p>The World Food Programme (WFP) reports that desperate and hungry crowds in Gaza are rushing aid trucks, leading to chaotic scenes as civilians scramble for food. The WFP managed to bring 77 trucks loaded with flour into Gaza, but all were stopped along the way, and the food was taken mainly by hungry people trying to feed their families. Israel eased an 11-week aid blockade on May 19, but the UN says the amount sent in the last week amounts to just over 10% of people's needs. A UN-backed assessment indicates that Gaza's entire population is at "critical risk" of famine, with two million people in desperate need of food. </p>

World Boxing is introducing mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers participating in their competitions. The decision stems from controversy surrounding Khelif after she won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, fueled by claims from the International Boxing Association that Khelif failed unspecified eligibility tests for the women's competition at last year's world championships. The PCR genetic test, which can be conducted by nasal/mouth swab, saliva, or blood, will reveal the presence of the Y chromosome to determine biological sex. </p>

The government is also expected to stress a greater need for public involvement in protecting the country, including announcements about British industry creating more defence kit and expanding the cadet forces.

The victory marks Yates's first Giro win, making him the third British rider to achieve this feat, and comes after a previous disappointment on the same climb in 2018. Yates expressed his emotions, stating that it was something he had worked towards for years, overcoming numerous setbacks to finally pull it off. </p>

          <p>UK steelmakers have criticized US President Donald Trump's decision to double import taxes on steel and aluminum to 50%, describing it as "another body blow" to the industry. Trade group UK Steel warned that some orders could be delayed or cancelled, with uncertainty surrounding shipments already en route across the Atlantic. The UK government is engaging with the US to provide clarity to the industry, as the original 25% tariff remains in place while details of a trade deal with the UK are finalized. UK Steel is pressing the government to finalize the agreement to eliminate UK steel import tax urgently, emphasizing that UK steelmakers should not bear the burden of the new tariff hike. </p>

Nvidia stood out with better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance, while Salesforce faced criticism for its focus on AI. Costco's strong performance was attributed to margin improvement and same-store sales growth. Inflation also played a role, with the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge coming in cooler than expected for April, but concerns remain about the potential impact of tariffs. The Federal Reserve indicated a "cautious approach" to monetary policy, while Chairman Jerome Powell met with Trump to discuss the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 130 former state and federal judges are urging the government to drop its charges against Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, calling her indictment an “egregious overreach” by the executive branch. Dugan was indicted in April after being accused of helping an undocumented migrant flee arrest at her courthouse, facing federal charges that could result in six years in prison and a $350,000 fine. The amicus brief filed by the former judges argues that Dugan’s indictment undermines centuries of precedent on judicial immunity, crucial for an effective judiciary. The group argues that judges are entitled to absolute immunity for their judicial acts, and mistakes should be addressed within the judicial branch, not by prosecutors. </p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five simple rules for effective parenting, emphasizing the importance of trusting instincts, following culture, and focusing on enjoyment rather than strict development. The rules include following your instincts instead of influencers, following your culture instead of clickbait, following your kid instead of the crowd, focusing on enjoyment instead of development, and being your real self instead of your ideal self. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should trust their intuition and cultural traditions, pay attention to their child's unique interests, and prioritize joy and genuine connection. By embracing these principles, parents can create a nurturing environment that fosters healthy youth development. </p>
