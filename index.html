          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 2,000 California National Guard members from federal duty in Los Angeles, about half of the force deployed in response to protests. The Pentagon cited subsiding lawlessness as the reason for the withdrawal, which had been a point of contention with Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom criticized the initial deployment as a political maneuver and has called for the remaining troops to be returned to their communities, stating they continue to serve without a clear mission.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new trade agreement with Indonesia, stating he has agreed to lower threatened U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods to 19%. In exchange, the deal reportedly provides American firms with "full access" to Indonesian markets and includes commitments for Indonesia to purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products. The announcement follows a period of trade tensions and threats of higher tariffs from the White House, although terms have not yet been confirmed by Indonesian officials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Seoul court has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who assassinated South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee in 1979. Forty-six years after he was executed for insurrection, the case re-examines whether Kim was a traitor seeking power or a patriot who acted to prevent bloodshed and restore democracy. The retrial, sought by his family, reopens a deeply polarizing chapter of the nation's history, forcing a reflection on its difficult path to democracy and the legacy of Park's authoritarian rule.</p>

The accusation stems from a Fannie Mae memo that noted a pattern of "possible occupancy misrepresentation" regarding Schiff's homes but did not conclude fraud was committed. Schiff suggested the attack is an attempt to distract from the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation files, a controversy important to many of Trump's supporters.</p>

          <p>Florida has executed Michael Bernard Bell, 54, for the 1993 murders of two people outside a bar in what was an act of attempted revenge based on mistaken identity. Bell's execution is the 26th in the United States this year, a number that already equals the total for all of 2024. Experts note that while death sentences have trended downward, the rate of executions has seen an uptick, which they attribute to the discretion of governors and attorneys general in certain states.</p>

          <p>A parliamentary watchdog has concluded that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves inadvertently breached rules by failing to declare gifted theatre tickets on the MPs' register of interests within the 28-day time limit. Reeves, who had declared the gift on the ministerial register, apologized for the oversight and attributed it to ambiguity between her roles. The standards commissioner accepted her apology and concluded the failure was inadvertent, closing the inquiry without further action.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union's strategy of pressuring China over its support for Russia's war economy is unlikely to alter Beijing's geopolitical stance and may backfire on the EU's own interests. The author contends that while the EU seeks fairer economic relations, its hardline approach could jeopardize trade and access to critical supplies from China. The piece suggests that the EU's "if you're not with us, you're against us" dichotomy oversimplifies complex international dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for about 11,700 people from Afghanistan. The administration intended to end the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan has improved, but advocacy groups sued, asserting the country remains unsafe. The court's one-week stay provides a brief reprieve for Afghan nationals, whose futures remain uncertain as the legal battle over the administration's immigration policy continues.</p>
