          <p>China is firmly resisting U.S. pressure to stop buying oil from Russia and Iran, a key point of contention in ongoing trade negotiations. Despite optimism about a broader trade deal, Beijing has stated it will defend its national interests and sovereignty, viewing energy supply as a critical component. U.S. officials acknowledge China's tough negotiating stance but remain hopeful for an agreement, while analysts suggest the U.S. may not follow through on threats of a 100% tariff. China benefits from discounted oil, which is vital for its economy and strategic alignment with Russia.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening, with a recent jobs report indicating a sharp slowdown as new tariffs are set to take effect. Economists express concern over rising inflation and slower overall growth, challenging the administration's outlook of a tariff-driven economic boom. The article also notes that a separate set of tariffs on Mexico has been delayed for 90 days to allow for further trade negotiations. These developments create uncertainty for businesses and consumers across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed compensation scheme for the mis-selling of car finance in the UK has been labeled "completely impractical" by the industry's trade body, the Finance and Leasing Association. The primary concern is the plan's retroactive scope, potentially covering loans as far back as 2007, for which both firms and customers may lack adequate records. While a Supreme Court ruling narrowed the potential for massive payouts, millions of drivers could still be eligible for compensation. The Financial Conduct Authority is proceeding with consultations, estimating the total cost could reach between £9bn and £18bn. (not investment advice)</p>

The match came down to the final moments, with an injured Chris Woakes bravely coming out to bat in a sling, creating a scene of high drama. Despite a valiant effort from England to chase a record target of 374, India's bowlers held their nerve to clinch the win and draw the five-match series 2-2.

          <p>A group of more than 50 Democratic state legislators have left Texas in a bid to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a controversial new congressional map. The proposed redistricting, backed by former President Trump, could create up to five new GOP-leaning seats. This dramatic move, which runs the clock out on the current special session, has drawn sharp condemnation from Republican leaders like Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, who have threatened fines and even arrest. This is the third time in recent decades that Texas Democrats have used this tactic to halt Republican legislation.</p>

          <p>A trio of Republican senators has introduced legislation aimed at providing independent contractors and gig workers with access to benefits like health insurance and retirement savings. The proposal would create a system for portable benefits, shielding companies that offer them from worker misclassification lawsuits, a long-standing concern for firms like Uber and Lyft. While proponents argue this supports the modern workforce, labor unions strongly oppose the measures. Unions view it as a way to solidify contractor status, thereby preventing workers from gaining core protections and the right to unionize.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has granted CEO Elon Musk a massive stock award of 96 million shares, currently valued at approximately $29 billion. This move comes just six months after a Delaware judge invalidated his previous, similarly structured 2018 pay package, ruling that it was improperly negotiated with a board that was not independent. To receive the shares, Musk must first pay Tesla an exercise price of $23.34 per share. The decision reignites the controversy surrounding the CEO's compensation, which has fluctuated in value based on the company's volatile stock price.</p>

This sharp decline is attributed to a successful and sustained campaign by animal welfare advocates, which has led to major fashion brands like Gucci and Prada going fur-free. The shift has been accelerated by legislative bans on fur farming and sales in numerous countries, the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mink farms, and changing economic conditions in major markets like Russia and China.

Berkshire's cash reserves remained near a record high at $344.1 billion, and it continued to be a net seller of stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Switzerland is experiencing high tension as a deadline approaches for a trade agreement with the United States, after which it faces a steep 39% tariff on its exports. The unexpectedly high duty has shocked the Swiss business community, which fears significant job losses and a potential recession if a deal is not reached. Industry groups warn that such a high rate would effectively cut off trade for many companies. Swiss leaders are scrambling to renegotiate, but U.S. officials have indicated that the new tariff rates are largely set, leaving the outcome uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CK Asset Holdings, on behalf of Hong Kong's wealthiest family, has issued a strong denial of rumors circulating on social media that their iconic residence at 79 Deep Water Bay Road is for sale. The company described the speculation as "entirely fabricated" and "groundless." Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, the company's chairman, urged the public to be wary of such rumors, particularly given the rise in online scams. The denial comes at a time when other prominent Hong Kong families have been forced to sell assets at a discount due to economic pressures and high borrowing costs.</p>

The People's Bank of China announced plans to accelerate the yuan's use in trade, enhance its financing functions, and strengthen its offshore market infrastructure. This includes expanding the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) to support overseas clearing. The move signals a clear strategic push by Beijing to increase its financial influence and provide an alternative to the dollar-dominated global financial system.</p>

According to a statement from the company's CEO, the child was in distress in the wave pool when lifeguards responded, performed life-saving measures, and had the child transported to a medical center, where they were pronounced dead. The local police department has since concluded its review, determining that no criminal activity was involved and that the park was upholding safety standards. The wave pool was temporarily closed out of respect for the family and the park's staff.</p>

          <p>A significant legal battle is underway in a federal appeals court over President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A coalition of states and businesses argues that the law, historically used for sanctions, does not grant the president power over tariffs, which is a constitutional authority of Congress. The administration contends that trade imbalances and drug flows constitute a national emergency. Regardless of the appeals court's decision, the high-stakes case, which could invalidate trillions in tariffs, is almost certain to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some seasonal employees at Yosemite National Park worked for weeks without pay this spring and summer, performing their duties as volunteers while waiting to be officially onboarded by the federal government. Facing hiring freezes and a strained Human Resources division, park supervisors offered prospective workers free housing if they volunteered at least 32 hours a week. The employees, who needed the park-provided housing, agreed but now feel exploited for their labor. While the National Park Service may not have violated labor laws, the situation highlights the severe staffing strains affecting national parks.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that while ad-supported streaming is becoming the norm, the implementation is universally terrible and frustrating for viewers. Commercial breaks are often inserted abruptly mid-scene, disrupting narrative flow, and the same low-quality ads are frequently repeated multiple times within a single binge-watching session. This poor integration is especially jarring in older content not designed for ad breaks. The author suggests that instead of being angry about the existence of ads, viewers should demand that streaming platforms improve the quality and placement of commercials to create a less abrasive experience.</p>

Despite a 1994 order to raise the lake's level, it remains about nine feet below the target, which activists say is harming the ecosystem and bird populations. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power contends the lake is relatively healthy and that its levels are more influenced by wet or dry years. However, some L.A. officials have expressed a desire to explore ways to lessen the city's reliance on the Mono Basin's water.</p>

For instance, serious suicidal thoughts in 12-to-17-year-olds fell from nearly 13% to 10%.
