        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paramount Global is set to reduce its workforce by 3.5% due to economic challenges and shifts in the media landscape, particularly the decline of linear television. This latest round of layoffs precedes the company's anticipated merger with Skydance Media, an entertainment business founded by David Ellison. The cuts will primarily affect U.S. workers, with potential impacts on international staff later on, and follow a previous reduction of 15% last year aimed at cost savings. The company is also currently facing a lawsuit from President Trump over CBS's "60 Minutes" program, adding further complexity to the merger process.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a high school in Graz, Austria, resulted in the deaths of nine people, with an additional 12 injured. The alleged shooter, a 21-year-old former student who never graduated, died by suicide in a school bathroom during the incident, acting alone using guns found at the scene. Authorities secured the school within 17 minutes after gunshots were heard, evacuating all individuals to a safe location. Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker declared a three-day national period of mourning, and support is being provided to students and parents affected by the tragedy.</p>

          <p>David Huerta, president of the California division of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), was charged with felony conspiracy for allegedly impeding an officer during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. Huerta was arrested after sitting in front of a vehicular gate to an ICE staging ground, allegedly yelling to protestors to block vehicles. He was released on a $50,000 bond and is due back in court July 7, with Newsom and other Democratic leaders denouncing the arrest. The incident occurred during immigration raids where 44 undocumented immigrants were arrested, and Huerta faces up to six years in federal prison if convicted.</p>

The defense argued that false testimony was presented regarding a 2016 balcony incident, but the judge found no prejudice. Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under a pseudonym, described alleged forced participation in "hotel nights" where she was expected to have sex with other men while Diddy watched. The ex-girlfriend began crying on the stand, expressing sympathy for Cassie Ventura after reading about similar experiences in Cassie's lawsuit, noting that she felt like she was reading her own story.</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged Â£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear project, aiming to create 10,000 jobs and enhance energy security, although the prime minister stated he is "not writing a blank cheque" for the project. The development, expected to take over a decade, has faced opposition due to potential costs and environmental impact. The government insists that nuclear power can lower household energy bills and reduce reliance on other countries, while critics argue that ministers are not being transparent about the project's total cost. The project is expected to generate enough power for six million homes.</p>

          <p>The UK government has partially reversed its decision to withdraw winter fuel payments from most pensioners, now extending the payment to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of Â£35,000 or less. This decision follows pressure from charities, unions, and MPs, with the government citing better-than-expected economic growth as the reason for the change. The government previously announced the removal of payments from over 10 million pensioners to address a Â£22 billion financial deficit. Critics argue that the reversal creates new complexity in the tax system, while the government maintains that the change will not lead to permanent additional borrowing.</p>

This standoff follows Trump's previous executive order targeting "anti-American ideology" at the Smithsonian and his criticism of Sajet's Democratic political donations and rejection of a pro-Trump painting. The board has directed the secretary to ensure museum content remains unbiased while maintaining the Smithsonian as a welcoming place for all Americans.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has significantly increased its military spending by approximately 20% in response to recent clashes with India, despite facing economic challenges. The defense budget has been raised to 2.55 trillion Pakistani rupees ($9 billion), while overall spending is down 7% to 17.57 trillion rupees ($62 billion). This decision comes after a major flare-up in violence with India, leading to a surge in the military's popularity. Analysts suggest that the increased defense budget will likely be offset by cuts in other areas, including welfare, potentially exacerbating hardships for the population.</p>

The case sheds light on crisis management tactics used by publicists to shape celebrity narratives and the ease with which social media can turn against female celebrities.

          <p>Kieran Tierney has rejoined Celtic from Arsenal on a five-year deal, expressing excitement about returning to the club. After a loan spell at Real Sociedad and struggling for regular starts at Arsenal, Tierney's return to Celtic was confirmed in February. Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers praised Tierney as a talented player and a massive addition to the squad, with Tierney citing his growth and experiences abroad as factors that have changed him. The transfer comes amid uncertainty about the future of fellow Scotland left-back Greg Taylor, whose contract ends this summer.</p>

          <p>Violent protests have broken out in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to dozens of arrests and the deployment of the National Guard. President Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to the city, which has triggered outrage from Democrats, and later ordered an additional 2,000 troops and 700 marines. The protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations, resulting in vehicles being set on fire and a major highway being shut down. Demonstrators have gathered in downtown LA and near a Home Depot in Paramount, with police using riot gear and flash-bang grenades to subdue crowds.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deployed thousands more troops to Los Angeles amid ongoing protests against immigration raids, with the unrest spreading to other U.S. cities. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as a "deranged fantasy" and is suing the president for sending troops without state approval. At least four Mexican nationals detained in LA have already been deported, and protests have erupted in other cities, including New York and Philadelphia. The LAPD has arrested dozens of people, and Trump has defended his decision, claiming it stopped the city from "burning down."</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that some immigrants arrested during recent ICE raids in Los Angeles have already been deported, raising concerns about due process. Parents of a 23-year-old Zapotec man claim he was deported after unknowingly signing a deportation form instead of a coronavirus test consent form. Advocacy groups report receiving numerous calls from distraught families, with many detainees lacking legal representation and being transferred to distant detention facilities. While federal officials claim the raids targeted criminal activity, reports suggest that many detainees have no criminal records, marking a shift towards broader deportation sweeps.</p>
