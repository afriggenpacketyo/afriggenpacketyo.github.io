          <p>Germany's national railway, Deutsche Bahn (DB), is experiencing a significant crisis with train punctuality dropping to 62%, a stark contrast to its historical reliability. Decades of underinvestment have left the network with outdated and failing infrastructure, prompting a massive, multi-year refurbishment program. However, the initial projects have been plagued by soaring costs and delays, with the Federal Audit Office criticizing the Transport Ministry's oversight and extending the program's timeline to 2036, signaling prolonged disruption for travelers.</p>

          <p>Shares of high fructose corn syrup producer Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) declined after former President Donald Trump claimed he persuaded Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, the announcement caused a stir in the market, with ADM's stock falling and raw sugar futures rising. The Corn Refiners Association warned the move could cost thousands of American manufacturing jobs, highlighting the economic implications of altering the beverage giant's sweetener.
