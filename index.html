          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening tool, offering women an alternative to traditional Pap smears. The test, developed by Teal Health, involves a vaginal swab to detect HPV, the virus responsible for most cervical cancers. This at-home option aims to improve accessibility for women who face barriers to in-person appointments. If the test is positive, a follow-up with a health care provider is necessary, but a negative result means no further screening is needed for several years, marking a significant step in preventative healthcare.</p>

          <p>Randy Carr, CEO of World Emblem, a company producing embroidered patches, faced uncertainty when President Trump considered imposing tariffs on Mexico. The company, with a large factory in Mexico, initially feared significant financial repercussions. However, after learning that companies covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempt, World Emblem temporarily benefited from the tariffs placed on competitors in China. Despite the initial win, Carr soon realized the tariffs would impact raw material costs and potentially lead to a recession, highlighting the complex and unpredictable nature of global trade policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. The judge, William K.

Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, was detained for an essay critical of Israel, leading to public outrage and accusations of government overreach.

          <h2>Trump Suggests Lowering Tariffs on China as Trade Talks Loom</h2>

          <p>President Trump has indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China ahead of high-stakes trade talks in Switzerland. Trump suggested that an 80% tariff on China "seems right," a significant decrease from the current 145% rate. However, the White House clarified that any tariff reduction would require concessions from China. The trade tensions between the two countries have impacted international markets, and economists warn of potential recession risks due to Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) is no longer suitable for long-term retirement planning due to increasing lifespans. With people living longer, Edelman suggests investors need a higher allocation to equities, around 70% to 80%, to ensure they don't outlive their savings. He emphasizes the importance of planning for a lifespan of 100 years or more, considering advancements in health and technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a "most favored nation" plan to cut Medicare drug prices. This plan, previously blocked by court orders, ties Medicare drug prices to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. HHS Secretary Robert F.

The administration is continuing to negotiate the cost of Ozempic in Medicare under talks launched by the Biden administration, but only for its uses to treat diabetes and other health conditions.</p>
