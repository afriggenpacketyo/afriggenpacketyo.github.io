        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily ease tariffs imposed over the last couple of months, according to a joint statement shared by the White House. Both sides committed to a 90-day suspension of most levies imposed since early April, with the understanding that ongoing discussions have the potential to address each side's economic and trade concerns. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the temporary reductions would effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China would reduce its levies on American imports to 10%. This news has buoyed commodities and currency markets in Asia and beyond, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (P.K.K.), a Kurdish group that has waged a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state for four decades, announced it would lay down its arms and end the conflict. This decision comes months after its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, urged the group to disarm, stating that the armed struggle had outlived its initial purpose. The P.K.K. began as a secessionist group seeking an independent state for Turkey’s Kurdish minority but more recently sought greater rights for Kurds inside Turkey. This move could end one of Turkey's most enduring security problems and deliver a significant political victory to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, potentially influencing other Kurdish militias in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to use executive powers to significantly cut prescription drug prices in America, aiming for reductions between 30% and 80%. He intends to introduce a "most favored nation" policy, ensuring the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest price worldwide. This announcement triggered a sell-off in pharmaceutical stocks, reflecting concerns about potential profit losses for drug companies. Trump's previous attempts to cap drug prices faced legal challenges, and the impact of this new executive order on government health programs remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Suffolk County, New York, has strengthened its animal cruelty laws by making it a Class A misdemeanor for convicted animal abusers to own pets. This new law expands on a 2010 initiative that created an animal abuse registry, now adding penalties of up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine for those who violate the ownership ban. The expanded legislation was signed after dozens of dead cats were found in a Long Island home, highlighting the need for stronger protections for animals. The law aims to close a loophole, ensuring that those who disregard the ban on pet ownership will face consequences.</p>

The PKK has led an armed insurgency since 1984, claiming tens of thousands of lives and is listed as a terror group by Turkey and its Western allies.

The US has imposed tariffs on global imports and proposed fees targeting Chinese vessels, aiming to re-establish the US shipbuilding industry and enhance national security. These fees, set to take effect in mid-October, will charge vessels owned or operated by companies in mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau when docking at US ports.

          <p>The US and China have reported progress in trade talks held in Switzerland, with both sides agreeing to cut tariffs. The US Treasury Secretary described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier said the talks were "in-depth" and "candid." The White House called it a "trade deal," but full details are expected soon. This marks the first face-to-face meeting since the US imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, prompting a 125% levy on some US goods, causing turmoil in financial markets.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled plans for at least $880 billion in cuts, largely to Medicaid, to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The legislation includes new work and eligibility requirements, which Democrats warn will cause millions of Americans to lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office indicates that these proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade. While Republicans claim they are rooting out waste, Democrats argue it's another attempt to repeal Obamacare.</p>

          <p>Landmark China-US trade talks are likely to carry economic and political significance, kick-starting a long process towards substantive deals that should address tariffs and other trade barriers. The apparent upbeat move in Geneva stands to give both powers interim political relief at home without appearing weak on the trade war battlefront. The talks resulted in an agreement to establish a “trade consultation mechanism”. Analysts suggest this is part of a strategic process to manage bilateral competition, economic resilience, and long-term development goals.</p>

President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire, saying "it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much". The US-brokered ceasefire between the nuclear-armed neighbours appears to have held overnight after nearly four days of intense shelling and aerial incursions from both sides. India announced it was reopening 32 airports for civilians that it had earlier said would remain closed until Thursday due to safety concerns.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have released a plan that would cause millions of poor Americans to lose Medicaid health coverage and millions more to pay higher fees. The plan, part of a sweeping bill to enact President Trump’s domestic agenda, omits structural changes to Medicaid demanded by ultraconservative Republicans. The legislation would reduce federal spending by an estimated $912 billion over the decade and cause 8.6 million people to become uninsured. The legislation released on Sunday tries to split the difference between Republicans agitating for deep cuts to Medicaid and those eager to protect their states from changes that could force them to shoulder much higher costs.</p>
