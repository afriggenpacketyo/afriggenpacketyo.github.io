          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza. Rubio stated his focus is on securing the return of hostages, ensuring humanitarian aid reaches civilians, and addressing the threat from Hamas, which he said cannot continue to exist for peace to be achieved. The meeting also covered a planned Israeli military operation in Gaza City, for which Israel has issued evacuation orders. During the visit, Netanyahu highlighted the strength of the U.S.-Israeli alliance, comparing its durability to the stones of the Western Wall, which the two leaders visited together.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report indicates that quarterback Shedeur Sanders sought to avoid being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2025 NFL Draft. Sanders allegedly communicated his desire not to be selected by the team due to the presence of two-time MVP Lamar Jackson, which would limit his opportunities to play. The Ravens, who had considered picking him, ultimately chose another player, and Sanders was later drafted by the Cleveland Browns. He is now positioned as the third-string quarterback for the Browns, behind Joe Flacco and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel, after performing well enough to secure a spot on the final roster.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España, a major professional cycling race, was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid. Demonstrators knocked down barriers and occupied parts of the route, including the major thoroughfare Gran Via, making it impossible for the race to proceed as planned. The cancellation occurred despite a significant security presence, with over 1,000 police officers deployed in anticipation of demonstrations. The protest action effectively halted the conclusion of one of cycling's most prestigious events, highlighting the intersection of international politics and major sporting competitions.</p>

          <p>Officials have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The attack, described as targeted, involved a single shot from a high-powered rifle fired from a nearby building's roof. Investigators tracked Robinson using security footage and evidence left at the scene, including palm prints. The suspect's father reportedly recognized his son in photos released by law enforcement and encouraged him to surrender.

          <p>Romania has reported that a Russian drone breached its airspace, making it the second NATO country, after Poland, to confirm such an incident recently. The Romanian defence ministry stated that its F-16 fighter jets tracked the drone near the Ukrainian border during a Russian attack on Ukrainian infrastructure along the Danube River. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the incursion as an "obvious expansion of the war by Russia." The event has heightened tensions along NATO's eastern flank, prompting Poland to increase its air defense readiness and the Czech Republic to deploy a special helicopter unit to the region in response.</p>

In an interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that despite the prince being stripped of titles and publicly shamed, it is not enough, and he should be held to the fullest extent of the law. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability. The family also urged for investigations into others associated with Epstein, including President Donald Trump.</p>

These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are seen as a direct competitor, diverting transactions that would otherwise generate revenue for credit card issuers. Financial institutions are also wary because BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating what one expert calls a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile. With an estimated 86.5 million Americans using these services in 2024, the trend represents a significant shift in consumer credit behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

The exhibition, titled "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," brings together his works, including his most famous painting, "Paris Street; Rainy Day."

          <h2>New Tax Law for Tipped Workers Sparks Debate on U.S. Tipping Culture</h2>

          <p>A new law enacted under President Trump that makes tips tax-free is intensifying the debate over America's tipping culture. While the law provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $25,000 for tipped income for certain workers, critics argue it enables employers to pay lower wages and increases pressure on consumers to tip more frequently. The article questions the eligibility criteria for the tax benefit, which includes professions like electricians and digital content creators but excludes others like postal workers and teachers. The author suggests that instead of incentivizing tips, the focus should be on ensuring employers pay a fair living wage.</p>

          <p>An Iowa official has refused to comply with the state governor's order to fly flags at half-staff in honor of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Jon Green, the Democratic chair of the Johnson County Board of Supervisors, condemned Kirk's killing but stated he would not honor a man who he said dedicated his life to denigrating marginalized communities. The decision has drawn criticism from Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who called it disgraceful. Green's defiance highlights the deep political divisions surrounding Kirk's legacy and has sparked a debate about the criteria for such public honors.</p>

          <p>An explosion at an empty house in Bradford, UK, has led to the arrest of two men on suspicion of theft. The blast, which occurred on Saturday night, destroyed the property and caused damage to two neighboring homes, resulting in minor injuries to a man, woman, and child. A 27-year-old man was found seriously injured near the scene and arrested, while a 28-year-old man who initially fled was arrested the following day on suspicion of metal theft.

          <p>A new report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reveals that the 16-year-old who opened fire at a Colorado high school was an active user of a "violent gore" website known for extremist content. The site, which hosts graphic videos of real violence, has reportedly been frequented by several other recent school shooters, suggesting a pattern of online radicalization. The shooter, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, also posted extremist symbols and references to other mass shooters on his social media accounts. The findings highlight the role of fringe online platforms in glorifying violence and influencing young perpetrators.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out an AI-powered feature called "Hear the Highlights," which provides short, audio summaries of product information. The system uses a large language model to generate scripts by pulling data from product catalogs, customer reviews, and other web sources. While the feature aims to simplify the shopping experience and improve accessibility for visually impaired customers, it also raises questions about its effectiveness. Critics are concerned that by blending marketing language with genuine user feedback, the AI summaries could lose the nuance and unique insights found in individual customer reviews, potentially misleading consumers.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that while Charlie Kirk's assassination is a tragedy, the public should not rewrite the realities of his life and political career. The author criticizes recent portrayals of Kirk as a virtuous practitioner of civil debate, pointing to his history of promoting divisive and hateful rhetoric against marginalized groups. The article contends that an honest accounting of his legacy is necessary and that condemning political violence should not require fabricating a more honorable life for the deceased. The author suggests that the values that lead to horror at his death should also strengthen opposition to the politics he championed.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that after two years of war, Israeli society has adapted to a new normal, becoming desensitized to the suffering in Gaza and locked in a state of perpetual conflict. The author suggests that political discourse has been replaced by a mythical narrative of victimization, framing the war as a biblical retribution rather than a political problem. This mindset, combined with a lack of a clear vision for the future, allows the conflict to continue without significant internal opposition. The piece contends that international actions, like the recognition of a Palestinian state, are necessary to break this stasis.</p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are experiencing heightened fear following a Supreme Court ruling that allows federal agents to conduct warrantless raids and potentially engage in racial profiling. The Department of Homeland Security has vowed to increase its presence, creating a tense atmosphere where many undocumented workers must choose between risking deportation by going to work or facing eviction by staying home.

          <p>The Trump administration's new report on children's health, titled "Make Our Children Healthy Again," is facing criticism for its significant omission of nicotine, smoking, and tobacco. Health advocates and parents have expressed alarm that the 20-page document, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., fails to address what remains the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Critics argue that this oversight is particularly concerning given the ongoing youth vaping epidemic and contrasts with President Trump's previous emphasis on the issue. The administration's plan focuses on public service campaigns and enforcement against illegal vapes.</p>

          <p>Team Europe's Ryder Cup golfers, including Rory McIlroy, are using an unconventional training method to prepare for the hostile crowd expected at Bethpage in New York. Captain Luke Donald has provided players with virtual reality headsets that simulate the sights and sounds of the event, complete with shouted abuse from virtual fans. The goal is to desensitize the players to the intense pressure and name-calling they anticipate facing on American soil. McIlroy confirmed he encouraged the simulation to be as harsh as possible, viewing it as a critical part of their preparation to defend the cup.</p>
