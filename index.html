          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 39.1% surge in third-quarter profit, significantly exceeding market expectations and setting a new financial high for the firm. This impressive growth is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. Consequently, the company has raised its revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range, signaling strong confidence in the sector's continued expansion. Advanced chips, particularly those 7-nanometer or smaller, constituted the vast majority of wafer revenue, underscoring the importance of cutting-edge technology. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy experienced a slight expansion of 0.1% in August, following a 0.1% contraction in the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics. While this represents a minor positive movement, significant concerns remain about the nation's financial stability ahead of the upcoming Budget. Economists and institutions like the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest that tax increases or spending cuts may be necessary to meet the government's self-imposed borrowing rules. Over a three-month period, the economy grew by 0.3%, indicating some underlying steadiness despite the monthly volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners with a decisive 13-4 victory, narrowing their deficit in the American League Championship Series to 2-1. The Blue Jays' offense was explosive, producing 18 hits and five home runs, all of which came early in the at-bats against Seattle's pitchers. Mariners' starting pitcher George Kirby struggled significantly, allowing eight hits in a departure from his typically strong performance this season. The offensive surge was a crucial turnaround for Toronto, which had scored only four total runs in the first two games of the series combined.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given assurances that India will halt its purchases of Russian crude oil. While no specific timeline was provided, Trump described the move as a significant step in pressuring Moscow over its war in Ukraine and urged China to follow suit. In response, India's external affairs ministry stated that its import decisions are guided primarily by consumer interests and the need for stable energy supplies. This development highlights ongoing diplomatic tensions, as India has been a major buyer of discounted Russian oil since the conflict began.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly confirmed that he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, citing national security concerns over drug trafficking and the alleged release of prisoners into the U.S. This admission follows a series of deadly U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean said to be originating from the country. The move has drawn sharp criticism from members of Congress, who expressed alarm that the administration is escalating toward armed conflict without proper oversight or authorization. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro swiftly condemned the action, equating it to historical CIA-backed coups.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order that prevents the Trump administration from firing federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came after more than 4,000 workers received reduction-in-force notifications, a move the judge described as "unprecedented" and likely illegal. In her decision, the judge cited President Trump's own public statements suggesting the layoffs were intended to punish political opponents by targeting what he called "Democrat Agencies." The order applies to workers represented by two major federal unions that filed the lawsuit, halting the terminations pending a further hearing.</p>

          <p>A long-forgotten diary discovered in a Hong Kong apartment slated for demolition has shed new light on the participation of Chinese naval officers in the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944. The diary belonged to Lam Ping-yu, who was one of two dozen Chinese officers sent to train and serve with Allied forces in Europe. His meticulously detailed account, written from aboard the British battleship HMS Ramillies, provides a unique and valuable firsthand perspective of the massive naval operation. The discovery offers a compelling historical record of the multinational cooperation that was crucial to Allied victory.</p>

          <p>Lawyers representing victims of the notorious Jesus Army cult have condemned a plan that allows former loyal members, including some accused of perpetrating abuse, to receive a share of the group's multi-million-pound fortune. A BBC investigation revealed that 172 former members will receive significantly larger payouts from the sect's liquidated assets than the compensation awarded to over 600 abuse victims. Survivors have described the prospect of their abusers benefiting financially as "sickening," while their lawyer called the situation "shameful." The trust managing the assets stated it had no legal power to redirect the funds.</p>

          <p>A scientist who was recently laid off from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that the Trump administration's reduction in force during the government shutdown poses a serious threat to American public health. The anonymous scientist, who worked on chronic diseases, stated that entire programs have been eliminated, which will inevitably lead to "more preventable deaths." The firings are part of a broader plan to cut over 10,000 federal jobs, which the White House has explicitly framed as targeting "Democrat agencies." This has left critical public health functions severely understaffed and hampered the CDC's ability to respond to outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has dismissed hundreds of racist and sexist text messages exchanged by leaders of the Young Republican National Federation as youthful indiscretions, stating that "kids do stupid things." The leaked messages from a Telegram chat included statements like "I love Hitler" and a comment calling rape "epic." Despite bipartisan calls for the participants, some of whom are in their 30s, to resign from their positions, Vance suggested that focusing on the texts was a distraction from more important political issues. Critics have strongly condemned his remarks for downplaying the severity of the content.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed ambitious plans to construct a large triumphal arch in Washington D.C., situated across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial, to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary. The monument, which some have dubbed the "Arc de Trump," would be privately funded by his supporters and is stylistically based on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. This project is part of a series of aesthetic changes Trump has initiated in the capital during his second term, including a gilded Oval Office makeover. The proposal reflects the president's ambition to leave a distinct physical mark on the city's landscape.</p>

He alleges he was targeted for his journalism and mistreated while in detention, including being held in solitary confinement. Now back in El Salvador, Guevara plans to continue his reporting work while desperately hoping to one day be reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>California state officials are considering an unprecedented closure of a major section of Interstate 5 in San Diego County due to serious safety concerns over a planned live-fire military event at Camp Pendleton. The event, commemorating the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary and featuring Vice President JD Vance, may involve Navy ships firing live ordnance over the heavily trafficked freeway. Governor Gavin Newsom's office has sharply criticized the White House for poor communication and planning, calling the event a "pompous display of power."

          <p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a sweeping emergency directive ordering all federal agencies to immediately patch critical vulnerabilities in products from tech vendor F5. The urgent order follows F5's disclosure that a sophisticated nation-state actor had gained long-term, persistent access to its internal systems and proprietary source code. Officials warned that the breach poses an "imminent risk" to federal networks, as attackers could exploit the flaws to steal credentials and potentially take full control of targeted government systems. The Justice Department had initially requested a delay in the public disclosure of the breach.</p>
