        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was excluded from England's squad for the match against Andorra due to fitness concerns, as he only completed one full training session during the week. Coach Thomas Tuchel is considering unconventional lineup choices, potentially positioning Chelsea's Reece James as a left-back and Liverpool's Curtis Jones on the right side of defense. Other options include Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa and Newcastle's Dan Burn in central defense. Chelsea's Cole Palmer is anticipated to debut, while Declan Rice may rest, giving opportunities to Jordan Henderson and Jude Bellingham in central roles, with Harry Kane leading the attack.</p>

          <p>Thailand has temporarily closed two border crossings to tourists following a military clash with Cambodia in the disputed Emerald Triangle area, citing threats to sovereignty and security. The decision comes after a Cambodian soldier was killed on May 28, leading to increased military presence on both sides of the 817-kilometer border, which has been a source of conflict for over a century. While trade remains unaffected, six other checkpoints have tightened their opening hours. Despite the tensions, Thailand is committed to bilateral talks with Cambodia on June 14 to resolve the dispute, while Cambodia insists its stance is defensive and not to initiate conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decade-long study of parents who raised high-achieving children reveals five key strategies focusing on optimism, personalized motivation, and the importance of fostering a love for learning. Parents encouraged their children to think big and stay positive, with an emphasis on tailoring motivation to each child's interests. The study also highlighted the significance of learning through everyday tasks and experiences, promoting self-sufficiency rather than intervening in small struggles. Developmental psychologists are shifting focus to fostering a love of learning and curiosity, which can be encouraged through travel and exploration. The most successful parents motivated their children with love and support, rather than acting as coaches or critics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a significant drop after CEO Elon Musk engaged in a public dispute with President Donald Trump over a spending bill and EV subsidies. The conflict began with Musk criticizing Trump's bill, leading to a social media battle where Trump threatened to end government contracts and subsidies for Tesla. This fallout caused Tesla's shares to plummet, erasing billions in market value and diminishing Musk's net worth. The deterioration of this relationship could impact Tesla's regulatory landscape, government support, and tariff exemptions, exacerbating existing challenges related to competition and consumer backlash. The board is facing increasing pressure to ensure Tesla can stand on its own regardless of Musk's polarizing behavior.</p>

          <p>Earl Enderson Riley IV, a 21-year-old Seattle resident, has been charged with multiple counts of residential burglary and robbery for targeting the homes of professional athletes. Riley allegedly led a series of burglaries beginning in February, stealing high-value items from the residences of Seattle Mariners pitcher Luis Castillo and center fielder Julio Rodriguez. The thefts also included watches from former Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman's home and an attempted burglary at Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell's residence. This arrest follows a warning from the FBI about crime organizations targeting athletes, prompting security alerts from the NFL and NBA after similar burglaries at the homes of other star athletes.</p>

Experts caution against involving law enforcement in reproductive matters, highlighting the complexities and commonality of miscarriages.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The age-adjusted death rate for cancer in the US has decreased by about a third since 1991, thanks to advances in treatments and prevention strategies. Breakthroughs in treatments like stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy have transformed cancer from a death sentence to a manageable condition. The decline in smoking has also contributed to reduced cancer deaths, along with better and earlier screening methods. Immunotherapies, particularly CAR-T therapy, show promising results in turning a patient's own T-cells into guided missiles, offering new hope for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers.</p>

The review aims to showcase Labour's economic priorities and counter criticisms of slow progress, but potential welfare cuts could spark internal dissent, with the government struggling in the polls.
