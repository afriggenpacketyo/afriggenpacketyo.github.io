          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were unprepared for the deadly flash floods that struck Kerr County, as the storm arrived at night while residents were asleep. The Guadalupe River swelled by 26 feet in 45 minutes, reaching its second-highest level on record and leading to at least 27 fatalities. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly defended the lack of an earlier evacuation order, stating they had no reason to believe the event would be so severe. The area does not have a warning system on the river, which contributed to the tragic outcome.</p>

          <p>A severe humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the Bialowieza Forest on the border between Poland and Belarus, where migrants are stranded in harsh conditions. Since Belarus began encouraging migrants to cross into the EU in 2021, Poland has responded with a border fence and pushbacks, leaving many people injured and without aid. Human rights groups like Grupa Granica provide essential supplies and medical care, reporting a sharp increase in injuries from the five-meter fence. Despite the risks and the criminalization of their work by the Polish government, volunteers continue to respond to thousands of emergency calls.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed off the coast of South Carolina, leading to tropical storm warnings for coastal areas of both North and South Carolina. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, is moving slowly and is expected to make landfall on Sunday. Forecasters anticipate the storm will bring heavy rainfall of up to six inches in some locations, which could cause flash flooding. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division is preparing for impacts including gusty winds and high rip currents through Monday.</p>

          <p>At least 27 people, including nine children, have died following catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country, which officials are calling a "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and a children's summer camp by surprise. Hundreds of people have been rescued by air and boat, but dozens, including many children from Camp Mystic, remain missing as search and rescue operations continue. Officials noted that the rainfall far exceeded forecasts, and the area lacks a dedicated river warning system.</p>

The Anti-Defamation League called the president's use of the slur "very troubling and irresponsible," as it evokes centuries-old stereotypes about Jewish people and greed.

          <p>Reform UK Member of Parliament James McMurdock has voluntarily given up the party whip after a newspaper investigation raised questions about COVID-19 business loans he received. The Sunday Times alleged that McMurdock's companies took out £70,000 in Bounce Back loans despite potentially not meeting the turnover eligibility requirements. McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing, stating his business dealings were compliant, but requested the suspension as a precautionary measure to protect the party. Reform UK has launched an internal investigation into the matter, and McMurdock will now sit as an independent MP.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent threats of retribution against political opponents and critics have intensified, raising alarms among democracy advocates. In the past week, he has suggested deportation for Elon Musk, arrest for a prospective New York mayoral candidate, and investigation of a former Biden administration official. While some view these as distractions, others see a dangerous pattern of weaponizing state power to silence dissent. This follows a series of punitive actions since his inauguration, such as revoking security clearances for political rivals, signaling an erosion of the principle that citizens can criticize power without fear of retaliation.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared her decision to build her family as a single mother, a choice relationship experts are calling a sign of strength and self-awareness. Theron explained that her own upbringing in a home with alcoholism and her tendency to lose herself in relationships led her to realize she was not equipped to have children with a partner. Experts praise her for choosing not to repeat painful cycles and for recognizing that modern women with sufficient resources can choose partnership out of preference rather than necessity, leading to a more authentic and fulfilling life.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire in central California has rapidly grown to become the largest wildfire in the state this year, scorching nearly 80,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, has prompted evacuation orders in parts of San Luis Obispo and Kern counties and threatens about 50 structures. Over 600 firefighters, supported by air tankers and helicopters, are battling the fire, which has been fueled by heat and wind. The fire's rapid growth serves as a stark reminder of the state's heightened fire danger as a heat wave approaches.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a country with which none of them have ties. The men, originally from countries in Asia and Latin America, were the subject of a prolonged legal battle that saw them held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The deportation marks a significant and controversial expansion of the administration's immigration policy, drawing alarm from human rights advocates who fear the men could face torture or other harms. The move was made possible after the Supreme Court cleared the way, ending a lower court's block on the action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping is becoming increasingly confusing for consumers due to new digital payment systems that prompt for tips in a wider range of service situations. This phenomenon, dubbed "tipflation," has led to an explosion in tip requests at places like fast-food counters and even self-service kiosks. Experts note that pre-set tip options on payment screens can pressure customers into tipping more or in situations where they normally would not. This shift is driven by technology and business practices, leaving many customers uncertain about when and how much to tip.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes against Iran could reinforce North Korea's belief that a nuclear arsenal is essential for its survival, according to security analysts. Experts suggest that Pyongyang may view the U.S. action as evidence that President Trump is an unpredictable and untrustworthy leader, undermining any remaining potential for denuclearization talks. This development is likely to push North Korea to further enhance its nuclear capabilities, focusing on mobility, second-strike capacity, and hardened underground facilities. The situation also presents a significant concern for China, as it increases regional instability on its border.</p>

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming the alcohol-free drink can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The beverage typically contains coconut water, orange juice, magnesium, and salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients, alone or in combination, can reduce cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, doctors note that managing stress effectively relies on proven methods like getting quality sleep, exercising, and maintaining social connections, not on unproven viral trends.</p>
