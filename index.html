          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration, challenging the freeze of $2.2 million in funding, escalating the conflict between the institution and the White House amidst ongoing student activism related to the war in Gaza. Harvard's president, Alan M Garber, accuses the administration of attempting to control academic decision-making, asserting that the government should not dictate the university's curriculum or admissions policies. The Trump administration has been critical of campus protests, labeling them as anti-American and antisemitic, which Harvard refutes. The lawsuit aims to protect academic independence and critical research at the university.</p>

          <p>Chinese and French scientists have collaborated to create a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque's claustrum, a brain region believed to be involved in consciousness, to better understand the neural origins of awareness. The map details the connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain regions, potentially revealing how this area contributes to cognitive functions like memory and abstract thinking. The research also highlights differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, which could offer insights into the evolution of consciousness. This research contributes to the ongoing scientific exploration of how consciousness is generated in the brain.</p>

          <p>A European Space Agency project has launched an experiment to assess the feasibility of growing lab-grown food in space, aiming to reduce the high costs of feeding astronauts during long-term missions. The project involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats, with the goal of creating a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station within two years. Researchers are exploring precision fermentation techniques to produce essential food ingredients in space, envisioning a future where astronauts can 3D-print customized meals on demand, potentially revolutionizing space travel and habitation.</p>

Trump's pressure on Powell to lower interest rates has fueled concerns about the Fed's independence, further unsettling investors. The dollar index also slid to its lowest level since 2022, while gold reached a record high, signaling investor anxiety about the safety of U.S. assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A minke whale that died in Long Beach Harbor was found to have domoic acid poisoning, linked to a toxic algal bloom affecting marine life in Southern California. The algal bloom, which started earlier than usual this year, has impacted hundreds of sea lions and dolphins, with domoic acid accumulating in fish consumed by these animals. Experts attribute the bloom to factors like upwelling, climate change, and runoff from recent fires. While the event is severe, officials believe it is unlikely to significantly affect the overall marine mammal population.</p>

          <p>US trade officials have finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia following a trade case brought by American manufacturers alleging unfair competition. The Commerce Department imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar equipment from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The tariffs, ranging from 6.1% to 271.28% for dumping duties and 14.64% to 3,403.96% for countervailing duties, aim to protect US solar manufacturing investments from what they claim are unfairly cheap goods.</p>

          <p>Canada's federal election agenda is shifting towards fossil fuels, with climate change taking a backseat amid concerns about the US under President Trump. Both main contenders, Mark Carney's Liberals and Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives, are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure. Carney emphasizes a pragmatic approach, while Poilievre advocates for expanding the oil and gas sector and scrapping the industrial carbon tax. This represents a shift from the 2021 election, where the environment was a top voter concern, influenced by factors such as rising prices and the war in Ukraine.</p>

He suggested that the administration's focus on cutting off China may be harming US interests and that investors are hesitant to invest in companies where the government is seemingly mandating weaker performance.
