        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Singapore dollar is increasingly viewed as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, especially within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework, economic stability, and prudent policymaking. While it has gained strength against the US dollar, its path to global safe-haven status like the yen or Swiss franc is hindered by the relatively small size of its market and its managed exchange rate policy. Experts believe that while it may not become a primary global reserve, the SGD offers significant diversification benefits and could evolve into a key regional safe haven, akin to the "Swiss franc of Asia."

          <p>Following a week of deadly clashes in the Druze-majority city of Sweida, armed Bedouin clans have announced their withdrawal under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. The fighting, which killed hundreds and displaced over 128,000 people, had threatened Syria's fragile post-war stability and involved sectarian violence and Israeli airstrikes. Humanitarian aid convoys have begun entering the city to address shortages of food, fuel, and medicine. Despite the withdrawal, tensions persist, with U.S. envoy Tom Barrack urging all factions to lay down their arms and pursue dialogue to prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>Two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Beech Rise and Willow Rise, are set to be closed, displacing residents due to critical fire safety deficiencies that have not been rectified. Leaseholders describe enduring "years of hell," paying escalating service charges for poor maintenance while their property values collapsed. The situation highlights a "broken leasehold system," with a complex history of ownership involving offshore firms and prominent investors. Despite residents and the local council spending nearly £1 million on safety patrols and attempted repairs, the fire service has deemed the buildings too dangerous to inhabit.</p>

          <p>A 158-year-old Northamptonshire transport company, KNP, was forced into liquidation, resulting in 700 job losses, after a ransomware attack believed to have originated from a single guessed password.

          <p>A stark contrast is emerging between the U.S. and China on energy policy, particularly as the demand for electricity rises due to AI and other technologies. While China is forging ahead with ambitious renewable energy goals and investments to secure a global tech lead, the Trump administration is moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar power. This divergence in strategy highlights different national priorities in the face of global climate change and the technology race. China's proactive stance on green energy is positioning it to lead in the sector, while the U.S. appears to be deprioritizing it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey has maintained her political stances over the years without apology, generally leaning left and having supported Bernie Sanders in 2015. However, she recently revealed that she made a promise to UFC president Dana White, a close friend of Donald Trump, to never speak ill of Trump. She explained this was due to Trump providing a venue for the UFC in its early days when no one else would. Rousey emphasizes that voting is a personal right and encourages everyone to participate in the democratic process, particularly in local elections, regardless of their political affiliation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is threatening to obstruct the Washington Commanders' plans for a new stadium in D.C. unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the name change and that he might impose a restriction on the stadium deal if the team does not comply. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people. It remains unclear how Trump could legally intervene in the project, which involves redeveloping a federally owned site.</p>

The pilot expressed surprise that the Air Force base, which has radar, did not provide a warning. Both SkyWest and the U.S. Air Force have confirmed they are investigating the incident to determine how the two aircraft came into such close proximity.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing a significant measles outbreak in 2025, with over 3,800 cases, making it the only Western nation in the top 10 for outbreaks globally. The number of infections, primarily among children, is nearly three times that of the U.S., despite Canada's smaller population. The hardest-hit provinces are Ontario and Alberta, with outbreaks spreading rapidly in communities with historically low vaccination rates, a trend exacerbated by post-pandemic vaccine hesitancy. Health officials note that low immunization coverage is the primary driver, and cases are likely underreported, highlighting a major public health challenge.</p>

          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines, market analyst Jim Cramer argues that numerous positive factors are currently buoying the stock market. He identifies ten key drivers, including a strong earnings season, the economic stimulus from Trump's "big beautiful bill," and significant tax relief for businesses. Other tailwinds include massive investment in data centers and the electric grid, a renaissance in the U.S. energy sector, and a primed IPO market. Cramer suggests that these pro-business conditions have created circumstances for economic growth that could counteract the negative sentiment often associated with trade disputes.

          <p>The UK government has warned that people retiring in 2050 will be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless action is taken to boost private savings. In response, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to address the issue that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on a future strategy to tackle the savings gap. This initiative comes as the cost of the state pension's "triple lock" is also under scrutiny.

          <p>Xiang Jingen, the founder and CEO of Chinese quantum computing firm SpinQ, predicts that the technology will cross a critical "usefulness" threshold within the next five years. He compared the current state of quantum computing to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, on the cusp of a major transition. Founded in 2018, Shenzhen-based SpinQ develops both small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful industrial-grade systems. The company has already sold its products, which include chips and software, to over 50 countries, positioning itself as a key player in the nascent global quantum market.</p>

          <h2>Poll Shows Declining Support for Trump's Deportation Program as Public Calls for Focus on Prices</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. The decline in support is linked to a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals. Meanwhile, a large majority of Americans, particularly outside of Trump's political base, believe the administration should focus more on lowering prices and inflation. The poll also found that the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is widely viewed as primarily benefiting the wealthy, contributing to the president's overall approval rating sliding into the low 40s.</p>
