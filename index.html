          <p>House Republicans are struggling to advance a $9 billion spending rescission package due to a significant roadblock over the Jeffrey Epstein case. A bipartisan group of lawmakers is demanding a vote to force the release of Justice Department files related to the deceased sex offender, stalling the legislative process. The controversy has created internal divisions, with leadership offering a non-binding resolution to release the files, which Democrats have dismissed as a mere political cover.</p>

          <p>The Scottsdale, Arizona home of Diamondbacks star Ketel Marte was burglarized while he was in Atlanta for the MLB All-Star Game. Police are investigating what they termed a 'high-dollar residential burglary' where personal items and jewelry were stolen. The incident is part of a troubling trend where organized crime groups, some from South America, allegedly use social media to track the whereabouts of high-profile athletes and target their homes when they are out of town.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following its decision to cancel $4 billion in federal funding for the state's ambitious high-speed rail project. The lawsuit argues the administration's action was 'arbitrary and capricious' and motivated by President Trump's personal animus towards California and the project. State officials contend the move will cause significant economic harm to the Central Valley, where construction on the line is currently underway.</p>

          <p>This article details the ongoing conflict between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump appointed but has frequently criticized. The president's frustration stems from the central bank's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation, as well as from alleged mismanagement of a costly renovation of the Fed's headquarters. The report explores the Fed's independent role in setting monetary policy and the legally untested question of whether a president can fire a Fed chair 'for cause.' (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that this is primarily a political gesture aimed at scoring points with health-conscious voters, but it offers negligible health benefits, as cane sugar and corn syrup are metabolically almost identical. The move is framed as a symbolic victory that aligns with the 'Make America Healthy Again' movement but does little to address the actual health problems associated with sugary drinks.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' with its final episode scheduled for May 2026, ending the network's long-running late-night franchise. The network cited the decision as 'purely financial,' reflecting industry-wide challenges as advertising revenues decline and audiences shift from traditional television to digital platforms. Despite being the top-rated late-night show for nine seasons, the program has reportedly been losing money, signaling a major shift in the media landscape.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit filed by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company executives. The lawsuit sought to have the leaders reimburse Meta for an estimated $8 billion in fines and legal costs related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. Shareholders alleged that officials violated a 2012 FTC consent order by failing to protect user data. The terms of the settlement, announced in a Delaware court, were not immediately made public.</p>

          <p>In a powerful first-person commentary, an international doctor describes the horrific injuries sustained by children in Gaza and the profound heroism of local Palestinian healthcare workers. The author details treating children with shattered limbs and perforated organs from airstrikes, often after their parents were killed in the same blast. The article argues the true heroes are the local staff who continue their duties despite losing their own families and homes, and calls for an end to the blockade and attacks on medical facilities.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing record-high beef prices this summer, with a pound of ground beef now averaging over $6. This price surge is driven by a long-term decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, high feed costs, and a recent ban on cattle imports from Mexico due to a pest outbreak, with experts predicting little relief for shoppers in the near future.</p>
