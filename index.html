          <p>A 22-year-old man, Raymond Boodarian, has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of residential burglary for the shooting deaths of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple was allegedly killed in their Encino home after returning from the grocery store and confronting the intruder. Investigators used security footage and facial recognition to identify Boodarian, who was arrested days after the bodies were discovered during a welfare check. The case has shocked the local community, and prosecutors will later decide whether to seek the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum toured Alcatraz Island, following a directive from President Trump to explore reopening the historic site as a federal penitentiary. The administration suggests the facility could house the "worst of the worst" criminals, including violent offenders and undocumented immigrants. The plan has drawn sharp criticism from local San Francisco officials and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who highlighted the significant economic and historical value of Alcatraz as a major tourist attraction. The former prison was closed in 1963 due to high operational costs and has since become a popular National Park Service site.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal has reported the existence of a "bawdy" birthday letter allegedly sent by Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 for his 50th birthday. The letter, part of an album reviewed by the newspaper, reportedly featured a hand-drawn naked woman with Trump's signature stylized as pubic hair. President Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter, calling the story "fake" and threatening a lawsuit against the publication. This revelation comes as the administration faces criticism for its handling of the release of documents related to the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>An ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has been transported from Antarctica to the UK for analysis. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey will melt the ancient ice to study trapped materials like dust, ash, and algae. This research aims to unlock secrets about Earth's climate from a previously unknown period, specifically the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how the planet might respond to current high levels of greenhouse gases. The multinational effort to extract the 2.8km core was a complex and costly scientific endeavor.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:16:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly driven by a slowdown in the rapid increase of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite this, the headline inflation rate has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates. However, concerns about economic growth, impacted by potential U.S. tariffs, complicate the policy outlook for the nation's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, which his physician described as a "benign and common" condition. The diagnosis came after the 79-year-old president experienced mild swelling in his legs, prompting a comprehensive examination that ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart. The physician's memo also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use, and affirmed that Mr. Trump remains in "excellent" overall health.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party's decision to suspend Diane Abbott for a second time stems from her recent reaffirmation of comments that led to her initial suspension. In a BBC interview, Abbott said she did not regret her 2023 letter that appeared to downplay antisemitism compared to racism based on skin color. For a leadership under Keir Starmer, who has staked his reputation on eradicating antisemitism from the party, this lack of regret left little choice but to act consistently. The political context, including the party's past struggles with antisemitism under Jeremy Corbyn, makes any perceived equivocation on the issue highly sensitive and necessitates a firm response.</p>

          <p>Beef prices in the United States have climbed to record levels, with the average cost of ground beef and steak rising significantly over the past year.

Factors contributing to the tight supply include prolonged drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them.

This exchange is part of a broader pressure campaign by the Trump administration, which has been openly critical of Powell's leadership and interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing mounting bipartisan pressure to release Justice Department files concerning the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This pressure has intensified following a Wall Street Journal report about a personal note from Trump to Epstein, which the President denies. Despite campaign promises, the administration has resisted full disclosure, with Attorney General Pam Bondi stating no "client list" exists and the President dismissing the ongoing controversy as a "hoax." This stance has created a rift with some of his own supporters and provided an opening for political opponents to demand transparency.</p>

In a statement, the band cited the unacceptable risks posed by a combination of extreme weather events, including heat, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. The group stated that these conditions made touring unsafe for their audience, the band, and the crew. The abrupt cancellation, which came just a day after the band was still promoting the tour, left the possibility of future performances open-ended.

          <p>In a significant departure from the previous administration's stance, the Department of Justice is recommending a token one-day prison sentence for Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights. Hankison blindly fired ten shots into Taylor's apartment building during the fatal March 2020 raid. If the judge accepts the recommendation, Hankison, who could face up to life in prison, would serve no additional time due to credit for time served.

          <p>Following President Trump's diagnosis, medical experts have provided details on chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common circulatory condition affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population. CVI occurs when valves in leg veins are damaged, making it difficult for blood to return to the heart and causing it to pool, which can lead to swelling and varicose veins. While it can be painful, it is not considered a serious health threat. Treatment is typically non-surgical and focuses on managing symptoms through methods like compression stockings, leg elevation, and exercise to strengthen the calf muscles, which help pump blood.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to block the termination of a key FEMA program for pre-disaster mitigation. The lawsuit argues that the administration acted unlawfully by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision they contend rests with Congress. The program, established in 2018, funded local projects to protect against natural disasters. The states claim the cuts jeopardize critical infrastructure projects and leave communities at higher risk, with a recent analysis showing that counties supporting Mr. Trump in 2024 were disproportionately affected.</p>

The legal battle centered on Governor Ron DeSantis's move to dismantle a North Florida district where Black voters had consistently elected their candidate of choice.

          <p>Legal experts are expressing concern over the Supreme Court's growing use of its emergency "shadow docket" to issue major rulings with little or no explanation. This trend has been particularly visible in cases involving the Trump administration, where the Court has frequently granted emergency relief to allow controversial policies to proceed while litigation continues. Critics argue this practice undermines transparency and accountability, as the Court allows significant actions, such as dismantling a federal department, before the underlying legal questions are fully resolved. This approach raises questions about the Court's motivations and the potential for long-term damage to its institutional legitimacy.</p>
