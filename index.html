          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan near the border with Pakistan, leading to a significant loss of life and widespread destruction. Officials from the Taliban government confirmed that at least 622 people have been killed and over 1,300 injured, with numerous villages in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces destroyed. The shallow depth of the quake exacerbated the damage, and rescue operations are currently underway with assistance from the UN and the Afghan Red Crescent. This event is one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit the seismically active region in recent years.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to tighten the rules for migrants who have been granted asylum and wish to bring their family members into the country. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will announce new criteria, including tougher English language standards and proof of sufficient funds, aiming to align UK policy with other European nations. The reforms are part of a broader overhaul of what the government calls a "broken" asylum system, which also seeks to end the use of hotels for housing migrants. The move comes as the government faces pressure over the number of small boat crossings in the English Channel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba reported better-than-expected profits for the June quarter, primarily driven by a 26% year-on-year sales increase in its cloud computing division. This growth is largely attributed to robust demand for artificial intelligence services, with AI-related product revenue showing triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. While overall revenue slightly missed analyst forecasts, the strong performance of the cloud unit and a revival in e-commerce led to a significant surge in the company's share price in both U.S. and Hong Kong markets.

          <p>Shares in Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk rose after new trial data indicated its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, is more effective at reducing heart disease risk than rival medications. The study revealed that users of Wegovy (semaglutide) had up to a 57% greater reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death compared to those using Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro (tirzepatide). This positive clinical result reinforces Novo Nordisk's leading position in the highly competitive market for weight management drugs, directly impacting investor confidence.

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever childcare support expansion has launched, offering working parents 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" to help families with costs, but the rollout faces significant challenges. Nurseries are reporting severe staff shortages and long waiting lists, making it difficult for many parents to secure a place despite their eligibility.

          <p>Scotland's national rail operator, ScotRail, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for traveling during busy weekday rush hours. The policy, first introduced as a pilot scheme, aims to make train travel more affordable and encourage commuters to switch from cars to public transport, thereby reducing carbon emissions. This change will result in significant savings for travelers, with a ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow becoming nearly 50% cheaper, simplifying the ticketing system and making it more flexible for passengers across the country.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Power and the Palace," reports that Queen Camilla was the victim of an attempted sexual assault on a train when she was a teenager, which she successfully fought off. The account notes she ensured the man was arrested, an experience she has kept private to avoid overshadowing the stories of other survivors. For years, the Queen has been a vocal supporter of organizations that help victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Sources suggest this advocacy stems from hearing victims' stories over the years rather than this single incident.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered brine shrimp, an ancient species dating back 400 million years, in a highly saline water source within the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang, China. These resilient crustaceans, also known as Artemia, are widely used in aquaculture as feed and also have applications in medicine and cosmetics. Researchers from Tarim University will conduct laboratory studies to determine if this is a new species. The discovery suggests that the region has the natural conditions necessary to develop a commercial aquaculture industry focused on salt-tolerant organisms.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD saw its Hong Kong-listed shares fall nearly 8% after reporting a 30% slump in its second-quarter net profit. The company attributed the decline to an intense and aggressive price war within China's domestic EV market, which has harmed profitability across the industry. Despite the profit drop, BYD's revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, bolstered by expanding overseas sales as the company pushes into new global markets. The company's filing noted that increased price competition and excessive marketing had an adverse impact on the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The improvement in the private survey suggests some resilience in external demand, though domestic demand remains a concern for sustained economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. district court judge has issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The emergency injunction was granted after advocacy groups reported that children were being placed on planes for imminent removal, which they argued would put the minors at risk of abuse and persecution. The administration claimed the flights were for family reunification at the request of the Guatemalan government, not deportations. The judge's order will remain in place for 14 days, covering all unaccompanied children at risk of deportation.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping signals a potential reset in relations, driven partly by deteriorating ties with the United States. The Trump administration's tariffs on Indian imports have pushed New Delhi to seek pragmatic partnerships, including with its powerful neighbor, despite long-standing border disputes. While the leaders promised to work through their differences, significant challenges remain, such as the large trade deficit and continued military presence at the border. India's policy of "strategic autonomy" will be tested as it navigates its relationships with both Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>Following Inter Miami's 3-0 loss to the Seattle Sounders in the Leagues Cup final, striker Luis Suárez was involved in a heated post-match confrontation. After an initial altercation with Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas, Suárez was filmed spitting on Gene Ramirez, Seattle's director of security, as he was being pulled away by teammates. The incident is the latest in a long history of controversial on-field behavior for Suárez. The confrontation, which involved multiple players and staff from both teams, could lead to multi-game suspensions from the league for those involved.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott stated he was not surprised by the trade that sent his former teammate, All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons, to the Green Bay Packers. While Prescott didn't expect the trade itself, he noted that the contract negotiations between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones seemed to have become personal, making the outcome less shocking. Parsons received a record-breaking four-year, $188 million contract from the Packers after the trade. Prescott expressed relief that the tense situation was resolved, avoiding a potential distraction for the Cowboys.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has revoked the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, effective just days before the start of her nationwide book tour. In response to the move, which critics have labeled as political retaliation, California Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly arranged for the California Highway Patrol's Dignitary Protection Unit to provide security for Harris. The former VP's usual six months of post-service protection had been extended to 18 months by the previous administration due to threats she had received.</p>

          <p>Authorities have opened a homicide investigation following the discovery of a deceased man at the Burning Man festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. The man was found lying in a pool of blood on Saturday evening around the same time the event's iconic "Man" effigy was being burned. The Pershing County Sheriff's Office confirmed the victim was deceased at the scene but has not yet identified him or released information on a cause of death or potential suspects. Officials acknowledged the complexity of investigating a major crime in a temporary city that will soon be dismantled.</p>
