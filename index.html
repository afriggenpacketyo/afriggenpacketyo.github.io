          <p>A bill introduced in Massachusetts by Democratic state representatives would prohibit federal immigration enforcement officers, including ICE agents, from wearing masks during public interactions. Proponents cite transparency and accountability, referencing a specific arrest by masked agents. Opponents, including ICE leadership and former President Trump, argue that masks are necessary to protect agents and their families from doxing and violent threats. The legislation is part of a broader push by Democrats to increase oversight of federal immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Aix-Marseille University in France has received nearly 300 applications from American researchers for its "Safe Place for Science" program, created in response to academic spending cuts and policy shifts by the Trump administration. The initiative offers significant funding to lure U.S. academics, with some researchers expressing concerns about a potential "brain drain" from the United States. This trend is not isolated, as other universities in Europe, Canada, and China are also launching similar programs to attract top American talent.</p>

          <p>A search for fugitive Travis Decker, accused of killing his three daughters in Washington, was called off in Idaho's Sawtooth National Forest after authorities located the subject and confirmed it was a case of mistaken identity. The search began after a family reported seeing a man who closely resembled Decker. The located individual, a hiker, was cooperative with investigators. The U.S. Marshals Service continues to offer a $20,000 reward for information leading to Decker's capture, who remains at large.</p>

          <p>All 31 construction workers trapped deep underground in a Los Angeles tunnel project were successfully rescued following a partial collapse. The workers, located about six miles from the entrance and 400 feet below ground, managed to navigate over debris to a tunnel boring machine before being brought to the surface. Officials, who initially feared a major tragedy, praised the workers' calm response and hailed the outcome as a victory. No major injuries were reported, and an investigation into the cause of the cave-in is underway.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on how Hollywood films during the Cold War, from "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to "The Day After," created a powerful cultural vocabulary and visual understanding of nuclear annihilation. The author argues that these movies instilled a tangible fear of the bomb in generations who grew up with it, a fear that has since faded for younger people despite the continued existence of nuclear arsenals. The piece suggests that as the collective memory of this threat recedes, new films may be needed to remind society of the persistent danger.</p>

While the Texas flood resulted in over 120 deaths and caught officials by surprise, the Ruidoso flood, though destructive, had a much lower death toll. Local officials and residents in Ruidoso were better prepared, having anticipated increased flood risk due to recent wildfire "burn scars" that make the ground less absorbent.

          <h2>China Claims to Have Foiled Three Foreign Espionage Plots, Including a 'Honey Trap'</h2>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security announced it had uncovered three separate spying cases, urging public officials to be vigilant against foreign intelligence operations. One detailed case involved a government employee who was allegedly lured by the "seductive beauty" of a foreign agent, blackmailed with intimate photos, and forced to hand over state secrets. The announcement is part of Beijing's heightened focus on counter-espionage amid worsening relations with the U.S. and other Western nations, which have also accused China of similar intelligence tactics.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, has killed at least 15 Palestinians, among them eight children and two women, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. The victims were reportedly queueing for nutritional supplements at a medical point when the strike occurred. The Israeli military stated it targeted a "Hamas terrorist" in the area and is reviewing the incident, expressing regret for any harm to uninvolved individuals.

          <p>A review of military combat and fitness standards initiated by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is causing concern that it may be a veiled attempt to sideline women from front-line roles. Hegseth, who before his confirmation stated he was against women in combat, has dispatched a team to elite units to look for evidence of lowered standards, though military officials maintain that job-specific standards are gender-neutral and have not been weakened. Critics argue the review is a "solution in search of a problem" that could alter the landscape for women in the military.</p>

          <p>An analysis of letters sent by the Attorney General to tech companies regarding the TikTok ban reveals a claim to a "dispensing power," a royal prerogative abolished in 17th-century England. The letters argue the president can exempt companies from a law if he believes it interferes with his foreign policy duties. Legal experts across the political spectrum describe this as a dangerous and unconstitutional assertion, effectively allowing the president to issue licenses for lawlessness. This move is seen as a significant expansion of executive power with potentially corrupting future implications.</p>

          <p>After a cabinetmaker took their $8,100 deposit and closed his business, a retired Tennessee couple took creative legal action to recoup their money. Steve and Tammy Wright won a civil judgment but had to enforce it themselves.

The couple successfully recovered their deposit and legal fees from the auction proceeds, providing a unique example of citizen-led legal enforcement.</p>

While the ruling does not overturn the athletics regulations themselves, it is a significant step in her long legal fight and could lead to the case being reheard by Switzerland's supreme court.</p>
