          <p>An 18-wheeler carrying eight million dimes crashed on U.S. Route 287 in Alvord, Texas, resulting in a 14-hour road closure as crews worked to recover the spilled coins. The truck, transporting freshly minted coins for the U.S. Mint, rolled onto its side after the driver veered off the roadway and overcorrected. While the driver and passenger sustained non-life-threatening injuries, the cleanup required heavy-duty vacuum trucks and manual labor to collect the scattered dimes. Despite initial rumors of $8 million being spilled, the actual amount was $800,000, and the town of Alvord jokingly considered metal detecting efforts.</p>

          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board has preliminarily approved rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs for landlords. The panel voted in favor of increases ranging from 1.75% to 4.75% on one-year leases and 4.75% to 7.75% on two-year leases, with a final decision expected in the coming months. Tenant advocates expressed concerns that the increases would exacerbate the housing crisis, while landlords argued that the adjustments were insufficient to cover rising expenses. The vote took place amid protests, highlighting the political sensitivity of rent stabilization in New York City.</p>

          <p>New vehicle sales in the U.S. surged in March as consumers sought to purchase cars before a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts took effect on April 3. This increase in sales led to a decrease in dealer inventory of pre-tariff vehicles, but a study projects overall vehicle sales will decline in the coming years if the tariffs remain in place. President Trump announced relief for U.S. automakers by ensuring they wouldn't be levied with tariffs on steel and aluminum. Dealerships stocked up in anticipation of higher prices, expecting an immediate rise in vehicle costs after the tariffs take effect.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia student with a green card, was released from ICE detention following a federal judge's order, after being detained during his U.S. citizenship interview. The judge cited concerns that the Trump administration was attempting to deport Mahdawi in retaliation for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, potentially violating his First Amendment rights. The Justice Department is appealing the court order. Mahdawi's attorneys argued his detention was a result of retaliation for protected speech, comparing it to the Red Scare and McCarthyism.</p>

          <p>Russell Defreitas, a New York drug trafficker, received a 53-year prison sentence after being convicted on multiple charges related to a large-scale cocaine and fentanyl trafficking operation that resulted in two overdose deaths. Defreitas directed associates not to call 911 when a woman overdosed in a hotel room booked in his name, and he removed drugs and evidence before leaving to eat at Wendy's. Authorities later found drugs, firearms, and other incriminating evidence in his trailer and hotel room, and he was in possession of bank cards belonging to two of his overdose victims. The district attorney endorsed Chelsey’s Law, which would give prosecutors additional tools to hold dealers accountable when their products cause death.</p>

          <p>Robert “Bobby” Lozoff, the bartender credited with creating the modern Tequila Sunrise at The Trident in Sausalito, has died at the age of 77. Lozoff and a co-bartender, Billy Rice, developed the popular version of the drink in the 1970s, and it gained fame after Lozoff served it to a member of the Rolling Stones in 1972. The band enjoyed the drink so much that they took it on tour with them, popularizing the combination of tequila, orange juice, and grenadine worldwide. Lozoff's legacy lives on through the cocktail, which remains a popular choice at bars and restaurants.</p>

          <p>A Senate effort to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs fell short, with Republicans largely opposing the measure amid concerns about economic disruption. The resolution, led by Senators Ron Wyden and Rand Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs, but failed to secure the necessary votes. The vote was largely symbolic, as the House was unlikely to take up the measure. The tariffs, which include a 10% baseline on most U.S. trading partners, have sparked anxiety over their potential economic impact.</p>

Economists cautioned that the figures may be skewed due to the surge in imports, but the report signals potential headwinds for the economy later in 2025.

          <p>The US and Ukraine have signed a much-anticipated natural resources deal, which the treasury department said would help with its post-war reconstruction efforts. President Donald Trump repeatedly pushed for the agreement as a prerequisite to offering any future security guarantees to Kyiv, as Ukraine fights against Russia's invasion. The deal will see the the creation of a joint Ukrainian-US investment fund to search for minerals, and set outs how revenues would be split. The US said the agreement "signals to Russia" that the Trump administration is "committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous" Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that Americans may have to "do with less" as a result of the trade war with China, marking a shift from previous statements minimizing potential disruptions. He argued that China has benefited significantly from trade imbalances with the U.S. and insisted that Americans don't need many of the goods imported from China. Trump maintained that the trade war will ultimately be more detrimental to China, which relies on the U.S. as a market for its goods. He also stated that negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping would occur.</p>

While Mexico is accepting some deportees, including third-country nationals, concerns remain about their legal status and treatment.
