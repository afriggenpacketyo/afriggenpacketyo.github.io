          <p>In response to a reported surge in violent crime, the Trump administration has directed federal agencies to increase their law enforcement presence in Washington, D.C. The operation, coordinated by a task force established in March, involves agencies like the FBI and DEA focusing on tourist areas and crime hotspots. This move is framed as fulfilling a campaign promise to restore safety in the nation's capital, with the White House stating there will be "no safe harbor for violent criminals" under the new directive. The deployment will initially last for seven days with an option to extend as needed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has doubled the bounty for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, raising the amount to $50 million. The Trump administration accuses Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker, alleging he collaborates with cartels to smuggle fentanyl-laced cocaine into the United States. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that U.S. authorities have linked significant drug seizures and over $700 million in assets to Maduro and his associates. Venezuela's Foreign Minister dismissed the move as "pathetic" political propaganda.</p>

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has officially approved a plan for the nation's military to take control of Gaza City while aiming to provide humanitarian aid to civilians outside combat zones. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the long-term goal is not to govern the territory but to demilitarize it, dismantle Hamas, and eventually transfer governance to "Arab forces." This strategy follows the breakdown of ceasefire negotiations and faces strong international opposition due to the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The plan outlines five principles for ending the war, including the return of all hostages.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton won the biggest title of his career at the Canadian Open, defeating Russia's Karen Khachanov in a tight three-set final. After losing the first set in a tiebreak, the 22-year-old rallied to win 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-6(3). The victory marks his first ATP Masters 1000 championship and makes him the youngest American to achieve this feat since Andy Roddick in 2004. The match included a tense second set where play was briefly halted due to technical issues with the line-calling system.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration's executive order on birthright citizenship from being enforced. This is the fourth court ruling to block the policy, which aims to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. The judge certified a class action for all affected children, stating the plaintiffs were highly likely to win their case on the grounds that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The administration argues the amendment's jurisdiction clause does not apply to parents without permanent legal status.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances quantifies how climate change has shifted the start of California's fire season significantly earlier over the past three decades. Researchers found that in some regions like the Cascade Range, the season now begins 46 days earlier than it did in the early 1990s. The primary drivers are not human-ignited fires, which have decreased, but rather earlier snowmelt and increased drying of vegetation due to rising average temperatures. This year is already on pace to exceed the five-year average for burned acreage, underscoring the growing and prolonged threat of wildfires in the state.</p>

The new duties, part of Trump's "America First" policy, will apply to companies that are not significantly manufacturing within the United States. As the region is already contending with other U.S. tariffs, this latest move, combined with policy unpredictability from Washington, may create an opening for China to increase its economic and technological influence.

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement to avoid a court order. Tonka, a former celebrity animal actor, was found in a small cage and has since been relocated to a sanctuary. Animal rights group PETA, which initiated the legal action, praised the sentence as justice for the animal's suffering.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has begun detaining dozens of migrants who crossed the English Channel as part of a new pilot deportation agreement with France. Under the "one-in, one-out" deal, the UK can return a migrant who arrives illegally via a small boat in exchange for accepting an approved asylum seeker from France. The Home Office confirmed that detentions are underway and the first returns could happen within weeks, despite potential legal challenges. The 11-month pilot program is a key part of the Labour government's strategy to secure the UK's borders and deter illegal crossings.</p>

          <p>Instagram's parent company, Meta, is facing user backlash following the launch of a new map feature that can share a user's location with their followers. While the company insists the tool is an opt-in feature and is off by default, many users expressed alarm, with some claiming their location was shared without their explicit consent. Concerns were raised about the potential for stalking and the danger it poses to vulnerable individuals. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri responded by stating that the feature requires double consent and that the company is investigating to ensure no one's location is shared unintentionally.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral GLP-1 medication, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity achieve significant weight loss in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Participants lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with a safety profile consistent with existing injectable weight loss drugs. The most common side effects reported were gastrointestinal issues like nausea and diarrhea. The company plans to submit the pill for regulatory approval later this year, which could make it a more accessible and convenient alternative to current injectable treatments by 2026.</p>

          <p>The UK government is drafting legislation to impose new geographical restrictions on serious violent and sexual offenders after they are released from prison. Instead of traditional exclusion zones that bar entry to specific areas, the new system would confine offenders to a designated area where they are permitted to be. This approach, which would be enforced with enhanced electronic tagging, is intended to provide victims with greater peace of mind by reducing the chance of accidental encounters. Critics, however, have raised concerns that the plan will add more pressure to an already strained probation service.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing federal agencies to explore regulatory changes that could permit 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity. While not an immediate change, the move could significantly broaden investment options for millions of Americans, giving them access to higher-risk, higher-reward asset classes. The private equity and cryptocurrency industries, which have long sought access to the trillions in retirement funds, have applauded the decision. The process of rewriting the rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is expected to take several months or longer. (not investment advice)</p>
