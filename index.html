          <p>Seven men in Rochdale were found guilty of sexually exploiting two teenage girls, repeatedly sexually assaulting them over a five-year period between 2001 and 2006. The victims, groomed from the age of 13, were treated as "sex slaves" and expected to "have sex with the men whenever and wherever they wanted." One victim reported being targeted by over 200 men, while the other said social workers had dismissed her as a prostitute since age 10. The abusers plied the girls with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes, offering them places to stay, with police admitting they could have done more at the time. Operation Lytton, investigating historical child sexual exploitation in the town, has led to 32 convictions to date. </p>

          <p>Israel launched a preemptive strike against Iran early Friday, resulting in air raid sirens sounding in Tel Aviv and a declared state of emergency by Defense Minister Israel Katz. Katz stated that a missile and drone attack against Israel and its civilian population is expected imminently. The U.S. confirmed it did not provide assistance or have any involvement in the Israeli strike, which is presumed to be targeting Iran's nuclear program. The strikes signal a significant escalation of tensions in the region, raising concerns about potential retaliatory actions and further destabilization.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the rise and fall of the tech right's support for Donald Trump, noting a shift in Silicon Valley politics from left-libertarianism to a more conservative stance driven by factors like the "Great Awokening," macroeconomic changes, and perceived attacks from liberals. Despite some deregulation and tax cuts, the tech right's priorities were largely ignored by the Trump administration, leading to disappointment and a potential fracturing of the coalition. The author suggests Democrats should consider winning back voters disillusioned by Trump's failures, acknowledging that the initial alliance was a bad bet for the tech industry. This analysis highlights the complex interplay between tech, politics, and economic policy.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump attacked judges on the Court of International Trade and conservative legal figure Leonard Leo after a ruling against his tariffs. Trump expressed frustration that judges appointed with the recommendation of the Federalist Society did not support his efforts to overturn the 2020 election or strike down tariffs. The article suggests a growing rift between Trump and the conservative legal movement, as judges prioritize legal principles over loyalty to Trump's demands. This division highlights the contrasting approaches of political conservatism and judicial independence.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dubbed the attack "Operation Rising Lion," aimed at eliminating the Iranian threat, while Iran launched over 100 drones in retaliation, which were intercepted by Israeli air defenses. </p>

          <p>The High Court dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, arguing the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law. The court found the government was aware some families would no longer be able to afford private education but was entitled to prioritize revenue for public services. The government welcomed the judgment, stating the policy would generate Â£1.8 billion annually to support state school pupils. Head teachers are planning to appeal the judgment, as the ruling has significant implications for families and private schools across the UK.</p>

Opposition politicians criticized Badenoch's comments, while the End Fuel Poverty Coalition deemed them "out of touch." Badenoch emphasized the importance of energy security and criticized Labour's extension of the tax, while supporters of the current windfall tax say it will provide necessary governmental revenue. </p>

          <p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff in western India, killing all but one of the 242 people on board, marking the first fatal crash of this aircraft model. Preliminary data indicates the plane lost signal less than a minute after takeoff, reaching a maximum altitude of 625 feet before crashing in a residential area. Investigators will examine the black boxes, maintenance records, pilot maneuvers, and weather conditions to determine the cause of the crash. Manufacturing and quality concerns about Dreamliners have surfaced before, but it is unclear if they are related to this incident.</p>

          <p>USA Fencing's board of directors has amended its policy that prioritized states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for competition host sites and a policy that restricted the playing of the national anthem at some events. The decision follows criticism over the punishment of a fencer who refused to compete against a trans opponent and scrutiny from federal lawmakers. The new policy prioritizes cost, safety, and convenience for all national-event bids, while the national anthem policy aims to provide consistent guidance across tournaments. The organization is also preparing to change its policy allowing trans athletes to compete in the women's category, requiring athletes to compete according to their biological sex if forced to change its stance.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the increasing recruitment of children by armed groups in Colombia, highlighting the case of a 15-year-old allegedly involved in the shooting of a senator. According to the Colombian Ombudsman's Office, 409 children and teenagers were recruited in 2024, up from 342 in 2023, though authorities acknowledge the data is underestimated. The recruitment methods have become more sophisticated, with armed groups using tools such as TikTok to reach youngsters in isolated areas, with the recruited children often coming from low-income urban areas or isolated rural territories where the Colombian state has a limited presence.</p>

          <p>Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting the "heart" of Iran's nuclear program and killing senior military figures and nuclear scientists. Iranian state media reported civilian casualties, while the Israeli military stated Iran launched about 100 drones towards Israel, which it was intercepting. Prime Minister Netanyahu described the strikes as a targeted operation to eliminate the Iranian threat, citing Iran's steps to "weaponize" in recent months. International reactions have been mixed, with Trump urging Iran to make a deal and Oman holding Israel responsible for the escalation.</p>

          <p>Recent policy changes, particularly under the Trump administration, are poised to negatively impact Baby Boomers' financial security, according to a new report. Overhauls to Social Security, volatile markets, and potential cuts to Medicare and Medicaid pose significant threats to older Americans. Cuts to Social Security staff and field offices could disproportionately affect low-income Boomers, while middle-income seniors may struggle with a volatile market and rising medical costs.

          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait, through which roughly 20 million barrels of oil pass daily, would likely trigger further retaliation and negatively impact Iran's largest oil customer, China. Some analysts argue that a full-scale disruption of global oil flows by closing the waterway might even be physically impossible. While Iran has previously threatened to close the strait, experts suggest such action would be a last resort and could be more detrimental to Tehran than its adversaries.</p>
