          <p>Lucy Connolly, who was imprisoned for inciting racial hatred after calling for people to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers, has been released after serving part of her sentence. In her first interviews, she claimed to be a "political prisoner" of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and asserted her support for free speech. Connolly, who pleaded guilty, stated her social media post was not her "finest moment" and that she does not advocate violence. She plans to meet with members of Donald Trump's administration to discuss free speech issues in the UK.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes and shootings in Gaza have killed at least 25 people, including displaced individuals in tents and those seeking food aid. This comes as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a leading global authority, officially declared that famine is gripping Gaza City. The announcement has intensified international calls for Israel to halt its offensive, though Israel has denounced the report as a lie. Meanwhile, ceasefire negotiations remain stalled as Israel prepares for a potential large-scale operation in Gaza City, a situation causing grave concern for the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>A man has been charged with assault on a federal officer and destruction of government property following a violent clash in San Francisco. A group of up to 20 anti-ICE protesters allegedly swarmed and physically assaulted immigration agents outside a courthouse. The suspect, Adrian Guerrero, is accused of slashing a government vehicle's tire and threatening to stab an agent and harm his family while armed with a knife. The Department of Homeland Security stated that assaults on its agents have increased dramatically, attributing the violence to rhetoric from sanctuary city politicians.</p>

          <p>A tour bus carrying over 50 passengers rolled over on the New York State Thruway near Pembroke, resulting in the deaths of five people. The bus was traveling from Niagara Falls to New York City when the driver lost control for unknown reasons, causing the vehicle to enter the median and overturn in a ditch. Dozens of other passengers sustained injuries ranging from stable to critical and were transported to several area hospitals. State police have ruled out mechanical failure and operator impairment as causes, and the investigation into the accident is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A new Czech documentary, "The Great Patriotic Trip," has sparked intense debate by taking three Czech citizens with pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian views on a journey to witness the war's reality firsthand. Director Robin Kvapil filmed the trio as they visited sites of destruction and mass graves in cities like Kharkiv and Izium. Despite confronting direct evidence of Russian aggression, including testimonies from victims, the participants largely maintained their conspiratorial beliefs, concluding the trip did not change their minds. The film highlights the deep-seated nature of disinformation and has led to both support and threats against the director.</p>

          <p>A new medical device is offering hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their recovery. The Vivistim System, an FDA-approved implant, uses vagus nerve stimulation during physical therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. The article highlights the story of restaurateur Tommy Fello, who regained significant movement in his left arm after receiving the implant, following months of minimal progress with traditional therapy. Neurosurgeons describe the technology as a first-of-its-kind approach that could redefine possibilities for stroke rehabilitation and help patients reclaim their lives.</p>

Blood levels in the affected population were approximately 10 times higher than in those outside the contaminated zone, raising significant health concerns linked to cancer and other serious diseases.

Critics argue these changes are superficial and do not address the core health issues of processed foods, such as high levels of salt, sugar, and saturated fat.

          <p>The scientific community in the United States is grappling with how to respond to what it perceives as unprecedented political interference from the Trump administration. Actions such as firing vaccine advisers, terminating grants, and denigrating federal scientists have prompted researchers to organize protests, file lawsuits, and publicly criticize government actions. However, this pushback creates a difficult situation: while silence could cede public opinion, actively fighting back risks reinforcing the administration's narrative that science is a partisan endeavor. This dynamic places scientists in a political trap, where defending their work's integrity can be misconstrued as taking a political side.</p>

The article suggests that mimicking Trump only reinforces his dominance over the terms of political engagement and fails to build a coherent, relatable alternative.

Financial advisors warn that such an early exit from the workforce requires significant savings to fund a retirement that could last 30 to 40 years, including the crucial gap in health care coverage before Medicare eligibility begins at 65. The article notes that many people retire earlier than planned not because they are financially prepared, but due to unforeseen circumstances like health problems or employment issues.

          <p>In a recent interview, astrophysicist and author Adam Becker challenges the visions of space colonization promoted by figures like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Becker argues that Mars is a terrible and hostile environment, and that no catastrophe on Earth could make it a worse place to live. He dismisses the idea of a Martian settlement as a "delusion" and a status symbol for the ultra-wealthy, rather than a practical solution for humanity's future. Instead of pursuing these fantasies, he contends that focus and resources should be directed toward solving problems and improving life here on Earth, our most special and suitable home.</p>

          <p>A former Sacramento elementary school teacher, Kim Kenneth Wilson, has been sentenced to 215 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to nine felony counts of lewd acts upon a child. For years, Wilson used his role as the head of the campus broadcast club to groom and sexually assault numerous students, often filming the crimes in a private, soundproof room. A search of his home uncovered a vast collection of recordings and other disturbing materials.

          <p>While standard sunscreen protects against UV radiation, it often fails to block visible light, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, especially in people with darker skin. Dermatologists explain that tinted sunscreens, which contain pigments like iron oxide, offer superior protection against visible light damage. This is crucial for preventing and managing dark spots that can arise from skin inflammation, such as acne. As research on the effects of visible light evolves, experts are recommending tinted products as a more comprehensive solution for skin health, though they note the need for a wider range of shades to match diverse skin tones.</p>

The article highlights the legacy of industrial mining, which has left behind environmental damage without benefiting local populations.

This activity marks the 31st display of molten rock since December, part of an ongoing eruption pattern.

          <p>Utility bills are rising across the U.S., with electricity costs up 5.5% and natural gas up 13.8% over the last year. Experts attribute the increase to a surge in demand driven by AI data centers, electrification, and renewed economic activity, which has outpaced the development of new energy transmission infrastructure. The article also points to Trump administration policies, such as curtailing renewable energy projects and forcing uneconomic coal plants to remain operational, as factors expected to further increase costs for consumers.

The visa allows survivors to remain in the U.S. if they assist law enforcement, but median processing times have jumped from six months in 2014 to nearly 20 months now. A policy allowing immigration authorities to issue a notice to appear for deportation upon denial has heightened fear among survivors.

The article posits that airing a series heavily focused on police brutality and critical of the first Trump administration may have become too risky for the network in the current political environment.

          <p>A commentary piece argues that the 27th season of "South Park" has succeeded where other comedies have failed in effectively satirizing the second Trump administration. The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have revived their anti-Trump commentary with gratifyingly mean and specific caricatures of political figures, avoiding the pitfalls of generic or self-righteous humor. By using its own established satirical language, such as depicting Trump with the same animation style as Saddam Hussein, the show makes pointed comparisons without moralizing. This approach allows the series to generate genuine laughs while critiquing the outsized and often bleak reality of current politics.</p>
