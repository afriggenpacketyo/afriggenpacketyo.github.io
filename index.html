          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck Texas Hill Country, resulting in at least 24 fatalities in what officials are calling a 'mass casualty event.' The Guadalupe River rose with shocking speed, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise, with dozens of campers still reported as missing. Rescue operations are extensive, involving helicopters and drones, as the state grapples with the sudden and catastrophic disaster. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, promising unlimited state resources for the affected counties.</p>

          <p>An arsonist set fire to the entrance of a Melbourne synagogue, forcing about 20 worshippers who were sharing a Shabbat meal to evacuate through a rear exit. Fortunately, no one was injured in the blaze, which authorities are investigating as a serious, hate-motivated crime and an act of antisemitism. The incident occurred just months after another synagogue in the city was destroyed by arson, heightening concerns about rising antisemitism in Australia. Police have released a CCTV image of a person of interest but have not yet made an arrest.</p>

          <p>A single mother reports being left with a $50,000 loan after her car dealership, Autosmart, allegedly failed to pay off her trade-in vehicle's financing as promised. This incident highlights the potential dangers of auto loan refinancing scams, where companies may collect payments without settling the original debt, leading to damaged credit and risk of repossession. The dealership in question has an 'F' rating from the Better Business Bureau, with multiple similar complaints filed against it. Experts advise consumers to be cautious, read all fine print, and research dealerships thoroughly before signing any agreements.</p>

          <p>Eight OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to a larger-than-expected oil production increase of 548,000 barrels per day for August. This decision accelerates the unwinding of previous voluntary supply cuts, citing a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals as key drivers. The move comes as the alliance aims to balance supply with rising summer demand and geopolitical tensions that have recently influenced oil prices. The group is moving more quickly than its initial plan to gradually restore production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military announced it successfully struck the Borisoglebsk airbase in Russia's Voronezh region, a key hub for several types of Russian fighter jets. The attack reportedly hit a depot containing glide bombs and other aircraft, representing a significant strategic blow to Russia's military capabilities. This strike occurred as Russia launched another massive wave of over 300 drones into Ukraine. The development comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a productive call with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss strengthening Ukraine's air defenses and potential joint weapons production.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have significant cancer-fighting potential. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug could strengthen the immune system's response to tumors by restoring dendritic cells, which are crucial for anti-tumor immunity. These 'intelligence agents' of the immune system often become depleted as cancer progresses. The discovery is being hailed as a potential new strategy for tumor immunotherapy, offering a new avenue for cancer treatment research.</p>

Combs was found guilty on lesser charges of transporting for prostitution. The article critiques the defense's strategy of portraying the events as a mere 'kink' and suggests the acquittal on the most serious charges should not obscure the disturbing pattern of abuse and control detailed by multiple witnesses during the trial.</p>

The trend is fostering a sense of despair and raising fundamental questions about the value of a college degree when the learning process is being outsourced to machines.

          <p>Nearly two weeks after U.S. and Israeli strikes targeted Iran's nuclear facilities, an analysis suggests that the proclaimed 'historic victory' may be short-lived. While the attacks caused significant damage to enrichment infrastructure, experts believe Iran retains the knowledge and foundational elements to reconstitute its program, potentially in more concealed locations. In response, Iran has already moved to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, the UN's nuclear watchdog.

The West's support for the attacks and perceived double standards compared to its condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have fostered deep mistrust.

Polling shows that Medicaid is a highly popular program, and Democrats are framing the legislation as a 'cruel' assault on healthcare to offset tax cuts.

          <p>The credit scoring company FICO has announced that it will begin incorporating data from 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) loans into some of its scoring models this fall. This change reflects the growing popularity of services like Affirm and Klarna, which allow consumers to split purchases into installments. For consumers, this means that on-time BNPL payments could help build their credit history, while missed payments could negatively impact their score. Lenders have sought this data to gain a more complete picture of a borrower's financial obligations and avoid extending excessive credit.</p>

At the recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes, firms like Robinhood and Deutsche Bank announced new initiatives for tokenized assets and funds on Ethereum-based networks. Despite price volatility, institutions are betting on Ethereum's utility, stability, and security for creating faster and cheaper financial transactions.

          <p>This commentary piece argues that President Donald Trump's plan to host a UFC event on the White House grounds is more than a spectacle; it's a form of authoritarian theatre. The author draws parallels between Trump's use of the hyper-masculine, nationalist sport and the way fascist regimes like Mussolini's Italy used sports to project strength and a cult of personality. The longstanding partnership between Trump and UFC CEO Dana White has allowed the president to cultivate a strongman image, and staging a fight at the White House is presented as the natural climax of this political branding.</p>

          <p>China's state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant offshore floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, Shandong province. This project, combined with a similar one launched in May, forms the largest initiative of its kind and is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This output will help cut carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. The innovative design allows the solar panels to rise and fall with the tide, and their proximity to the water's surface increases their energy generation efficiency.</p>

As a key ally of Tehran, Beijing has intensified its criticism of the attacks while positioning itself as a key mediator and responsible global power.

          <p>This commentary piece analyzes the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest as a deeply symbolic, if disgusting, cultural event. The author portrays champion Joey Chestnut as an elite athlete dedicated to his craft, but also frames the contest itself as a grotesque spectacle of excess that honestly reflects a dysfunctional American relationship with food and consumption. The article argues that the event is a form of punkish satire, holding up a mirror to a society obsessed with wants and desires. It concludes that the contest, in its own way, is a powerful and telling piece of modern art.</p>

          <p>Recent studies are reigniting the debate over whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently, with conflicting results on the perception of visual illusions. One study suggests people from 'carpentered' Western environments see illusions differently than those from rural Namibian communities. However, another study convincingly dismantles this hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion. The author suggests that perception is an active construction by the brain, not a direct window to reality, and that understanding our own perceptual biases can foster a much-needed humility about how we see the world.</p>

The city has established three supervised outdoor pool zones, complete with lifeguards, changing rooms, and showers.

Critics argue that the company's financial incentive model encourages aggressive enforcement for minor infractions, and the intimidating penalty notices pressure people into paying without a proper appeals process.</p>
