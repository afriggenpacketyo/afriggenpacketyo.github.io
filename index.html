          <p>A new travel ban implemented by the US president has sparked fear and frustration among immigrants from targeted countries, who express concerns about the ban disrupting their lives. One Haitian asylum seeker voiced their confusion and distress over being continuously targeted by the president's policies. The ban is causing widespread anxiety and uncertainty for those seeking refuge and stability in the United States, particularly those from nations facing political instability or humanitarian crises. This action adds to a growing list of restrictive immigration measures, further complicating the lives of immigrants in the country. The policy's long-term effects on immigrant communities remain to be seen.</p>

          <p>A survivalist is advising hikers and outdoorsmen to avoid the Ozarks region of Arkansas due to the ongoing search for escaped convict Grant Hardin, a former police chief serving time for murder and sexual assault. Hardin, nicknamed the "Devil in the Ozarks," escaped from a medium-security prison and is considered armed and dangerous. The expert suggests that Hardin's survival skills and lack of regard for human life make him a significant threat to anyone in the area.

          <p>India's central bank has exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest level since August 2022. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited significantly softened inflation and lower-than-expected growth as reasons for the move. While the decision follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, signaling a potential slowdown. The RBI has shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" due to limited room for further rate cuts and will carefully assess incoming data to balance growth and inflation.

The regulator, Ofwat, can now claw back bonuses or take enforcement action against companies violating the ban, which is backdated to April 2024.</p>

This criticism led to a public falling out, with both figures trading insults on social media and Trump threatening to terminate Musk's government contracts.

          <p>Global markets are bracing for another potential 'China shock' as overcapacity in the country's manufacturing sector leads to a flood of cheap exports. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., excess production is rippling through global markets, raising concerns in Asia about local industries being squeezed. However, economists suggest that the influx of low-cost Chinese goods could ease inflationary pressures for inflation-worn economies, potentially offering central banks some relief.

The 5,000-ton warship, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a malfunction during its launch, causing the stern to slide prematurely into the water. Leader Kim Jong Un deemed the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workersâ€™ Party. Analysts were surprised by the speed of the refloating process, which involved the use of aerostatic balloons.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces conducted airstrikes on southern Beirut on the eve of Eid Al Adha, targeting what they claimed was a Hezbollah unit producing drones. The attack, which followed evacuation warnings for several buildings, occurred despite a ceasefire being in effect between Israel and the armed group for the past six months. Lebanese officials condemned the strikes as a violation of international accords, while the UN emphasized the importance of diplomacy to prevent escalation. Israel's Defense Minister praised the military's execution of the strikes, holding the Lebanese government responsible for preventing violations of the ceasefire.</p>
