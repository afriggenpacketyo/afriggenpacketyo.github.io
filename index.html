          <p>Aren Pearson, 41, has been jailed for life after being found guilty of murdering his 24-year-old girlfriend, Claire Leveque, in a hot tub in Shetland. Pearson stabbed Ms. Leveque over 25 times and initially claimed she stabbed herself, a defense rejected by the jury. Judge Lord Arthurson described the crime as one of "exceptional depravity," with Pearson's evidence deemed "malicious" and "fabricated." Police characterized their relationship as "controlling and violent," revealing Pearson confessed to the killing during a 999 call and later to officers.</p>

          <p>As the federal funding stalemate continues, some House and Senate Republicans are preparing for a potential extension of the Nov. 21 government shutdown deadline. Senate Democrats have repeatedly rejected the GOP's short-term funding measure, known as a continuing resolution (CR), leading to a prolonged impasse. Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, acknowledge the need for more time to negotiate, while others insist on sticking to the current bill. This article highlights the political challenges and the potential for a new, contentious CR debate.</p>

          <p>A former funeral director, Robert Bush, 47, has pleaded guilty to 36 fraud charges following a major investigation into human remains found at his Hull-based Legacy Independent Funeral Directors. The admitted offenses include 35 counts of fraud by false representation and one of fraudulently running a business. Bush, however, denied 30 counts of preventing lawful and decent burials and one charge of stealing from charity collection boxes. His trial for the remaining charges is scheduled for October 2026, with Humberside Police continuing their inquiry.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is re-examining a legal dispute over Louisiana's congressional map, a case that could significantly impact political representation and potentially weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. At issue is whether drawing a second majority-minority district to remedy a likely Section 2 violation aligns with the 14th and 15th Amendments. Louisiana Republicans and the Trump administration are now arguing against race-based redistricting, urging the court to forbid any consideration of race in drawing voting lines. This article underscores the high stakes for minority voting protections and the future interpretation of the landmark civil rights law.</p>

          <p>Jewish mourning rituals primarily focus on eternal memory among the living, with less emphasis on an afterlife. Jewish law mandates quick, simple burials, with bodies given a ritual bath and placed in plain wooden caskets or shrouds, without embalming. The article explains that close family members perform K'riah, a ritual tearing of clothing, as an expression of pain. After burial, a seven-day period of intense mourning, called shiva, is observed, during which mourners refrain from work and grooming. The communal Mourner's Kaddish prayer, recited with a minyan, provides support and honors the deceased's memory.</p>
