          <p>Scottie Scheffler appears poised to win his first Open Championship, holding a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final day at Royal Portrush. His performance has created an air of inevitability, with bookmakers giving him extremely short odds to secure what would be his fourth major title. Scheffler's unflappable demeanor and consistent play, including crucial par saves and a key birdie on the 16th hole, have left competitors like Matt Fitzpatrick and Li Haotong with a significant challenge. His mindset of focusing on one shot at a time underscores his relentless and dominant presence in the sport.</p>

          <p>Florida Democratic State Representative Joe Casello passed away at the age of 73 following a heart attack. First elected in 2018 to represent a district in Boynton Beach, Casello was a former firefighter who served for three decades before entering politics. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by his family and girlfriend. His passing creates a vacancy in the Florida House, which by law requires Governor Ron DeSantis to call for a special election to fill the seat. Casello had previously announced plans to run for the Palm Beach County Commission in 2026.</p>

          <p>Former professional wrestling star Marcus "Buff" Bagwell, 55, has had his right leg amputated above the knee. The surgery was necessary due to complications from injuries sustained in a 2020 car accident that never properly healed, according to a friend. Bagwell was a prominent figure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) during the 1990s, where he was a five-time tag-team champion. The news prompted an outpouring of support from the wrestling community for the former star as he begins what a friend described as a "whole new kind of battle."</p>

          <p>Germany, under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is pivoting its foreign policy to focus on a strengthened security alliance with France and the United Kingdom, known as the "E3." This move is driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty surrounding the United States' commitment to European defense. The new German-UK treaty enhances security and arms cooperation, complementing the existing Franco-German partnership. While this trilateral cooperation is significant, Merz has emphasized that it is intended to supplement, not replace, the US defense guarantee, acknowledging Europe's need to increase its own defense spending and take more responsibility for its security.</p>

After a solid, bogey-free round of 67, he sits at 14 under par, with China's Li Haotong as his closest competitor. A victory would mark Scheffler's third major of his career and put him three-quarters of the way to a career Grand Slam. Despite an early charge from Rory McIlroy, who delighted the home crowd with a 66, Scheffler's consistent and error-free play has made him the overwhelming favorite to lift the Claret Jug.</p>

After being sidelined at United by manager Ruben Amorim for a perceived lack of effort, Rashford is seeking a fresh start. For Barcelona, the move is a strategic one after failing to sign other targets like Nico Williams and Luis Diaz. The loan deal, with an option to buy, presents a low-financial-risk opportunity for the Spanish club to acquire a talented, experienced player who could be a major asset if he rediscovers his top form.</p>

          <p>July 20th marks the 81st anniversary of the 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler, led by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. The plot, known as Operation Valkyrie, involved a bomb planted in a briefcase at Hitler's Wolf's Lair headquarters, but it failed to kill the dictator, leading to the swift collapse of the coup. Following the failure, Stauffenberg and hundreds of co-conspirators were executed. While the plotters were initially seen as traitors in post-war Germany, they are now largely honored as heroes, though historians note their motives were complex and their vision for a post-Hitler Germany was authoritarian.</p>

The move follows public pressure for more information on the Epstein case, though legal experts suggest the grand jury transcripts may not reveal significant new details compared to evidence already public.

DeChambeau argued for a more modern and fair system that times every shot for every player, suggesting the current approach is ineffective.</p>

          <p>According to hospital officials and witnesses in Gaza, Israeli forces opened fire on crowds of Palestinians attempting to get food, killing 32 people near aid distribution hubs on Saturday. The incidents occurred near centers run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S. and Israeli-backed group. Witnesses described indiscriminate fire from tanks and drones as people massed in the area. The Israeli military stated it fired "warning shots" after a group approached its troops and that it was investigating, while the GHF claimed the shootings happened far from its sites before they opened.</p>

          <p>The article profiles Generation Life, a Pennsylvania-based Christian group of young adults who travel to the Jersey Shore to advocate for "chastity before marriage." Facing a largely unreceptive audience, the activists attempt to connect with their peers by discussing modern relationship challenges, such as the negative impacts of social media, before introducing their message. The group defines chastity not just as abstinence but as a "countercultural" way of life focused on seeing people with dignity beyond their physical bodies. Their mission aims to provide an alternative path in an era of widespread secularism and changing sexual norms.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house election, far-right parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These nationalist groups are fanning concerns over unruly tourists and crimes committed by foreigners, echoing rhetoric from movements like Donald Trump's in the US. While Japan faces significant labor shortages due to a declining birthrate, these parties advocate against relying on foreign workers and call for stricter controls. This nationalist push comes as the government aims to attract 60 million foreign tourists annually by 2030.</p>

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the 2024 building collapse in the town of George, which killed 34 construction workers, was "entirely preventable." The investigation found that numerous red flags, including the use of substandard materials and visible structural cracks, were ignored for up to a year before the tragedy. A health and safety officer had even resigned in protest, yet work continued on the five-storey apartment block. The public works minister called for criminal accountability for the negligence, as survivors and victims' families continue to deal with trauma and financial hardship.</p>

Host Dave Ramsey challenged the caller to address the situation more directly, questioning whether it was a budgeting problem or a true addiction that required serious intervention. He pointed out that with their income, the spending, while problematic, was not the sole reason for their financial tightness, urging her to confront the core behavioral issues.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from his left knee bone bruise ahead of schedule and could return sooner than the initially anticipated six weeks. Muncy described himself as lucky, as doctors told him a slight difference in the timing of the injury-causing slide could have resulted in surgery. He has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings without significant discomfort. His return is highly anticipated by the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly since the slugger was placed on the injured list at the beginning of July.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, Great Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m relay team has finally been presented with their world championship gold medals. The team, which finished second in Athens, was upgraded from silver after the US team was disqualified due to a doping admission by member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. The belated ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting, where Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton received their medals in front of a large home crowd. The moment was described as a chance to recognize their talent and values.</p>
