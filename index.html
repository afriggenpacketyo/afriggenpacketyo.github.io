          <p>A federal judge reduced the felony charge against Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was convicted of excessive force, to a misdemeanor.  The decision overturned a controversial plea deal offered by the newly appointed US Attorney, Bill Essayli, which prompted several federal prosecutors to resign.  The judge rejected the plea deal, stating that probation did not match the facts of the case.  The deputy could still face jail time at his sentencing.</p>
