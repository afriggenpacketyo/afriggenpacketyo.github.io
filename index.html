Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed his commitment to revise the Constitution, though there is little political momentum for the move. Japan is also pushing for a review of all tariffs in trade talks with the U.S., while Australia's Labor party secured an election victory. Additionally, South Korea's conservative party chose Kim Moon Soo as their presidential candidate, and the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on auto parts from Japan.</p>

          <p>Sovereignty, with 5-1 odds, won the 151st Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, triumphing over 18 other horses in rainy conditions. The favorite, Journalism, finished second after facing early challenges in the race.

Students were previously warned about violating college policies and faced interim suspensions. The encampment was named in honor of Hossam Shabat, a Palestinian journalist killed in Gaza, and was part of a broader wave of campus protests against Israel's actions, although this year's protests have been met with crackdowns and punitive measures.</p>

          <p>Buffalo Trace Distillery, America's oldest-running distillery, reopened in Frankfort, Kentucky, just in time for the Kentucky Derby after being shut down due to historic flooding.

Despite the extensive damage, crews worked quickly to restore operations for Derby Week, an important time for bourbon sales. The reopening is a positive step for the community, as the distillery is an iconic part of Frankfort's identity and a major employer.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the complexities of antidepressant use, noting that while they can be life-saving for some, others experience significant side effects and withdrawal symptoms. The author, a psychiatrist, argues for more research into the long-term effects and safe tapering strategies for antidepressants, as current guidelines are lacking. The piece highlights the need for the medical community to acknowledge and address patients' concerns about these medications, rather than dismissing them with a blanket statement of "safe and effective." The author warns that ignoring patient experiences risks losing credibility and ceding the conversation to those who may exploit suffering for personal gain.</p>

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel "Conclave" and Oscar-winning film adaptation, likened the process of selecting a new Pope to the dynamics of the TV show "The Traitors," where contestants must identify the "traitors" among them. Harris suggests that the secretive ritual in the Sistine Chapel is a "rather brilliant device" for finding the right leader. He also finds it odd that women are excluded from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope. Harris was given permission to visit parts of the Vatican generally off-limits to outsiders while researching his novel about conclave.</p>

          <p>President Trump's first 100 days in his second term have caused shock and insult among America's European allies, particularly due to his rhetoric on trade and NATO. Trump's tariff war has created uncertainty for European businesses, while his questioning of NATO's European members' defense spending has shaken the alliance. While some agree that Europeans should invest more in defense, there is a growing fear that the Trump administration may abandon them. Many Europeans feel more committed to the relationship with the U.S. than the other way around, leading to concerns about the future of transatlantic relations.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Reform Party's success in the recent English local council elections, highlighting that their victory was more than just a protest vote. The party performed well in wards that heavily voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019, indicating a concentrated appeal among those who feel left behind by globalization and hold more conservative views on immigration. This presents a challenge for both the Conservative and Labour parties, as they need to appeal to this demographic to recover from their losses. Reform's success reflects a mood of disillusionment with both major parties in a distinctive segment of the British population.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, with higher amounts for students with disabilities and smaller amounts for home-schooled students. Supporters claim the bill empowers parents, while Democrats argue it harms public schools and primarily benefits wealthier students. The legislation marks a significant victory for conservatives pushing for school choice.</p>
