          <p>The Chinese government has lodged a formal protest with India after Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly extended birthday wishes to the Dalai Lama. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson urged India to recognize the 'separatist nature' of Tibetan issues and to cease meddling in China's internal affairs. The exchange highlights the ongoing diplomatic sensitivities surrounding the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing views as a threat to its sovereignty over the region.</p>

According to the Air Zermatt rescue service, the dog's persistent presence at the accident site was crucial in pinpointing the man's location and ultimately saving his life.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new hardline trade policy, threatening to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with the 'Anti-American policies of BRICS'. This warning comes as the U.S. approaches an August 1 deadline for new trade deals, after which higher tariffs could be implemented for nations without an agreement. The move escalates trade tensions and targets the expanding economic bloc, which includes China and Russia and has been critical of U.S. tariff strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economists are calling on Chinese authorities to take more decisive action to address the country's persistent deflationary pressures, which are driven by weak domestic demand and intense price wars. China's GDP deflator, a broad measure of prices, has been negative for over a year, and consumer prices have also fallen. Analysts argue that attempts to revive inflation by cutting supply have been insufficient, and that stimulating household income and consumption is crucial to breaking the deflationary cycle.

          <p>Huawei's AI research division, Noah's Ark Lab, has defended its new open-source Pangu Pro MoE model as a home-grown product, denying allegations that it was built upon a model from rival Alibaba. Whistle-blowers on GitHub claimed the Huawei model showed an 'extraordinary correlation' with an existing Alibaba model, raising questions about its originality. Huawei stated that while its development used some open-source codes from other models in accordance with licensing, the core model was independently trained on its own Ascend AI chips.</p>

          <p>The president of the University of Virginia, James Ryan, has stepped down under pressure from the Trump administration, which demanded his resignation to resolve a Justice Department investigation. The probe focused on the university's compliance with federal orders banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. This move is seen by critics as a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to exert control over higher education, following a pattern of targeting universities over issues like DEI, antisemitism, and transgender athletes to advance a political agenda.</p>

          <p>A federal trial has commenced in Massachusetts challenging the Trump administration's policy of targeting foreign students and scholars for deportation based on their pro-Palestinian political speech. The lawsuit, brought by academic associations like the AAUP, argues that this 'ideological-deportation policy' is unconstitutional and has created a climate of fear and self-censorship on university campuses. The government must now defend its position that it can deport noncitizens, who have committed no crimes, if their presence is deemed a threat to U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The recent announcements by Republican Senator Thom Tillis and Representative Don Bacon that they will not seek reelection highlight a continuing trend of moderate voices being purged from the GOP. This opinion article argues that President Trump's strategy is not to grow the party, but to purify it by demanding absolute loyalty and crushing any dissent, regardless of ideological reasoning. The process has replaced pragmatic conservatives with compliant loyalists, consolidating Trump's control even if it means losing seats to Democrats, as the ultimate goal is domination, not a majority.</p>

His journey from an undocumented immigrant to a powerful congressman embodies a narrative of the American dream that he is now leveraging to hold the administration accountable.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has experienced a significant slump this year, prompting concerns among some investors that it reflects a decline in America's global financial dominance. Factors contributing to this anxiety include President Trump's unpredictable tariff policies, attacks on the Federal Reserve, and a ballooning national debt. While some analysts see the dollar's drop as a temporary correction after years of strength, others argue it's part of a long-term trend of investors moving away from the dollar amid political instability.
