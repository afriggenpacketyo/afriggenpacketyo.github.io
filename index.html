          <p>Merseyside Police arrested a man in Liverpool suspected of murdering two members of a Scottish organized crime group in a Spanish bar. Ross Monaghan and Eddie Lyons Jr. were shot dead at Monaghans Bar in Fuengirola on May 31.  The arrest followed an international warrant issued by Spanish authorities, with Scottish detectives assisting in the investigation.  The incident occurred during the Champions League final, and police stated there was no evidence suggesting the killings were linked to an ongoing gang feud in Scotland.</p>

          <p>The Philippines and Japan held a joint maritime exercise in the South China Sea, focusing on strengthening international cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.  The exercise involved a Philippine Navy frigate and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer, conducting drills such as anti-submarine warfare. This follows repeated incursions by Chinese vessels into Philippine waters and China's rejection of a 2016 arbitration ruling.  The agreement to facilitate joint exercises was signed last July, and the countries also participate in multilateral exercises with the US and Australia.</p>

          <p>Israel claims Iran was months away from producing a nuclear bomb, citing intelligence on weapons components.  However, experts like Kelsey Davenport dispute this, highlighting Iran's "near-zero breakout" status and the lack of compelling evidence of weaponization efforts.  While Iran's uranium stockpile is at record highs, US intelligence agencies maintain Iran isn't building a nuclear weapon.  The IAEA also expressed serious concern over Iran's uranium enrichment levels and lack of compliance with investigations.</p>

          <p>The article contrasts the Schengen Agreement's 40th anniversary celebration with President Trump's military parade.  Schengen, symbolizing borderless travel in Europe, represents a different vision of international order than Trump's display of military might.  The author notes the irony of Schengen's initial focus on excluding unwanted outsiders while highlighting the enduring popularity of free movement within the EU.  The contrast underscores the diverging visions of international cooperation and security.</p>
