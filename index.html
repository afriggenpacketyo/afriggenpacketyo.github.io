          <p>A federal judge has disqualified Alina Habba, the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey and a former personal lawyer for President Trump, from participating in ongoing criminal cases. The judge ruled that her appointment was not legally valid after the administration used a series of novel personnel moves to keep her in the post beyond the legal time limit for interim appointments. This decision follows a challenge in two separate cases and finds that Habba has been exercising her duties without lawful authority since July 1, 2025. The ruling has been stayed to allow for an appeal, but it could potentially void actions she has taken and impact numerous federal cases in the state.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has created the Mexican Border Defense Medal to recognize service members deployed to the southern border as part of President Trump's immigration enforcement efforts. This new award will replace the Armed Forces Service Medal for troops serving with Joint Task Force Southern Border, which currently includes about 8,500 personnel. To be eligible, service members must have been deployed since January 20, 2025, to support Customs and Border Protection within 100 nautical miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. The establishment of this medal coincides with the creation of national defense areas along the border, which grant U.S. troops expanded authority to assist federal law enforcement.</p>

However, the National Hurricane Center continues to warn of life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along most of the East Coast. Storm surge warnings and evacuation orders remain in effect for parts of the Outer Banks, which experienced tropical storm conditions and face potential flooding. While the storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical by Saturday, officials urge the public to avoid swimming and heed local warnings due to the hazardous ocean conditions generated by the large and powerful hurricane.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The process involves exchanging assets from a taxable account, such as a separately managed account (SMA), for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches. This allows the investor to avoid triggering a taxable event until they eventually sell the ETF shares. While the strategy offers significant tax advantages, it comes with strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, often starting at $1 million. Financial advisors caution that investors must be comfortable holding the resulting ETF for the long term, as options to exit the position without incurring taxes are limited.

The new design removes the iconic image of a man leaning against a barrel, opting for a cleaner wordmark, as part of a broader effort to modernize the 55-year-old chain's image. This rebranding, which includes menu updates and store renovations, has drawn criticism from some conservative commentators and marketing experts who argue the company is abandoning a brand that customers felt a strong connection to. The company stated that the character, "Uncle Herschel," will still be featured in its restaurants despite his removal from the main logo.</p>

In response, Hamas recently accepted a ceasefire proposal it had previously resisted, signaling a potential shift in its position.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising national credit card debt and high interest rates, debt forgiveness programs offer a potential solution for some consumers, but not all will qualify. Typically, candidates for these programs, which negotiate with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount, must have a substantial amount of unsecured debt, often over $7,500. They must also be experiencing significant financial hardship, such as job loss or a medical emergency, which makes full repayment unrealistic. Furthermore, borrowers who are already delinquent on their payments are more likely to be considered, as creditors become more willing to negotiate to avoid a total loss on the account.

          <p>Two leading House Democrats, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Frank Pallone, are investigating the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media over concerns of potential bribery involving President Donald Trump. The probe centers on a $16 million settlement Paramount paid to Trump to end his lawsuit against CBS News, which occurred shortly before the FCC approved the merger. The lawmakers' letter to the new company's CEO raises concerns that the payment was an "illegal bribe" in exchange for regulatory approval. The investigation will also examine reports of a side deal for advertising and an agreement to alter CBS's editorial practices to align with the Trump administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated a multi-million dollar federal grant for a California sex education program because the state refused to remove references to gender identity and transgender people from its curriculum. The Administration for Children and Families argued that such topics were outside the scope of the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP), which aims to prevent teen pregnancy and STIs. California officials defended their curriculum as medically accurate and necessary, but the refusal to comply resulted in the loss of about $12 million in funding. Advocates fear this is part of a broader federal effort to undermine comprehensive sex education and target LGBTQ+ inclusive content nationwide.</p>

          <p>A woman from South Texas who was arrested on a murder charge in 2022 for using an abortion-inducing medication has filed a lawsuit alleging her constitutional rights were violated by the local district attorney and sheriff. Lizelle Gonzalez spent three days in jail before the charges were dropped, as Texas law explicitly exempts a pregnant person from criminal homicide charges for ending their own pregnancy. New court filings claim that prosecutors pursued the case despite knowing it was not a crime, allegedly directing the investigation to secure an indictment. The lawsuit seeks to hold the officials accountable for their actions, which her attorneys argue were outside their legal authority.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the massive monetary penalty imposed on President Donald Trump and his company in the civil business fraud case brought by Attorney General Letitia James. The court ruled that the fine, which had grown to over $500 million, was an "excessive fine" that violated the U.S. Constitution. However, the ruling upheld the original judge's finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by inflating asset values to obtain better financial terms. The non-monetary sanctions, including the appointment of an independent monitor, were also upheld. The Attorney General has announced plans to appeal the decision regarding the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates trending downwards and the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut, financial experts are advising homeowners with high-interest loans to prepare for a potential refinancing opportunity. Key steps include checking credit reports for errors, protecting credit scores by avoiding new debt, and estimating home equity, as having at least 20% can lead to better loan terms. Homeowners should also begin gathering necessary documents like proof of income, insurance, and property deeds. By doing this preparatory work in advance, borrowers can move quickly to lock in a lower rate when the market is favorable, as refinancing opportunities can be short-lived.

The removal follows a recent Florida Department of Transportation memo prohibiting "surface art" with social or political messages on public roads. A Pulse survivor described the move as an attempt to erase a show of solidarity and desecrate the memory of those who were killed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration's "America First" doctrine is evolving into an interventionist "America Everywhere" policy in Europe. Rather than isolationism, the administration is actively supporting nativist political parties that align with its ideology, as seen in endorsements and comments from officials like Vice President J.D. Vance regarding German and Polish politics. This approach is creating a new strain on the transatlantic relationship, moving it from one of shared democratic values to one of transactional and partisan alignment. The article suggests this shift, combined with America's growing economic and military supremacy, is forcing Europe to confront a future where it must be more self-reliant.</p>
