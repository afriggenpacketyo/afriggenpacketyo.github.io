          <p>Charter Communications and Cox Communications have reached an agreement to merge, creating one of the largest deals in the cable industry and corporate America, valuing Cox at $34.5 billion. Charter CEO Chris Winfrey stated the merger would be "good for America," bringing jobs back from overseas and creating new customer service and sales careers. The deal comes amid slower-than-expected corporate deal activity, despite expectations of a looser regulatory environment following President Trump's election. The merger with Cox is expected to close simultaneously with Charter's acquisition of Liberty Broadband, with projected annualized cost synergies of $500 million within three years of closing. Relevant context: The merger is subject to regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in 40 years began Friday, leaving thousands of commuters stranded due to a wage dispute between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. Governor Philip D. Murphy apologized to commuters and criticized union leaders for rejecting an offer he deemed fair. Union officials claim NJ Transit engineers earn significantly less than their counterparts at other railroads, while NJ Transit states their offer would bring starting hourly wages close to those of the Long Island Rail Road. The strike impacts approximately 350,000 NJ Transit riders, with limited alternative transportation options available. Relevant context: Negotiations are expected to resume soon.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates, considered "armed and dangerous," escaped from Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans early Friday morning, prompting a large-scale manhunt involving local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. Authorities believe the inmates had inside help, as they removed a sliding jail cell door and breached a wall behind a toilet, scaling down a wall and running across the interstate. One inmate was quickly apprehended in downtown New Orleans using facial recognition technology. Police have notified victims of the escapees, several of whom face murder or other violent charges, and have taken a family from their home to safety. Relevant context: The jail is on lockdown, and the public is urged to report any suspicious activity.</p>

This approval follows years of sales of other blood tests for Alzheimer's without FDA approval, which the agency has sought to regulate more strictly.

          <p>A military parade to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday, could cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade in Washington D.C. is expected to feature 6,600 soldiers, 50 military aircraft, and 150 vehicles, including M1 Abrams tanks. The army will place metal plates on the streets to protect the pavement from the tanks. The event has drawn criticism, with some calling it wasteful and self-aggrandizing.

The move could allow Syria to re-enter international markets and attract foreign investment, positively impacting Lebanon and the region. Lebanon, facing its own economic challenges and a large Syrian refugee population, hopes the easing of sanctions will facilitate the return of refugees and open land corridors for trade.

          <p>The Justice Department is considering a deal that would allow Boeing to avoid pleading guilty or facing trial in a criminal case related to the 737 Max crashes. This potential deal follows a previous agreement where Boeing agreed to plead guilty, which was later rejected by a judge due to concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion. The fraud charge stems from Boeing's development of the 737 Max, with the U.S. accusing the company of misleading regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the crashes. Relevant context: The crashes resulted in significant reputational damage and financial costs for Boeing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is targeting state laws that provide benefits to undocumented immigrants, leading to a split among Democrats. Republicans argue that these benefits incentivize illegal immigration and object to taxpayer dollars going toward undocumented immigrants.

The reconciliation bill calls for penalizing states that use their own funds to provide health care to undocumented immigrants, potentially costing states billions of dollars.
