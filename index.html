          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk secured a parliamentary vote of confidence in his pro-European government after calling for the vote following a recent presidential election defeat. Right-wing nationalist Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party and U.S. President Donald Trump, narrowly won the presidential election. Tusk framed the vote as a "new opening" and promised a cabinet reshuffle in July, while opposition leaders had signaled Tusk's downfall. Tusk's government has struggled to implement key reforms, including judicial changes and abortion rights, due to opposition from the outgoing President Andrzej Duda and now Nawrocki, creating political gridlock.</p>

          <p>This news analysis discusses how the Trump administration's shifting priorities and reshaping of the world order are causing important U.S. allies to strengthen their relationships with each other. These allies are seeking to bolster their ties in response to perceived uncertainties and changes in U.S. foreign policy under President Trump. The article suggests that this realignment is a direct consequence of the administration's approach to international relations, as traditional allies navigate a changing global landscape. This is causing a ripple effect in international diplomacy as nations adjust to the new dynamics. The article highlights the growing importance of multilateral cooperation among U.S. allies amidst these shifts. The tone of the article is neutral and analytical, focusing on the observed changes in international relations.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell stated that the National Guard's deployment to Los Angeles is primarily focused on supporting federal agencies with immigration enforcement, not assisting with protest control.

McDonnell expressed concern about potential interactions between the military and protesters, emphasizing the need for clear rules and responsibilities.

          <p>As Malawi prepares for elections, young candidates are pushing for greater political inclusion, facing challenges such as entrenched party structures and financial barriers. With over half of Malawi's population under 35, youth inclusion is a growing concern, but many young entrants find party structures dominated by older leaders. Some, like Ivy Sande, have left established parties due to a lack of support, while others, like lawmaker Fyness Magonjwa, urge youth to seek decision-making positions. Experts emphasize the need for fair competition and transparent procedures within political parties to ensure meaningful youth representation and empowerment.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance echoed President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve, accusing it of "monetary malpractice" for not cutting interest rates. Vance's statement follows a Bureau of Labor Statistics report showing that the consumer price index increased just 0.1% in May, indicating that tariffs have not exerted substantial upward pressure on inflation. The Trump administration has been urging the Fed to lower rates, but officials have expressed concern over the longer-term impacts that tariffs will have on prices. Markets are currently assigning zero probability of a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta introduced V-JEPA 2, a new open-source AI "world model" designed to enhance the understanding of 3D environments and physical object movements. This AI model can predict and plan in the physical world by building an internal simulation of reality, enabling AI to learn and make decisions more like humans. For instance, V-JEPA 2 can recognize that a rolling ball will fall off a table or that a hidden object still exists. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is investing heavily in AI to compete with companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reached an agreement on trade after high-level talks in London, with the deal now contingent on approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The agreement aims to implement the Geneva trade consensus and stabilize the relationship after both countries accused each other of violations. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that he and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will brief President Trump on the deal. Experts suggest that the need for leaders' approval indicates unresolved details still require internal discussion.</p>

          <p>An opinion columnist argues that President Trump's deployment of troops to address protests in Los Angeles is a sign of weakness rather than strength. The author contends that this recourse to military force highlights the administration's compromised political position and the weakness of its policy program. Strong, confident regimes typically do not meet protests with military force, suggesting the administration lacks alternative strategies. The author contrasts Trump's actions with those of his previous administration, noting the influence of more compliant advisors.</p>

          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has introduced a new rule allowing players to protect their rankings while undergoing fertility treatments. The policy enables players to take time off for procedures like egg or embryo freezing and return with a protected ranking, known as a "Special Entry Ranking," which can be used for three tournaments. This initiative expands the WTA's support programs, including maternity leave, postpartum support, and fertility grants. The move reflects a growing push among female athletes to address fertility challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that generative AI models are limited in representing concepts requiring human senses, such as smell and touch, resulting in "hollow and shallow" creativity. Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot represent a flower in the same way humans do due to their lack of sensory and motor experiences. The study suggests that AI's inability to represent sensory concepts explains why it lacks human-style creativity. While AI can satisfy minimal definitions of creativity, it cannot replicate the depth and richness of human artistic expression.</p>

          <p>President Trump's political operation has reportedly approached Texas Republicans about redrawing the state's congressional map ahead of the midterms to protect the GOP's fragile House majority. Texas Republican lawmakers have held preliminary discussions on the topic, with potential targets including up to five seats currently held by Democrats. However, concerns exist that redrawing the map could backfire, leading to legal challenges or Democratic pickups. The conversations reflect GOP worries about losing seats in November, despite the current map being drawn by Republicans in 2021.</p>

          <p>The European Union stated that it is "too early to conclude" whether high US tariffs on Chinese goods have led to a diversion of exports to the bloc, which could prompt emergency measures. Despite a surge in Chinese exports to the EU coinciding with a drop in shipments to the US, the European Commission said that such spikes do not necessarily indicate trade diversion. The EU requires a trend to be observed and evidence of harm to EU industries before taking action. The assessment follows the implementation of a new customs surveillance system designed to detect trade diversions.</p>

Continued weakness in energy prices helped offset some increases, while vehicle and apparel prices declined.
