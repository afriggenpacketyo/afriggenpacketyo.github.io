          <h2>Japan Considers Increasing Tariff-Free Rice Imports from the U.S.</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 06:23:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan is contemplating expanding tariff-free rice imports from the United States as part of negotiations concerning higher levies imposed by Washington. The proposal involves increasing imports from the U.S. to around 410,000 tons from the current 350,000 tons, addressing calls for more affordable imported rice amid surging prices due to supply shortages. This move is a concession to secure exemption from U.S. tariffs, potentially impacting domestic farmers' incomes, while economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa is set to hold further talks with the United States later this month.</p>

          <p>The article delves into the diverse ecosystem of rocky intertidal zones, or tidepools, off the California coast, highlighting the unique species that inhabit these areas. It focuses on the work of Rebecca Johnson, a zoologist studying these tidepools, and the threats they face from marine heatwaves and other environmental stressors. The decline of sea star populations due to wasting syndrome has disrupted the balance of these ecosystems, leading to kelp forest devastation and shifts in tidepool species distribution. Scientists and community members are collaborating to monitor and conserve these fragile environments, emphasizing the interconnectedness of coastal ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration, alleging interference in academic decision-making following the university's refusal to comply with demands to appoint an outside overseer and ensure viewpoint diversity. The lawsuit challenges a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants and threats to additional funding and tax-exempt status, which Harvard argues has severe consequences for its patients, students, and researchers. Harvard President Alan Garber asserted that no government should dictate the curriculum or admissions policies of private universities, positioning the lawsuit as a defense of academic freedom against political pressure.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece criticizes Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s stance on autism, arguing that he promotes misinformation and ignores scientific consensus. Kennedy's claims about an autism "epidemic" and his dismissal of genetic factors are refuted by the CDC report he cites, which emphasizes improved screening and diagnosis. The author expresses concern that Kennedy's focus on "environmental toxins" will divert resources from crucial research and support for autistic individuals and their families, highlighting the importance of understanding and embracing neurodiversity.</p>

          <p>Octavia Butler's "Parable of the Talents," a dystopian novel exploring themes of political extremism and social upheaval, has been adapted into a graphic novel. This adaptation, a follow-up to the Hugo Award-winning graphic novel of "Parable of the Sower," aims to reach a new audience with its prescient themes and compelling characters. The graphic novel continues to paint a picture of a war-torn United States under the control of a Christian fundamentalist fascist state. Illustrator John Jennings talked about his process in visually adapting the tome, conversing with his collaborators and what effect creating the adaptations had on him.</p>
