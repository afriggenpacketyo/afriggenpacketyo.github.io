          <h2>Ric Edelman Argues Longevity Makes the Classic 60-40 Portfolio Obsolete</h2>

          <p>Financial planning icon Ric Edelman argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) is no longer sufficient for retirement planning due to increasing lifespans. With breakthroughs in health and science, people are living longer, requiring more money invested in the stock market to avoid outliving their savings. Edelman suggests a portfolio with 70% to 80% in equities for many investors, emphasizing the need to plan for living to 100 or beyond. Data from Fidelity Investments suggests a retired couple may need $315,000 saved just to cover healthcare expenses in retirement, further highlighting the inadequacy of traditional retirement plans.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi can remain free from immigration custody while he challenges his detention, denying the Trump administration's request to re-detain him. Mahdawi, who co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union, was detained by immigration agents during his citizenship interview, allegedly for "adverse foreign policy consequences" related to pro-Palestinian protests. His legal team argues his detention violates the First Amendment, while the Trump administration accuses him of antisemitic statements, which he denies. Mahdawi has criticized Columbia University for its response to pro-Palestinian protests and asserts that he will continue to protest.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, to be released from immigration custody on bail as she challenges her detention after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. The judge found that Ozturk raised substantial claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated, stating that her detention appeared to be based solely on an opinion piece she co-authored about Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk, who has suffered multiple asthma attacks in ICE detention, will return to her home in Massachusetts and continue her doctoral studies. Tufts University expressed pleasure at the court's decision and looks forward to welcoming her back to campus.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a "most favored nation" plan to cut Medicare drug prices, tying the cost of some high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. This plan, previously attempted during Trump's first term, was blocked by court orders due to procedural issues. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at the possibility of the policy returning, pointing to higher prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic. The Trump administration is continuing to negotiate the cost of Ozempic in Medicare for diabetes treatment, but not for weight loss purposes.</p>

Trump suggested he was willing to lower tariffs on China to 80%, a rate many businesses would still consider extremely high.

          <p>The Los Angeles Opera presented Osvaldo Golijov’s “Ainadamar,” an opera portraying the execution of Federico Garcia Lorca during the Spanish Civil War, alongside Rufus Wainwright’s new “Dream Requiem.” “Ainadamar” explores the final moments of actress Margarita Xirgu's life as she prepares to perform in a Lorca play. Wainwright's “Dream Requiem” uses recitations of Lord Byron’s “Darkness” to create a lament for the environment, drawing parallels between Lorca's death and the environmental catastrophe caused by the 1815 Mt. Tambora eruption. The performance of “Dream Requiem” was conducted by Grant Gershon and featured the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus, soprano Liv Redpath, and narrator Jane Fonda.</p>

          <p>California is grappling with a surge in child sexual assault lawsuits against public institutions, leading to multimillion-dollar judgments and settlements that are pushing some cities, counties, and school districts to the brink of financial crisis. A state law signed in 2019 expanded the number of lawsuits that can be filed, resulting in billions of dollars in claims. Santa Monica, for example, has paid nearly $230 million to plaintiffs assaulted by a volunteer and is considering selling a library to cover costs. Lawmakers are considering measures to provide relief to public institutions, but face opposition from trial lawyers.</p>

President Claudia Sheinbaum argues that the name change is politically motivated and undermines Mexico's sovereignty. Google claims the change was made as part of a longstanding practice of following name changes updated by official government sources, but Sheinbaum's government contends that Trump's order applies only to the U.S. portion of the continental shelf.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Vermont ordered the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, from immigration detention, citing concerns that her detention threatened to chill the speech of millions of noncitizens. Ozturk was detained after authorities claimed she supported Hamas, but the primary evidence against her appears to be an essay critical of Israel she helped write. The judge emphasized that the government had not provided sufficient evidence to justify her detention. The case has drawn public outrage and criticism that the government is abusing the immigration system to deport international students.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed seeking to undo the 624,000-acre Chuckwalla National Monument in Southern California, arguing that President Biden overstepped his authority by setting aside such a vast area of land. The plaintiffs, represented by a conservative think tank, claim Biden abused the Antiquities Act, which requires monuments to be limited to the smallest area compatible with protecting the objects to be protected. Supporters of the monument, however, argue that it safeguards land sacred to tribes, important wildlife habitat, and military sites. The Interior Department has not yet responded to the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are increasing the prices of baby products, potentially adding up to $1,000 a year to the cost of raising a child, according to parents and baby gear makers. Import duties of up to 145% apply to U.S. imports from China, where the vast majority of strollers sold in the U.S. are made. Some parents are turning to resale platforms to save money, while advocates are calling on the White House to exempt critical baby products from the tariffs. The rising cost of parenthood may conflict with the White House's call for families to have more children.</p>
