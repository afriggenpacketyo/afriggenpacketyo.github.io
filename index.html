          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ordered Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, and Instagram head Adam Mosseri to testify in an upcoming trial. The lawsuit alleges that social media platforms have knowingly created addictive features that cause mental health harm to younger users. The judge ruled that the CEOs' testimonies are uniquely relevant to establishing potential negligence, as their knowledge of these harms is central to the case. This legal development is part of a broader wave of litigation and legislative scrutiny aimed at holding social media companies accountable for their impact on child safety.</p>

          <p>An important upcoming consumer price index report is being met with skepticism from some financial market analysts due to the ongoing government shutdown. Experts question the reliability and completeness of the data, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics is operating with reduced staff and has faced criticism over its data collection methods. The shutdown has suspended most other economic data releases, placing even greater emphasis on this single inflation report. This uncertainty complicates policy-making for the Federal Reserve, which relies on accurate economic indicators to guide its decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department has instructed its employees to refrain from sharing photographs of the ongoing demolition and construction work in the White House's East Wing. The work is for a new ballroom project initiated by President Donald Trump, and photos of the construction have already circulated online, drawing criticism. A Treasury spokesperson cited security concerns, stating that carelessly shared images could inadvertently reveal sensitive security features or confidential structural details of the White House complex. The construction, which President Trump has stated will be privately financed, is taking place next to the Treasury building.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat experienced a dramatic surge, jumping over 90% in a single day of trading. The rally was triggered after the company was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a short squeeze against investors betting against the stock. This follows a separate announcement of an expanded distribution deal with Walmart. The stock, which had fallen to penny-stock status after years of poor performance, saw a remarkable turnaround, highlighting the continued volatility and influence of retail traders in the market.

          <p>A third survivor of abuse has resigned from the advisory panel for the UK government's inquiry into grooming gangs, following two other resignations. The departing members have expressed a lack of confidence in the process, with one describing it as feeling like a "cover-up" in a "toxic environment." Concerns have been raised about the suitability of shortlisted candidates to chair the inquiry and fears that its scope is being broadened in a way that dilutes its focus on grooming gangs. Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has denied these claims, insisting the government remains committed to exposing failures.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to announce further interest rate cuts, top financial advisors are recommending strategies for investors to adapt their portfolios. Some suggest focusing on intermediate-range U.S. Treasury bonds to lock in higher yields before rates fall further. Advisors emphasize maintaining a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes rather than chasing specific industry trends, as it's difficult to predict which sectors will outperform. The overall sentiment is to balance optimism with caution, as the current rate-cutting cycle occurs within a relatively strong economy, unlike previous post-crisis environments.

          <p>A recent analysis from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to inflation. The study found that product categories with significant imports, such as furniture, car parts, and electronics, have seen notable price increases. Researchers determined that companies have passed approximately 35% of these tariff costs on to consumers, exerting measurable upward pressure on inflation gauges like the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. The findings suggest that even without new tariffs, the economic effects will continue to evolve and impact consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The French Ministry of Culture has confirmed that the priceless jewels stolen from the Louvre Museum were not privately insured. According to French law, collections in national museums are considered state property, and the state itself acts as the insurer, meaning private insurance is not taken out unless items are loaned to other institutions. As a result, neither the museum nor the government will receive an insurance payout to cover the value of the stolen artifacts. This revelation adds a significant financial dimension to the cultural loss and raises further questions about the state's risk management for its national treasures.</p>

          <p>A new documentary by filmmaker Raoul Peck, titled "Orwell: 2+2=5," examines the enduring relevance of George Orwell's dystopian novel "1984." Using archival materials from the Orwell estate, the film traces the authoritarian tactics that suppress truth, arguing that generations of readers have become numb to the novel's warnings rather than acting on them. The documentary connects Orwell's concepts, like Newspeak, to contemporary political rhetoric and the obfuscation of language. Peck structures the film around the novel's three main tenets—"War is peace," "Ignorance is strength," and "Freedom is slavery"—to illustrate how these ideas manifest in the modern world.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving hundreds of thousands of people in the Chernihiv region without power and water ahead of winter. Ukrainian officials reported that ongoing drone strikes are hampering repair efforts, as Moscow appears to be employing a strategy of terrorizing the population with cold and darkness. These attacks come as diplomatic tensions continue, with a proposed summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin facing delays. European leaders have reiterated that any peace negotiations must start from the current front lines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced a formal review of strategic alternatives after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire company and its studio division. The board will consider various options, including a sale or continuing with its plan to split into two separate companies by mid-2026. This move follows recent reports of takeover bids from entities like Paramount Skydance, Netflix, and Comcast, signaling a potential bidding war that could reshape the media landscape. The company, still managing debt from the 2022 merger, is focused on unlocking the full value of its assets amid industry-wide pressures.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed there are no immediate plans for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, just days after Trump announced a potential summit in Budapest. A preparatory phone call between the U.S. Secretary of State and the Russian Foreign Minister was deemed sufficient, making an in-person meeting unnecessary for now. The development follows Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his subsequent endorsement of a ceasefire along current front lines. Russia has pushed back against this proposal, insisting that the root causes of the conflict must be addressed first.</p>

          <p>Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the first Asian American to lead New York's Central Synagogue, shares how her experience growing up as a Korean Jew shaped her message of radical compassion. In a recent interview and her new memoir, she explains that feeling like an outsider in multiple communities cultivated a deep empathy that defines her leadership style. Buchdahl uses her platform to address complex issues like the Israel-Hamas war and rising antisemitism, advocating for empathy as a way to recognize shared humanity rather than a betrayal of one's own side. Her sermons, which often incorporate music, draw thousands of viewers online.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. cattle ranchers are expressing strong opposition to President Donald Trump's suggestion of importing beef from Argentina to address high domestic prices. Ranchers argue this is not a viable long-term solution for a supply chain already stressed by drought and the threat of the screwworm parasite. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association warned the plan could create chaos for producers and cited Argentina's history of foot-and-mouth disease, which could devastate U.S. livestock. Instead of market intervention, ranchers are urging the government to focus on biosecurity and supporting the domestic industry.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Connecticut are raising awareness about the increasing risk of tick-borne illnesses across the state. A campaign from UConn Extension provides educational materials on prevention, as diagnostic labs have observed a rise in diseases like Lyme and the rare but dangerous Powassan virus. Experts note that warmer winters are allowing ticks to remain active for longer periods, expanding the typical season of risk. While the advisory is for the entire region, the university is taking proactive steps to educate its campus community on how to prevent tick bites and recognize symptoms.</p>

          <p>The latest population estimate for the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale shows a small increase to 384 individuals, representing slow growth over the past four years. Researchers at the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium called this "positive news" but emphasized that the species remains dangerously close to extinction. Conservation groups noted that there have been no reported whale deaths this year and fewer detected injuries from vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement. Advocates are urging the federal government to implement stronger, science-based protections to ensure the fragile recovery continues.</p>
