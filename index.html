          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has been denied her request for a rehearing of her fraud conviction appeal by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, meaning that the Supreme Court remains her final recourse to overturn the conviction. Holmes was initially sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison in January 2023 after being found guilty on four counts of wire fraud in January 2022, stemming from her role in defrauding investors about Theranos' blood-testing technology. The company, once valued at billions, collapsed following a Wall Street Journal report exposing its struggles and ultimately shut down in 2018. Holmes and former Theranos executive Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani were also ordered to pay $452 million in restitution.</p>

          <p>Representative Buddy Carter of Georgia has announced his candidacy for the Republican primary, aiming to challenge Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff in the upcoming election, according to the New York Times article. Carter's announcement follows Governor Brian Kemp's decision not to run, opening the door for other Republican contenders. Carter is positioning himself as a staunch supporter of President Trump and focusing on cultural issues, particularly those related to transgender rights, to appeal to voters. Ossoff, a rising star in the Democratic Party, faces a tough re-election battle in a state that has shifted back towards Republican leanings, making his seat a prime target for Republicans.</p>

          <p>A young kangaroo named Hickory escaped from its owner's enclosure in Saint Cloud, Florida, leading to the owner facing charges for lacking proper permits, according to this Fox News article. The kangaroo was seen hopping along a busy road before being captured by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission with the help of another licensed kangaroo facility owner. Hickory was tranquilized and taken to a wildlife preserve until the owner's enclosure meets local code requirements.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 14:17:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is holding off on cutting interest rates due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies and their potential impact on inflation and economic growth, according to the New York Times article. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank prefers to wait and assess the economic effects of the tariffs before making any adjustments to interest rates. Economists are increasingly predicting that the Fed will likely wait until September to consider cutting rates, with some suggesting a larger-than-usual half-point cut may be necessary at that point. The Fed's caution stems from inflation running above its 2 percent target and the need for concrete evidence of economic weakness before lowering rates.</p>

          <p>The UK and US have reached an agreement to reduce or remove tariffs on specific goods traded between the two countries, according to this BBC article. The deal cuts tariffs on UK car exports to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles, scraps the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports into the US, and includes a $10 billion purchase of Boeing planes by the UK. However, pharmaceuticals remain a key area of ongoing negotiation, and there is no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms. While President Trump declared the announcement would be a "major trade deal," it is not a free-trade agreement and requires further negotiations and legal paperwork.</p>

The agreement includes adjustments to tariffs on U.K. autos, creating a $5 billion opportunity for new exports for U.S. farmers, and securing the supply chain for pharmaceutical products. While specifics are still being finalized, the deal maintains a 10% blanket U.S. tariff on U.K. imports and requires the U.S. to negotiate an alternative arrangement to the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as an incredible platform for the future.</p>

          <p>During a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Senate Democrats clashed with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and the Department of Homeland Security's budget, according to this ABC News article. Democrats questioned Noem about whether the Trump administration would comply with a Supreme Court decision to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., but Noem stated that the government is following the law. Senator Chris Murphy accused Noem's department of being "out of control" and illegally refusing to spend authorized funds.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled the framework for a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first such accord since the White House suspended some of its "Liberation Day" tariffs, according to this ABC News article. The agreement includes adjustments to tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, while leaving the 10% tariff on imported goods in place. In exchange, the U.K. will ease trade barriers on products such as ethanol, beef, and machinery. While some details still need to be worked out, the agreement sets the two countries on a path toward a wider deal.</p>

          <p>A West Point philosophy professor, Graham Parsons, resigned after 13 years, citing the academy's shift away from core educational principles under the Trump administration, according to this Guardian article. Parsons criticized the institution for censoring its curriculum to align with the administrationâ€™s ideological preferences, particularly regarding instruction on race, gender, and power dynamics. Courses and authors addressing these topics were removed, and a new policy required professors to obtain departmental approval before publishing or speaking publicly about their academic work. Parsons stated that he could not tolerate these changes and was ashamed to be associated with the academy in its current form.</p>

In return, London agreed to lower barriers on U.S. agricultural exports and increase access for U.S. aerospace companies. Starmer said he intended to continue negotiating with the administration to lower the 10% baseline rate.</p>
