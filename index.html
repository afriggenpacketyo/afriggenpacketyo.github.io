          <p>An EPA analysis under the Trump administration indicates that rolling back greenhouse gas emission standards would paradoxically lead to higher gasoline prices. The report, citing U.S. Energy Information Administration data, projects increased demand for gas-powered vehicles would drive up fuel costs for everyone. The analysis also forecasts the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035 and reduced fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles, contradicting the administration's claims of consumer savings. This move is part of a broader effort to deregulate the energy economy.</p>

She shared on social media that she and her baby are fine but that she required surgery for a wound on her thigh, describing it as the "worst day of my life." Officials are investigating the incident to determine the type of shark involved. Gallinari, a native of Italy, played in the NBA for 16 seasons before retiring in 2024.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's executive order to increase tariffs on imports is expected to raise consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. The new duties, with a baseline of 15% and some exceeding 40%, could cost the average American household over $2,000 annually. Economists warn that while the administration argues the policy revives U.S. manufacturing, it will likely lead to higher costs for everyday goods like appliances, clothing, and cars. Businesses may also face supply-chain delays and offer fewer product choices to manage costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paula Deen has suddenly closed The Lady and Sons, the iconic Savannah restaurant that launched her career and made her a star of Southern cuisine. Opened in 1996, the establishment became a culinary landmark, but Deen announced its last day of service was July 31st. This closure follows a pattern of other abrupt shutdowns of her restaurants over the years, some of which occurred around a 2013 controversy where she admitted to using a racial slur. Deen stated she will now focus on her four Paula Deen’s Family Kitchen locations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has intensified his criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, whom he labeled a "stubborn MORON" for not cutting interest rates. Following a weak jobs report, Trump urged the Fed's board to seize control from Powell and lower rates immediately, a significant break from the tradition of respecting the central bank's political independence. The attacks come as the White House faces scrutiny over its tariff policies and their economic impact. Despite the harsh rhetoric, Trump later suggested Powell would likely remain in his position until his term ends.</p>

          <p>A traffic jam with a quirky cause occurred on Interstate-83 in Pennsylvania when a tractor-trailer experienced a mechanical issue and spilled its entire load of hotdogs. The incident, which happened near the Maryland line during the morning commute, resulted in minor injuries for four people and a significant cleanup effort. The fire chief on the scene noted the unusual challenge of the cleanup, stating that hotdogs are surprisingly slippery. The spilled food was deemed garbage and had to be discarded, leaving motorists temporarily steamed over the delay.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed signs of a significant slowdown as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling well short of the 115,000 forecast by economists. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.2%, and previous estimates for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000 jobs. Analysts suggest the weak hiring could be a reflection of economic uncertainty caused by escalating trade tensions and new tariffs.

          <h2>Experts and Survivors Explain How to Identify and Understand Cults</h2>

          <p>A BBC documentary and interviews with experts are shedding light on the dynamics of cults and the challenges survivors face. Psychotherapist Gillie Jenkinson, herself a cult survivor, explains that cults use coercive control and tactics like "love bombing" to manipulate followers, who are often sold a lie. Linguist Amanda Montell notes that cults can form around any idea, not just religion, and often use an "us-versus-them" mentality and high barriers to exit. Experts are calling for more specialized mental health support for those who leave cults and for legal changes to address coercive control in group settings.</p>

          <p>ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok and Douyin, disclosed internal data on employee tenure during a recent town hall meeting. The social media giant revealed that the median service length for its current 120,000 employees is 2.9 years, with an average tenure of three years. This data was shared to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. The figures suggest that ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding "996" work culture.</p>

In a social media post, Bessent stated that the talks have "advanced" and that he believes "we have the makings of a deal that will benefit both of our great nations." This positive assessment comes amid mixed messages from the Trump administration regarding its aggressive tariff strategy. A Chinese official also indicated that a pause on new tariff increases would be extended, though this has not yet been confirmed by the U.S. side.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 people who have been living and working legally in the U.S., some for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the decision to end the programs was "preordained" and potentially "motivated by racial animus." The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and stated its intention to appeal.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has signaled it may declare President Trump's executive order restricting birthright citizenship unconstitutional, a move that would align with other court rulings against the policy. Judges on the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sharply questioned the Justice Department's argument that the 14th Amendment does not grant citizenship to the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents. The order, which directs agencies to deny citizenship to children without at least one citizen or permanent resident parent, has been blocked by multiple lower courts, and its fate will likely be decided by the Supreme Court.</p>
