          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a prominent Fox News host and staunch supporter of President Trump, to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The confirmation, which passed with a 50-45 vote, formalizes her role after she had been serving in an acting capacity since May. This appointment places a well-known media personality and presidential loyalist in charge of one of the country's most powerful prosecutorial offices. The move follows other controversial confirmations of Trump allies to significant legal and judicial posts, drawing both praise from the administration and criticism from opponents.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the release of a jobs report showing weaker-than-expected hiring and significant downward revisions for previous months. Trump publicly criticized the data as inaccurate and politically manipulated, a claim disputed by economists who note that such revisions are standard practice. The move has sparked widespread concern among policy experts and some Republican lawmakers, who warn that politicizing the nonpartisan agency threatens the integrity of crucial economic data that markets and policymakers rely on. A deputy commissioner will take over the role in an acting capacity.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts immigration enforcement from conducting raids based on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish in the Los Angeles area. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that such factors do not constitute reasonable suspicion for detaining individuals, a practice that advocates argued was unconstitutional racial profiling. The decision stems from controversial raids by the Trump administration that targeted workplaces and public areas, causing widespread fear. While the administration argues these operations target individuals in the country illegally, pro-immigrant groups hailed the ruling as a victory for civil rights.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led two major criminal probes into Donald Trump. The inquiry will examine whether Smith violated the Hatch Act, which restricts the political activities of federal employees. This action follows a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's prosecutorial actions were politically motivated and intended to interfere with the 2024 election. Smith, who resigned in January, had previously maintained that his investigations were conducted without political influence, while Trump has consistently labeled them as a politically-driven witch hunt.</p>

          <p>The BBC has reportedly launched an investigation following allegations of cocaine use by two unnamed stars of its popular show, 'Strictly Come Dancing'. The claims were detailed in a legal submission from a former celebrity contestant, and it is alleged that the drug use was widely discussed among the show's cast and crew. In response, the corporation has hired an external law firm to lead the probe, stating it has clear protocols for handling serious complaints. This development adds to a series of recent controversies surrounding the long-running program, which has prompted the BBC to implement new welfare measures for its participants.</p>

This development comes as the club continues to show interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. Although Hojlund has publicly stated his desire to remain at Old Trafford, his position would likely be marginalized by the arrival of another high-profile striker. A sale at this price would represent a financial loss for United based on his book value, but it may be necessary to fund new acquisitions while complying with Premier League profit and sustainability regulations.</p>

The platypus, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift meant to curry favor with the British Prime Minister during World War II. While long-standing rumors claimed the animal died from shock due to a nearby German U-boat attack, newly analyzed records suggest a different cause. Archival logs of water and air temperatures on the ship indicate that the platypus was exposed to prolonged heat as it crossed the equator, leading researchers to conclude it likely died from heatstroke.</p>

          <p>Decades after David Berkowitz's year-long reign of terror, two survivors of his attacks have shared their stories of that traumatic period. Robert Violante, who was blinded in the final shooting that killed his first date, Stacy Moskowitz, recalled the sudden explosion of glass and his desperate attempts to get help. Carl Denaro, shot months earlier, initially had no idea his attack was part of a serial killer's spree until police connected the cases. Both men expressed relief at Berkowitz's capture but live with the permanent physical and emotional scars of being targeted by one of New York City's most infamous killers.</p>

          <h2>Criminals Capitalize on TikTok's Labubu Doll Trend with Dangerous Counterfeits</h2>

          <p>The viral popularity of Labubu dolls on TikTok has created a lucrative market for criminals producing dangerous counterfeit versions. Trading Standards officers have seized thousands of fake dolls that pose a significant choking hazard, with small parts that easily detach. As genuine dolls from parent company Pop Mart sell out instantly, a secondary market of scalpers and counterfeiters has emerged, selling fakes for a fraction of the price. Authorities warn that these knock-offs are often made with cheap, untested, and potentially toxic materials, putting children at risk while funding criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>Protests held by anti-migrant groups outside hotels housing asylum seekers across England led to clashes with counter-demonstrators and resulted in fifteen arrests. In London, nine people were arrested for public order offenses during a demonstration at the Thistle City Barbican Hotel. Similar confrontations occurred in Newcastle, while a large march organized by Britain First took place in Manchester. The protests come as the government announces plans to phase out the use of hotels for asylum seekers by 2029 and fast-track the appeals process to manage the asylum system more effectively.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly condemned his team's performance following a 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their first match of the Scottish Premiership season. Martin expressed deep disappointment, stating his players were lucky to get a point and that their opponents were 'braver' and 'more aggressive.' He specifically criticized the mentality and ego of some players, suggesting they reverted to old habits rather than following tactical instructions. The harsh and unusually early public criticism from the new manager has raised concerns among pundits and fans about the team's direction and cohesion.</p>

Incumbent Matt Hayball, a former Geelong Cats player, is facing a challenge from rookie James Burnip, who recently completed a standout career at the University of Alabama. This cut-throat scenario has become a recurring ritual for the Saints, who have consistently favored Australian punters for their versatility. Despite the intense pressure, with only one set to make the final 53-man roster, the two maintain a friendly camaraderie rooted in their shared background at ProKick Australia.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start since returning from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his promising return was spoiled by two home runs from Tampa Bay Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, who capitalized on the short right-field wall at the team's temporary ballpark. Snell gave up three runs in the Dodgers' 4-0 loss, but his command and ability to generate swings and misses were positive signs for the team's rotation. Despite the loss, the outing provided a hopeful glimpse of the dominance the two-time Cy Young winner could bring to the Dodgers' championship defense.</p>
