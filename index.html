        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Anti-Defamation League (ADL) report revealed that Desmond Holly, the 16-year-old who carried out a school shooting in Colorado, was active on a "violent gore" website known for hosting white supremacist content and graphic violence. This site, previously banned from Reddit, has been frequented by several other school shooters, suggesting a concerning pattern of online radicalization among young individuals. Experts from the ADL and Colorado University emphasize the alarming lack of access friction to these platforms and the glorification of violent shooter types within these online communities. They stress the critical need for better funding for violence prevention, including social-emotional learning programs, to intervene earlier and prevent individuals from ever developing an interest in such harmful online spaces.</p>

          <p>China's recent Victory Day parade served as a strategic message, not primarily to Washington, but to middle powers across the Global South grappling with developing military capabilities while avoiding Cold War entanglements. The attendance of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, marking his first multilateral international appearance since the pandemic, alongside President Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, projected an image of diplomatic legitimacy and alternative partnerships outside Western frameworks. This trilateral display aimed to reassure China's domestic audience that it isn't isolated, demonstrate viable non-Western alliances to nations like Indonesia and South Africa, and signal the limitations of Washington's sanctions regime. The article suggests this gathering presented an "axis of the excluded," indicating nations rejecting Western terms of engagement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly requested an additional $58 million from Congress to enhance security for executive and judicial branch members, following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. This request comes as House Democrats prepare for a security briefing, prompted by Kirk's death, which has intensified concerns over rising political violence. A University of Maryland study indicates a nearly 40% increase in plots and acts of terrorism in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year, highlighting a growing threat. House Speaker Mike Johnson emphasized the urgent need to protect public officials to ensure individuals continue to run for office safely.</p>

          <p>East Los Angeles residents defiantly celebrated their 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade amidst the Trump administration's intensified immigration crackdown and recent Supreme Court rulings authorizing "roving patrols" by federal agents. Despite fears stoked by ongoing ICE raids, which have targeted individuals based on appearance or language, many felt it was crucial to participate and assert their rights and cultural pride. Mayor Karen Bass expressed strong opposition to the raids, emphasizing Los Angeles' identity as a city of immigrants and denouncing the targeting of Latino residents as abhorrent. The event, though possibly less attended, radiated joy and resistance, uniting diverse communities in a vibrant display of heritage.</p>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Chinese scholar, argues that China must develop its own knowledge system for AI, moving beyond Western-centric theories. He expresses concern about "intellectual colonialism" in the AI era, noting that Western social science theories, while influential, are based on Western practices and fail to adequately explain civilizations like Confucian, Islamic, or Indian societies. Zheng asserts that the meaning of society and technology is shaped by humanities and social sciences, urging China to embrace its secular civilization to play a proper role in the international order. This perspective advocates for a distinct, culturally rooted approach to AI development.</p>

          <p>A woman expressed distress on Reddit after discovering her husband repeatedly sent large sums of money to a female coworker, despite her explicit requests for him to stop. The husband, who has a history of workplace infidelity, claimed these were exchanges for cash, acting as the coworker's "personal bank," but his bank statements suggested otherwise. This behavior, particularly after an incident shortly after their child's birth, has led the wife to suspect deeper issues beyond mere financial transactions. Commenters on the post advised seeking legal counsel and considering a private investigator to uncover the full truth behind his secretive actions.</p>
