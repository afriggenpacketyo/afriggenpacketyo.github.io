          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is facing pressure from President Donald Trump's administration to take leave, with top economic adviser Kevin Hassett suggesting it as "the honorable thing to do." This comes as Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, plans to file a lawsuit challenging Trump's attempt to remove her, which her attorney asserts lacks factual or legal basis. The dispute centers on allegations of mortgage fraud, and the legal battle could potentially reach the Supreme Court, highlighting a significant challenge to the independence of the central bank. The Federal Reserve has confirmed Cook's intention to legally contest her removal.</p>

          <p>A Chinese woman, identified as Zhou, was rescued after being trapped in a locked guesthouse room for 30 hours without her phone, food, or a toilet. In a desperate attempt, she bit her finger and wrote "110 625" (emergency number and room number) on a pillow with her blood, then threw it out the window. A food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the message and alerted the police, leading to her rescue and earning him a 3,000 yuan reward. This extraordinary act of ingenuity and the quick thinking of a civilian highlights the critical role of community vigilance in emergencies.</p>

City officials confirmed the shooter is contained and no longer an active threat, with reports indicating a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident, which impacted students from pre-K to eighth grade, prompted responses from the FBI, ATF, and statements from Governor Tim Walz and President Donald Trump, expressing condolences and monitoring the situation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump and House Republicans are collaborating on legislative measures to prolong the White House's involvement in Washington D.C.'s crime crackdown. This initiative includes amending the D.C. Home Rule Act to allow the president to federalize the city's police force for extended periods beyond the current 30-day limit. Proponents argue it's necessary to improve public safety, citing a decrease in homicides since federal intervention began. However, opponents, primarily Democrats, criticize the move as an erosion of D.C.'s autonomy, raising constitutional questions about federal oversight of local governance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in its namesake brand's sales growth in the fiscal second quarter, with sales falling 5%. However, the company's overall performance was bolstered by a significant 19% surge in its teen-focused Hollister brand, marking its best-ever second-quarter net sales growth. This success led Abercrombie to narrowly beat Wall Street expectations and hike its full-year revenue outlook, despite facing increased tariff costs. The retailer is actively working to revitalize the Abercrombie brand through new categories and strategic partnerships, including becoming the NFL's first official fashion partner.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national in U.S. immigration custody, has formally requested an immigration judge to reopen his proceedings and is now seeking asylum in the United States. This development follows his re-detention by ICE, despite a previous court order prohibiting his removal to El Salvador due to fears of gang persecution. A federal judge has temporarily blocked his deportation to Uganda and ordered him to remain in a U.S. detention center within a specific radius for legal access. The complex case highlights ongoing challenges in immigration law and the protections sought by individuals facing potential harm in their home countries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is expected to rule on Google's lucrative default search contracts, potentially jeopardizing over $26 billion annually, with a significant portion going to Apple. This antitrust case, where Google was already found to hold a monopoly in search and ads, could force changes to exclusive deals. While Apple faces a potential financial hit, some analysts believe Google could benefit in the long run by redirecting funds from these costly agreements towards its rapidly growing AI and cloud initiatives. The outcome is seen as a test for future competition in search and AI, potentially reshaping the tech landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has issued a formal apology for the country's historical forced contraception campaign targeting Inuit women in Greenland. From the 1960s to 1992, approximately half of Greenland's 9,000 Inuit women were subjected to intrauterine device (IUD) insertion without consent, leading to sterility and various health problems. This apology acknowledges systematic discrimination and comes as about 150 women are suing Denmark for compensation.

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to chair a White House meeting with top U.S. and Israeli officials to discuss a post-war vision for Gaza, as Israel continues its offensive and warns of an "inevitable" evacuation of Gaza City. The region faces escalating tensions, including a Houthi missile attack on Israel that forced Germany's Development Minister to take shelter. International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors have returned to Iran amid ongoing disputes over its nuclear program, further complicating regional stability. Meanwhile, efforts for a Gaza ceasefire remain stalled, with Hamas agreeing to a proposal but Israel yet to respond.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Department of Transportation (DOT) will reclaim full management of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, aiming to enhance safety and aesthetics. Although DOT has owned the transit hub since the 1980s, its control had been diluted by various agreements. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader anti-crime crackdown in D.C., which has seen a federal presence at the station. The DOT plans to reinvest station income, such as from parking, into capital improvements like security and lighting, expecting renewed control by September to improve this vital East Coast transit hub.</p>

          <p>California's expanded film and TV tax credit program has awarded incentives to 22 television series, including two that relocated from Texas and Canada, amidst a nearly 400% surge in applications.

These projects are expected to generate $1.1 billion in economic impact and create thousands of jobs for cast, crew, and background actors. Governor Gavin Newsom hailed the initiative as a way to maintain California's status as the entertainment capital of the world, making the state more competitive in attracting productions.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency review into the Ammanford school stabbing, where a 13-year-old girl attacked two teachers and a pupil, found that the perpetrator had a long-standing fascination with weapons and war memorabilia. The report highlighted missed opportunities for intervention, noting that while counseling was offered and a referral for an Early Help assessment was made, these were declined or not pursued by the father. The girl, who was sentenced to 15 years for attempted murder, had previously been found with knives and a BB gun. This case underscores critical challenges in inter-agency information sharing and addressing complex needs in children.</p>

          <p>A key indicator for commercial real estate transaction volume, JLL's global Bid Intensity Index, improved in July for the first time this year, signaling renewed activity after an earlier pullback. The index, which measures bidding dynamics, suggests capital is increasing and the gap between buyer and seller expectations is narrowing. This stabilization comes as property sector fundamentals hold up despite weaker investor sentiment. While industrial and retail sectors face challenges from tariffs and supply chain uncertainty, the "living" (multifamily) and office sectors show improvement. Investors are increasingly accepting uncertainty and moving to a "risk-on" mode, expecting gradual momentum through the year's second half. (not investment advice)</p>
