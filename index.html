          <p>The new Trump administration is retroactively dismissing asylum applications filed years ago, citing procedural issues like the lack of a "credible fear" interview at the border. This change affects dozens of immigrants who had been following the established rules, possessed work permits, and were integrated into their communities. Immigration lawyers express concern that this policy converts documented individuals into undocumented ones, forcing them to restart a lengthy process and risk detention or deportation. The dismissals are part of a broader effort to tighten immigration controls and are causing significant uncertainty and fear among affected asylum-seekers.</p>

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a significant rise in tourism from neighboring Turkey, driven by affordability and a more relaxed atmosphere. This influx is boosting the local economy, with restaurateurs and officials welcoming the visitors. The increased people-to-people contact is seen as a positive force, potentially helping to ease long-standing political tensions between Greece and Turkey over issues like maritime borders and airspace. Despite ongoing diplomatic disputes between Athens and Ankara, the positive experiences of tourists on the ground offer a glimmer of hope for improved bilateral relations.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed a new set of genome editing tools, known as programmable chromosome engineering (PCE) systems, that can precisely edit large DNA fragments. This breakthrough makes a decade-old gene-editing technique significantly more efficient and easier to use, particularly in complex organisms like plants. The technology holds immense potential for agricultural improvements, such as enhancing crop traits, and for medical advancements, including the treatment of genetic diseases. This innovation could also accelerate the development of artificial chromosomes, opening new frontiers in the field of synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, key European allies have issued a joint statement insisting that Ukraine must be included in any peace negotiations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that any agreements made without Kyiv's participation would be considered "dead decisions." Concerns are growing in Europe over potential deals that might involve territorial concessions, with reports suggesting a US proposal could cede the Donbas region and Crimea to Russia. The European leaders emphasized that international borders should not be changed by force and reiterated their continued support for Ukraine's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Egyptian football star Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned a tribute from UEFA, European football's governing body, for the late Palestinian international player Suleiman al-Obeid. Salah highlighted that UEFA's social media post failed to mention the circumstances of al-Obeid's death. According to the Palestinian Football Association, al-Obeid was killed by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip. Salah's intervention draws further attention to the human cost of the conflict and follows his previous calls for increased humanitarian access to Gaza, using his platform to scrutinize the statements of major sporting organizations.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Baltimore on Saturday night left six people injured, including a five-year-old girl. Police responded to the scene where they found four males and two females with gunshot wounds. The child was shot in the hand with what are described as non-serious injuries. Five of the victims sustained non-life-threatening injuries, but one 38-year-old man is in critical condition following surgery. According to the police commissioner, it appears a gunman opened fire on a group of people who were gathered outside. Homicide detectives have been called to investigate due to the severity of one victim's condition.</p>

          <p>A second boxer, 28-year-old Hiromasa Urakawa, has died from a brain injury sustained during a boxing event in Tokyo. His death on Saturday followed a knockout loss in a fight on August 2. This is the second fatality from the same event, as another boxer, Shigetoshi Kotari, died on Friday from injuries he suffered in a separate bout. Both athletes had undergone surgery for a subdural hematoma, a serious condition involving blood collecting between the skull and the brain. The two deaths have cast a tragic shadow over the sport and the specific event held at Tokyo's Korakuen Hall.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics company Unitree, predicts that the "ChatGPT moment" for robotics could arrive within the next one to three years. He defines this milestone as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in an entirely new environment without prior specific training for that location. While acknowledging that hardware and training data are advancing, he states the crucial missing piece is a more sophisticated "AI for embodied intelligence." Wang expressed some skepticism about current models but suggested that new approaches, like generating interactive world models from text prompts, hold a higher probability of success.</p>

          <p>A small, circular piece of a bathroom door lock proved to be the key piece of evidence in solving the 2022 murder of Alexandra Pennig, a Minnesota nurse. Her colleague, Matthew Ecker, claimed she had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide. However, investigators found the metal lock component underneath her body, indicating the door was forced open *before* she was shot and fell. This contradicted Ecker's story that he broke the door down after hearing the gunshot. This crucial forensic finding allowed detectives to dismantle his narrative, leading to his arrest and eventual conviction for second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are pleading with residents of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to completely stop using water, including flushing toilets, amid a multi-day service outage. The crisis began when a critical water control valve broke, affecting about 9,200 households during a heatwave and prompting a boil water advisory. Efforts to restore service by refilling a large water tank are being hampered by continued residential water consumption, which is preventing the system from reaching the necessary pressure. A subsequent blowout of a temporary pipe has further delayed repairs, increasing the urgency of the conservation request from city leaders.</p>

          <p>Northern China is once again grappling with severe weather, as deadly floods have struck Beijing during the traditional rainy season of July and August. This year's disaster marks the fifth major flooding event in the region since 2012, raising questions about changing climate patterns. The recent storms have been particularly unusual because they primarily impacted the northern areas of the capital. This contrasts with previous severe floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the city's southern regions, indicating a potential shift in the geographic focus of these extreme weather events.</p>

It highlights the danger of viewing nuclear weapons as viable for offensive use rather than just deterrence.

The operation required using a false identity, a carefully crafted backstory, and hidden recording equipment to expose the criminal network's methods. The year-long investigation, which culminated in a tense meeting in a secret forest camp, has since led to an arrest in the UK, highlighting the impact of such dangerous undercover work.</p>
