          <p>Jeannie Seely, a Grammy-winning country music star known as "Miss Country Soul," has passed away at age 85 due to complications from an intestinal infection. A prominent member of the Grand Ole Opry for over 55 years, Seely was celebrated for her hit song "Don't Touch Me" and for challenging conventions, such as by wearing a miniskirt on the Opry stage. She remained an active performer and host throughout her life, with her final song released in July 2024. Colleagues like Dolly Parton remembered her as a dear friend and one of Nashville's greatest singers.</p>

          <p>Following a jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected growth and significant downward revisions, President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The president accused the agency of political manipulation without providing evidence, a move that has raised alarms on Wall Street about the integrity of U.S. economic data. The decision coincided with a global stock market downturn attributed to the administration's new tariff policies, which many economists predict will negatively impact the economy.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has scheduled a major case for its next term to determine if Louisiana's creation of a second majority-Black congressional district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The court has asked parties to submit briefs on whether the map violates the 14th or 15th Amendments. This case stems from a prolonged legal battle over the state's congressional map following the 2020 Census. The court's decision could have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act and the balance of power in the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>Researchers have published a study suggesting a connection between decadal solar cycle activities and the summer precipitation patterns in China. The study, featured in the Journal of Climate, posits that changes in the sun's magnetic cycle influence the country's "south drought and north flooding" phenomenon. This research highlights the significant role of the monsoon rain belt's positioning in determining regional droughts and floods. Understanding this link is considered crucial for improving climate predictions during China's flood seasons and mitigating their impact.</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a major fundraiser for President Trump, just one day after the president publicly demanded that Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies lower their drug prices in the U.S. The White House sent letters to 17 drugmakers, insisting they match the lower prices paid in other countries. The event, held at Trump's New Jersey golf club, aimed to raise approximately $25 million for a pro-Trump super PAC. This interaction highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry amid ongoing debates over prescription drug costs.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are warning beachgoers of a significant rise in stingray-related injuries, with daily incidents jumping from an average of one to as many as 15. Officials attribute the increase to calm, warm waters attracting more stingrays closer to the shore, particularly in an area known as "ray bay." To avoid being stung, experts advise shuffling one's feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish. If a sting occurs, the recommended treatment is to soak the affected area in hot water to break down the venom.</p>

          <p>A CBS News review of the Environmental Protection Agency's own regulatory analysis indicates that rolling back Biden-era greenhouse gas emission standards would lead to higher gasoline prices and the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035. While the administration promoted the repeal as a cost-saving measure, the cited data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency projects increased demand for less efficient vehicles, thereby driving up fuel costs. The analysis also shows that fuel efficiency standards for new cars and trucks would be significantly lower without the previous policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order to increase tariffs on most imports is expected to heighten uncertainty for businesses and raise prices for American consumers, according to trade experts. The new policy sets a baseline tariff of at least 15% for most countries, pushing the average U.S. tariff rate to a multi-decade high of 17%. Economists warn this could make everyday goods like clothing, furniture, and cars more expensive, potentially costing the average household over $2,000 annually. While the administration argues the tariffs will revive U.S. manufacturing, experts predict supply-chain disruptions and reduced product choices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Plan to Recognize Palestinian State Met with Hope and Skepticism</h2>

          <p>The British government's plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state has been framed as a way to revive the two-state solution, but it is receiving mixed reactions. Palestinian officials in London welcomed the move as a serious commitment beyond lip service, viewing it as a step toward correcting a historical injustice. However, on the ground in the West Bank, some Palestinians expressed skepticism, believing it will not change the reality of Israeli occupation and settlement expansion. Israeli officials, meanwhile, have condemned the plan as a reward for terrorism.</p>

          <p>All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons has publicly requested a trade from the Dallas Cowboys, stating on social media that he no longer wishes to play for the team. The 26-year-old star, who has been sitting out of on-field activities at training camp, is seeking a long-term contract extension but claims the team has not engaged in negotiations with his agent. Parsons expressed frustration over what he described as a lack of communication and narratives being spread to the media. The request escalates a significant contract standoff for one of the NFL's premier defensive players.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector has provided a rare account of how the country sends thousands of IT workers abroad to secretly earn foreign currency for the regime. In an interview with the BBC, the former worker, using the name Jin-su, described using fake identities to secure remote work with Western companies, earning thousands of dollars a month. He stated that 85% of his earnings were sent back to North Korea. This scheme, which has boomed with the rise of remote work, is estimated to generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually for the sanctioned nation.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Trump administration, alleging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth. The lawsuit argues the White House and Justice Department are intimidating providers with threats of criminal prosecution and demands for private patient data, creating a de facto national ban. This federal pressure has led several prominent children's hospitals to close their gender clinics, even in states where the care remains legal, disrupting access for many families.</p>

          <p>A jury in Florida has found Tesla to be partly responsible for a 2019 crash involving a Model S on Autopilot, which resulted in the death of a pedestrian and severe injuries to another. The company has been ordered to pay up to $243 million in damages, though it has vowed to appeal the verdict. Plaintiffs successfully argued that the Autopilot driver-assistance software should have alerted the distracted driver and applied the brakes. This case marks a significant legal setback for Tesla, as it is the first fatal Autopilot lawsuit to reach a jury verdict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that closes off a major avenue for millions of motorists to claim compensation for the mis-selling of car finance. The court did not uphold a previous ruling that deemed hidden commission payments to car dealers inherently unlawful. However, the judgment still leaves open the possibility for claims based on unfairness due to large, disproportionate commissions. The decision significantly reduces the potential compensation liability for lenders, though many individual claims under discretionary commission arrangements banned in 2021 are still expected to proceed.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner represents a broader war on objective numbers and facts. The author satirically suggests that, like his personal net worth or golf scores, the president believes economic data should conform to his feelings and political needs. The piece contends that by attacking the credibility of government statisticians, the administration fosters an environment of misinformation where policy decisions are based on vibes rather than evidence, ultimately leaving everyone to navigate in the dark.

Jenkinson, who appeared in a BBC documentary on the Jesus Army cult, emphasizes that these groups are not always religious and can be hard to spot. She calls for greater support within the healthcare system and legal changes to address coercive control in group settings.</p>

This disclosure suggests that about half of the company's workforce has been with the firm for over three years. The figures appear to counter online speculation about high turnover rates and indicate a relatively stable workforce within China's competitive technology sector.</p>
