        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the Trump administration's preference for tariffs over traditional sanctions as a tool for economic leverage and foreign policy. The piece explores how this strategy, characterized by sudden impositions and reversals, creates global market uncertainty but provides unilateral control and revenue for the US Treasury. Experts quoted express concern that blurring the lines between trade policy and punitive sanctions could destabilize international relations and potentially lead to conflict, a departure from previous administrations' approaches.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that a vote on a resolution to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein will not occur before the August recess. Johnson stated the Trump administration needs space to conduct its own review, a move Democrats have labeled a "cover vote." This delay comes amid President Trump's own directive for the Justice Department to seek the unsealing of grand jury transcripts, and a separate bipartisan effort to force a vote on the matter.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being hailed as a significant moment for Muslim and South Asian Americans. The 33-year-old assemblyman, who ran on a platform focused on affordability and Palestinian rights, mobilized a diverse coalition of voters. His rise is seen by many as a sign of growing political influence for a community that has faced intense scrutiny and Islamophobia, particularly in a city deeply affected by the aftermath of 9/11.</p>

          <p>As college costs continue to rise, this article provides a detailed breakdown of the maximum amounts students can borrow through federal loan programs. The limits vary based on factors such as a student's dependency status, their year in school, and whether they are pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree. While federal loans offer borrower protections and are often the first source of funding, their borrowing caps mean they may not cover the full cost of attendance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A dispute has emerged between NHS England and the British Medical Association (BMA) over care levels during an upcoming five-day doctors' strike. NHS England has instructed hospitals not to cancel non-urgent care, a move the BMA warns will spread non-striking staff too thinly and put patient safety at risk by understaffing emergency services. This new approach differs from previous strikes where non-urgent work was widely rescheduled, creating a tense standoff as negotiations continue.</p>
