          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 09:05:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Trade Organization has increased its global trade volume growth forecast for 2025 to 2.4%, a significant rise from its previous 0.9% estimate. This growth is attributed to strong U.S. import demand ahead of tariff hikes and a surge in demand for AI-related goods, particularly from Asia. However, the WTO has sharply downgraded its outlook for 2026, cutting the expected growth from 1.8% to just 0.5%, citing a cooling global economy and the delayed impact of trade tariffs. The organization warns that trade-restrictive measures and policy uncertainty remain key downside risks for the global economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second quarter of 2025, real estate investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the U.S., marking the highest share in five years, according to a report from CJ Patrick Co. While the overall number of homes bought by investors decreased compared to last year, their market share grew due to a weaker overall sales market. Small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, continue to dominate the market, while large institutional investors have been selling more homes than they buy for six consecutive quarters. This trend is adding much-needed inventory for both renters and traditional homebuyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham, Peter Windsor, has been found guilty of stalking television and radio presenter Myleene Klass and her colleague Katie Breathwick. The court heard that Windsor sent numerous distressing items to their workplace between 2020 and 2024, including a gun, handcuffs, and a will-writing kit, causing what Klass described as "sheer terror." Windsor, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, sent letters calling Klass a "naughty vixen" and made other disturbing proposals. Jurors reached a unanimous guilty verdict, and the judge is considering sentencing options that include prison or a hospital order.</p>

Semenya, who has a difference of sexual development (DSD), has been fighting rules that would require her to medically reduce her natural testosterone levels to compete.

          <p>Glenn Medical Center, the only hospital in Glenn County, California, has been forced to shut down after 75 years of service, impacting approximately 28,000 residents. The closure occurred after the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) revoked its "critical access" designation, a status vital for its financial viability, due to a reassessment of its distance from the next nearest hospital. This decision leaves a vast agricultural community without a local emergency room, forcing residents to travel over 30 miles for urgent medical care. The closure highlights a nationwide crisis facing rural hospitals, with hundreds at risk of shutting down due to financial pressures.</p>

          <p>With the official jobs report delayed by the U.S. government shutdown, investment firm Carlyle has released its own analysis indicating that employment growth was nearly flat in September. The firm's proprietary data, derived from its portfolio of 277 companies, showed a meager gain of just 17,000 jobs, which is lower than the previous month's official figures. This estimate aligns with other private-sector data, such as ADP's report of job losses, suggesting a significant slowdown in the labor market. Despite the weak hiring numbers, Carlyle's data also indicated a resilient underlying economy with a 2.7% annualized GDP growth rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of travelers using artificial intelligence to plan or book their holidays has doubled, rising from 4% to 8% over the last year, according to UK travel association ABTA. The trend is most prominent among younger holidaymakers, although AI still trails far behind traditional methods like internet searches and recommendations from friends and family. Overall holiday travel continues to rebound toward pre-pandemic levels, with Spain remaining the top international destination for UK travelers. While the travel industry sees AI as both an opportunity and a challenge, most consumers are not yet comfortable handing over full control of their booking to the technology.</p>

          <p>At a public parole hearing for David Norris, one of the men convicted of the 1993 racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, argued he must remain in prison. In a statement read by her lawyer, she asserted that Norris remains a danger to the public because he has never shown true remorse or taken full responsibility for his actions. The hearing confirmed that Norris has recently admitted his involvement in the attack but denies being the one who used the knife. Baroness Lawrence emphasized that anyone holding his extremist racist views, which were recorded on a police bug, poses an obvious threat to society.</p>

          <p>Two years after the October 7th attacks, Jeremy Ben-Ami reflects on the devastation in communities like Kfar Aza, where residents who advocated for peace were killed or taken hostage. Despite the immense loss and ongoing war, he argues that the pursuit of peace is not a naive ideal but a pragmatic necessity for the security of both Israelis and Palestinians. The article points to a recent peace proposal as a reason for cautious hope, suggesting that its framework for a ceasefire and a path toward Palestinian self-governance must be seriously considered.

          <p>A remote, tented immigration jail in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," has resumed operations after two appellate court judges paused a lower court's closure order. The facility, notorious for allegations of inhumane conditions, was initially ordered to shut down due to violations of federal environmental laws. However, the reprieve has allowed the 3,000-capacity camp to rapidly fill again, with activists reporting it is operating like a "U.S. black site" where detainees are transferred or deported without notice. The legal battle continues as immigrant and environmental groups argue the facility was built improperly and violates the constitutional rights of detainees.</p>

In a rare look inside its California design lab, Chief Design Officer Jeff Hammoud explained the process of creating the new, more affordable models through "subtraction" while retaining the brand's core ethos.

Her case highlights the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, especially as breast cancer rates are rising in women under 50. Thanks to the early detection, her prognosis is excellent, and her oncologist credits her awareness with preventing a much more advanced diagnosis.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of a new voluntary military service model, suggesting that a return to compulsory service may be necessary. His comments have fueled an ongoing debate in Germany about reinstating conscription, which was suspended in 2011, to boost the Bundeswehr's troop numbers amid growing security threats. The government aims to increase active soldiers from 183,000 to 260,000 by the early 2030s. Merz's remarks have created friction within the ruling coalition, as his Social Democrat partners favor the current voluntary approach, which is set to be debated in parliament.</p>

While other services are also affected, the impact on military families is considered a particularly potent issue. If this deadline does not force an agreement, such as a short-term continuing resolution, some fear the shutdown could extend for a prolonged period. (not investment advice)</p>

This simple, low-cost intervention is inspired by the U.S. military's practice of treating uniforms to repel mosquitoes. Researchers believe this method could be a critical new tool in the fight against malaria, which kills a child under five nearly every minute in sub-Saharan Africa, by providing protection during daytime hours when bed nets are not in use.</p>
