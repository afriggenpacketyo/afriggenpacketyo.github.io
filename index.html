          <p>Danish wind farm developer Orsted experienced a significant stock price drop of over 25% following the announcement of a planned $9.4 billion rights issue. The company cited "material adverse development" in the U.S. market, which prevented it from raising funds through a partial sale of its Sunrise Wind project. This move, offering existing shareholders priority on new shares, is a direct response to unexpected financial pressures and market challenges in its American operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gary Grant, the founder of The Entertainer, the largest toy retailer in the United Kingdom, is transferring 100% ownership of the company to its 1,900 employees. This move establishes an employee ownership trust, which will allow staff to share in the company's profits and have a say in its governance. Grant, who founded the chain in 1981, stated the decision was made to preserve the company's family-oriented values rather than selling it for purely monetary gain.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a major revision of driving laws in England and Wales, which includes mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 every three years. The proposed road safety strategy also considers reducing the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter level and introducing penalties for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These changes follow a coroner's report that criticized the current self-reporting system for vision problems as the "laxest in Europe" after several fatal accidents.</p>

The truce, agreed upon in May, had paused a series of punitive measures and reduced prohibitive duties. Key issues complicating a new deal include China's commitment to purchasing U.S. goods, semiconductor export controls, China's dominance in rare-earth metals, and its significant purchases of Russian crude oil, which could trigger secondary sanctions.</p>

          <p>Beijing has unexpectedly relaxed its property buying restrictions, allowing eligible families to purchase homes outside the city's Fifth Ring Road. This move is seen as a proactive step by the government to bolster market confidence amid deteriorating sales and home-price data. Analysts suggest this could signal that other major cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen might soon follow suit and ease their own long-standing purchasing curbs to stimulate the struggling real estate sector.

          <p>Driven by global economic uncertainties, many Chinese citizens are seeking opportunities in African goldfields, despite significant risks. In Mali, one of Africa's top gold producers, the Chinese embassy has repeatedly warned its nationals to halt mining operations and evacuate due to a deteriorating security situation. This follows a series of kidnappings and attacks targeting Chinese miners, highlighting the dangerous environment they face in a country that has been unstable since a 2020 military coup.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the most anticipated celestial events, is set to peak this week, but viewing conditions are expected to be poor. The peak on August 12-13 coincides with a waning gibbous moon that will be 84% full, significantly reducing visibility. Astronomers predict that the bright moonlight could obscure up to 75% of the meteors, with viewers likely to see only 10-20 of the brightest fireballs per hour instead of the usual 50 or more under dark sky conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The conviction of nurse Lucy Letby for murdering and attempting to murder babies is being challenged by her defense team, who argue the case was built on unreliable medical evidence. This article examines the complexities of the evidence, focusing on the case of one infant, Baby O. It highlights how expert opinions diverge on key prosecution claims, such as liver injuries from impact and air embolism, while also showing that alternative defense theories, like an accidental needle injury, lack consensus and supporting evidence.</p>

          <p>Following a successful run in the Leagues Cup, the LA Galaxy returned to MLS action with a disappointing 4-0 home loss to the Seattle Sounders. The Galaxy, who will face Pachuca in the Leagues Cup quarterfinals, struggled to find their rhythm against Seattle, conceding an own goal in the first half before Seattle added three more in the second. The lopsided defeat significantly damages the Galaxy's already slim chances of making the MLS playoffs, despite the pre-game celebration of their 2005 championship team.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company Tesla has formally applied for a license to supply electricity to households and businesses in the United Kingdom. If approved by the energy regulator Ofgem, the move would position Tesla to compete with established UK energy firms as soon as next year.

          <p>Following President Donald Trump's promise of a crackdown on crime and homelessness, federal agents were deployed across Washington, D.C. The president announced on social media that homeless individuals must move out immediately and that he would hold a press conference on the matter. This action comes despite official data showing that violent crime in the city hit a 30-year low in 2024, and has raised concerns among homeless residents and civil liberties advocates about the administration's rhetoric and tactics.</p>

          <p>After a tumultuous first 100 days in office, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing intense political pressure and is being widely portrayed as a 'dead man walking.' His new coalition government with the Social Democrats is struggling to find its footing amid a hyperpolarized political environment. Merz is simultaneously criticized for being too culturally conservative and for conceding too much to the left, all while facing a strategic effort by the far-right AfD party to weaken his administration and grow its own support.</p>

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that Beijing misinterpreted his recent comments about a potential conflict over Taiwan. China had accused Marcos of "playing with fire" after he said the Philippines would inevitably be drawn into any conflict due to its geographic proximity. Marcos clarified that he was referring to the practical necessity of evacuating over one hundred thousand Filipinos living in Taiwan in a war scenario, and that his country wishes to avoid any confrontation.</p>
