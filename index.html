        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article discusses how the perception of the United States as a threat to China through peaceful evolution has diminished under the Trump administration. The author reflects on how, during their upbringing in China, they were taught to be wary of American conspiracies aimed at subverting the Communist Party. However, with China's rise as a global power and the US shifting away from nation-building, the perceived threat has receded. The author posits that Trump's policies have inadvertently lessened China's concerns about American influence. Optimism is reflected in the stability of the state of China's relationship with the United States.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement operations. According to a statement from the White House, President Trump signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address lawlessness in California. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and likely to escalate tensions. The deployment follows clashes between demonstrators and authorities during protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. The optimism score is relatively low due to the escalation of tensions and potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's dilemma regarding her husband's interest in ethical non-monogamy while she prefers monogamy. The columnist emphasizes the importance of open communication and clearly stating one's desires within a relationship. Drawing on Erich Fromm's philosophy, the advice underscores the need for freedom and support for personal growth in love, while cautioning against masochistic self-sacrifice. The article suggests the couple work on strengthening their emotional connection before considering non-monogamy, and that the husband should cease flirting with his colleague until the couple is aligned on the terms of their relationship.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, was diverted to Rome because the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was too large to land at the Naples airport. Passengers were then transported by bus from Rome to Naples, a journey of approximately three hours. American Airlines apologized for the disruption, citing operational limitations as the reason for the diversion. Historical flight data indicates that American Airlines typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route. The situation is frustrating for the passengers but the circumstances are relatively stable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newt Gingrich's new book, "Trump's Triumph," is analyzed for its flattering portrayal of President Trump and its selective recounting of past political events. The article highlights Gingrich's praise for Trump and Elon Musk, while also pointing out potential conflicts of interest due to his wife's ambassadorship and Tesla stock holdings. The review notes the book's score-settling tone, particularly regarding figures like George H.W. Bush and Mitt Romney. It also touches on Gingrich's own past controversies and ethical issues, contrasting them with his current eagerness to align with the powers that be. The optimism score is relatively low due to the critical analysis of political motivations and past controversies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's aim to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers fast enough to meet demand. The average age of aircraft mechanics is high, and a significant portion is nearing retirement, leading to a projected shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people to the field by raising wages and offering on-the-job training. While some experts are doubtful that jobs shipped abroad will return, high-value sectors like aviation are more likely to remain in the US. The optimism score reflects the challenge of filling skilled positions, balanced by efforts to attract new talent.</p>

          <p>This article examines Barack Obama's post-presidency activities and questions his relative silence during the Trump era. It contrasts Obama's carefully curated public image with the urgency and desperation felt by many of his supporters. While acknowledging the former president's right to enjoy his semi-retirement, the article argues that his absence from the political fray is a dereliction of the message he built his career on. The author suggests that Obama could play a more active role in challenging Trump's policies and inspiring the next generation of Democratic leaders. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the disappointment with Obama's perceived inaction balanced by the potential for him to re-engage.</p>

It points out that both criticize the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but for different reasons that ultimately serve their own interests. The article contends that this shared value of cutting public services and providing tax cuts for the rich is a fundamental principle of the Republican Party.

          <p>This article argues that anti-Semitic attacks inadvertently strengthen the case for Zionism, the movement for a Jewish state. The author contends that historical and contemporary acts of anti-Semitism, including recent attacks in the United States, demonstrate the need for a safe haven for Jews. By creating an environment of fear and insecurity, these attacks push Jews who were once indifferent or opposed to Israel to become reluctant supporters. The article suggests that the most effective way to counter Zionism would be to create a society where Jews feel welcome and secure outside of Israel.
