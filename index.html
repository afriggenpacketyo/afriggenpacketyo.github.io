          <p>Police have identified Shane Devon Tamura, 27, as the suspect in the Midtown Manhattan office shooting that killed four people. Originally from the Las Vegas area with a history of competitive football in high school, Tamura had a documented mental health history according to authorities. He drove across the country to New York, where he entered an office building with a high-powered rifle and body armor. The motive for the attack, which ended with his self-inflicted death, remains under investigation as police trace his recent movements and any potential connection to the targeted location.</p>

          <p>Ryne Sandberg, the celebrated Chicago Cubs second baseman and a Baseball Hall of Famer, has passed away at the age of 65 after a battle with cancer. Known for his exceptional skill, he was a 10-time All-Star, nine-time Gold Glove winner, and the 1984 National League MVP. His career is famously highlighted by the "Sandberg Game" in 1984, where he hit two game-tying home runs against a rival closer. The Cubs recently honored his legacy by unveiling a statue of him outside Wrigley Field, celebrating his profound impact on the sport and the city.</p>

          <p>Intense rainfall has caused severe flooding and landslides in and around Beijing, resulting in the deaths of at least 34 people. The Miyun district was particularly hard-hit, with some areas receiving over 21 inches of rain, prompting authorities to release water from a reservoir at its highest level since 1959. Over 80,000 people have been evacuated from their homes as the storms destroyed roads, cut power, and disrupted communications. This event highlights the region's vulnerability to extreme weather, echoing the severe flooding experienced in 2023.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and bribery, making him the first ex-president in the country's history to be convicted of a crime. The case stemmed from an investigation into his alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups, with the court finding he conspired to influence testimony from imprisoned former fighters. The verdict is deeply polarizing in Colombia, where Uribe is seen by some as a savior who fought leftist insurgencies. He faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management has issued a memo affirming that federal employees have a right to religious expression at work, including attempting to persuade colleagues about their beliefs. The guidance states that an employee can discuss why their faith is correct, but must stop if a coworker requests it. The policy, which has drawn criticism from groups like the Freedom From Religion Foundation, is part of a broader push to protect religious expression. Critics argue the memo could lead to workplace harassment and evangelizing, particularly from supervisors to their subordinates.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a European-led peace plan and aid efforts for Gaza. The initiative, developed with France and Germany, was presented to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland. This diplomatic push comes amid growing domestic pressure on the UK government to immediately recognize Palestinian statehood, with over half of Labour's backbench MPs signing a letter in support. Downing Street stated the plan aims to provide immediate relief and set out a sustainable pathway to a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a formal misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, escalating a conflict over his handling of a case involving deportations. The complaint alleges the judge made improper public comments critical of the Trump administration, thereby undermining the judiciary's impartiality. This action follows Judge Boasberg's previous rulings that blocked deportation flights and found probable cause that the administration committed contempt of court by ignoring his order. The complaint seeks an investigation and the reassignment of the case to another judge.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are facing the potential loss of crucial mental health resources due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of federal grants. Citing concerns over diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, the Department of Education suspended the funding, leaving districts scrambling and potentially forcing them to lay off counselors and social workers. With a nationwide shortage of child mental health professionals, especially in rural areas, the cuts could leave many students without access to essential services. The department is being sued by 16 states over the decision.</p>

The incident occurred during a traffic stop where Laynez's undocumented coworkers were also detained. U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated the individuals resisted arrest, but the video has intensified scrutiny of expanded state and local roles in immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is being viewed by some economists as an unbalanced deal that could negatively impact the EU's economy. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while U.S. goods exported to the EU will face no tariffs. Analysts forecast this could reduce the EU's annual GDP, though the deal does provide certainty by avoiding a threatened 30% tariff. While the Trump administration touts the agreement as a win for American manufacturers, European industry groups have expressed concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland provided significant, direct access to the American leader, which Downing Street views as invaluable. However, the article notes the inherent risks of engaging with Trump's free-wheeling and unpredictable diplomatic style. The discussions covered a wide range of topics, including Gaza, with Starmer carefully interjecting to clarify UK policy. The analysis suggests that while the relationship is solid, its ultimate benefit for the UK depends on translating this personal access into tangible diplomatic outcomes.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver request to play in the upcoming season. The suit challenges the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive and unfairly penalizes him for disruptions caused by the pandemic and a previous injury. Wingfield, who transferred to USC for his final season, claims the denial robs him of a significant name, image, and likeness (NIL) opportunity and the chance to raise his professional profile. The case adds to a growing number of legal challenges against the NCAA's regulations.</p>
