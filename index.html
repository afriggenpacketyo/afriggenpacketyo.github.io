          <h2>China's Exports Increase Despite US Tariffs Due to Increased Trade with Southeast Asia</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, primarily driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a significant decline in exports to the United States following the implementation of tariffs. Exports to ASEAN countries rose by 20.8%, while exports to the U.S. fell by over 21%. Despite the overall export growth, analysts anticipate a potential weakening in trade data in the coming months. The surge in exports could be attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% decline following the release of its first-quarter earnings report, which fell short of analysts' estimates. While revenue increased by approximately 28% year-over-year to $2.24 billion, and profit attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million, these figures missed expectations due to production fluctuations. The company anticipates a sequential decline in revenue for the current quarter, projecting a decrease of 4% to 6%.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump abruptly dismissed Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, a move that has sparked outrage among congressional Democrats. Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, was notified of her termination via email from the White House's Presidential Personnel Office. The dismissal, which came before the expiration of Hayden's 10-year term, followed criticism from a conservative advocacy group accusing her of promoting "radical" content. The firing is seen as part of a broader effort by Trump to remove officials perceived as opposing his agenda.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of reducing U.S. tariffs on goods imported from China as high-level trade talks are scheduled to take place. Trump mentioned that tariffs cannot go any higher than the current 145%, implying an impending decrease. The meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Switzerland signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war that has significantly impacted global financial markets. Despite the optimistic tone, analysts caution that any tariff cuts are likely to be minor and that significant systemic issues between the two countries remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% year-on-year in April, defying US President Trump's tariff increases and surpassing market expectations. This strong export growth could strengthen China's negotiating position in upcoming trade talks with the U.S. in Switzerland. The surge in exports may be due to transshipment through other countries and trade contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. However, analysts anticipate a potential weakening in trade data in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Nearly 60 felony cases in Hanceville, Alabama, will be dismissed due to "rampant culture of corruption" within the local police department. A grand jury determined that the cases were tainted after four officers and the police chief were indicted on charges related to mishandling evidence. An audit revealed significant issues with the department's evidence room, including undocumented and missing items.

          <p>Producers of tungsten products in developed nations are recognizing the need to diversify their raw material supply sources following China's export restrictions.

The element is used to make cutting tools, drill bits, heavy machinery parts, and is a component in certain types of ammunition and armor. The United States defense contractors must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027.</p>
