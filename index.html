          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced new tariffs on imports from over 60 countries, set to take effect in seven days. The executive order details duties ranging from 10% to as high as 41%, determined by whether the U.S. has a trade surplus or deficit with the nation. The move also includes a significant hike on Canadian goods from 25% to 35%, while Mexico received a 90-day extension for negotiations. This action follows through on earlier threats and aims to reshape U.S. trade relationships, despite criticism that the strategy creates economic uncertainty.</p>

Passengers described a terrifying scene where people and objects were thrown around the cabin of the Airbus A330. An engineering professor commented that while air travel remains safe, such clear-air turbulence events are becoming more common and severe due to climate change.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order revising tariffs on dozens of countries, with new rates from 10% to 41% effective August 7. A significant new provision imposes an additional 40% tariff on any goods found to be transshipped through other countries to evade duties. While some Asian nations like Thailand and Malaysia saw their proposed rates lowered, the order confirmed higher duties for partners like Canada. Analysts expressed concern that the continued uncertainty and the potential for more tariff hikes could negatively impact global trade and economic stability.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, postponing the termination until at least a November hearing. In her decision, the judge stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the terminations were "preordained" actions that did not fully consider current country conditions. The judge also found it likely the decisions were motivated by racial animus, citing various statements by the administration.</p>

          <p>Following the signing of a new tariff order, President Trump engaged in a sharp exchange with a reporter who questioned why the policy wasn't implemented during his first term. The president responded that he was preoccupied with other issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic and "fighting lunatics like you." He defended his trade strategy by pointing to the hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff revenue collected from China during his first term. The White House stated the new tariffs are intended to secure fair and reciprocal trade relationships to benefit American workers and manufacturers.</p>

The case was built after one victim reported an assault in 2020, leading investigators to discover text messages and four other victims. The prosecutor noted the sentence was warranted due to the profound harm caused by the defendant's sexual violence.</p>

          <p>Speaking at a judicial conference, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's handling of a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. He argued that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass Congress, more legal challenges that require the court's intervention are inevitable. Kavanaugh stated the court has increased its process for these cases, including scheduling emergency oral arguments, to "try to get the right answer." He also emphasized the court's strong collegiality, stating that despite disagreements, the justices view each other as patriots.</p>

          <p>Gold prices are on track for a weekly loss, primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, which has hit its highest level since late May.

          <p>A U.S. district judge has extended deportation protections for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program. In a sharply worded order, Judge Trina Thompson ruled that the administration's decision to end their status was likely motivated by racial animus. The judge referenced President Trump's campaign rhetoric, stating the immigrants were being told to "atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood."

          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that a majority of the 109,000 arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the first five months of the second Trump term occurred in Southern and border states. Texas accounted for nearly a quarter of all arrests, followed by Florida and California. This represents a 120% increase in arrests compared to the same period in 2024. Experts attribute the geographic concentration to local law enforcement cooperation with ICE and the demographic distribution of immigrant communities across the country.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:58 EDT</div>

          <p>According to new research, the modern potato's ancestor is unexpectedly the tomato. A study published in the journal Cell proposes that the potato evolved around 9 million years ago through a hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuber-producing wild potato species from Chile. Scientists say the ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to create starchy tubers, while the wild potato provided a gene that controls their growth. This discovery, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, finally solves the long-puzzling mystery of the popular vegetable's origin.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals China's Use of 'Dark Fleet' to Illicitly Purchase Sanctioned Iranian Oil</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News investigation has uncovered that China is circumventing U.S. sanctions by secretly purchasing Iranian oil using a "dark fleet" of tankers. These ships turn off their tracking transponders and conduct ship-to-ship oil transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia to obscure the origin of the crude. This illicit trade, which is estimated to have generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, props up the Iranian regime and its nuclear program. Despite U.S. sanctions on vessels involved, the investigation found the activity is only increasing, with a dozen transfers recorded in a single day.</p>

          <h2>Fatal Crash in Cornwall Prompts Calls for Stricter Rules for Older Drivers</h2>

          <p>The daughter of a 79-year-old woman killed in a car crash in Cornwall, UK, is calling for an overhaul of driving regulations for older adults, labeling the current rules "unsafe and inadequate." Geraldine Gibson died after pulling into oncoming traffic, and her daughter believes her mother's age and health conditions were contributing factors. Currently, UK drivers must self-declare medical conditions and renew their license every three years after age 70, but there are no mandatory tests. The case highlights a growing debate as the number of older drivers on UK roads increases.</p>

          <p>London's Heathrow Airport has revealed a £49 billion plan for expansion, which includes a third runway, a new terminal, and significant infrastructure upgrades like diverting a major motorway. The airport's CEO called the expansion "urgent," stating that Heathrow is operating at capacity, to the detriment of UK trade and connectivity. While the government and business groups support the privately financed project for its economic benefits, it faces fierce opposition from environmental groups, local residents, and London's mayor over noise, air pollution, and climate concerns.</p>

          <p>Apple announced strong fiscal third-quarter results, with revenue growing 10% to $94.04 billion, outpacing estimates and driven by record iPhone sales. Despite the solid performance, the company's stock saw only a modest increase as investors were left wanting more details on its artificial intelligence strategy. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed that AI is a profound technology and that the company is significantly increasing its investment, but offered little new information on the roadmap for 'Apple Intelligence.' The results highlight Apple's current strength but also the market's intense focus on its future in AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A monument honoring Robert Smalls, the enslaved man who commandeered a Confederate ship to win his freedom and later became a U.S. Congressman, is being created for the South Carolina State House grounds. This will be the first statue dedicated to an individual African American at the state capitol, which is currently surrounded by monuments to White men, many with Confederate ties. The project, made possible by a bipartisan push from state lawmakers, is seen by historians as a crucial step to "complete the incomplete and unfinished story" of the state's history.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's practice of deporting migrants to African nations that are not their country of origin is facing scrutiny from human rights experts and legal scholars. The U.S. recently sent a dozen men from countries like Mexico and Yemen to Eswatini and South Sudan, arguing their home countries would not accept them. Critics argue these third-country removals could violate the international law principle of non-refoulement if the destination country is unsafe. The deals, which are largely secret, raise questions about due process and the safety of the deported individuals.</p>

          <p>In the first federal trial of its kind, attorneys for plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Tesla over a fatal Autopilot crash are asking the jury to award $345 million in damages. The 2019 crash in Florida killed a 22-year-old woman and severely injured her boyfriend after a Model S using Enhanced Autopilot accelerated through an intersection. The plaintiffs argue that Tesla's system had dangerous defects and that the company overstated its capabilities, encouraging driver overreliance. Tesla's defense counters that the driver was at fault and that a ruling against the company would stifle life-saving technology.</p>
