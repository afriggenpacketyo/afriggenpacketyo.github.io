          <p>A shooting in New York City's Times Square resulted in three people being wounded, though their injuries are not life-threatening. The incident occurred in the early morning hours, leading to a police response and the questioning of one person in custody. This event contrasts with the city's overall trend of declining gun violence this year, which has seen its fewest shootings in decades. Authorities have not yet released details on the motive or circumstances of the shooting.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that ceding any territory to Russia is not an option for achieving peace. His declaration comes in response to a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where Trump suggested a potential deal could involve "some swapping of territories." Zelenskyy emphasized that any peace agreement made without Ukraine's direct involvement would be a "dead solution" and against the country's constitutional principles. This underscores Kyiv's anxiety about being sidelined in crucial geopolitical negotiations.</p>

          <p>The article explores the adverse psychological effects of hook-up apps like Grindr, as told through the experiences of young gay men. Users describe a cycle of seeking validation through casual sexual encounters, which often leads to feelings of objectification, anxiety, and depression. While acknowledging the apps can be a way to explore sexuality, the piece highlights a "toxic" culture that can make it difficult to form meaningful connections. It features individuals who feel their self-worth has become damagingly tied to physical appearance and sexual validation.</p>

          <p>Europe is witnessing a notable surge in tourism from China, with a 13% year-on-year increase recorded in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), the trend is expected to continue, as a recent report found 72% of Chinese tourists are willing to travel long-haul to the continent. This figure is significantly higher than the global average and surpasses interest from traditionally strong markets like the US and Japan. The influx provides a welcome boost to Europe's summer tourism economy.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores the Rise of 'Grifter' as a Prominent Political Insult</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 04:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "grifter" has become a ubiquitous insult in modern political discourse, used to accuse opponents of profiting from their beliefs through dishonest means. This article examines the word's increased usage, noting its application to figures across the political spectrum, from Nigel Farage to Zarah Sultana. The trend reflects a broader societal paranoia fueled by online influencer culture, high-profile scam documentaries, and a general distrust in politicians' motives. The piece suggests this atmosphere makes it common to view political adversaries not just as wrong, but as con artists.</p>

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood holds a commanding four-shot lead at the St. Jude Championship in Memphis after completing his second round with a six-under 64.

This comes after a reported directive that could authorize direct military action on foreign soil, building on an executive order designating several Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations.
