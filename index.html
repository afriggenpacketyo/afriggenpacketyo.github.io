The judge highlighted the extreme brutality of the crime and the profound grief of the victim's family, noting Methven's betrayal of trust and the dignity he robbed from her in death.</p>

          <p>A plane operated by Dutch company Zeusch Aviation crashed upon takeoff at London Southend Airport, with witnesses describing a "huge fireball." The airport has been closed until further notice, leading to the cancellation and rerouting of all Monday flights. The aircraft, which had flown from Croatia, was seen banking sharply before it inverted and hit the ground. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has deployed a team to investigate the cause of the crash. The number of casualties has not yet been confirmed by authorities.</p>

          <p>The Dragon Bravo Fire near the Grand Canyon National Park has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and 50 to 80 other structures, including visitor facilities and employee housing. The fire, fueled by strong winds, also caused a chlorine gas leak from a damaged water treatment plant, complicating firefighting efforts and forcing evacuations. This event is part of a larger pattern of wildfires in the region, including the White Sage Fire, with smoke from Canadian wildfires also causing poor air quality across the U.S. Midwest. Officials are investigating the fire's handling amid extreme heat and dry conditions.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tuam, Ireland, have begun a two-year excavation of a suspected mass grave at the site of a former Catholic-run home for unwed mothers. The site is believed to contain the remains of up to 796 babies and young children who died between 1925 and 1961, with test digs previously finding human remains in a disused septic tank. This effort follows years of work by historian Catherine Corless and campaigning by survivors and families. The investigation aims to exhume, identify, and respectfully re-inter the remains, addressing a dark chapter in Irish history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of ground beef in the United States has surged to a record high, costing $6.67 per pound just before the Fourth of July. This increase is attributed to a combination of factors, including a national cattle herd that has shrunk to its smallest size since 1951 due to prolonged droughts in key states. Additionally, higher production costs, rising interest rates, and trade disruptions have contributed to the sustained high prices. Despite the cost, consumer demand for beef remains strong, prompting shoppers and restaurants to adapt by seeking value-friendly options and alternative proteins. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal is seen as a response to growing activism that began during the pandemic and builds on the city's previous success with universal pre-K.

While the nearby town of Comfort, which suffered in 1987, recently installed a siren system and saw successful evacuations, the broader Kerr County did not, despite its known vulnerability as "flash flood alley."

This article explores the paradox of modern life, where factors such as stress, demanding work schedules, and "revenge bedtime procrastination" undermine sleep quality. Systemic issues like environmental noise, light pollution, and socioeconomic disparities also play a crucial role, disproportionately affecting low-income communities. Experts suggest that while individual habits matter, a fixation on perfecting sleep can be counterproductive, and addressing broader systemic barriers is essential.</p>

The decline was driven by a continued drop in food prices, which fell into negative territory. This lower-than-expected inflation rate provides the Reserve Bank of India with more flexibility to continue easing its monetary policy and potentially cut interest rates further. Analysts expect inflation to remain low, aided by strong crop production and a good monsoon season, which could boost economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new tariff rates on 25 economies after a pause on previous "reciprocal tariffs" expired. The new threats include 30% tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, 35% on Canada, 50% on Brazil, and 25% on Japan and South Korea, with an August 1 deadline for negotiations. This article explains the latest developments in the administration's trade policy, which aims to use tariffs to pressure allies and rivals into new agreements. The moves are part of a broader strategy that could create significant uncertainty in global trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Undocumented farm workers in the U.S. report feeling "hunted like animals" as the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement actions in agricultural areas. Workers interviewed describe constant stress, lost income, and being forced into hiding due to raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The crackdown has alarmed advocates, especially after a presidential pledge to put farmers "in charge" of enforcement, which critics fear could lead to exploitative conditions. Workers express that they are essential to the food supply and economy, yet they are being demonized and living in constant fear.</p>

          <p>Scientists are undertaking a rescue mission in North Carolina's Hickory Nut Gorge to save the endangered Hickory Nut Gorge green salamander. The species, which lives only in this valley, had its habitat severely damaged by flooding and landslides from Hurricane Helene, pushing the tiny population of a few hundred individuals closer to extinction. Researchers are now carefully capturing a small number of the surviving salamanders to establish a captive breeding program at the North Carolina Zoo. This effort serves as a critical insurance policy to prevent the species from disappearing entirely.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while ICE raids are cruel, the U.S. economy's reliance on undocumented labor creates a "low wage/high welfare model" that is unsustainable and traps many immigrants in poverty.

Experts note that climate change is increasing the risk of intense rainfall and inland flooding.
