          <p>UnitedHealthcare, the largest private health insurer in the U.S., is under increasing scrutiny for its role in the convoluted U.S. health-care system, facing criticism from patients, providers, and lawmakers.

The company has faced multiple lawsuits and government investigations, including a criminal probe into possible Medicare fraud and fallout from a ransomware attack on Change Healthcare. UnitedHealth Group's business model centers on managing claims to limit payouts, leading to denials of services deemed medically unnecessary and frustrating patients. </p>

          <p>The Canadian province of Alberta is laying the groundwork for a referendum on whether to secede from Canada, driven by grievances over the federal system's perceived limitations on its oil and gas resources. Premier Danielle Smith, while not explicitly advocating for secession, seeks to leverage the referendum to renegotiate Alberta's relationship with Ottawa and unshackle the province's energy industry. The movement gains momentum amidst dissatisfaction with federal climate policies and a desire for greater autonomy. The referendum push faces opposition from Indigenous groups and presents a challenge for Prime Minister Mark Carney as he navigates Canada's relationship with the United States.</p>

          <p>More than 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected by UN teams inside the Gaza Strip, three days after Israel eased an 11-week-long blockade. The aid included flour, baby food, and medical equipment, and was picked up from the Kerem Shalom crossing and taken to warehouses for distribution. The UN stated that the delays were due to insecurity along the access route, and that the amount of aid was "nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza".

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed fury after a newly built 5,000-ton-class destroyer was damaged during a launching event at the port of Chongjin. Kim Jong Un blamed military officials and shipyard operators for the "serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism." He called for a Workers' Party meeting to address the "irresponsible errors." Despite the setback, North Korea disclosed the incident to show its commitment to modernizing its navy.</p>

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a sharp decline after House Republicans passed a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits.

First Solar, however, fell just 1% as the bill left the manufacturing tax credit relatively unscathed.</p>
