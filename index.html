          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new initiative called "Organizing Summer" to drive voter engagement and rebuild support following the party's 2024 election losses. The program will focus on registering voters and connecting with them through non-traditional channels like community groups and social media. With an initial six-figure investment, the effort aims to deploy thousands of volunteers in key districts and states ahead of the 2025 and 2026 elections. This move is also seen as an attempt to unify the party after recent internal disputes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is moving towards a final vote on President Trump's extensive tax and immigration bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," aiming to pass it before a July 4 deadline. The process has been marked by partisan debate and significant Republican dissent, with a key procedural vote passing by a narrow 51-49 margin. GOP Senator Thom Tillis notably opposed the bill over its Medicaid provisions, announcing his retirement after facing pressure from the president. If the bill passes the Senate, it must return to the House for approval of the changes, where its passage remains uncertain.</p>

While most amendments are not expected to pass, the process highlights divisions within the Republican party and serves as a tool for future political messaging.

Concurrently, rising expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts have also contributed to the currency's weakness, while assets like the euro and gold have seen significant gains.

From the first week of May to the first week of June, detentions of individuals facing only civil immigration charges rose by over 250%. This shift coincides with a White House push to increase daily arrests. While the Trump administration has stated its focus is on deporting criminals, the data shows that only about 8% of all detainees since January 20 had been convicted of violent crimes, with traffic offenses being the most common violation.</p>

The conflict reached a new peak when Canada planned to implement its DST, prompting Trump to suspend trade talks.

          <h2>Trump Suggests "Temporary Pass" from Immigration Enforcement for Agricultural and Hospitality Industries</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated his administration is developing a plan to grant a "temporary pass" to farmers and hospitality businesses to mitigate the impact of increased immigration enforcement. Acknowledging that raids can remove long-term workers who are difficult to replace, Trump stated a need to protect these industries while still removing criminals from the country. This potential policy would allow certain workers to remain, possibly by paying taxes, giving employers like farmers more control over their workforce. The comments signal a potential shift in enforcement priorities for key sectors of the economy.</p>

          <p>The number of working-age adults in England and Wales claiming disability or incapacity benefits has risen to 4 million, up from 3 million in 2019. This significant increase has been largely driven by a rise in claims citing mental health conditions. Researchers suggest several contributing factors, including the rising state pension age keeping more people in the working-age category for longer, and potentially greater public awareness of benefit eligibility. The UK government has announced scaled-back reforms to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) system, which will now only apply to new claimants.</p>

The decision to suspend the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data, which was set for June 30, had caused alarm among experts at NOAA and NASA. A new notice from NOAA indicates the delay was requested by NASA and that the original plan was intended to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk. The move provides a temporary reprieve for forecasters who warned the cut could set their work back by decades.</p>
