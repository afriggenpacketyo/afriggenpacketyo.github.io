          <p>Marcus Rashford believes Manchester United would be prepared to sell him for Â£40m, but his high salary may pose a challenge for potential buyers. While he had a significant impact on Villa's run to the Champions League quarter-finals, there have been no negotiations over a permanent transfer. The Rashford camp do not believe current United head coach Ruben Amorim wants to restore the player to his squad, while minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously spoken about his frustration at some of the team's highest earners not being on the pitch.

          <h2>Humans on Pace to Slaughter 6 Trillion Animals Annually by 2033</h2>

          <p>A new report forecasts that humanity is on track to farm and kill nearly 6 trillion animals annually by 2033, primarily driven by the increasing consumption of shrimp, fish, and insects. The article explores the ethical implications of farming these smaller animals, particularly regarding their potential for sentience and the limited welfare standards they receive. It questions whether there should be a moral consideration for invertebrates like shrimp and insects, despite their unfamiliarity and lack of charisma. This article reports on animal welfare and is not investment advice.</p>
