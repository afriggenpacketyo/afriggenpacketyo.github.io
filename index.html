          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a significant new fee for H-1B visas, arguing it will incentivize companies to hire American workers. Economists present a complex outlook, suggesting that while some domestic tech workers might see short-term job gains, the policy could hinder long-term economic growth. Research indicates that H-1B workers often create additional jobs and boost firm productivity, leading some experts to warn the restrictions could ultimately harm the job prospects for the Americans the policy aims to help. The White House maintains the fee is necessary to protect U.S. workers from being replaced by cheaper foreign labor.</p>

          <p>Americans traveling to 29 European countries in the Schengen Area will soon be required to provide biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial scan, under the new Entry/Exit System. The system, which will gradually roll out starting in October, replaces traditional passport stamps with a digital record of entry and exit dates. EU officials state the changes are designed to enhance security and better track visa overstays. Travelers who refuse to provide the required biometric information will be denied entry into the region.</p>

          <p>With a government funding deadline fast approaching, President Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders, escalating the risk of a shutdown. The White House is insisting on a clean funding extension, while Democrats are pushing for additional provisions related to healthcare subsidies and other programs. The House has already passed a Republican-backed bill and is now in a district work period, leaving the Senate as the primary arena for negotiation. The cancellation of talks suggests both sides may be more focused on winning political arguments than averting the economic disruption of a government closure.</p>

          <p>A sniper opened fire on a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, killing two detainees and critically wounding a third before taking his own life. The gunman, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, fired from a nearby rooftop, with authorities stating the attack was ideologically motivated. The FBI is investigating the shooting as an act of targeted violence, noting that an unspent shell casing engraved with "ANTI ICE" was recovered. The incident has intensified the national debate over immigration enforcement, with officials condemning the violence and calling for a de-escalation of political rhetoric surrounding the agency.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media Group, a major owner of ABC affiliate stations, is continuing to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the show's return to the air. The broadcaster stated it is evaluating the program's status to ensure it "reflects and respects the diverse interests of the communities we serve." This decision follows Kimmel's temporary suspension by parent company Disney after he made comments linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to President Trump's MAGA movement. The ongoing preemption by Nexstar and Sinclair means the late-night show remains unavailable in approximately 20% of the country.</p>

          <p>A joint U.S.-Mexican operation led to the capture of Martha Alicia Mendez Aguilar, a Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) leader known as "La Diabla." She is accused of running a horrific infant trafficking ring where pregnant women were lured to remote locations, killed during forced C-sections, and their newborns sold in the U.S. The operation was guided by intelligence from the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, which tracked Aguilar's activities. This capture highlights the application of counterterrorism tools against cartels, which the U.S. has increasingly designated as foreign terrorist organizations due to their extreme violence and trafficking operations.</p>

          <p>This article expresses concern over the Trump administration's increasing influence on mass media and technology platforms, citing recent events as evidence of a concerning trend. The analysis points to the pressure campaign against "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" and a potential deal for TikTok's U.S. operations to be sold to a consortium led by Trump allies like Larry Ellison. The author argues that while foreign ownership of platforms like TikTok poses surveillance risks, the greater danger may come from the domestic government potentially using these powerful data-gathering tools to profile and target political opponents. The piece suggests a pattern of state-level pressure on free speech and media.</p>

Altman acknowledges the worries but insists the buildout is necessary to meet the tenfold increase in ChatGPT usage and the "near infinite demand" for AI compute.

          <p>In response to a string of deaths and injuries, the New York City Police Department is now using drones to detect and prevent "subway surfing." The dangerous activity, which involves riding on top of moving trains, has led to 16 deaths in the city over the past three years. Drones canvass train routes, and if someone is spotted, a team is dispatched to intercept the train at the next station and remove the individual. The program was initiated after a rise in incidents, many of which are filmed and shared on social media platforms, prompting lawsuits against tech companies for their role in popularizing the trend.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to remove the $25,000 minimum equity rule for "pattern day traders," a change that would make active trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. The current rule, established during the dot-com bubble, requires traders who execute four or more day trades in five days to maintain a $25,000 balance. The new proposal, which awaits SEC approval, would replace this with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken, reflecting modern market technology and access. The change could increase trading volume, particularly in options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to Rolex questioning whether the company's decision to host President Donald Trump in its corporate box at the U.S. Open was an attempt to gain influence over tariff policy. The inquiry comes after the Trump administration imposed a 39% tariff on Swiss exports, a rate significantly higher than that for other European nations. In her letter, Warren expressed concern that Rolex might be trying to "curry favor" to secure special exemptions, citing the president's record of giving preferential treatment to supportive CEOs. The White House dismissed the senator's concerns as "asinine conspiracy theories."</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $250,000 mortgage, this new rate results in a monthly principal and interest payment of about $1,520. This is a reduction of roughly $150 per month compared to the payments at the beginning of the year, when rates were above 7%. Over the full 30-year term of the loan, this lower rate translates to a total interest savings of approximately $54,000 for the borrower. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the conservative reaction to the death of activist Charlie Kirk, arguing that many on the right view it as a pivotal, systemic event akin to the left's "George Floyd moment." According to the analysis, conservatives saw Kirk not just as a commentator but as an indispensable organizer who advocated for competing within democratic systems. His killing is therefore interpreted by his allies as proof that the left will not tolerate even peaceful political opposition, fueling a desire to seize cultural and institutional power. This perspective helps explain the vehement and sometimes authoritarian responses from prominent conservative figures following his death.</p>

The installation, titled "Best Friends Forever," was placed by an activist group called The Secret Handshake to highlight the relationship between the two men. The group accuses the Trump administration of illegally removing the artwork as a form of censorship, while the Department of the Interior stated it was not compliant with the permit.

          <p>Doctors are expressing concern and reassuring patients after President Trump claimed that taking Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy leads to a "very increased risk" of autism. Medical experts emphasize that existing research does not show a conclusive causal link, and major studies have found no association. They worry the president's remarks could create unnecessary fear and guilt among parents and cause pregnant women to avoid one of the only pain and fever relievers considered safe for them. Untreated high fevers during pregnancy can pose serious health risks to both the mother and fetus, making the advice to "tough it out" potentially dangerous.</p>

          <p>A family has shared that their son, who was diagnosed with nonverbal autism, began speaking just days after starting treatment with leucovorin, a generic drug typically used to manage chemotherapy side effects. Researchers are studying the drug based on a theory that some children with autism have a condition that blocks the transport of folate (vitamin B9) to the brain, which leucovorin can bypass. While early trials have shown positive effects on speech for some children, more research is needed for FDA approval for this use. The drug's low cost presents a challenge, as there is little financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to fund large-scale trials.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals that infections from carbapenem-resistant bacteria, known as "nightmare bacteria," have increased by 70% in the United States. The surge is primarily driven by a strain containing the NDM gene, which is resistant to most antibiotics and requires expensive, intravenous treatment. Researchers suggest the increase may be linked to a surge in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise of these highly resistant bacteria poses a significant public health threat, potentially making common infections much more difficult and dangerous to treat.</p>
