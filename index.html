          <p>Netflix's shares dropped significantly after the company reported a third-quarter earnings miss, primarily due to an unforeseen expense related to an ongoing tax dispute with Brazilian authorities. Despite this, revenue for the quarter rose 17%, aligning with analyst expectations, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and increased ad revenue. The streaming giant adjusted its full-year operating margin forecast to 29% from 30% because of this issue, though it does not anticipate a material impact on future results.

          <p>Beyond Meat experienced its best day ever, with shares skyrocketing more than 146% following its addition to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF and a new distribution agreement with Walmart. This remarkable rally, which saw the stock climb from 65 cents to around $2 per share, appears to have triggered a short squeeze. The plant-based food company has struggled for years, becoming a penny stock after its 2019 IPO. The article suggests this surge could also indicate a frothy market where investors are increasingly piling into speculative names despite elevated valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs, including the American Federation of Teachers, launched the 'Take Back Tesla' campaign, urging shareholders to vote against CEO Elon Musk's proposed nearly $1 trillion stock pay package. The group deems the package 'outrageous,' citing Musk's political activities and other ventures as distractions from his Tesla leadership. This initiative comes ahead of Tesla's annual meeting and amid an appeal by Musk to reinstate his rescinded 2018 pay package, which a Delaware court ruled was improperly granted. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, overseeing a $300 billion pension fund, also opposes the plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors' stock surged over 15% after the automaker surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates and increased its 2025 financial guidance. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 on $48.59 billion in revenue, outperforming expectations. CEO Mary Barra attributed the strong performance to team efforts and a compelling vehicle portfolio, expressing confidence in the company's trajectory. Despite a 57% drop in net income due to EV-related special charges and slower-than-expected EV profitability, GM remains committed to electric vehicles and aims to improve North American profit margins.

          <p>A new study by Schroders found that 90% of working Americans intend to ignore the common financial advice of waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, despite understanding that delaying offers significantly higher monthly payments. Many workers face retirement savings shortfalls and require immediate income, while others express concerns about the program's long-term solvency. Although Social Security faces potential insolvency by 2034, benefits would likely be reduced, not halted. The article highlights the financial realities and anxieties driving these claiming decisions, underscoring a disconnect between expert recommendations and individual needs.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a motion to dissolve a court order that prevents the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. This follows a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision that overturned a previous temporary restraining order, finding the administration likely to succeed in its challenge. The legal battle centers on the President's authority to federalize the National Guard to protect federal property amid ongoing protests, despite objections from local officials. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield criticized the ruling, emphasizing Portland's peaceful state and the military's lack of place in its streets. </p>

          <h2>Economists Warn Trump Administration Tariffs Are Increasing Consumer Prices and Business Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists report that Trump administration tariffs are significantly contributing to inflation, particularly for imported goods like furniture, car parts, and electronics. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that companies passed 35% of tariff costs onto consumers from May through July, with Goldman Sachs predicting this could rise to 55%. These tariffs added 0.5 percentage points to the headline Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) rate between June and August. The article highlights that despite predictions of higher price hikes, businesses are still adjusting, and the full impact on consumers is expected to evolve over coming months.

          <p>Demolition has commenced on a portion of the White House's East Wing to make way for President Trump's planned ballroom addition, a project he asserts will not interfere with the existing structure. Trump stated the $250 million project, intended to accommodate nearly 1,000 guests, is entirely funded by private contributions from business and tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. This initiative fulfills a long-held presidential dream of a grand White House ballroom for state visits and large events.

          <p>The upcoming September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is facing skepticism from financial markets due to the ongoing government shutdown, which impacts the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) data collection. Investors express concern about the cleanliness and completeness of the data, especially after the BLS faced scrutiny and staffing cuts earlier this year. The CPI report's release is critical for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, making it one of the few economic data points available during the shutdown.

          <p>A recent Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage, which knocked major global sites offline, has sparked renewed debate over the world's over-dependence on a few dominant U.S. tech firms for cloud computing. AWS and Microsoft Azure collectively control a significant portion of the cloud market, leading to 'nested dependency' where even small outages create widespread disruptions. Experts acknowledge the economic benefits of these hyperscalers but warn of concentrated risk and the prohibitive cost of diversifying providers. The article highlights calls for government intervention to mandate data resilience standards and promote competition in the cloud market. </p>

Despite government employment statistics, this research highlights a significant gap in job quality, with many workers reporting unpredictable schedules and financial struggles. The article emphasizes that fair pay alone is insufficient, as workers also value safety, respect, and influence over decisions like technology adoption.

          <p>The priceless jewels stolen from the Louvre museum in a recent heist were not privately insured, as French law prohibits national museums from insuring their collections, except when loaned or moved. This means neither the Louvre nor the French government will receive private insurance payouts for the estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) worth of stolen items. The state itself bears responsibility for its cultural property, according to officials. The article underscores the unique legal framework governing national treasures and raises questions about the financial implications of such a high-profile theft. </p>

          <p>A Colombian court acquitted former President Alvaro Uribe of bribery in criminal proceedings, overturning his August conviction for witness tampering and procedural fraud. The Bogota High Court ruled that the charges were not proven 'beyond reasonable doubt,' citing 'methodological errors' and 'biased evaluation of evidence' in the initial sentence. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010 and was the first former Colombian president convicted of criminal charges, has consistently maintained his innocence, alleging political persecution.
