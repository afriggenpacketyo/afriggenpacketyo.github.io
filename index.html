          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced strong revenue growth of 420% in its first earnings report since its IPO, surpassing analyst expectations with $981.6 million in revenue compared to the anticipated $853 million. Despite a widened net loss due to stock-based compensation, the company's revenue backlog increased by 63%. CEO Mike Intrator acknowledged uncertainties in global trade policy but highlighted accelerating customer demand, especially noting a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion, which complements OpenAI's reliance on Microsoft. CoreWeave's growth hinges on securing sufficient power for its data centers, with the company adding 300 megawatts of contracted power during the quarter, bringing its total to 1.3 gigawatts.</p>

          <p>A recent investigation by Consumer Reports, The Guardian, and FERN uncovered widespread price tag errors at Kroger stores, leading to customers being overcharged for items marked on sale. Expired discount tags were found on various products, resulting in an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. While Kroger disputes the findings, stating the errors represent a small fraction of total transactions, the investigation found issues at over half of the 26 locations examined. This comes amid ongoing complaints from customers and multiple class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations, raising concerns about the accuracy of advertised prices and potential understaffing issues. Kroger claims to be addressing these issues by empowering employees to correct price discrepancies on the spot.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old Michigan man, Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said, has been arrested for allegedly planning a mass shooting at a U.S. military base in Warren, Michigan, on behalf of ISIS.

He allegedly provided ammunition and magazines, surveilled the base with a drone, and instructed the officers on how to enter the facility and which building to target. Said was arrested near the base on the scheduled day of the attack and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.</p>

The most serious allegation involved a 2018 incident where Ventura claims Combs sexually assaulted her in her living room, an act she says left her crying and feeling violated.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced a delay in the timeline for water utilities to comply with reducing certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water, while also reconsidering the allowable levels for others. The compliance deadline for PFOA and PFOS, two common PFAS chemicals, is extended to 2031, and the limits for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS are being rescinded and reconsidered. While EPA administrator Lee Zeldin claims this could lead to stricter limits, some environmental advocates are skeptical, suggesting it's about cost relief for water systems. The move has been praised by groups representing water utilities but raises concerns among health advocates about delaying the removal of these potentially harmful chemicals from drinking water.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has moved the Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) staff from the CIA to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in an effort to streamline operations and ensure a continuity of workforce. The PDB, a daily summary of high-level national security information for the president, has always been coordinated and delivered by the ODNI with contributions from the CIA. This move follows Gabbard's earlier transfer of the National Intelligence Council from the CIA to ODNI, both aimed at providing the President with more timely and actionable intelligence.

          <p>Uber is launching a new "Route Share" feature, designed to resemble public transportation, offering commuters a lower-cost alternative by operating Uber shuttles along busy routes with pickups every 20 minutes. The service, available during weekday commuting hours, allows passengers to share rides with up to two other people at half the cost of an UberX. Uber is also introducing "Price Lock," a feature that lets customers choose a fixed price for a specific route for $2.99 per month, potentially saving up to $50 a month. This caters to riders in densely populated areas and expands on existing shared car services, aiming to make Uber more accessible for regular commuters without access to a car or transit stops.</p>

The proposed law would create an above-the-line deduction for tips received by individuals in occupations that traditionally receive tips, phasing out for those making over $160,000 a year and expiring after 2028. The bill's provisions are expected to change as it moves through the legislative process, with potential restrictions such as a maximum deduction of $25,000.

          <p>A proposal to use federal tax dollars to help families pay for private school tuition is advancing, with Republicans including a $20 billion federal school voucher program in a reconciliation bill. This program would provide tax credits to individuals who donate to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs), which would then distribute scholarships for private school expenses. Critics argue that vouchers weaken public education and may not protect students with disabilities, as private schools are not bound by the same federal disability laws. Early results from voucher programs show that much of the money has gone to students already enrolled in private schools.</p>

          <p>A recent resentencing has made Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, eligible for parole for the first time in 35 years. This eligibility is one of three potential avenues for their release, including a clemency application with Governor Gavin Newsom and a pending petition for a new trial based on new evidence of sexual abuse by their father. The brothers have long claimed they committed the murders out of fear of their parents, and have expressed remorse for their actions. The Los Angeles County District Attorney, Nathan Hochman, has voiced his opposition to their release.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current interest rate environment, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a significantly cheaper borrowing option compared to personal loans. The average HELOC rate is 7.99%, while the average personal loan rate is 12.47%. HELOCs are secured by the borrower's home, resulting in lower interest rates, and they often have variable interest rates that are likely to decrease further due to anticipated rate cuts. Borrowers can save hundreds of dollars per month by choosing a HELOC over a personal loan, making it a more financially advantageous option for those who can manage their payments responsibly.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the US Congress are seeking to prevent states from introducing or enforcing laws that regulate artificial intelligence (AI) and automated decision-making systems for a decade. The provision in a proposed budgetary bill would broadly define AI systems, encompassing everything from facial recognition to generative AI, and would apply to systems used in hiring, housing, and public benefits decisions. Critics argue this move would shield large corporations from accountability, undermining state efforts to establish safeguards around these systems.

Einhorn also has positions on long-duration inflation swaps, betting that prices will rise faster than the market anticipates.

          <p>President Trump is reviving a plan to set drug price caps based on amounts paid in other high-income countries, a concept previously considered but ultimately rejected by Senate Democrats and the Biden administration. Trump's executive order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to develop regulations imposing these price restrictions if drugmakers don't voluntarily lower U.S. prices. While Democrats had initially explored a similar approach, concerns over innovation and support from moderate senators led them to adopt a different formula for capping drug prices. Trump officials argue they have the authority to pursue these wider actions to lower drug prices, despite legal challenges.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Capital One, alleging the bank cheated customers out of millions of dollars in interest payments by failing to inform them about a higher-yield savings account.

This action mirrors a similar lawsuit by the CFPB, which was dropped under the Trump administration.
