          <p>At least 95 people have died, including 27 children, after catastrophic flash floods struck Texas Hill Country. The Guadalupe River rose to unprecedented levels, devastating communities and a summer camp, Camp Mystic, which suffered numerous fatalities among its campers and staff. Dozens of people remain missing, prompting a massive, ongoing search and rescue operation involving state and federal agencies. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the area, and officials are grappling with the scale of the tragedy, which was caused by unexpected and intense rainfall.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 16:33:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After five consecutive weeks of decline, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage has fallen to 6.75%, providing some relief for prospective homebuyers. This downward trend occurred despite the Federal Reserve holding its key interest rate steady, highlighting the influence of other factors like the 10-year Treasury yield. However, whether this decline will continue through July is uncertain and may depend on upcoming inflation data and future signals from the Fed. Analysts suggest that lenders might begin lowering their rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose significant tariffs on goods from seven countries, set to take effect on August 1. Japan and South Korea will face 25% tariffs, while duties will be as high as 40% for nations like Myanmar and Laos. The move follows a 90-day freeze on previously announced "reciprocal" tariffs, which is now being extended to the new August deadline. In letters to foreign leaders, President Trump warned that any retaliatory tariffs would be added to the new U.S. rates, framing the policy as a necessary step to ensure fair trade.

          <p>For individuals facing overwhelming debt, wage garnishment can be a stressful reality that allows creditors to take money directly from a paycheck after obtaining a court judgment. The duration of garnishment typically lasts until the entire debt, including interest and fees, is fully paid off, which can take years. Federal law limits the amount that can be taken to 25% of disposable income, but rules differ for debts like student loans or taxes. Options to stop or reduce garnishment include challenging it in court, negotiating with the creditor, or filing for bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>In a satirical piece, The Atlantic critiques the media's breathless reporting on so-called Gen Z workplace trends by humorously rebranding everyday activities with buzzword-laden names. The article follows a fictional Gen Z worker through a typical day, describing sleep as a "Microdeath," commuting without internet as a "Tiny Detox," and taking a lunch break as a "Microvacation." The piece playfully mocks the alarmist tone often used to describe mundane behaviors like talking to colleagues ("Voice Quitting") or breathing ("Lung Bathe"). It ultimately satirizes the way normal work-life phenomena are often framed as dramatic, new generational trends.</p>

          <p>At least 10 people have been killed and over 560 arrested during widespread anti-government protests in Kenya, according to human rights and police reports. The demonstrations, which commemorated the historic "Saba Saba" pro-democracy protests, saw citizens demanding President William Ruto's resignation over the high cost of living, alleged corruption, and police brutality. Authorities blocked roads into the capital, Nairobi, to prevent rallies, leading to clashes where police used tear gas against protesters who lit bonfires and threw stones. Most businesses in the capital remained closed amid the unrest.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated in the coming months, homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) are advised to take preparatory steps now. Financial experts suggest prospective borrowers should check their credit reports, work on improving their credit scores, and compare offers from multiple lenders to establish a baseline. It is also crucial to calculate potential repayment costs under various interest rate scenarios, as HELOCs have variable rates. Taking these actions can better position homeowners to secure favorable terms when rates eventually drop. (not investment advice)</p>

The weaker dollar benefits U.S. exporters but has fueled discussion about the potential end of its global dominance. In response to the uncertainty, some central banks are increasing their gold reserves as an alternative, though some analysts believe fears of the dollar's decline are overstated.
