          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and staunch ally of President Trump, to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in a 50-45 vote. Pirro, who previously served as a judge and prosecutor, had been in the role on an acting basis since May. Her confirmation to this powerful prosecutorial post follows the collapse of Trump's previous nominee, Ed Martin, who faced opposition due to his advocacy for "Stop the Steal" and his presence at the Capitol on January 6th. Pirro's nomination saw comparatively little resistance from Democrats.</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Davis recently shared that during her time on the 1990s drama "Melrose Place," a specific co-star consistently gave her the cold shoulder, refusing to even exchange morning greetings. While she did not name the individual, Davis noted the set was highly competitive, and this particular cast member, with whom she had no scenes, is now nice to her years later. This negative experience informed her own behavior on the set of "Sex and the City," where she made a point of being a "welcoming committee" for new actors to prevent them from feeling the same sense of intimidation she once did.</p>

The officials are accused of inflating the prices of state contracts for military drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, a critical issue for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union. The arrests follow the recent restoration of independence to the country's anti-corruption bodies after a public backlash against a government bill that sought to limit their power.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has evolved from a niche cypherpunk project into a foundational layer for the global financial system, now valued at over $420 billion. Initially a bare-bones network, it now underpins trillions in payments via stablecoins and is being integrated by major institutions like BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, and Robinhood for tokenized assets and funds. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledged the platform's staggering growth beyond initial expectations, while also warning of the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption accelerates. Experts note that institutions value Ethereum for its stability, dependability, and programmability, solidifying its role as the plumbing for a new generation of financial products.

          <p>President Trump has ordered the dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the release of a July jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected hiring and significant downward revisions for previous months. Trump criticized the numbers as inaccurate and politically manipulated, a claim made without evidence. The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and some lawmakers, who warn that it threatens the integrity and independence of federal economic data collection. Experts argue that politicizing the BLS could shake financial markets that rely on unbiased information and sets a dangerous precedent for government statistical agencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration enforcement tactics in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's finding that agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over "roving" raids conducted by the Trump administration that led to protests and fear within the region's Latino community. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that such factors do not constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop under the 4th Amendment. The administration criticized the decision, stating that it undermines their efforts to remove criminals and that enforcement is based on illegal status, not race.</p>

The new entity cannot field candidates until it is officially registered with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules on party names.

Scientists warn that thawing permafrost, the "glue" holding mountains together, is making such events more frequent and unpredictable, forcing costly protection measures and evacuations in other villages like Brienz and Kandersteg. The disaster has sparked a debate in Switzerland over the immense cost of rebuilding and protecting these vulnerable areas, with some questioning whether relocation should be considered.

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, died in 1943 during its voyage from Australia to the UK, with popular legend blaming the trauma of a nearby Nazi U-boat attack. However, recent archival research by university students and museum staff has revealed a more likely cause. By analyzing the platypus attendant's logbook, researchers found that the water and air temperatures on the ship climbed well above the safe threshold for the species as it crossed the equator, suggesting the animal essentially died from heat stress rather than shell-shock.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who use social media to advertise or promote illegal Channel crossings. The proposed law, part of a broader bill, could lead to up to five years in prison for creating online material that facilitates breaches of UK immigration law, such as advertising fake passports or illegal work. Home Office analysis suggests around 80% of migrants arriving by small boat used social media to contact agents. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the measure is aimed at disrupting the business model of criminal gangs who sell the "false promise of a safe journey."</p>

          <p>Decades after David Berkowitz's reign of terror, survivors of his attacks continue to live with the devastating consequences. Robert Violante, who was blinded in the final "Son of Sam" shooting which killed his date Stacy Moskowitz, had just landed a modeling job and was full of hope before the attack shattered his life. Carl Denaro, shot months earlier, had his military career derailed and lived for years with the notoriety of being a victim. Both men expressed relief at Berkowitz's capture but remain forever marked by the random violence that altered their futures in an instant.</p>

          <p>The Ottawa County Sheriff's new patrol boat, which had its maiden voyage just two months ago, sank at its dock in a Port Clinton marina during a severe storm. Officials believe a seiche, a rapid, storm-driven rise in water level, may have compromised the boat's dive doors and pulled it under. The vessel, which cost $360,000 and was funded by a Department of Homeland Security grant, was submerged for about an hour before crews were able to pump it out and refloat it. While the engines are reportedly okay, the boat's electronics and interior sustained significant damage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global TikTok trend involving fluffy Labubu dolls has been exploited by criminals producing dangerous counterfeit versions, according to UK authorities. Trading Standards officers recently seized thousands of fake dolls from a London warehouse that were found to be a choking hazard, with parts like eyes and feet easily detaching. The popularity of the authentic dolls from parent company Pop Mart has led to scalpers bulk-buying them for resale, creating a market for cheap but unsafe knock-offs. Authorities warn that these fakes are often made with hazardous materials and are urging consumers to be cautious of "too good to be true" pricing.</p>

          <p>A series of protests held by anti-migrant groups outside hotels used to house asylum seekers in England resulted in clashes with counter-demonstrators and fifteen arrests. The confrontations occurred in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, with police intervening to manage the crowds. The protests come as the Home Office reports a decrease in the number of hotels being used for this purpose and plans to phase them out entirely by 2029. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper also announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process to "restore order and control" to the system amid the ongoing demonstrations.</p>
