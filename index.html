          <p>Federal prosecutors delivered their closing arguments in the sex trafficking trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, portraying him as the leader of a criminal enterprise who used his fame and resources to facilitate and conceal abuse. Over seven weeks, the prosecution presented 34 witnesses, including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura Fine, to support charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. The defense, which did not call any witnesses, will present its closing arguments Friday, arguing that Combs' lifestyle does not equate to criminal activity.

In response, Iran has passed legislation to halt cooperation with the IAEA, raising international concerns about a new nuclear crisis as the full extent of the damage remains under assessment.</p>

          <p>Nike announced that new tariffs will add approximately $1 billion in costs during the current fiscal year, calling the duties a "new and meaningful" challenge. The company plans to fully offset this impact over time by adjusting its supply chain, increasing prices, and working with partners.

Despite these headwinds and a significant drop in quarterly profit due to its ongoing turnaround plan, the company's report beat Wall Street estimates, and its shares rose.

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images providing evidence of a previously undiscovered exoplanet.

Scientists used high-contrast imaging with a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare and reveal the faint planet. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly points to it being a new planetary discovery.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. and Israeli strikes, the exact state of Iran's nuclear facilities remains a subject of conflicting reports, ranging from President Trump's claim of "obliteration" to more measured assessments. Experts believe the deeply buried Fordo site was significantly damaged but perhaps not destroyed, while above-ground facilities at Natanz and Isfahan were likely leveled. However, a key uncertainty is the location of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, which may have been moved to undisclosed, protected locations before the attacks, leaving a significant potential for the program's continuation.</p>
