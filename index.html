        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a wide-ranging series of new tariffs on goods from dozens of countries, fulfilling a key campaign promise to reshape global trade. The levies vary by country, with significant rates applied to nations like India, Brazil, and manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia, while allies like the EU and Japan have negotiated lower rates. The White House aims to pressure trading partners and encourage domestic investment, particularly in technology, by imposing measures such as a potential 100% tariff on foreign-made computer chips. These actions are part of a broader strategy to create what the administration calls a more "reciprocal" global trading system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Climate experts have confirmed that July 2025 was the third-hottest July ever recorded worldwide, with an average surface air temperature 0.45°C above the 1991-2020 average. Although the streak of consecutive record-breaking hot months has ended, scientists emphasize that this does not signal a halt in climate change. The month still saw extreme weather events, including temperatures over 50°C in the Middle East and catastrophic floods in Asia, highlighting the ongoing effects of a warming planet. Experts from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service reiterated that these trends are primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels and will continue without rapid stabilization of greenhouse gases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Motor reported an 11% year-on-year drop in its June-quarter operating profit, directly attributing a significant portion of the loss to the impact of new U.S. tariffs. Despite beating profit estimates and seeing strong global sales, the automaker faced ¥450 billion in losses from the import taxes, prompting a downward revision of its full-year income forecast. The situation reflects a broader trend among Japanese carmakers, which have been forced to cut prices to maintain market share in the United States following the implementation of the 25% tariff on imported vehicles. A recent trade deal with Tokyo may eventually lower these tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Republic of Moldova is facing an "unprecedented" level of interference from Russia ahead of its upcoming parliamentary elections, according to President Maia Sandu. Moscow is allegedly employing a range of hybrid warfare tactics, including massive vote-buying schemes, paid protests, and a flood of disinformation and AI-generated fake news to destabilize the country. The goal is to sow chaos and install a pro-Russian government, thereby pulling Moldova back into Moscow's orbit and away from its path toward European integration. These efforts represent a critical test for Moldovan democracy as it navigates sustained neo-imperial aggression from the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>British athlete Jonathan Edwards is marking the 30th anniversary of his triple jump world record of 18.29 meters, set at the 1995 World Championships. While proud, Edwards expressed that the record's longevity might not be a positive sign for the health of athletics, suggesting the sport may not be attracting top talent due to lower financial rewards compared to other sports. He set the record with a groundbreaking double arm action technique, becoming the first person to legally jump beyond 18 meters. Despite advancements in sports science and footwear, no one has come closer than American Christian Taylor's 18.21m jump a decade ago.</p>

          <p>A potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine could happen soon, following what the White House described as "great progress" in talks. The diplomatic movement comes from discussions led by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow. While officials are cautious not to overstate the breakthrough, the developments suggest a possible shift in the nearly 200-day-long conflict. Key questions remain about Russia's willingness to agree to a ceasefire and whether President Putin would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but the talks signal a new phase of diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>The UK's Environment Agency (EA) is introducing enhanced checks on tyre exports after a BBC investigation revealed that millions of used tyres were being sent to illegal furnaces in India instead of being recycled. The EA acknowledged it is "highly likely" that UK tyres are being diverted to makeshift pyrolysis plants, which cause severe environmental damage and health risks. While campaigners and industry bodies welcomed the new checks, they expressed disappointment that the EA did not implement a full ban on whole-tyre exports, an approach they believe is necessary to close loopholes exploited by criminals and ensure environmentally sound disposal.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have identified a set of 37 young "de novo" genes, which are unique to humans and are not evolved from existing genes. These novel genes, which arise from previously non-functional DNA, are believed to play a crucial role in advanced human traits like higher cognitive abilities. However, the study, published in Cell Genomics, also found a dark side to these evolutionary developments. The expression of these same genes was found to be significantly increased in tumors, and deleting some of them suppressed cancer cell proliferation, suggesting they may act like "dormant bombs" in the human genome.</p>

A spokesperson for the minister stated that she complied with all legal requirements. A source close to Ali explained that the property had been on the market for sale and the tenants, who were offered a rolling contract, chose to leave, after which it was re-listed for rent when it failed to sell.</p>

President Trump's recent tariff increase on India is a direct response to its continued energy trade with Russia, which has provided India with substantial cost savings since 2022. Experts warn that forcing Russia's five million barrels per day off the market could cause a dramatic spike in global oil prices and stoke inflation, reminiscent of the market shocks in 2022. While China may have more leverage to resist U.S. pressure, India faces a difficult choice between energy security and avoiding severe secondary sanctions. (not investment advice)</p>

The robust export performance has provided strong support for the Chinese economy so far this year, though some analysts caution this may be partly due to businesses front-loading shipments ahead of a potential U.S. tariff deadline.

The Highway Loss Data Institute found that powerful, expensive vehicles and pickup trucks dominate the list of the 20 most-stolen cars. The Camaro's vulnerability is reportedly linked to its on-board data port, which thieves can exploit to steal the vehicle easily. In contrast, electric vehicles are among the least stolen, likely because they are often charged in secure garages and their connected nature makes them a high-risk target for thieves.</p>

          <p>In a major discovery, researchers have found that the metal lithium, known for treating mood disorders, is naturally present in the body and essential for normal cell function, particularly in the brain. A study in the journal Nature revealed that depleting lithium in mice accelerated brain aging and the buildup of plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, maintaining normal lithium levels protected against these changes. The research suggests that beta-amyloid plaques may deplete available lithium in the brain, creating a vicious cycle. This finding could pave the way for new diagnostic tests and low-dose lithium treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

          <p>Louisiana officials have scrapped a major $3 billion coastal restoration project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, which was designed to rebuild the state's rapidly disappearing wetlands. The project aimed to use the Mississippi River's own sediment to naturally create 17,000 acres of new land over 30 years, providing a critical buffer against hurricanes. However, it faced strong opposition from the local fishing industry, which feared the diversion of fresh water would harm their fisheries and livelihoods. Despite scientists arguing it was the best long-term solution, the state, under Governor Jeff Landry, canceled the project, leaving the future of Louisiana's coastal protection uncertain.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed its Dark Eagle long-range hypersonic missile system to Australia for the first time, a move widely seen as a demonstration of military capability aimed at China. The land-based weapon, which can travel at over five times the speed of sound and strike targets more than 2,700km away, was transported by the Hawaii-based 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force. An army commander called the deployment a "major milestone" that demonstrates the ability to rapidly project advanced capabilities in support of allies. Analysts interpret the action as a "flexing of military muscle" and a clear signal of strengthening U.S.-Australia defense cooperation in the region.</p>

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given China two weeks to provide an explanation for blacked-out sections in its planning documents for a new "mega-embassy" in London. The proposed embassy, located near the city's financial district, has raised concerns about potential espionage and security risks for local residents. The government is also seeking information about a new "hard perimeter" requested by the Home Office. The move comes as the Labour government attempts to re-engage with Beijing, with a final planning decision on the controversial and previously rejected application expected by early September.</p>

          <h2>Climate Change Likely Intensified Deadly Monsoon Rains in Pakistan, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 21:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study from the World Weather Attribution group concludes that climate change likely made Pakistan's recent monsoon rains significantly heavier, exacerbating deadly floods. The research found that rainfall was approximately 10% to 15% more intense due to global warming, as a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. Since late June, the severe weather has caused at least 300 deaths, with many victims killed by collapsing buildings in flood-prone urban settlements. The report highlights Pakistan's vulnerability, noting that rapid urbanization and inadequate housing compound the dangers of extreme weather events, which have battered the entire South Asia region this season.</p>

          <h2>Inner London Councils to Face Major Funding Cuts Under Government's Proposed Rebalance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 21:12:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Councils in inner London are projected to be the most significant losers under a government plan to overhaul local authority funding, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The report finds that some London boroughs could see their funding fall by up to 12% after accounting for inflation. The new system, set to be phased in from 2026, aims to redirect funds to more deprived areas and those with lower council tax bases, benefiting many urban areas outside the capital. The IFS predicts the changes will redistribute around £2.1 billion in annual funding, creating a mix of winners and losers across England. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines experienced a major technology disruption that led to the grounding of hundreds of its flights across the United States for several hours. The issue, which the airline stated was not related to cybersecurity, affected a core system that manages flight information, leading to a nationwide ground stop at its major hubs. The outage caused significant delays and left passengers stranded on planes at gates and on tarmacs. While the airline resolved the underlying problem and began restoring normal operations, residual delays were expected to continue throughout the evening, highlighting the vulnerability of modern aviation to IT failures.</p>
