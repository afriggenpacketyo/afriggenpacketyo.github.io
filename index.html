          <p>Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's extensive sexual assault ring, accompanied by lawmakers, convened a news conference on Capitol Hill to demand further accountability and support for victims. This public event served to highlight the profound and lasting impact of Epstein's crimes, underscoring the ongoing legal and social ramifications of his actions. The gathering aimed to push for legislative action and judicial processes that ensure justice is served and similar abuses are prevented in the future, emphasizing the need for systemic change. Their collective voice continues to advocate for stronger protections and support for all victims of sexual assault, striving for a future where such networks of abuse cannot thrive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Phantom energy, also termed vampire energy, describes the electricity consumed by devices when they are plugged in but not actively in use. This silent drain can account for 5% to 10% of a home's total energy consumption, originating from common items like phone chargers, microwaves, and smart televisions with constant connectivity features. Experts highlight that reducing this wasted electricity, by simply unplugging devices or disabling smart features, offers a dual benefit: significant savings on individual utility bills and a collective contribution to reducing planet-warming emissions. Such small, consistent actions, when adopted widely, are crucial for fostering more sustainable energy practices and combating climate change.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 11:02:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>D.C. grand juries have recently rejected multiple Justice Department requests for indictments, a highly unusual occurrence that has raised significant concerns among former federal prosecutors. In one prominent case, a grand jury declined to indict Nathalie Rose Jones for allegedly posting an Instagram threat against President Trump, prompting questions about the department's approach. Critics, including former federal prosecutors, suggest this pattern reflects a breakdown in the Justice Department's credibility with D.C. jurors, rather than issues with individual prosecutors. This development underscores the vital constitutional function of grand juries as a critical check on prosecutorial discretion, even when dealing with allegations of federal crimes.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Yields Decline Amid Weak Jobs Data and Fed Independence Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 11:01:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields experienced a decline after the latest job openings data indicated a weaker-than-expected labor market, causing the 30-year yield to briefly surpass 5% before retreating. This market movement is attributed to a confluence of factors, including ongoing tariff uncertainty and significant concerns regarding the Federal Reserve's independence. Investors are particularly wary of President Trump's attempts to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook and a recent court ruling challenging the legality of many of his tariffs. The broader worry is that such political interventions could compromise the central bank's inflation-fighting credibility, potentially impacting long-term interest rates despite any immediate rate adjustments.

          <p>Actress Demi Moore has publicly defended Emma Heming Willis, wife of her ex-husband Bruce Willis, against criticism regarding her caregiving decisions for the actor, who is diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. Moore emphasized the lack of a roadmap for such a condition and praised Emma's dedication to self-care, which she argues is essential for any caregiver. Emma Heming Willis had faced backlash for moving Bruce into a separate home with professional caregivers, a decision she defended as necessary. Moore also shared her personal struggles with seeing Bruce's decline, stressing the importance of meeting individuals where they are without expectations of their past selves.</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its "Prime Invitee" program, which previously allowed Prime members to share free shipping benefits with individuals outside their immediate household, effective October 1. The company is now actively encouraging these non-household users to purchase their own Prime subscriptions, offering a promotional discounted one-year membership for $14.99. This strategic shift follows a Prime membership fee increase in 2022 and aims to convert more users into individual subscribers. The "Prime Invitee" program is being replaced by "Amazon Family," which, while offering a broader range of Prime benefits like Prime Video and Music, restricts sharing to only one other adult within the same household, thus tightening access to shared perks.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended his agency's handling of a recent measles outbreak in west Texas in a Wall Street Journal editorial, praising the CDC's swift and science-guided response. This self-congratulatory piece comes amid significant upheaval at the CDC, including the abrupt firing of its director and subsequent resignations of senior officials, reportedly due to clashes over vaccine policy. Critics, including former CDC experts, claim Kennedy has never been briefed on major health issues like measles by the agency's specialists. Over 1,000 current and former HHS employees have signed a letter demanding his resignation, accusing him of politicizing public health and endangering the nation.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive fact-check investigation by DW, utilizing data from the FBI and long-term academic studies, debunks President Trump's repeated claims that Democrat-run cities inherently experience higher crime rates. While it's true that most large U.S. cities are governed by Democrats and generally report higher crime rates than rural areas, the analysis strongly emphasizes that this correlation does not imply causation. Research from Harvard, MIT, and Boston University, spanning nearly three decades across 400 cities, found no detectable impact of a mayor's political affiliation on crime rates or policing strategies. The article concludes that crime trends are primarily influenced by a complex interplay of socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural factors, rather than the political party in charge.</p>

Hegseth confirmed the precision of the attack, underscoring the administration's aggressive new stance against drug smugglers and its unwavering commitment to securing the Western Hemisphere.

This article compares the affordability of these two options, noting that while HELOCs currently have slightly lower variable rates, home equity loans offer fixed rates and predictable payments. Experts suggest HELOCs become more appealing when rates are decreasing, while fixed-rate loans are preferred during rising rate environments. Borrowers must consider interest rates, repayment terms, and additional costs like closing fees, as both options are secured by the home and carry foreclosure risks if payments are missed.

          <p>A New York judge has ruled to admit critical DNA evidence in the ongoing Gilgo Beach serial killer case, which prosecutors assert links alleged killer Rex Heuermann to the murders of at least seven victims. This judicial decision is highly significant because the defense had challenged the evidence, obtained through whole genome sequencing—a new DNA technology never before utilized in a New York court. Prosecutors successfully argued that this advanced technology is derived from widely accepted scientific methods and will prove crucial in aiding the jury's determination of guilt. Heuermann, who was arrested in July 2023, has pleaded not guilty to the murders, making the inclusion of this forensic evidence a major development in this high-profile and long-unsolved case.</p>

Google can continue making payments to companies, like Apple, to preload its search engine, but cannot enforce exclusive contracts.

          <p>Senator Rand Paul criticized the Trump administration's decision to acquire a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel for $8.9 billion, labeling it "a step towards socialism." Paul, a conservative Republican, expressed concern that such government ownership undermines the free market principles that are a core part of the Republican Party's ideology. This investment is part of a broader trend where the Trump administration has taken an increasingly heavy hand in the private sector, including stakes in other tech and industrial companies. Paul argues against government involvement in the free market, even as some, like Senator Bernie Sanders, supported the Intel deal to ensure taxpayer returns on corporate welfare.

Falling home prices in some areas can reduce the qualified loan amount and make qualification harder, though government-backed HECMs protect against owing more than the home's value.
