          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump hinted at the possibility of regime change in Iran, raising concerns about further escalation. Israeli officials have also suggested the military actions could lead to an uprising against Iran's theocratic rulers, while Iran's Foreign Minister visited Russia seeking support. The U.S. Secretary of State acknowledged it would take time to confirm whether Iran's enriched uranium stockpile had been moved, but expressed doubt that it had occurred given the current circumstances. The U.S. State Department issued an alert for Americans traveling abroad to exercise increased caution due to potential anti-U.S. sentiment. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case involving a former Louisiana inmate, Damon Landor, who is suing prison officials for shaving his dreadlocks against his Rastafarian beliefs. Landor, a devout Rastafarian, maintained his Nazarite Vow for nearly 20 years until his incarceration, during which prison officials forcibly cut his hair despite his religious objections and a prior court decision protecting Rastafarians' hair. Landor argues that denying him the opportunity to seek damages violates his religious liberty, while Louisiana officials condemn his treatment but urge the Court to reject his appeal, noting the state has since amended its grooming policy. The justices will hear arguments in the next term, with a decision expected by the summer of 2026.</p>

Ishiba dismissed cutting the consumption tax, advocating for cash handouts to struggling households, and emphasized the need for "win-win" relations in tariff negotiations with the United States.

          <p>The United States launched a military assault on Iran, joining an Israeli-led offensive targeting Iran's nuclear program, with President Trump claiming a major victory. However, the success of the strikes remains uncertain, and the potential for escalation looms due to the complex history between the U.S. and Iran. The attack was motivated by a perception of Iranian vulnerability and a desire to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, although the strikes have sparked controversy and debate among Republicans. Iran's potential retaliation and the possibility of a wider war remain significant concerns, with various scenarios ranging from limited strikes to a full-scale conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump's political team launched a PAC aimed at ousting GOP Rep. Thomas Massie, signaling a new strategy to hold congressional Republicans accountable. Massie challenged Trump's constitutional authority to strike Iran, leading to a public feud and the formation of the "Kentucky PAC." Massie, known for his fiscal conservatism and willingness to disagree with Trump, co-sponsored a War Powers Resolution to prevent unauthorized military action against Iran. Trump criticized Massie's dissent, claiming "MAGA doesn't want him," and vowed to campaign against him in the Republican primary.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and Kaiser Permanente, plan to streamline the prior authorization process to expedite patient care. The initiative aims to create a standardized online submission system, reduce the number of claims requiring prior authorization, and provide real-time responses to requests. The changes, set to take effect in 2026 and 2027, are intended to alleviate administrative burdens on doctors and reduce delays for patients. AHIP estimates that these efforts could benefit over 250 million Americans, although the real impact will depend on the experiences of patients and physicians.</p>

The bill proposes $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage, potentially causing 16 million people to lose health insurance. This could result in a $50 billion increase in overall medical debt, with an estimated 5.4 million more people facing medical debt.

Telehealth abortions are becoming increasingly common, especially in states with large rural areas, facilitated by "shield laws" protecting providers who treat women in states with bans. Despite total abortion bans, some abortions still occur in emergency situations, though data suggests exceptions are narrowly applied. The future of shield laws is uncertain due to legal challenges, and access to mifepristone is also under assault, although advocates remain optimistic about maintaining access to abortion care.</p>

Paola Clouatre, a Mexican national, was detained during a green card meeting due to a deportation order from 2018, despite her marriage to a U.S. veteran. Immigration law experts say directives for strict immigrant enforcement have cast away practices of deference previously afforded to military families, with a federal agency referring military family members for deportation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>If you have unpaid tax debt, the IRS may take action to collect the money directly from your paycheck through wage garnishment. The IRS typically sends out a series of warning signs before garnishing wages, including multiple notices about unpaid taxes and a Final Notice of Intent to Levy. If you receive these notices, you can request a Collection Due Process hearing, set up a payment plan, or explore hardship options. Acting promptly and communicating with the IRS can help you avoid wage garnishment and find a solution to satisfy your tax obligations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home sales in the U.S. experienced their slowest May in 16 years, with existing home sales falling 0.7% compared to the same month last year, although sales were up slightly, 0.8%, from April. Affordability remains a key challenge, with median home prices significantly outpacing wage gains, while sales activity is running at 75% of pre-COVID levels. Despite a more than 20% increase in the number of homes for sale, prices have continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace, with the median single-family home price up 1.3% from May 2024. The Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cuts later this year could provide some relief to the market.</p>

The measures could reduce energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses, alongside other plans aimed at boosting growth. The strategy includes improving workers' skills, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending. While manufacturers have welcomed the plans, the hospitality sector has expressed disappointment at its exclusion, with concerns raised about the impact of the government's Employment Rights Bill on growth.</p>

Traders are assigning a 23% probability to a rate move at the July meeting, with a higher likelihood of a cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US launched air strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, with American officials claiming the action has significantly set back Tehran's nuclear ambitions. The strikes involved 125 US military aircraft and targeted the Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan facilities, utilizing precision-guided weapons and bunker-buster bombs. While the US claims the strikes caused severe damage, Iran has stated that the targeted sites had been evacuated, and the UN's nuclear watchdog reported no increase in radiation levels. Iran is weighing its response, with potential options ranging from doing nothing to retaliating against American military bases or blockading the Strait of Hormuz.</p>
