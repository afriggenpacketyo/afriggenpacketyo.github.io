          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, faced criticism after stating he doesn't need to buy rice due to the abundance received from supporters, a remark made amidst rising rice prices affecting households. Eto's comments, made at a fundraising party, contrasted with his ministry's efforts to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. The average rice price has roughly doubled from the previous year due to a poor harvest. Eto later expressed regret for his remarks, acknowledging they went too far, but ruled out stepping down from his position as farm minister.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article argues that China is rapidly surpassing the United States in economic and technological power, potentially leading to a 'Chinese century.' The author contends that while the U.S. focuses on short-term trade disputes, China is making long-term investments in cutting-edge technologies and expanding its manufacturing capabilities. China already leads in multiple industries and is projected to account for nearly half of global manufacturing by 2030. The article suggests that the U.S. needs to shift its focus towards investing in research, innovation, and global economic ties to avoid becoming a diminished nation. </p>

The facility is open for tours, offering visitors a glimpse into the cavernous space with its towering pillars, reminiscent of an ancient Roman temple. The system is a key part of Tokyo's infrastructure, designed to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>House Republicans advanced their tax cut and border security package out of a key committee after negotiations with deficit hawks, who had previously blocked the bill. The bill includes extensions of the 2017 tax cuts, new tax cuts proposed by Trump, and increased spending on border security and defense. However, some conservatives are pushing for faster implementation of Medicaid work requirements and deeper cuts to clean energy tax credits. Democrats are largely opposed, calling the bill a 'betrayal' of working families, as the bill's fate in the full House and Senate remains uncertain.</p>

The glitter, safe for consumption, is added to the voles' food, and the resulting glittery poo helps conservationists monitor their movements. This innovative approach aims to identify the voles' territories and habitats, allowing for targeted conservation efforts such as removing invasive species and protecting riverbanks. The project is currently being tested on captive-bred water voles before being implemented in the wild.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, signaling concerns about consumption, while industrial output grew more than expected, defying the impact of U.S. tariffs. Retail sales rose 5.1% year on year, missing analysts' estimates, while industrial output grew 6.1%. Fixed-asset investment rose 4.0%, slightly lower than expected. The urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1%. Despite trade tensions with the U.S., China's exports surged due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries. Domestic demand, including consumption, still lacks momentum.</p>

          <p>The United States lost its last triple-A credit rating from Moody's, amplifying concerns about government debt and the cost of President Trump's policies. The downgrade was attributed to the proposed bill making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, which could add trillions to the federal debt. Financial markets reacted negatively, with stock futures indicating a decline and the U.S. dollar weakening. The downgrade could potentially destabilize the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, leading to higher premiums for U.S. debt.</p>
