          <h2>Goldman Sachs Report Reveals Growing Number of Americans Living Paycheck to Paycheck</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 07:56:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Goldman Sachs finds that a growing number of Americans are struggling to save for retirement as they live paycheck to paycheck. The analysis indicates that 42% of younger workers across Gen Z, Millennial, and Gen X demographics have no savings left after covering essential living expenses, a significant increase from 31% in 1997. This financial pressure, which the report calls a "financial vortex," is driven by the rising costs of housing and healthcare, making traditional advice to simply "save more" unrealistic for millions. The report suggests that without systemic changes, this trend could worsen, further jeopardizing the financial security of future retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cautioned that the ongoing government shutdown could negatively impact U.S. economic growth. Speaking on CNBC, Bessent stated that the impasse could deliver a "hit to the GDP" and harm working Americans at a time when the economy has shown positive momentum. The warning comes on the second day of the shutdown, with no agreement yet reached on a continuing resolution to fund government operations. While past shutdowns have had limited long-term economic effects, concerns are rising that a prolonged closure could inflict more significant damage, especially if it leads to permanent job losses among federal workers.

          <p>The Russian government is preparing to increase taxes on businesses and consumers to sustain its military spending amid a slowing economy. According to its 2026 draft budget, the Kremlin plans to raise the VAT from 20% to 22% and implement other tax measures to fund its war in Ukraine without significantly increasing borrowing. This move comes as economic growth forecasts are being revised downward, with analysts noting that Moscow is shifting the financial burden of the conflict onto the general population. The budget reflects a strategy of austerity for the civilian economy while prioritizing defense and security spending, signaling a prolonged commitment to the war effort. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A minor collision occurred between two Delta Air Lines planes on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport on Wednesday night. The incident involved two Delta Connection flights, operated by Endeavor Air, resulting in the wing of one aircraft making contact with the fuselage of the other. A flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was treated at the scene before being taken to a hospital, but no passengers were harmed. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which caused no significant disruption to overall airport operations. Passengers were deplaned and provided with accommodations and alternative travel arrangements.</p>

          <p>A woman who survived a deadly shooting at a Michigan church shared a powerful account of her encounter with the gunman, stating "he let me live." Lisa Louis, whose father was among the four people killed in the attack, wrote that she locked eyes with the shooter, saw his pain, and instantly forgave him in her heart. She believes this interaction may have provided precious time for others to escape the chaos. The attacker, who had expressed hatred toward the church, was later killed by police at the scene.

          <p>A new report from wealth intelligence firm Altrata predicts a significant generational shift among the world's ultra-wealthy, with millennials and Gen Z poised to control over a third of this group's assets by 2040. Currently, baby boomers dominate the population of individuals worth at least $30 million, but the ongoing "great wealth transfer" will rapidly change this dynamic. This transition is expected to have far-reaching implications for industries catering to the rich, from finance to luxury goods, as younger generations have different priorities and sources of wealth, with a stronger focus on technology and entertainment. Firms are being advised to adapt their strategies to cater to these emerging preferences and values. (not investment advice)</p>

This transaction marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash reserve of $344 billion. Occidental plans to use a significant portion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO, Vicki Hollub, says will unlock shareholder value and allow the company to resume its stock buyback program. The deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, deepens the existing relationship between the two companies, as Berkshire already holds a substantial stake in Occidental.</p>

Critics argue that these controls place the burden of safety on parents rather than on the tech companies themselves.

However, the article also highlights sources of institutional resistance, such as grand juries rejecting some charges and a previous U.S. attorney resigning rather than bringing the case.

          <p>A new study in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that the alarming rise in cancer diagnoses among adults under 50 may be partially a "diagnostic mirage." While incidence rates for certain cancers have nearly doubled since 1990, the study found that death rates have remained flat, and rates of metastatic cancer have not increased at the same pace. The researchers argue this indicates an "epidemic of diagnosis" rather than an epidemic of disease, where improved screening technologies are detecting cancers that might never have become clinically significant. However, other experts caution against oversimplifying the trend, noting that mortality has genuinely increased for specific cancers like colorectal and uterine.</p>

          <p>Democratic Governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, who has successfully won two elections in a state heavily favoring Donald Trump, is now considering a presidential campaign. In an interview with NPR, Beshear discussed his belief that Democrats need to change their approach to win back voters in rural and red-state areas. He emphasized the importance of showing respect, finding common ground, and focusing on issues that impact all Americans. By positioning himself as a common-sense leader who can succeed in politically challenging environments, Beshear is making a case for why a Democrat from a red state could be a viable national candidate.</p>

          <p>Russia has denounced the restoration of United Nations sanctions against Iran, calling the action illegal and legally void. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated that the move, triggered by Britain, Germany, and France, was the result of "manipulation" and would only deepen the crisis over Iran's nuclear program. The reinstated sanctions include an arms embargo and a ban on uranium enrichment activities. Russia, which maintains close ties with Iran, asserted that the snapback process imposes no legal obligations on other countries and reiterated its support for Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of Hamas's military wing in Gaza, Izz al-Din al-Haddad, has reportedly indicated his opposition to the latest U.S.-backed ceasefire plan. According to the BBC, he believes the proposal is designed to eliminate Hamas and is therefore determined to continue fighting. The plan, which Israel has accepted, requires Hamas to disarm and release all hostages within 72 hours, a condition seen as giving up its primary leverage. This internal division complicates negotiations, as the group's political leadership in Qatar is reportedly more open to a deal but lacks control over the hostages held in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Officials for Munich's Oktoberfest have dismissed the idea of extending the festival, despite a temporary closure caused by a bomb threat on Wednesday. A German hospitality association had suggested adding a day as a sign of resilience, but festival organizers cited practical challenges, including staffing shortages and expiring contracts, making a last-minute extension unfeasible. The festival grounds were shut down for several hours after police linked a bomb threat to a fire at a nearby house. Authorities have since reassured the public that no risks remain, and the event has resumed normal operations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a general consensus among food lovers about what makes a good pasta shape, certain inferior varieties like farfalle, penne, and wagon wheels continue to persist on store shelves. Culinary experts argue that superior shapes excel at cooking evenly and effectively holding sauce, qualities often lacking in their less-regarded counterparts. The continued existence of these "bad" shapes is largely attributed to nostalgia and their frequent use in potluck dishes like pasta salad, where convenience often outweighs culinary excellence. While some chefs harbor a deep disdain for shapes like penne, others argue that even a maligned pasta can find its purpose in the right dish, suggesting a place for every noodle.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Tesco, Ken Murphy, has warned the UK government against imposing additional taxes on retailers in the November Budget. He stated that the industry has already absorbed substantial new operating costs this year, including higher National Insurance contributions and packaging recycling levies, declaring that "enough is enough." His comments were made as the supermarket giant upgraded its annual profit forecast, driven by shoppers buying more items despite price cuts on thousands of products. With Chancellor Rachel Reeves expected to announce some tax increases, Murphy's plea highlights the pressure facing the retail sector amid rising operational expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown enters its second day, the White House has stated that mass layoffs of federal workers are "imminent" and could become permanent within days. The administration is blaming Democrats for the impasse, while President Trump has encouraged Republicans to use the shutdown as a chance to make lasting cuts to the workforce. With no compromise in sight and the Senate adjourned until Friday, fears are growing about the economic impact and the job security of hundreds of thousands of federal employees. The shutdown began after lawmakers failed to agree on a new spending plan, with disputes centered on healthcare funding.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has shut down after Congress failed to pass a new spending bill, leading to the suspension of many services and placing about 750,000 workers on unpaid leave. The impasse stems from a dispute between Republicans and Democrats over funding for healthcare programs, with Democrats leveraging their votes in the Senate to demand extensions for health insurance tax credits. While essential services like border protection and air traffic control will continue, many agencies, national parks, and federally funded programs will be reduced or closed. The White House has indicated it may use the shutdown to make permanent cuts to the federal workforce.</p>

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, told the BBC they were moved from a military camp under the pretense of being relocated to better accommodations. This incident is part of a controversial U.S. "third-country deportation" policy, under which Ghana agreed to accept West African nationals. The deportee, who fears persecution in Nigeria, is now stranded in a hotel in Togo without proper documentation, highlighting the complex and perilous journey faced by those removed from the U.S.</p>

A U.S. District Judge ruled that the iconic image does not constitute child pornography, stating that the context does not suggest sexually explicit conduct. Elden had sued the band and the photographer in 2021, arguing he was a victim of commercial sexual exploitation. The judge likened the photo to a family picture of a child bathing and noted that Elden had previously embraced his connection to the album cover.

Proponents of the ban point to the overwhelming consensus from major medical and mental health organizations that the practice is harmful and ineffective. Opponents, represented by the conservative Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom, argue that the law constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination by regulating the content of talk therapy.</p>
