          <p>Chinese scientists have significantly improved the lifespan and brightness of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs).  This breakthrough addresses a key limitation hindering widespread commercial adoptionâ€”the instability of PeLEDs. The new PeLEDs achieve brightness exceeding current commercial displays and boast a theoretical lifespan of over 21 years at standard operating brightness. This technology could revolutionize lighting and display screens, offering potentially lower costs and superior performance.</p>
