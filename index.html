          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the U.S., citing antisemitism concerns at the Ivy League institution. This action follows Trump's previous efforts to block Harvard from enrolling international students and freeze federal funding. Harvard has filed lawsuits in response to these measures, alleging unlawful retaliation for its refusal to surrender academic independence. The White House aims to exert control over university policies, including diversity programs and hiring practices.</p>

          <p>Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley suggests the era of investing in cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization is nearing its end. He draws parallels to Wall Street, where investors build a thesis around a business rather than comparing market capitalizations. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has also advocated for diversifying cryptocurrency portfolios beyond Bitcoin, comparing the current landscape to the internet in 2004. This shift emphasizes narrative-driven investing and the emergence of new sectors in the cryptocurrency market (not investment advice).</p>
