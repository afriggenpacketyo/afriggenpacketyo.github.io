          <p>Germany's coalition government is split on how to expand its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to meet NATO personnel targets. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of the Social Democrats has proposed a more attractive voluntary service model, inspired by Sweden, which includes mandatory questionnaires and medical exams for young men. However, members of the center-right CDU/CSU coalition partners argue this approach is insufficient given the current security climate and are pushing for a faster reintroduction of compulsory military service, which was suspended in 2011.</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's 2023 decision ending race-based affirmative action, the Trump administration is now requiring universities to submit detailed admissions data to prevent the use of "racial proxies." Amid this scrutiny, the concept of class-based affirmative action, which gives preference to economically disadvantaged students of all races, is gaining attention as a potential alternative. However, there are concerns that the administration may also oppose this approach if it results in increased racial diversity, creating a complex political and legal landscape for higher education.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, forcing both parties into binding arbitration. The work stoppage, which began during the peak summer travel season, stranded more than 100,000 travelers globally. Citing the need to avoid risks to the economy, the federal jobs minister ordered the employees back to work less than 12 hours after the strike began, though the airline anticipates it will take several days to fully stabilize its flight schedule.</p>

The storm is bringing heavy rain and high winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, prompting considerable flash flood warnings. While current models predict Erin will turn north and stay offshore from the U.S. mainland, its large size is expected to generate dangerous surf and significant rip currents along the entire U.S. East Coast throughout the week.</p>

          <p>In the 11 days since the UK and France implemented a new "one in, one out" migrant returns agreement, more than 2,500 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one with a strong asylum case, but no removals have yet occurred. The continued crossings, organized by smuggling gangs, are placing pressure on the UK government to demonstrate the effectiveness of its strategy to secure the country's borders.</p>

          <p>A new policy by South Korea's president to de-escalate tensions with North Korea by cutting 80% of radio broadcasts into the country is facing criticism for its impact on human rights. Defectors and advocates argue that this move threatens the estimated 400,000 underground Christians in the North, for whom the broadcasts are a crucial and often sole source of religious information and hope. Critics call the policy a "catastrophic strategic mistake," asserting that it harms a persecuted population while aiming for diplomatic progress with the Kim Jong Un regime.</p>

The piece contrasts a youthful, academic appreciation of artists like Piero della Francesca and Michelangelo with a later, more visceral understanding of their depictions of complex human experiences. This evolution in perspective is linked to the contemporary art of Jenny Saville and a broader capacity for empathy, suggesting that art's power is unlocked as we live and grow.</p>
