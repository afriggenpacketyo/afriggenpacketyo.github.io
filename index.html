          <p>This article explains the 'Reichsbürger' movement in Germany, whose members deny the legitimacy of the post-World War II Federal Republic. They adhere to debunked claims about the German Reich's continued existence and the illegitimacy of the current government. While initially dismissed as harmless, the movement has become more radical and prone to violence, leading to increased scrutiny from authorities. The article also addresses and debunks the Reichsbürger's key theories, such as the lack of a peace treaty and the claim that Germany is just a company. Optimism score is at 65.</p>
