          <p>CNBC reports that China has accused the United States of undermining preliminary trade agreements by issuing an industry warning against using Chinese chips, specifically those from Huawei. Beijing has demanded that the U.S. correct its mistakes, calling the Commerce Department's guidance discriminatory and market distorting. China threatens to take resolute measures to safeguard its interests if the U.S. continues to damage them.

These efforts follow direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul, where prisoner exchanges were discussed but no ceasefire was agreed upon.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, has cautioned that Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating understates the true risks to U.S. Treasurys. According to CNBC, Dalio argues that credit agencies fail to account for the risk of the government printing money to pay its debts, which would devalue bondholder returns. Moody's recently downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the ballooning budget deficit and soaring interest payments on the debt. This warning comes as U.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose in response to Moody's downgrade.</p>

          <p>The BBC reports that struggling DNA testing firm 23andMe has entered into an agreement to be acquired by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for $256 million. The acquisition comes two months after the company filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Regeneron has committed to comply with 23andMe's privacy policies, and the deal will be overseen by an ombudsman to protect user data. Regeneron plans to use 23andMe's data for drug development, while 23andMe's subsidiary Lemonaid Health will be wound down.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that while the center-right Democratic Alliance is set to rule Portugal again in a minority government, the hard-right Chega party has emerged as a powerful new force. In the recent snap election, Chega won over 22 percent of the vote, positioning itself as a potent movement with an anti-immigrant message. Analysts say this will likely pressure the government to shift further to the right on issues like immigration. The election cemented Chega's evolution from a protest movement to a significant political contender.</p>

          <p>The New York Times analyzes Israel's recent decisions regarding the Gaza offensive and aid delivery, highlighting the government's attempts to balance competing interests. After a two-month blockade, Israel allowed limited aid into Gaza, while also escalating its military rhetoric. This reflects internal disagreements about national priorities, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu trying to appease both right-wing allies and foreign allies. The delay in the ground operation is also influenced by ongoing negotiations for a cease-fire, amid pressure from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>CBS News reports that lenders offer differing rates for home equity loans and HELOCs due to several factors. Home equity loans have fixed rates, which command a premium because lenders assume the risk of future rate increases. HELOCs, on the other hand, offer lower variable rates that change with economic conditions. Flexible draw periods and ongoing borrowing risk also contribute to the rate differences. Despite the rate differences, both home equity products can offer better interest rates and higher borrowing limits compared to credit cards or personal loans. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement on plant and animal health is expected to reduce red tape and checks, benefiting those producing and selling foodstuffs.

          <p>The New York Times reports that President Trumpâ€™s tariffs on auto parts are causing job losses in Windsor, Ontario, a hub for auto-parts makers supplying vehicles bound for the United States. Many parts makers are small businesses that lack the financial cushion of auto giants to withstand the tariffs' impact. Estimates suggest that thousands of parts workers have been laid off since the tariffs began. The tariffs have created uncertainty and complicated trade rules, hindering the industry's operations.</p>
