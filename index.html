          <p>Firefighters responding to a growing brush fire on Canfield Mountain in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, were ambushed by an unidentified gunman shooting from the woods. The incident prompted a swift law enforcement response, with the area being treated as an active shooter situation and a shelter-in-place order issued for the surrounding community. Authorities are investigating the possibility that the fire was deliberately set as a trap to lure first responders to the scene.

          <p>Colorado Rockies interim manager Warren Schaeffer was ejected for the first time in his career during a game against the Brewers, following a heated argument with the home plate umpire. Schaeffer vehemently protested a called third strike on outfielder Tyler Freeman, leading to his ejection after he spiked his hat and knelt to demonstrate where he believed the pitch was. Despite the team's poor season record, Schaeffer's fiery display appeared to galvanize his players. The Rockies went on to win the game 4-3 in extra innings, marking a memorable outcome to the manager's dramatic dismissal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has initiated debate on a comprehensive Republican domestic policy bill, which faces scrutiny over its fiscal and social impact. A new analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects the legislation would increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade. The CBO also estimates that the bill's proposed cuts to healthcare funding would cause an additional 11.8 million Americans to become uninsured by 2034. These stark figures present significant challenges for Republican leadership as they aim to pass the measure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are conducting a nationwide crackdown on writers of "danmei," a popular genre of gay erotic fiction, with at least 30 authors arrested since February. The writers, almost all young women, are accused of producing and distributing obscene material for profit, a charge that can lead to over ten years in prison. This campaign targets content published on platforms like the Taiwan-hosted Haitang Literature City and is seen as part of a broader effort by Beijing to enforce traditional family values. The arrests have sparked a rare online debate about censorship and the criminalization of artistic expression.</p>

          <p>In the week following the U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration and intelligence reports have created uncertainty about the extent of the damage. While the president and defense secretary claimed Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated," a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggested the setback was only temporary. Officials later shifted focus, highlighting that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, seemingly reframing the primary goal of the mission. This evolution in messaging has led to ongoing questions about the true impact and objectives of the military action.</p>

He also reiterated that Iran will insist on its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, rejecting the notion of zero enrichment as the "law of the jungle."

Walker passed away in 2013 during the filming of “Furious 7,” which used a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins to complete his scenes.

They describe severe water shortages, with tap water often discolored and unsafe, along with frequent power cuts and scarce, expensive medicines.

The provision, championed by Senator Mike Lee, was intended to address housing affordability but drew fierce opposition from conservation groups, recreation advocates, and several Republican lawmakers. Lee stated he withdrew the measure due to an inability to secure safeguards preventing the land from being sold to foreign interests.

          <p>England's women's football team received a major boost as star player Lauren James made a successful return from a three-month hamstring injury. In a friendly match against Jamaica, the 23-year-old Chelsea forward made an immediate impact, providing an assist just eight minutes after coming on as a substitute in England's dominant 7-0 victory. Her return comes just days before the Lionesses begin their Euro 2025 title defense against France. While her match fitness is still being built, her creative talent and versatility provide manager Sarina Wiegman with a powerful strategic option for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir-Saeid Iravani, declared that his country's nuclear enrichment activities "will never stop," asserting it is an inalienable right for peaceful energy purposes under international treaties. His comments come a week after U.S. airstrikes targeted three Iranian nuclear facilities, creating what he called an improper condition for new negotiations. While stating Iran is ready for dialogue, he characterized U.S. demands as dictating policy rather than negotiating. Iravani also denied threats against IAEA inspectors but confirmed that Iran's parliament has suspended cooperation with the nuclear watchdog agency.</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, has apologized after mistakenly informing thousands of Eurojackpot players that they had won millions more than their actual prizes. The error occurred due to a technical glitch where winnings in Euros were incorrectly multiplied instead of converted to Norwegian kroner. Although no incorrect payments were made, the mistake led to widespread disappointment and anger, prompting CEO Tonje Sagstuen to resign. The company acknowledged it has faced several technical issues over the past year and is investigating the cause of this significant blunder.</p>

          <p>A private funeral was held for former Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark, and their dog, following their tragic deaths earlier this month. The service was attended by hundreds, including Governor Tim Walz, who delivered a eulogy remembering Hortman as a deeply committed public servant and a talented, compassionate legislator. The couple was killed in their home in an act of violence that also targeted another state lawmaker. Melissa Hortman was the first woman to lie in state at the Minnesota Capitol, where thousands paid their respects to her legacy of bipartisan collaboration.</p>

          <h2>Expert Analysis Provides Context on Assessing Damage from Iran Airstrikes</h2>

          <p>This article provides a historical and technical perspective on Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) to analyze the disputed effectiveness of the recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. It explains that early assessments, like a leaked DIA report suggesting minimal damage, are often incomplete, as a full analysis integrates various intelligence sources over time. Considering the precision munitions, advanced aircraft, and specific targeting used in the U.S. and Israeli campaign, the author argues that the cumulative damage to Iran's nuclear ecosystem was likely severe. The analysis concludes that official claims of significant impact are probably more accurate than hasty critiques.</p>
