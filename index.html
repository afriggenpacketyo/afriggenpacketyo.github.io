          <p>A 33-year-old man, Javon Riley, has been found guilty for his involvement in a gang-related shooting in Dalston, London, that left a nine-year-old girl with a bullet permanently lodged in her brain. The court heard that Riley conducted reconnaissance for the attack, which targeted three men affiliated with a rival Turkish gang, and assisted the still-unidentified gunman's escape. The girl, an innocent bystander eating ice cream with her family, now suffers from severe physical and emotional trauma. The Metropolitan Police are still offering a reward for information leading to the gunman's arrest.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling hundreds of flights as it faces a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, set to begin this weekend if a new labor agreement is not reached. The airline initiated a gradual suspension of operations to ensure an orderly process, impacting tens of thousands of travelers daily. The primary dispute centers on wage issues, with the union describing current pay as "poverty wages," while the airline states it has offered a significant increase. The carrier is providing full refunds for canceled flights and working with other airlines to find alternative travel options for affected customers.</p>

          <p>Google has partnered with nuclear startup Kairos Power to deploy an advanced Hermes 2 nuclear reactor to help power its data centers in the Tennessee Valley. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has agreed to purchase up to 50 megawatts of power from the plant, which is expected to be operational by 2030. This collaboration aims to commercialize smaller, more affordable nuclear technology without placing the financial risk of construction on consumers. The project represents a significant step in using reliable, carbon-free energy to meet the growing electricity demands of artificial intelligence and large-scale data processing.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a powerful Category 4 storm, is not expected to make landfall in the United States but will generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast throughout the week. The National Hurricane Center has advised coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, to remain vigilant as the storm moves between Bermuda and the U.S. coast. While the core of the hurricane will remain offshore, its large size means its effects will be felt widely, prompting some mandatory evacuations on Hatteras Island due to potential flooding and high winds. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos and parts of the Bahamas.</p>

Following meetings with Lebanese leaders, Barrack stated that the next step requires Israel to reciprocate the Lebanese government's commitment to the plan. The proposal has angered the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which has vowed to resist disarmament, raising concerns about potential civil unrest in Lebanon. The diplomatic efforts aim to resolve the long-standing conflict that has caused significant economic damage and instability in the region.</p>

          <p>A trend dubbed "job hugging" has emerged in the U.S. labor market, as workers increasingly opt to stay in their current roles rather than seeking new opportunities. This shift from the recent "great resignation" is attributed to economic uncertainty, a cooling job market, and a lower hiring rate, making employees more cautious about job hopping. While providing stability, experts warn that this stagnation could lead to slower wage growth for individuals and make it more difficult for new entrants, like recent graduates, to find employment. The rate at which workers are voluntarily quitting their jobs has fallen to lows not seen since before the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to President Donald Trump, has publicly condemned India for its continued purchases of Russian crude oil, labeling the practice "opportunistic" and undermining international sanctions against Moscow. In an op-ed, Navarro argued that India is effectively acting as a clearinghouse for Russian oil, which provides Russia with necessary funds while undermining U.S. foreign policy goals. His comments follow the administration's plan to impose additional tariffs on India, escalating trade tensions. India has defended its actions as a necessity driven by global market conditions to ensure affordable energy for its citizens.</p>

Beijing is expected to be more assertive this time, seeking a more balanced agreement with concessions from Washington, such as the relaxation of export controls. Since the previous deal, China has successfully reduced its export dependency on the U.S. and developed a range of retaliatory tools beyond tariffs, including restrictions on critical mineral exports. This changed dynamic, coupled with a lack of simple solutions and time constraints, complicates the path toward stabilizing the critical bilateral economic relationship.</p>

A Category 1 storm features winds of 74-95 mph causing "some damage," while a Category 5 storm has winds of 157 mph or higher and is capable of causing "catastrophic damage." Storms rated as Category 3 or higher are designated as "major" hurricanes due to their potential for significant loss of life. This article breaks down the characteristics of each category, citing historical examples like Hurricane Katrina (Category 3 at landfall) and Hurricane Andrew (Category 5) to illustrate their destructive power.</p>

This economic stimulus is seen as a way to bolster India's economy, which is heavily reliant on domestic spending, and counteract the negative impact of ongoing U.S. tariffs on Indian imports.

Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched a large-scale attack overnight involving 140 drones and several missiles across multiple regions. President Zelenskyy described the attack as a "demonstrative and cynical" act by Russia to exert pressure and undermine diplomatic efforts. The attack highlights the ongoing violence as President Trump prepares to host Zelenskyy and European leaders to discuss a potential end to the war.</p>

          <p>Swiss watchmaker Swatch has removed a global advertisement and issued an apology after it sparked accusations of racism on Chinese social media. The ad featured an Asian male model making a "slanted eye" gesture, which led to widespread criticism and calls for a boycott of Swatch Group brands. In its apology, the company acknowledged the concerns and expressed regret for any distress caused. The incident occurs as Swatch and other Western luxury brands are already struggling with sluggish demand and declining sales in the critical Chinese market, making the public relations crisis particularly damaging.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturers Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid are facing significant revenue losses due to the Trump administration's overhaul of federal fuel economy regulations. The companies have historically profited by selling regulatory credits to automakers that fail to meet emissions standards, a system now being dismantled. In a court filing, Rivian stated that the changes have already put over $100 million in revenue in limbo. The administration's decision to reduce non-compliance penalties to zero has effectively eliminated the market for these credits, impacting a key, high-profit revenue stream for all-electric automakers.

          <p>Legendary director Francis Ford Coppola has undertaken a six-city tour in an unconventional effort to build a cult following for his 2024 film, "Megalopolis." The epic, which was self-funded, critically panned, and a box office flop, is the subject of these live events where Coppola engages in lengthy, unmoderated discussions on the movie's themes. Unlike the organic process through which most cult classics emerge over time, Coppola is actively trying to facilitate a reappraisal of his work. The tour has drawn sold-out crowds, suggesting a fascination not just with the film, but with the spectacle of a famed auteur defending and mythologizing his passion project.</p>

          <p>Shipping container data reveals that major retailers Walmart and Target proactively imported large quantities of goods, such as holiday decorations and popular toys, ahead of threatened U.S. tariffs on Chinese products. This "front-loading" strategy aimed to manage costs and ensure product availability by shipping items earlier than usual during periods of tariff uncertainty. While this approach helps avoid higher duties, it can also lead to increased freight and storage costs, as seen when Target reported an earnings miss attributed to absorbing these expenses. The data illustrates how retailers are navigating volatile trade policies to maintain supply chain stability. (not investment advice)</p>
