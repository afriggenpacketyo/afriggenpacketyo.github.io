          <p>Following the catastrophic flash floods in central Texas that have claimed over 80 lives, numerous celebrities are using their platforms to express sorrow and encourage support for the victims. Texas natives like Matthew McConaughey and Hilary Duff shared heartfelt messages, with McConaughey calling on Texans to lend a helping hand during the long recovery ahead. The entertainers conveyed their devastation, particularly over the loss of life at Camp Mystic, a place Duff described as holding a special significance for many who attended summer camps in the Texas hill country. Their posts reflect a widespread sense of shock and mourning for the affected communities.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed opera tenor Rodell Rosel, a fixture in Chicago's music scene for two decades, believes opera is a universal art form that connects people through powerful emotion, even across language barriers. In an interview, he explained how the music allows audiences to feel the drama and that success in the art form, and in life, comes from embracing one's full identity. Rosel, who openly identifies as a gay man, also spoke about the importance of community and finding safe spaces, such as the group "Asians and Friends." He views his craft as a continuous learning process, akin to medicine or law, requiring constant work and dedication.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood early Monday morning resulted in three fatalities and nine other individuals being wounded by gunfire. The victims, ranging in age from 15 to 24, were transported to local hospitals for treatment. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel stated that officers had been monitoring the block over the weekend due to previous disturbances and responded to the scene after hearing gunshots nearby. Authorities believe there may have been an exchange of gunfire among a crowd of about 40 people and have recovered dozens of shell casings, taking one person into custody.</p>

          <p>A team of engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has designed and built an innovative printer capable of adding braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a machine to handle materials that commercial braille printers could not. The students' invention features open hardware, allowing BISM's low-vision employees to operate it easily by touch. The device has already been used to print 400 labels for "Blind Spot," a beer from Checkerspot Brewing Company, for an annual fundraiser supporting people with vision loss.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that any country aligning with what he terms the "Anti-American policies of BRICS" will face an additional 10% tariff. This move escalates trade tensions as a July 9 deadline for trade deals approaches, with new tariffs now set to begin on August 1. The BRICS bloc, which recently expanded, has criticized US tariff policies as a threat to the global economy. The Trump administration's protectionist stance has led to ongoing negotiations with major partners like the European Union, which is seeking to avoid steep duties on cars and metals.

          <p>Doris Garcia, a 96-year-old woman from Colorado, has fulfilled a lifelong dream of meeting penguins, 70 years after she was denied the opportunity to see them in their natural habitat. In the 1950s, while working for the U.S. government in Argentina, she was invited on a research trip to Antarctica but was barred from going at the last minute simply because she was a woman. Her story moved Compassionate Hospice and the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance to arrange a special behind-the-scenes encounter with African penguins at the zoo. The event provided a joyful and long-awaited moment for Garcia and her family.</p>

          <p>Effective apologies from leaders require taking full responsibility, showing genuine empathy, and outlining a clear plan for corrective action, according to communication experts. The timing of an apology is crucial; waiting too long can suggest a lack of care, while speaking too quickly without a plan can erode credibility. Experts advise leaders to sound human and vulnerable without making the situation about themselves, as a scripted or emotionless delivery can appear disingenuous. Ultimately, whether for a major public crisis or an internal misstep, a successful apology builds trust by demonstrating that the leader cares and is competent to fix the problem.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn a return that can outpace rising costs. Current top CD rates significantly exceed national averages, with online banks often providing the most competitive yields due to lower overhead costs. Short-term CDs, particularly those with terms of six months to one year, are presently offering higher rates than longer-term options, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. To secure the best rates, experts advise comparing offers from various institutions, especially online banks, and considering a CD laddering strategy to balance high yields with long-term savings goals.

          <p>Apple is appealing a €500 million fine imposed by the European Commission, which found the company had illegally restricted app developers from informing users about alternative purchasing options outside its App Store. The tech giant called the penalty "unprecedented" and argued that the EU's decision goes beyond legal requirements, forcing it to adopt business terms that are confusing for developers and detrimental to users. This fine was one of the first issued under the EU's landmark Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to increase competition in online markets. Apple has escalated its complaint to the EU's General Court, setting the stage for a lengthy legal battle.</p>

          <p>The jury has retired to consider its verdicts in the retrial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who face charges of manslaughter by gross negligence in the death of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The couple was the subject of a nationwide manhunt in 2023 after evidence of a birth was found in their abandoned car. The baby's body was later discovered in a shopping bag in an allotment shed in Brighton. The couple claims the baby died accidentally in a tent on the South Downs, while the prosecution argues she died from exposure to cold due to inadequate care.</p>

          <p>An autopsy has revealed that Juliana Marins, a 26-year-old Brazilian tourist, died from internal bleeding and organ damage caused by blunt force trauma after falling into an active volcano in Indonesia. Marins slipped and fell approximately 600 meters down a cliffside near the crater of Mount Rinjani on June 21. While she initially survived the fall, rescue efforts were hampered by difficult terrain and weather. Her family has claimed that a more prompt rescue could have saved her and is now seeking justice, blaming what they call Indonesia's "precarious public services" and lack of infrastructure for tourists in remote, dangerous locations.</p>

The girl's mother reported the relationship to authorities after she had returned to the UK. The campaign group Detained in Dubai, which supported Fakana, stated his family is "over the moon" to have him back and highlighted the case as a warning about differing laws for tourists in the UAE.</p>

          <p>A new migrant detention camp in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by supporters, is being condemned by critics as a cruel and dangerous political stunt. As the first detainees arrived, the Florida Republican party began selling merchandise mocking the camp's harsh, swampy location. Immigration advocates and Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost have slammed the facility as a "hell on earth" where detainees will face extreme heat and hurricane risks. Observers suggest the high-profile camp is more about political performance for Donald Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis than effective policy, creating a potentially deadly situation for those held within its flimsy structures.</p>

For decades, credit for the colorful corridors was often mistakenly given to her boss at the time. The Dodgers, seeking to install a similar design in their clubhouse walkway, tracked Bennett down for her blessing and advice. Now, a sign at Dodger Stadium explicitly recognizes her as the inspiration, celebrating her work that has become a symbol of arrival in Los Angeles for generations of travelers and a fixture in popular culture.</p>

          <p>A critical analysis in The Atlantic argues that the "One Big Beautiful Bill" will effectively gut Medicaid by implementing a nationwide work-reporting requirement, despite White House claims to the contrary. The article asserts that this policy will not spur employment, as most eligible recipients are already working or unable to, but will instead create a massive bureaucratic hurdle. This red tape is projected to cause millions of people to lose their health coverage due to administrative complexity, not ineligibility. The author contends that the requirement is a costly and cruel measure that shifts administrative burdens onto vulnerable individuals, ultimately weakening the nation's healthcare safety net.</p>

The raid and subsequent deportations highlight the precarious situation of migrant laborers who are essential to the state's multi-billion dollar dairy industry. Advocates and workers describe an atmosphere of uncertainty, intensified by mixed messages from the White House regarding worksite enforcement. The story of workers like José Molina-Aguilar, arrested despite a pending asylum case, underscores the human impact of immigration policies on an industry that would reportedly collapse without their labor.</p>

          <p>Zambia's new Cyber Security and Cyber Crimes Act has ignited a fierce debate, with the government defending it as a necessary tool to fight digital crime while rights groups condemn it as a threat to free expression. The law grants authorities the power to intercept and surveil all electronic communications and brings the national cybersecurity agency directly under the president's office. Critics, including the Law Association of Zambia and media watchdogs, argue that vague definitions and stiff penalties will lead to self-censorship and stifle investigative journalism. The move is particularly controversial as President Hakainde Hichilema had criticized similar laws while in opposition.</p>
