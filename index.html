          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its key interest rate to 20%, marking the first reduction since September 2022, signaling a potential easing of inflation pressures that had previously been described as "alarming" by President Vladimir Putin. The decision comes as the inflation rate in April dropped to 6.2%, a decrease from the 8.2% average recorded in the first quarter of 2025. Despite domestic demand still outpacing the supply of goods and services, the central bank believes the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path, though tight monetary policy will remain in place to achieve the 4% inflation target. Russia's economy has faced immense strain on prices due to its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, leading to a weaker ruble and the need to re-orient the economy. Optimism for a lasting ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine has waned. The score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has dismissed Elon Musk as someone who has "lost his mind" and expressed a lack of interest in speaking with him, following a public dispute between the two.

Trump also mentioned that he is considering selling or giving away the red Tesla he purchased to support Musk, and he made a show of checking out Tesla models at the White House in March.

          <p>The UK has repositioned its stance on the Western Sahara conflict, endorsing Morocco's autonomy plan as the "most credible" position. This move aligns the UK with other Western countries but has angered Algeria, which backs the Polisario Front seeking an independent West Saharan state. Experts suggest the UK's position leaves room for flexibility, unlike France's more definitive support for Morocco. The UK's shift is likely driven by economic interests, as trade relations with Morocco have expanded significantly. The score for this article is 45.</p>
