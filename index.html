          <p>The Department of Justice is set to investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following a criminal referral from a Trump administration official. The referral, initiated by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, alleges potential mortgage fraud, claiming Cook declared two different properties as her primary residence simultaneously. Despite calls for her resignation from President Trump and a formal request for her removal sent to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Cook has stated she will not be bullied into stepping down. She intends to gather and provide accurate information to address any legitimate questions regarding her financial history before joining the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>For over four decades, San Pedro-based woodworker Harold Greene has dedicated his life to creating custom, handmade furniture from materials like maple and ash. A former firefighter and musician, Greene followed his passion for woodworking, building a career that includes everything from personal dining tables to commissioned public works like a bridge for Descanso Gardens. His philosophy centers on the idea that every piece of wood has a unique life and story, a belief reflected in his intricate designs, such as his signature Soliarc Chaise Lounge. Now in his 70s, Greene continues to work on new projects and shares his craft by teaching workshops across the country.</p>

          <p>Fujifilm Biotechnologies is preparing to open a massive new biologics manufacturing plant in Holly Springs, North Carolina, a project that underscores the complexities of increasing U.S. pharmaceutical production. The facility, which took five years and over $3 billion to build, will initially produce drug substances for clients like Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson. This development comes as President Trump threatens tariffs to incentivize domestic manufacturing, yet the long timeline illustrates the difficulty for drugmakers to quickly shift their supply chains. The project is part of a broader trend of biopharmaceutical investment in the U.S., driven by factors including tax policy changes and a desire for more resilient supply chains.</p>

          <p>Shares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store fell approximately 10% following the unveiling of a new, simplified logo that removes the iconic image of a man leaning against a barrel. The change is part of a broader brand revitalization effort that also includes updates to restaurant interiors and menu offerings. However, the redesign has faced significant criticism on social media, with some commentators suggesting the move is an attempt to distance the brand from its traditional American image. The negative reaction highlights the risks companies face when altering established branding, especially in a politically polarized environment.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a motion arguing that Sean "Diddy" Combs should not be granted a new trial on his two convictions for transportation to engage in prostitution. The filing asserts that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict, which found he transported escorts across state lines for his sexual gratification. Combs' defense team had previously requested an acquittal or new trial, claiming the Mann Act was misinterpreted and that evidence from his acquitted racketeering charges created unfair prejudice. Prosecutors countered that the law applies regardless of whether Combs' motive was commercial profit or personal voyeurism, maintaining his actions fall squarely within the statute.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the massive monetary penalty imposed on President Donald Trump and his company in the civil business fraud case brought by Attorney General Letitia James. The court ruled that the fine, which had grown to over $500 million, violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against excessive fines. However, the ruling upheld the original finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by inflating the value of real estate assets to obtain favorable financial terms. The non-monetary sanctions, designed to curb the company's business practices, were also upheld, while James has stated she will appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

The strategy requires the contributed portfolio to meet specific diversification rules to qualify for tax-deferred treatment. While this approach offers significant tax advantages, it also comes with complexities, such as high investment minimums and the potential for an investor's assets to be locked into the new ETF.

Key preparatory steps include reviewing credit reports for errors, protecting credit scores by avoiding new debt, and estimating home equity levels. Homeowners should also begin gathering necessary documents such as proof of income, insurance, and existing mortgage statements. By completing these steps in advance, borrowers can move quickly to lock in a lower rate when market conditions are favorable, potentially leading to significant long-term savings on their home loans.

          <p>For the first time in 25 years, senior officials from Syria and Israel have engaged in direct, face-to-face talks, brokered by the United States in Paris. The discussions focused on de-escalating tensions, reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement regarding the Golan Heights, and providing humanitarian aid to Syria's Druze minority. The two nations have technically been at war since 1967, and tensions have been high since the fall of Bashar Assad's regime. While full normalization of ties is not an immediate prospect, these talks represent a significant diplomatic development aimed at establishing security and stability along their shared border.</p>

          <p>A resident of South Lake Tahoe, California, has tested positive for the plague, according to local health officials. The individual is currently recovering at home and is believed to have been infected by a flea bite while camping in the area. Health officials emphasized that while human cases are extremely rare, the plague-causing bacterium, Yersinia pestis, is naturally present in wild rodent populations in higher-elevation parts of California. The public is being advised to take precautions, such as avoiding contact with wild rodents and keeping pets away from their burrows. The last confirmed human case in the county was in 2020.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun to move away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., the National Hurricane Center warns that it will continue to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast for several days. Storm surge warnings and some evacuation orders remain in effect for parts of the Outer Banks, which have already experienced coastal flooding. The storm is forecast to weaken gradually as it moves north over the Atlantic and is expected to become post-tropical by the weekend.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he would personally go out to patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., on Thursday night alongside police and National Guard members. The announcement follows the administration's recent anti-crime initiative, which has significantly increased the presence of federal law enforcement in the city. The White House has claimed the initiative is making the city safer, pointing to a recent week without any reported homicides. However, local police data indicates that violent crime in D.C. has been on a downward trend for the past year and a half, a fact President Trump has dismissed as "phony numbers."</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom received a record 111,000 asylum applications in the year ending in June, a 14% increase from the previous year. Despite the record influx, new Home Office figures show that officials are processing cases at a faster rate, reducing the overall backlog of initial decisions to 71,000 cases, down from a peak of 134,000 in June 2023. The majority of claims came from individuals from Pakistan, while most people arriving via small boats were from Afghanistan. The Labour government, which has pledged to clear the backlog by 2029, faces continued pressure over immigration and the use of hotels to house asylum seekers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A political analysis suggests that Stephen Miller's intense focus on immigration enforcement, while central to his role, may be counterproductive to President Trump's efforts to consolidate power. The recent militarization of Washington, D.C., for example, has heavily targeted immigrants but has been largely ineffective at suppressing broader protests, instead galvanizing resistance. This approach combines the optics of authoritarianism with a lack of actual repressive capacity against the general populace. The article argues that Miller's monomaniacal pursuit of deportations, while cruel, is an ineffective form of authoritarianism that alienates potential supporters and energizes opposition without achieving broader control.</p>

          <p>China has condemned Washington's military build-up near Venezuela as U.S. warships approached the nation's coast. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that Beijing opposes any actions that violate a country's sovereignty and rejects foreign interference in Venezuela's internal affairs. The statement of support for Nicolas Maduro's government came as Maduro hosted China's ambassador in Caracas to discuss joint projects. This diplomatic exchange highlights the growing international dimensions of the standoff between the U.S. and Venezuela, with China aligning itself firmly with Caracas against the Trump administration's pressure campaign.</p>

          <p>Shares of British retailer WH Smith dropped by 42% after the company announced it had discovered a £30 million accounting error in its North American division. The mistake, related to the premature logging of income from supplier rebates and promotions, forced the company to slash its profit forecasts for the year. As a result, group pre-tax profits are now expected to be around £110 million, significantly lower than the £140 million anticipated by the market. The board has launched an independent review of the matter, which has drawn comparisons to a previous accounting scandal at Tesco and has severely damaged investor confidence.</p>

          <p>A record number of students aged 17 and older took GCSE exams in Maths and English this year, prompting concerns about a "resit crisis" in England's education system. Under current rules, students who do not achieve a passing grade at age 16 must continue to study and retake the exams. However, pass rates for these resits are very low, with only 20.9% passing English and 17.1% passing Maths this year. Educationalists argue that many students are caught in a demoralizing cycle of failure and that the curriculum may be too demanding, placing a significant strain on the colleges that facilitate the resits.</p>

          <p>Securities filings from the second quarter reveal that the family offices of several billionaire investors made significant changes to their stock portfolios in response to President Trump's tariff announcements. Many firms, including those of David Tepper and George Soros, sold off positions in casino stocks like Las Vegas Sands due to fears of a trade war impacting their Macao operations. In contrast, several family offices increased their holdings in semiconductor companies like Nvidia and Intel, betting on the long-term growth of artificial intelligence. These moves demonstrate how even long-term investors are actively repositioning themselves amid geopolitical and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is preparing for a highly anticipated speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, where he will address the economic outlook and the central bank's long-term policy framework. The speech comes as the Fed faces intense pressure from the White House to lower interest rates and criticism over its operations. Investors will be closely watching for any hints about a potential rate cut in September, though Powell is expected to maintain a cautious stance given that inflation remains above the Fed's target. The address also marks a critical moment for defending the central bank's independence from political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), the third-largest steelworks in the United Kingdom and part of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel, has been placed under government control following a compulsory winding-up order. The court found the company to be "hopelessly insolvent," creating an uncertain future for its nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield. The government will now cover wages and costs while a buyer is sought for the business. The collapse follows financial turmoil stemming from the failure of Liberty Steel's main lender, Greensill Capital, and adds to the broader struggles of the UK steel industry.</p>
