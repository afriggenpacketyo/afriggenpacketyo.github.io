        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several newspapers highlight the release of Peter Sullivan, wrongly convicted of murder in 1986, after 38 years in jail due to new DNA evidence. The Daily Mirror calls it a "justice fiasco," while the Daily Mail describes it as "one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice," noting Sullivan may receive a ¬£1m payout. The Times and Daily Express focus on research indicating that new weight-loss drugs, GLP-1 agonists, could halve deaths from strokes and heart attacks, potentially benefiting over half the UK population and alleviating pressure on the NHS. Other news includes counter-terrorism police investigating a blaze at the PM's home and Chinese criticism of the UK-US trade accord.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they face a significant challenge in finding qualified money managers. The number of family offices is expected to grow to 10,720 by 2030, managing $5.4 trillion in assets. However, McKinsey estimates a shortage of approximately 100,000 advisors by 2034. Family offices often prioritize trust over other qualifications, leading to selectivity and difficulty in filling roles that require a combination of skills, such as a chief investment officer and CFO. To attract talent, some families are willing to pay a salary premium, but young employees remain hesitant due to a lack of clear corporate structure and career progression opportunities.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced he will lift sanctions on Syria ahead of a meeting with its interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, as part of his Middle East tour. The decision was met with celebration in Damascus, with officials hailing it as a "pivotal turning point" for the country. Al-Sharaa has called for the lifting of sanctions and the de-listing of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a terrorist organization, while also promising to protect ethnic minorities. Concerns remain regarding clashes between Islamist factions, security forces, and religious minorities, highlighting ongoing instability in the region.</p>

          <p>China has reasserted its territorial claims near its contested border with India by releasing ‚Äústandard‚Äù names for dozens of places in Arunachal Pradesh, a region China calls Zangnan. The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs published names for 27 geographical features in Chinese characters, Tibetan, and pinyin, along with detailed coordinates and a high-resolution map. This move comes despite recent efforts to improve relations between the two countries after a deadly military clash in the Galwan Valley in 2020 and a subsequent military standoff at the shared border. Late last year, China and India agreed to end their military standoff at the Himalayan border.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the plan to American special envoy Steve Witkoff in Oman, suggesting Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use. This proposal aims to create a permanent arrangement, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and would include on-the-ground oversight from other countries, potentially including the United States. While the idea is new and untested, it represents an attempt to move beyond maximalist demands and avert a potential military confrontation.</p>

          <p>Even as the United States and China take steps to rein in their trade war, Beijing is preparing for broader rivalry with Washington to continue. China is seeking economic and diplomatic opportunities across Asia while maintaining a tough stance on regional territorial claims and military competition. Despite a tariff truce, China remains wary of US intentions, including military presence in the Asia-Pacific and technology restrictions. China presents itself as a stable alternative, promoting economic cooperation but also asserting its claims in disputed territories like the South China Sea and around Taiwan, indicating a complex mix of diplomacy and power projection.</p>

          <p>A UNICEF report reveals that children in Japan continue to struggle with poor mental health, ranking 32nd among 43 developed and emerging nations, primarily due to high suicide rates. While Japan improved from 37th in 2020, its youth suicide rate is the fourth highest among wealthy states surveyed. In contrast, Japan ranks first in physical health and 12th in academic and social skills. Experts suggest there is a lack of awareness and ineffective government measures addressing children's mental health issues in Japan, while also noting the problem of underweight children alongside low obesity levels. The report highlights the pandemic's negative impact on children's well-being and calls for countries to address these issues in a modern world context.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team has inadvertently opened the door for prosecutors to introduce new evidence regarding a fight she had with her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, prior to his death. The prosecution argues this evidence could demonstrate the slaying as a "domestic violence homicide" and show Read's inability to accept O'Keefe's desire to end their relationship. Text messages introduced by the defense revealed Read's flirtatious exchanges with another man and complaints about O'Keefe. Prosecutors now plan to present testimony about an incident in Aruba where Read allegedly became enraged at O'Keefe for speaking to a female friend, claiming it shows intent, opportunity, or preparation ahead of O'Keefe's death.</p>

He made these remarks following a town hall in Iowa, addressing concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities, which arose after a poor debate performance against Donald Trump. Buttigieg emphasized that Biden was fully engaged and effective during their time working together, particularly during the Baltimore bridge collapse.

          <p>President Trump's repeated descriptions of U.S. mediation efforts between India and Pakistan have strained relations with India. India directly contradicted Trump's claims about trade offers and threats related to the cease-fire, worrying about being perceived as halting the conflict under outside pressure. Trump's approach, which treats India and Pakistan on equal terms and offers to mediate bilateral issues, has made India's political leaders vulnerable. This has led to questioning of India's closer ties with the U.S. and concerns about the re-emergence of the India-Pakistan hyphenation in foreign policy.</p>

Consumer Watchdog claims State Farm refused to provide paperwork corroborating its dire financial straits, while the organization's actuaries determined the rate increase was not justified.

          <p>A House committee session to consider Medicaid cuts and other key parts of President Trump‚Äôs domestic policy bill was disrupted by protests and partisan clashes. Protesters shouted at lawmakers, leading to arrests, while Republicans and Democrats argued over the Medicaid cuts. Democrats accused Republicans of taking health care away from vulnerable people, while Republicans accused Democrats of misrepresenting the Medicaid cuts. The committee also debated a $2.5 trillion tax proposal and considered cuts to nutrition assistance. Disagreements over Medicaid coverage and the Affordable Care Act have become a major point of contention, with Republicans arguing their proposed cuts would control rising Medicaid costs.</p>
