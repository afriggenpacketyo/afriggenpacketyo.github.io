          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will inform other nations of the tariff rates the U.S. will impose on imports, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick sending the letters. These tariffs, which are intended to encourage businesses to relocate manufacturing to the U.S., have raised concerns among retailers like Walmart, who warn of potential price hikes for consumers. Goldman Sachs analysts anticipate that the U.S.'s effective tariff rate will significantly increase, reaching levels not seen since the 1930s.

          <p>Members of Parliament are debating proposed changes to a bill that would legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults with a life expectancy of six months or less. The discussions include the role of doctors, safeguards against coercion, and concerns about vulnerable individuals. Amendments under consideration aim to ensure no obligation to assist and prevent medical staff from initiating the topic with patients. The government remains neutral, allowing MPs a free vote based on their conscience.</p>

          <p>Japan and South Korea are planning to establish fast-track entry lanes for tourists at four airports in June to expedite immigration, marking the 60th anniversary of diplomatic normalization. The lanes will be available for a month at Haneda and Fukuoka airports in Japan, and Gimpo and Gimhae airports in South Korea. The system aims to facilitate travel between the two countries, which have become popular tourist destinations.

          <p>In 1993, Jeanie Childs was found murdered in her Minneapolis apartment, with bloody, bare footprints providing a crucial clue.

Westrom denied knowing Childs, but authorities collected his footprints for comparison. The case highlights the importance of forensic evidence and investigative genetic genealogy in solving cold cases.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how new GLP-1 drugs, like Wegovy and Ozempic, have exposed flaws in the American healthcare system. Despite their effectiveness in treating obesity-related complications, access is limited due to high costs and insurance complexities. Patients face difficult choices between financial hardship, less effective treatments, or potentially unsafe compounded medications. The author argues that the healthcare system is failing to address the biological nature of obesity and that pharmaceutical companies, the FDA, and health insurers are contributing to the problem.
