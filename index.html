          <p>With Japan's aging population and a rise in childless couples, more seniors are turning to bequest donations to hospitals and nonprofits. Yoko Inaba, a 71-year-old, is one such individual who has decided to donate her savings to a medical facility for newborns, finding relief in knowing how her money will be used after her death. Readyfor Inc. mediates between donors and recipients, seeing an increase in demand for their services, especially for donations to child care, health care, and educational institutions. The Supreme Court reports a threefold increase in money going into the national treasury due to the absence of inheritors, highlighting the growing need for bequest donation services.</p>

Trump defended crypto, criticizing the previous administration's enforcement actions and promising a change of approach.

          <p>The Greater Washington area is heartbroken and shaken after two Israeli Embassy employees were shot and killed in what the F.B.I. director described as ‚Äútargeted anti-Semitic violence‚Äù. Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum, where the American Jewish Committee was hosting a reception for young diplomats. The community is processing the tragedy, with many expressing defiance and solidarity. The rise in antisemitism since the 2018 attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh has left many Jews feeling less secure.</p>

          <p>North Korea has begun investigating and arresting those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer after leader Kim Jong Un expressed fury over the incident. The 5,000-ton-class warship was damaged during a launch ceremony at the port of Chongjin, with satellite imagery showing the vessel lying on its side. While North Korea claims the damage is not serious and can be repaired in about 10 days, analysts suggest repairs are more likely to take months. The incident is seen as a demonstration of Kim's resolve to advance his naval capabilities.</p>
