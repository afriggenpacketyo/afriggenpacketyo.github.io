          <p>Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital have reached a nearly $1 billion settlement with victims of gynecologist Robert Hadden, who committed sexual assaults over two decades. Victims like Laurie Maldonado and Eva Santos Veloz have criticized the institutions for failing to protect patients and enabling Hadden's behavior. Hadden was convicted in 2023 and sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients across state lines to sexually assault them. The settlement raises questions about the culture within medical institutions that allows such abuse to persist.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering the migration patterns of birds, affecting their ability to feed and breed effectively. Rising sea levels are impacting coastal resting spots, while ocean acidification threatens small crustaceans, a key food source for migratory birds. Extreme weather events also pose a threat, and warmer temperatures can lead to birds shortening their routes or abandoning migration altogether, causing conflicts with resident animals. While humans can help by expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly habitats, some species, like the slender-billed curlew, have already been declared extinct due to habitat loss.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that nearly half of Tesla owners believe their vehicles have been intentionally damaged, with the majority of incidents occurring in the southern United States. The report suggests that Tesla vehicles have become targets due to negative sentiment towards CEO Elon Musk. Many Tesla owners report increased insurance premiums and have installed or enabled video surveillance on their cars out of fear. The average repair bill for intentional damage is around $1,900, with Gen Z drivers facing the most hostility.</p>

The Saints recently drafted Tyler Shough, signaling a potential future at quarterback, and have other QBs on the roster to fill the gap left by Carr's departure.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers is facing bankruptcy as weight loss injections like Mounjaro gain popularity, disrupting the diet industry. The company, once synonymous with safe and controlled weight loss, has lost over a million members and is struggling to compete with social media influencers and weight loss medications. While WeightWatchers stresses its commitment to a holistic model of care, some experts worry about the long-term effects of weight loss injections. These experts argue that understanding the psychological reasons behind overeating is crucial for effective and sustainable weight loss.</p>
