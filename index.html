        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has intensified its criticism of the Federal Reserve, with the Office of Management and Budget accusing Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement. The accusation centers on a renovation of the Fed's headquarters, which is allegedly $700 million over budget and described as "ostentatious." This move is seen as another front in the administration's ongoing pressure campaign against Powell and the central bank's interest rate policies, raising questions about potential actions to remove him.</p>

          <p>A White House proposal to rescind funding for public broadcasting is facing resistance from some Senate Republicans. These senators are particularly concerned about the impact on rural and tribal radio stations, which often serve as the sole source for local news and critical emergency alerts. The debate highlights a divide over the value of public media, especially for remote communities that rely on it for safety information amid natural disasters like recent floods.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Philharmonic opened its 103rd season at the Hollywood Bowl with a program of Russian composers, a choice that felt relevant in the current geopolitical climate. The review noted a somewhat somber mood, lower-than-expected attendance, and the reduced presence of music director Gustavo Dudamel. Despite some technical issues, the performances, led by guest conductor Thomas Sondergard, were described as powerful and intense, fitting the mood of the times.</p>

The capital, Monrovia, is named after a U.S. president, and the country's culture retains a strong American influence from this shared history.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the concept of "middlebrow," using a fiery 1932 letter by Virginia Woolf as a starting point. Woolf championed "highbrow" art and had an appreciation for "lowbrow" life, but reserved special contempt for the "middlebrow," which she saw as a dishonest, fashion-driven consumer of smoothed-out art. The essay reflects on how this term has evolved, now often referring to anything perceived as harmlessly pedestrian, and explores the ongoing cultural debates about taste.</p>
