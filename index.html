          <p>Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, has declared that Gaza City faces destruction if Hamas does not agree to disarm and release all remaining hostages, a stance backed by cabinet approval for a major assault. This ultimatum follows Hamas's acceptance of a 60-day ceasefire proposal, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly rejected, demanding terms "acceptable to Israel" for ending the war. With only an estimated 20 of 50 hostages believed to be alive, the Israeli Defense Forces have urged Gaza City's one million residents to evacuate south, exacerbating fears of an already dire humanitarian crisis and potential famine. The UN has cited intensifying attacks, warning of high civilian casualties and large-scale destruction as the conflict continues.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed key component suppliers, including Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics, to halt production of its China-specific H20 general processing units. This directive follows weeks after the Chinese government urged local tech companies to stop buying these chips, citing national security concerns regarding potential tracking technology or "backdoors." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged these discussions, asserting the company has clarified that such backdoors do not exist and that the H20 is intended for commercial, not military, use. The situation highlights the ongoing difficulties for Nvidia and other tech firms navigating complex trade uncertainties and security scrutiny between Washington and Beijing, impacting market conditions and supply chains.

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised an earlier order on stray dogs in New Delhi, now mandating that animals be caught, sterilized, and immunized before release, unless they are rabid or aggressive. The court also prohibited public feeding of strays, instructing civic bodies to establish designated feeding zones to curb the estimated 800,000 to one million stray dogs. This decision follows widespread protests from animal rights activists who criticized the previous order for mass removal as impractical and inhumane. The court cited nearly 2,000 daily dog bite incidents in New Delhi and aims to frame a nationwide policy to address public safety and animal welfare.</p>

          <p>Millions of travelers across the UK are bracing for significant disruption this bank holiday weekend, contending with busy roads, a rail strike, and extensive engineering works. The RMT union strike will halt CrossCountry rail services on Saturday, with limited operations on Sunday and Monday, impacting routes from Aberdeen to Cornwall and connections from Birmingham. Additionally, road networks, particularly the M5 between Bristol and Devon and parts of the M20 in Kent, are expected to experience heavy traffic as 17.6 million holiday trips are anticipated. Despite a mostly dry weather forecast for numerous festivals and events nationwide, Network Rail and the RAC advise checking journeys and setting off early to mitigate widespread delays.</p>

The company, part of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire, was deemed "hopelessly insolvent" with substantial debts. The decision prevents a "pre-pack administration" favored by Gupta, with creditors arguing for independent management to ensure steel production restarts. This follows previous government intervention in British Steel, highlighting ongoing challenges for the UK's strategic steel industry.</p>

          <p>European stocks are poised to open lower as investors continue to assess the comprehensive details of the EU-U.S. trade deal, which were released mid-week. The agreement stipulates the EU will invest $750 billion in U.S. energy and $600 billion in the U.S., in exchange for a 15% tariff cap on its goods, significantly lower than previously threatened rates. While the pharmaceutical sector saw some relief with tariffs capped at 15%, automotive stocks declined due to conditional tariff reductions, dependent on the EU lowering its own industrial duties. European investors are closely monitoring key economic data, including French business confidence, German GDP figures, and the U.K. consumer confidence update, for further market direction.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is moving away from the northeastern U.S. coast as a Category 1 storm, though dangerous swimming conditions are expected to persist for days along most East Coast beaches. The storm, which briefly reached Category 5, is still bringing tropical storm-force gusts to Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Bermuda. While not forecast for a direct U.S. landfall, Erin caused tropical storm conditions and significant storm surge in parts of the Outer Banks, leading to evacuations and life-threatening rip currents. Officials urge adherence to warnings, as rip currents account for over 80% of beach rescues.</p>

This alleged self-censorship is reportedly driven by a new Israeli registration process that demands sensitive data, including personal information of Palestinian staff, by September 2025. Aid workers fear this regulation, which allows denial of permits to organizations supporting legal proceedings against Israeli soldiers or boycotts, is designed to block impartial aid and silence advocacy. Many humanitarian staff express profound distress, feeling compelled to compromise their principles to maintain even limited operational access in Gaza, despite the severe humanitarian crisis and the GHF's controversial near-monopoly on aid distribution.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as one of "the greatest companies in the history of humanity," suggesting that investing in its stock would be "very smart." Huang's comments, made during a visit to Taiwan, were primarily to thank TSMC for their work on Nvidia's next-generation AI chip platform, Rubin, and six other new products, including new CPUs and GPUs. This comes amidst discussions about the U.S. administration potentially acquiring equity stakes in tech companies receiving CHIPS Act funding, though a Wall Street Journal report indicated no such plans for firms significantly increasing U.S. investments, like TSMC with its $165 billion U.S. expansion.

          <p>India and Russia have committed to deepening bilateral trade ties, openly defying U.S. tariff threats aimed at curbing India's substantial imports of Russian oil. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar emphasized the "steadiest" relationship between the two nations, announcing plans to boost India's exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and textiles to Russia, and send skilled Indian workers to address Russian labor shortages. This partnership continues despite Western sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine war, with India arguing its oil purchases help stabilize global markets. Geopolitical experts suggest that U.S. President Trump's tariff strategy primarily aims to leverage trade deals and a Ukraine ceasefire, rather than solely curbing Russian oil revenues.

          <p>Major Japanese automakers, including industry giants Toyota and Honda, have explicitly denied directly passing the costs of U.S. tariffs onto American car buyers. This contradicts a Nikkei Asia report that suggested Japanese automakers were shifting some tariff expenses to consumers, despite the U.S. initially imposing 25% tariffs on automobiles, which were later reduced to 15% after a trade deal. Toyota clarified that its recent price increases were standard annual adjustments reflecting various operational costs, not a direct response to tariffs, aiming to maintain vehicle affordability. Honda similarly attributed any price changes to enhanced feature content, highlighting its ability to absorb tariff impacts due to a high percentage of American-made vehicles.

          <p>Chocolate prices are expected to continue rising for consumers due to the lagged impact of soaring cocoa prices, which reached record highs amidst adverse weather conditions and supply tightness in West Africa. Chocolatiers are still processing the heightened costs incurred in late 2024, leading to an ongoing "hangover" effect that is being passed through to consumers. However, the outlook for next year's Easter season appears somewhat brighter, with industrial demand softening and supply improving from new plantings in Ecuador and Brazil reaching maturity. Despite this potential short-term relief, experts warn that long-standing productivity challenges and underinvestment in major cocoa-producing regions will likely keep prices structurally higher than historical levels.

She emphasized the critical need for "credible and robust" security guarantees for Ukraine, advocating for a strong Ukrainian army rather than relying solely on agreements "just on paper."

          <p>Thailand's former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, has been acquitted of royal defamation charges that could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence, easing a significant legal threat to his political dynasty. A Bangkok court found insufficient evidence to convict him for remarks made in a 2015 interview concerning the 2014 coup that removed his sister from power. This ruling is considered unusual, as acquittals in lese majeste cases, which criminalize criticism of the monarchy and carry severe penalties, are rare in Thailand. The verdict allows Thaksin, who remains a central figure in Thai politics, to navigate a complex political landscape where his family's influence has recently waned.</p>

The high court lifted a lower court order that had required the NIH to restore these grants, although the underlying legal challenge from 16 states and a coalition of research groups will continue in a lower court. This decision empowers the administration to retract awards it deems misaligned with its policy objectives, which include directives to federal agencies to cease funding DEI and gender identity initiatives.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has made a significant discovery, revealing that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas called linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. This groundbreaking research, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, offers crucial insights into how planting density affects both plant growth and defense mechanisms. The study, conducted in maize fields in Hainan, China, demonstrated that corn plants in densely planted inner rows suffered less herbivore damage but also exhibited reduced growth compared to those at the edges. Optimizing the release of this natural chemical could potentially be leveraged to combat agricultural pests and significantly increase crop yields, benefiting global food security.</p>

          <p>Colombia is grappling with its most serious security crisis in decades following two separate and deadly attacks that killed at least 18 people and injured dozens. A car bomb detonated on a busy street in Cali, killing six and wounding over 60 near a military aviation school, an act attributed to the "Mordisco" narco-cartel, a dissident faction of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Earlier, a drone attack against a police helicopter outside Medellin killed 12 officers who were on a mission to eradicate coca leaf crops, with the EMC guerrilla group being blamed. These coordinated acts of violence pose fresh challenges to Colombia's fragile peace processes ahead of upcoming elections, leading to martial law in Cali and a national security council meeting.</p>
