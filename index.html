          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk sidestepped a reporter's inquiry about a New York Times article detailing his alleged drug use and family drama during President Trump's campaign. Musk, who led the DOGE government cost-cutting initiative, spoke over Fox News reporter Peter Doocy when asked about the report. The Times claimed Musk consumed ketamine beyond occasional use and allegedly used Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. Musk questioned the credibility of the New York Times, referencing a judge's ruling regarding their reporting on Russia-gate. Musk was a major financial supporter of Trump's 2024 campaign. The court decision Musk referenced declined to pause a defamation lawsuit Trump filed against members of the Pulitzer Prize board.</p>

          <p>Representative Jamie Raskin, the leading Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, is requesting further details from the new U.S. pardon attorney regarding President Trump's recent pardons. Raskin alleges that the traditional clemency application system has been supplanted by favors to loyalists and donors, pointing to pardons for convicted fraudsters and others with ties to Trump. He asserts that the administration has altered pardon criteria to prioritize loyalty and financial contributions, rather than adherence to established Justice Department standards. A Justice Department spokesperson responded by referencing potential pardons by former President Biden and questioning Raskin's stance on Hunter Biden's situation. The current president's pardon power is broad, but Raskin is concerned that it is being used inappropriately. The article also mentions that Martin will also serve as director of the Justice Department's "Weaponization Working Group".</p>

          <p>This NPR segment covers two distinct global stories: the death of the legendary Bolshoi Ballet choreographer Yuri Grigorovich, and Nepal's first-ever monkey census. Grigorovich, who served as the Bolshoi Ballet's artistic director for three decades during the Soviet era, is remembered for his wildly popular productions that also projected soft power overseas. In Nepal, the government is undertaking a monkey census to address the ongoing issue of monkeys stealing food from people's property. The census aims to provide a clearer understanding of the extent of the problem and inform future mitigation strategies.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, celebrated for her portrayal of Maj. Margaret Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has passed away at the age of 87. Swit died at her home in New York City, reportedly of natural causes. She was widely recognized for her role as a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce on "M*A*S*H," which ran for 11 seasons on CBS. The show, adapted from the 1970 film, maintained an anti-establishment ethos while toning down some of the movie's more explicit content.</p>

          <p>There is a growing trend of crimes combining cybertheft with violence, known as "wrench attacks," in which criminals physically threaten crypto owners to reveal their account passwords. The rise in these attacks is partly attributed to the increasing value of bitcoin and the relative ease of stealing digital wallets compared to traditional bank accounts. The crypto world's culture of flaunting wealth on social media also makes it easier for criminals to identify potential targets. A recent case in New York City involved investors allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist in an attempt to steal his cryptocurrency holdings, highlighting the extreme nature of these crimes. The article indicates that Bitcoin traded Friday at nearly $105,000 per token. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests that more significant measures are needed to address America's soaring deficits and national debt, particularly concerning entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.

The CDC advises consumers to discard any cucumbers if the source is unknown and to wash surfaces that may have come into contact with the contaminated produce.

Musk praised the DOGE team for saving $175 billion in government spending, though the program's initial goal was much higher.

          <p>The remains of 19 Black New Orleanians, whose skulls were dismembered and shipped to Germany in the late 1800s for racist research, have been repatriated for memorialization and burial. The research, which sought to prove the debunked theory that Black people's brains were smaller, was conducted on individuals who died at New Orleans' charity hospital. Leipzig University contacted the city of New Orleans to inform it of the 19 skulls. The city formed a cultural repatriation committee, led by historian Eva Baham, which includes representatives from Dillard University, the city of New Orleans, the University medical center and other community partners.</p>

          <p>As U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger retires, he expresses concern over the surge in threats against members of Congress, which have more than quadrupled in recent years. The department is expanding its protection efforts nationwide to address these threats. Manger notes that the Capitol Police has been understaffed for years but has made progress in securing staffing and resources. He has helped secure large budget increases for his department to help protect the Capitol campus, its members, staffers and visitors. Manger's budget request for 2026 is nearly $1 billion, approximately double the funding the department was given in 2021, prior to the Capitol riot, and it's about a 20% boost over funding levels in the current spending agreement.</p>

Emergency teams were called to HMP Long Lartin in South Littleton, near Evesham, Worcestershire, on Friday just before 08:40 BST. The Ministry of Justice confirmed that the staff member is in stable condition, and police recovered a weapon. Initial investigations suggest a disagreement between the inmate and the officer escalated.

The email cited "information identified by the Department of Homeland Security" as apparently giving evidence that Harvard University has "failed to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism." The stricter vetting procedure now targeting America's leading global university is the result of two executive orders signed by President Trump: One that directed more vetting for visas, and one calling for a crackdown on antisemitism, per the email.</p>
