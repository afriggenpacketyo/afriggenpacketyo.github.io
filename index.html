          <p>A new study from Chinese researchers suggests that sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, may possess cancer-fighting properties. The research, published in the journal Nature, indicates the drug could enhance the immune system's ability to combat tumors by restoring the function of dendritic cells, which act as key intelligence agents for immunity. This discovery is being hailed by Westlake University as a potential new strategy for tumor immunotherapy, offering a novel approach to cancer treatment by strengthening the body's natural defenses.</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities have detained three more mayors from the main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), as part of a continuing crackdown. The arrests in Adana, Antalya, and Adiyaman follow a series of detentions targeting hundreds of CHP members, including Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The CHP claims these actions are politically motivated to neutralize opposition following their success in local elections, while the government maintains the judiciary is acting independently on charges like extortion and corruption.</p>

          <p>Hamas has delivered what it terms a "positive response" to the latest US-proposed ceasefire and hostage release deal for Gaza, signaling a readiness for immediate negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official indicated that Hamas has requested several amendments, including a halt to a US-backed aid system and an American guarantee that the war will not resume if talks fail. While Israel has not officially commented, US President Donald Trump expressed cautious optimism, suggesting a deal could be reached soon amid ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A software engineer from Mumbai, Soham Parekh, has become the center of a debate on "extreme hustle culture" after being exposed for simultaneously working for multiple Silicon Valley startups. Several founders, including those from Playground AI and Antimetal, confirmed they had hired and subsequently fired him upon discovering the deception. Parekh admitted to the practice, citing "extremely dire financial circumstances" as his motivation, though some in the tech community question the ethics while others are intrigued by the logistics of managing such a workload, highlighting a broader trend of "overemployment."</p>

While timely payments could help consumers build a credit history, missed payments could negatively impact their scores. This move provides lenders with a more complete financial picture of borrowers but also highlights that BNPL services lack some consumer protections offered by traditional credit cards.

They are focusing their messaging on the legislation's nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which they frame as an "all-out assault" on American healthcare. While Republicans promote the bill's potential for economic growth, polling shows public opposition and high favorability for Medicaid, creating a political hurdle for the GOP and a potential opening for Democrats to regain control of the House.</p>

One study suggests people from "carpentered" Western environments perceive illusions differently than those from rural Namibia, supporting a 60-year-old hypothesis. However, another study convincingly debunks this explanation for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion. The author concludes that while perceptual diversity exists, it's complex, likely occurring within cultures as much as between them, reminding us that our experience is always an active construction by the brain.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations of a "binge drinking culture" and blurred sexual boundaries at Bangor Cathedral in Wales. Former choir members described events like a "seven last shots of Christ" drinking game on Good Friday and pressure to consume alcohol. These claims follow two critical reports that highlighted safeguarding weaknesses and led to the immediate retirement of the Archbishop of Wales, Andrew John. The Church in Wales has acknowledged the issues, stating that the "abuse of alcohol is always inappropriate" and that a new policy is being developed.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic flash flood in Texas has resulted in the deaths of at least 24 people, with a major search and rescue operation underway for up to 25 girls missing from a Christian summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in under an hour, sweeping away homes and vehicles near Kerrville. Officials have declared a state of emergency, admitting they had no warning system for a flood of this magnitude and that rainfall far exceeded forecasts, leaving the community devastated by the sudden tragedy.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's sweeping "liberation day" tariffs is set to expire, creating renewed uncertainty for the global economy as dozens of trade deals have not materialized. While some narrow agreements have been reached with countries like the UK and China, businesses still face higher costs from existing tariffs. Economists and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warn that these costs are ultimately passed on to US consumers, contributing to inflation, regardless of whether the president reimposes the most severe rates.

          <p>Authorities have discovered human remains at the site of a massive explosion and fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California.

          <p>Despite attracting over a million people, Pride in London and similar events across the UK are facing an uncertain future due to significant financial pressures. Organizers report a sharp decline in corporate sponsorships, which they attribute partly to a pullback from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by global corporations. This funding crisis has already led to the cancellation or scaling back of some Pride events, while others, like Salford Pride, are forced to charge for tickets for the first time to cover rising operational costs.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by identifying a "genetic switch" that restored damaged ear tissue in mice. The study, published in the journal *Science*, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key vitamin A derivative. By reactivating this disabled genetic pathway, the researchers achieved complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage, offering hope that this mechanism could one day be applied to organ regeneration in humans.</p>

          <p>The administration of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te is facing a "revisionist dilemma" as it reshapes the island's historical narrative surrounding World War II. Critics accuse the government of honoring the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory while simultaneously downplaying its pre-1949 mainland Chinese roots. This approach aligns with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's emphasis on a distinct Taiwanese identity, separate from the mainland, creating a complex tension between celebrating the ROC's historical legacy and forging a new national consciousness.</p>
