        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed a comprehensive executive order, the "Protecting Chicago Initiative," designed to safeguard residents' rights against a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order explicitly aims to prohibit federal agents operating in Chicago from wearing masks, mandates they display clear identifying information, and forbids city police from collaborating in federal actions that might violate constitutional rights. Johnson articulated strong concerns about the prospect of militarized activity and the potential for families to be separated, asserting the city's commitment to employing all available legal avenues to resist perceived federal overreach. This proactive measure follows "highly credible reports" indicating the imminent arrival of federal agents, a development that has already drawn sharp criticism from the White House.</p>

          <p>Iowa Hawkeyes coach Kirk Ferentz achieved a significant milestone, tying legendary Ohio State coach Woody Hayes as the Big Ten's all-time winningest coach with his 205th victory at Iowa. This historic win came as the Hawkeyes defeated Albany 34-7 on Saturday night, marking Ferentz's 23rd season-opening triumph. Despite a sluggish offensive start and a challenging debut for new quarterback Mark Gronowski, who transferred from South Dakota State, the team secured the victory. Running back Xavier Williams delivered a standout performance with 122 yards and a touchdown, stepping up when the starting running back was injured. Ferentz, the longest-tenured active head coach in college football, humbly downplayed the personal achievement, prioritizing the team's success.</p>

          <p>This article details the chilling true story of Dino Guglielmelli, a millionaire supplement company owner, who orchestrated a murder-for-hire plot against his ex-wife, Monica Olsen. Consumed by anger during their divorce, Guglielmelli hired Rick Fuhrmann to kill Olsen, initially attempting to have her framed or deported. Fuhrmann, however, exposed the plot to authorities and cooperated by wearing a wire, recording Guglielmelli explicitly agreeing to pay $80,000 for his wife's death, which he desired to appear as a drug-related sexual assault in Mexico. Guglielmelli was arrested and later pleaded guilty to attempted murder, serving six years in prison, while Olsen continues to fear for her safety post-release.</p>

Quarterback Jayden Maiava had a seamless debut, completing 15 of 18 passes for 295 yards and two touchdowns before halftime, while the defense recorded five sacks and a pick-six, showcasing significant improvement. This game, originally slated as a marquee matchup but later changed due to USC's move to the Big Ten, served as a dominant, albeit unchallenged, start to the season. The offensive prowess, including three plays of over 60 yards and no punts, indicated the team's readiness despite the lower-tier opponent.</p>

          <p>Florida State delivered a stunning 31-17 upset victory over No. 8 Alabama, abruptly ending the Crimson Tide’s impressive 23-game season-opener winning streak. New quarterback Tommy Castellanos spearheaded Florida State's punishing rushing attack, gaining 78 yards and scoring a touchdown, contributing significantly to the unranked Seminoles' unexpected win. This early-season loss immediately casts doubt on Alabama's College Football Playoff aspirations and intensifies pressure on first-year coach Kalen DeBoer, who took over from legendary Nick Saban. The Seminoles' physical play under new offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn was evident, accumulating 230 rushing yards.

          <p>This article, an opinion piece by reporter Michael Daly, delves into the complex question of blame in the heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes, for which Alix Tichelman pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. Daly questions whether Hayes, who arranged the meeting and asked Tichelman to inject him, shares significant responsibility for his own demise. He highlights that Tichelman faced criminal charges while Hayes, a prominent figure, is largely given a pass for creating the dangerous situation. The article ultimately suggests that the answers to accountability lie in ethics rather than just forensics, leaving the reader to ponder the moral implications.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth investigation into the mysterious death of Google executive Forrest Hayes, found deceased on his yacht in Santa Cruz. Surveillance video from the yacht proved crucial, revealing that Hayes met with Alix Tichelman, a 26-year-old model found through the SeekingArrangement.com website. The footage showed Tichelman injecting Hayes with heroin, after which he went into distress, and she subsequently cleaned up evidence and left without calling for help. This led to her arrest for prostitution and charges in Hayes' death. The case also brought to light a previous heroin overdose death of Tichelman's fiancé, Dean Riopelle, just two months prior, prompting a re-examination of that incident.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social his intention to issue an executive order mandating voter identification for every vote, with "NO EXCEPTIONS!" He further declared plans to end mail-in voting, except for specific cases involving the "Very Ill, And The Far Away Military." Trump consistently makes unsubstantiated claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 election and illegal voting by non-citizens. The constitutional authority for such an executive order is uncertain, given that federal elections are primarily administered at the state level, which could lead to significant legal challenges. This announcement signals a continued focus on election integrity issues ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

This shift presents a crucial opportunity for the KMT to capitalize on growing discontent with the DPP, but the lack of a clear successor for the party leadership is seen by some as a "poisoned chalice," highlighting internal divisions at a volatile time in Taiwanese politics.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced plans to remove all net-zero requirements on oil and gas companies drilling in the North Sea if elected, aiming to solely "maximise extraction" of these resources. This policy shift, to be formally unveiled in Aberdeen, directly contrasts with the Labour government's commitment to banning new exploration licenses and pursuing a "fair and orderly transition" away from fossil fuels. Badenoch argues that current net-zero requirements burden the economy and that it is "absurd" for the UK to leave "vital resources untapped" while neighboring countries extract from the same seabed. This move signals a significant departure in Conservative climate policy, which previously committed to reaching net-zero by 2050 as enshrined in law.</p>

          <p>The historic Bayeux Tapestry is set to close to the public in France on Monday as it prepares for a controversial loan to the British Museum in London next September. French art experts are fiercely opposed to the move, fearing that the nearly 1,000-year-old, 70-meter-long masterpiece is too delicate to withstand the vibrations of road transport, potentially causing irreparable damage. Despite a French official defending the move and citing a study, a petition against the "cultural crime" has garnered 60,000 signatures. The loan, announced by President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer, is part of a cultural exchange, with Anglo-Saxon artifacts traveling to Normandy in return.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are employing an unusual arsenal, including sniffer dogs, drones, and nuclear atmospheric dispersion models, to combat the spruce bark beetle, a tiny but devastating threat to British forests. This hairy beetle, which has ravaged European spruce trees, was found to be spreading to the UK via winds across the English Channel, not just imported wood. While the UK claims to have eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in the east and southeast, climate change poses an increasing risk by stressing trees and boosting beetle populations in Europe. The innovative methods aim to protect the UK's 725,000 hectares of spruce, valued at £2.9 billion annually.</p>

          <p>A California state bill, SB 256, aimed at mandating investor-owned utilities like Southern California Edison to remove decommissioned power lines to mitigate wildfire risks, unexpectedly failed in Sacramento on Friday. Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, whose district was devastated by the Eaton fire and where a decommissioned line was a leading hypothesis for the ignition, expressed deep frustration over the bill's demise. She voiced concerns about accountability and suggested that powerful utilities might have engaged in "shadow lobbying" to prevent its passage, despite formally withdrawing their opposition. The legislation sought to significantly enhance wildfire mitigation planning and improve the safety of electrical infrastructure across the state.</p>

He shared security footage showing subcontractors moving heavy landscaping equipment with a broken and tilting cart, which he claimed caused the "deep and nasty" imperfection. Trump, who oversaw the controversial redesign with First Lady Melania, declared he had fired the contractor responsible and vowed they would "never" work at the White House again. He emphasized his personal pride in the stonework, honed from his building career, and highlighted the effectiveness of the White House's security video equipment in capturing the moment of damage.</p>

          <p>This investigative article exposes the largely unregulated for-profit body broker industry in the US, where companies acquire, dissect, and sell human body parts, often to medical research centers. Critics liken the practice to "grave-robbery," citing cases like Harold Dillard's, whose family believed his body would be handled respectfully but later learned his head was found in a warehouse with other dismembered parts. The article highlights how loose US regulations, which allow charging "reasonable amounts" for "processing," enable this global trade. It underscores the ethical dilemma between essential medical research and the potential exploitation of vulnerable individuals and grieving families.</p>

          <p>New government data in England reveals that pupils who were partially absent during the first week of school in September 2024 were significantly more likely to become "persistently absent" later in the year, missing at least 10% of school. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize full attendance at the start of the 2025 term, emphasizing that "every day of school missed is a day stolen from a child's future." While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains a greater challenge than pre-Covid levels.

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa plans to announce that she will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that will open up a potentially fierce and competitive Senate race. Ernst, who was first elected in 2014, made history as the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran, winning her second term in 2020. Her decision has already prompted fellow Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson to eye the soon-to-be-open seat, with several Democrats also announcing their candidacies.

He argued that Trump's move might be part of a plan to "stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections," calling it "an attack on the American people." The White House, however, dismissed Pritzker's accusations, urging him to address Chicago's crime crisis.</p>
