Notably, H&M shares surged significantly after its quarterly earnings surpassed expectations, providing a bright spot in the otherwise cautious market.

          <p>The Co-op has revealed that a significant cyber-attack earlier this year resulted in at least £206 million in lost revenue. The security breach, which occurred in April, caused severe disruption, including payment system failures, product shortages, and the theft of data from all 6.5 million members. This incident contributed to an underlying pre-tax loss of £75 million for the first half of the year, a stark contrast to the profit reported in the same period last year. The full financial impact may still grow.</p>

While not currently a Member of Parliament, Burnham did not rule out a future leadership bid, highlighting the internal pressures facing the Prime Minister ahead of the party conference. His comments have been interpreted as a potential leadership pitch, criticizing the current government's approach and suggesting a need for "wholesale change" to address what he terms an "existential" threat to the party.</p>

          <p>A leading UK charity, Whizz Kids, has warned of a "national crisis" regarding wheelchair provision for disabled children, forcing it to close to new referrals for the first time in 35 years. The organization reports a surge in demand, which it attributes to an increasing number of rejections by the NHS due to budget constraints. Consequently, thousands of children are left waiting for months for essential mobility equipment, with many experiencing pain and a loss of independence. The situation highlights systemic underfunding and its profound impact on vulnerable children's quality of life.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Ragasa, previously a super typhoon, has caused widespread devastation and at least 25 deaths across the Philippines, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The storm, which was the world's strongest cyclone this year, brought powerful winds and flooding, leading to mass evacuations, power outages, and significant infrastructure damage in China's Guangdong province. After weakening, the storm is now moving towards Vietnam, where authorities are preparing for its arrival. Clean-up and recovery efforts are underway in the affected regions.</p>

This marks the third successful identification from the initiative, which publicly releases information and shares records like fingerprints globally. The identification provides a name to the victim, previously known as "the woman in pink," and offers new leads for the ongoing investigation into her suspicious death.</p>

The deal involves an upfront payment of US$18 million and potential future payments up to US$1.1 billion based on performance milestones. This move is part of Hengrui's strategy to leverage international partnerships to bring its innovative drugs to the global market.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has strongly criticized recent U.S. airstrikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean, labeling them an "act of tyranny" and "murder." The strikes, which have reportedly killed 17 people, are part of the Trump administration's efforts to stop the flow of illegal narcotics. Petro questioned the necessity of lethal force, arguing that the boats could be intercepted and the crews arrested without fatalities, as has been done in past collaborative operations. He called for criminal proceedings against U.S. officials if investigations confirm Colombian citizens were among those killed.</p>

In a social media post, he detailed an escalator coming to an abrupt halt, a teleprompter failing during his speech to the General Assembly, and an audio system malfunction in the auditorium. Trump dismissed the incidents as a coincidence and demanded an immediate investigation by the UN Secretary-General. A UN official suggested the escalator's safety feature may have been inadvertently triggered by a videographer.</p>

According to an Oxford Economics study, imports reached 9,516 megawatts, a significant increase from the previous year. This surge is driven by falling costs and the development of large-scale energy projects by Chinese firms in countries like South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria. Given China's dominance in solar panel manufacturing, these import figures serve as a strong indicator of Africa's accelerating transition towards renewable energy.</p>
