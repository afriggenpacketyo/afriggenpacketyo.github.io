          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland has informed the Department of Justice that there is insufficient evidence to charge Senator Adam Schiff with mortgage fraud. This development comes after President Trump publicly called for Schiff's criminal prosecution. Despite the prosecutor's assessment, a senior Justice Department official is reportedly pushing to keep the investigation active. Schiff's attorney previously dismissed the allegations as "transparently false" and "long debunked," indicating a continued political dimension to the probe.</p>

          <p>Industry experts at the 11th Global Blockchain Summit anticipate that increased collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China could significantly advance the cryptocurrency sector. Hong Kong leads in crypto regulation, while the mainland excels in fintech development, including digital payments and AI. Despite the central government's long-standing ban on many crypto activities on the mainland, both markets are expected to gain from shared initiatives. Organizations like the Solana Foundation are already investing in China's developer ecosystem, highlighting the region's importance in the global payments industry.</p>

          <p>A 45-year-old German man tragically died while swimming in a Corsican river after being swept away by a torrent of water during Storm Benjamin. His wife and two daughters were rescued, but his body was later recovered. The storm has caused significant disruption across Corsica and other parts of France, with wind gusts up to 170 km/h, leading to numerous flight and ferry cancellations. Over 60,000 people across France also experienced power outages as the storm swept through the region, underscoring the severe impact of the weather.</p>

The probe uncovered two schemes: one where players allegedly faked injuries to manipulate betting odds, and another involving an illegal poker ring tied to New York crime families. The NBA has placed the implicated individuals on immediate leave, cooperating fully with authorities as they prioritize the integrity of the game.</p>

          <p>The demolition of the White House East Wing is nearing completion, making way for President Trump's privately funded $300 million ballroom project. Construction crews are now focusing on debris removal, with the structure largely reduced to rubble. The White House maintains that presidential approval is only required for "vertical construction," not demolition, citing a legal opinion. The project has drawn criticism, but the administration dismissed it as "manufactured outrage." A list of corporate and individual donors, including major tech giants, has been released to fund the initiative.</p>

Experts argue the military presence aims to intimidate Maduro's inner circle, not primarily target drugs, as Venezuela is not a major cocaine producer.
