          <h2>Ohio Republicans Attribute Cincinnati Brawl to Democratic Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 17:51:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican congressional members from Ohio are blaming Democratic policies for creating the conditions that led to a widely publicized, violent brawl in downtown Cincinnati. They argue that progressive approaches to public safety have fostered an environment of "fear and chaos" in major American cities. Senator Bernie Moreno called for the Cincinnati mayor's resignation over the incident, while other officials asserted that such lawlessness stems from a failure to adequately fund police and prosecute violent criminals, a claim disputed by local Democratic leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a heated exchange on the Senate floor, Senator Cory Booker accused fellow Democrats of being "complicit" with President Trump's agenda by preparing to pass a bipartisan policing package. Booker argued that the legislation fails to prevent the Justice Department from politicizing public safety grants and withholding funds from certain jurisdictions. He passionately called for his party to show more "backbone" and fight against what he described as the president's unconstitutional actions, leading to a rare and public moment of intraparty disagreement.</p>

          <p>Starbucks reported its sixth consecutive quarter of declining same-store sales, but CEO Brian Niccol asserted that the company's turnaround plan is ahead of schedule. Despite a 2% drop in global same-store sales, the North American market performed better than anticipated, and the company's China business saw its first sales growth in over a year. Niccol highlighted rising employee engagement and customer connection scores as positive signs, outlining future plans that include new product launches and a refreshed rewards program to regain momentum.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed his falling out with Jeffrey Epstein was because the late sex offender "stole" young female employees from his Mar-a-Lago club's spa. When asked if one of these employees was Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Epstein, Trump replied, "I think that was one of the people, yeah." This account of the rift being over poached employees casts their separation in a different light from previous White House statements, which attributed it to Epstein's inappropriate sexual behavior.</p>

          <p>Gap's Athleta brand has hired Maggie Gauger, the head of Nike's women's business in North America, to be its new CEO. The move is a significant win for Athleta, which has been struggling with declining sales, and a notable loss for Nike, which has made winning female consumers a key part of its turnaround strategy. Gauger's departure creates a leadership vacuum at Nike as it faces increasing competition in the women's athleisure market from brands like Athleta and Lululemon.</p>

According to Bessent, Chinese officials responded by asserting their country's energy sovereignty, suggesting they would not be deterred by the threat. (not investment advice)</p>
