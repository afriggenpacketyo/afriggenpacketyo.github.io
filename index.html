          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:24:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, CEO of the AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key R&D employees in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. This strategic move is part of an escalating talent war in the artificial intelligence sector, with major companies like Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft also making significant hires from startups. The agreement includes a nonexclusive license for Google to use certain Windsurf technology, while Windsurf will continue to operate independently and can license its tech to others. This acquisition highlights the growing importance of tools that utilize AI to assist developers.</p>

          <p>A rapidly spreading wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, has burned over 10,900 acres in Arizona, prompting the full evacuation of the Grand Canyon National Park's North Rim. Sparked by lightning, the blaze remains 0% contained due to high temperatures, strong winds, and dry conditions. Officials have evacuated approximately 500 guests and closed a portion of State Route 89A. The incident tragically coincides with the death of a 67-year-old hiker in a separate event within the park, highlighting the extreme heat and dangerous conditions currently affecting the region.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Pharmaceutical Companies Trialing Dozens of Weight-Loss Drugs to Compete with Ozempic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is poised to enter the lucrative global weight-loss drug market, with approximately 60 rival drugs to Novo Nordisk's Ozempic currently in clinical trials. The patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is set to expire in China next year, much earlier than in other markets. This is expected to pave the way for cheaper, generic versions, potentially making these treatments more accessible and affordable for a large population. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic manufacturers in China will compete, driving down prices in the estimated US$150 billion market.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a Chicago federal court to running a significant part of the Sinaloa Cartel. He admitted to coordinating large-scale drug trafficking operations, including fentanyl and cocaine, into the United States and using violence to protect the cartel's activities. As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez will forfeit $80 million. U.S. officials have hailed the plea as a major victory in their efforts to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and combat the fentanyl epidemic.</p>

Officials expressed confidence in the port's long-term growth, citing the need to prepare for future demand for larger vessels.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found sufficient evidence that agents were not meeting the 4th Amendment's requirement for reasonable suspicion. The lawsuit, filed by immigrant rights groups, argued that agents were unlawfully targeting individuals in places like Home Depot parking lots and carwashes.

However, a coalition of architects, engineers, and citizens, backed by UNESCO, argues that the historic bridge can and should be repaired in place.

          <p>The Wimbledon women's singles final will feature a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, both competing for their first title at the All England Club. Swiatek, the world number one, has overcome her previous struggles on grass to reach the final, while Anisimova is fulfilling her early-career promise after taking a break for her mental health. Analysts suggest the match will hinge on which player better handles the pressure of the occasion. Anisimova's aggressive, free-swinging style as the underdog could pose a unique challenge to the more experienced Swiatek.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is navigating rising global tensions by promoting a foreign policy doctrine of "Australia first," seeking to balance relationships with key allies and rivals. In a recent speech invoking wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasized the need for Australia to act in its own strategic interest rather than being defined by traditional alliances. While maintaining the AUKUS security pact and the U.S. alliance, his government aims to recalibrate its posture, particularly with China. This approach asserts a more independent and sovereign path for Australia in an increasingly uncertain Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods if President Trump proceeds with a threatened 50% tariff. Trump's threat, delivered via a letter, was explicitly linked to what he called the "witch hunt" criminal trial of his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. President Lula stated he would use a reciprocity law to match any U.S. tariff, calling the move an attempt to interfere in Brazil's domestic politics and judiciary. The escalating dispute risks a trade war between the two major economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to levy a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to take effect on August 1st. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to stop fentanyl trafficking and its own retaliatory tariffs as justification for the move. This represents a significant escalation in trade tensions with one of America's largest trading partners. The threat is part of a broader strategy where the administration is sending similar letters to dozens of countries, aiming to renegotiate trade deals and correct what Trump views as unfair imbalances.

This case is part of a broader trend of legal challenges against tech companies that focus on harmful product design rather than user-generated content, which has greater legal protection.</p>

While many Canadians remain united against the U.S. tariffs, political commentators are debating whether Carney's approach is working.
