          <p>Germany and Israel are marking 60 years of diplomatic relations, an event overshadowed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza and rising antisemitism. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is visiting Berlin to commemorate the anniversary with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, including a visit to the "Platform 17" Holocaust memorial. The leaders aim to address increasing antisemitism, particularly among young Germans, which has intensified since the Gaza conflict began. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized Germany's commitment to Israel's security while also stressing the need for Israel to adhere to international law and humanitarian obligations amidst the Gaza war. The article also touches on the complex issue of potential arrest warrants for Israeli officials by the International Criminal Court, highlighting the delicate balance Germany must strike between its support for Israel and its obligations under international law.</p>

          <p>Chinese energy investments in Africa are increasingly focused on renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power accounting for 59% of China's energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested approximately $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with the continent becoming a significant market for Chinese solar and wind technology, as exports surged by 153% from 2020 to 2024. This shift is driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production. The trend aligns with China's global move away from fossil fuels and its commitment to halt funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas, while Africa's growing energy needs and untapped renewable resources make it a key destination for Chinese wind and solar technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump is undertaking his first foreign trip of his second term, touring the Middle East to pursue investment, trade, and technology agreements with Gulf allies. The trip, reminiscent of his 2017 visit, focuses on securing deals and support for the region's economic and geopolitical interests, with negotiations covering oil, trade, regional conflicts, and the Iran nuclear program. Trump's primary objective is to prioritize American interests by securing multi-billion dollar deals and investments from wealthy Gulf states. The tour excludes a visit to Israel, reflecting tensions over the Gaza conflict and differing views on a two-state solution, and the article underscores the complexities and potential conflicts-of-interest surrounding Trump's approach to the region.</p>

          <p>Ordinary Kashmiris are bearing the brunt of renewed conflict between India and Pakistan, as artillery battles along the Line of Control devastate villages and disrupt lives. This New York Times article recounts a night spent in a safe house with a family in Garkote, a village on the Indian-administered side of Kashmir, as shelling intensified. The conflict, triggered by a recent terrorist attack, has seen both advanced aerial engagements and brutal artillery exchanges, with civilians caught in the crossfire. Despite a recent ceasefire agreement, the night of fear and the resilience of the Kashmiri people living under constant threat underscore the deep-seated tensions and the human cost of the conflict.</p>

          <p>The art world is in mourning after the sudden death of Koyo Kouoh, a prominent figure who was set to be the first African woman to curate the Venice Biennale in 2026. Kouoh, known for her work as the curator and executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, had built a global reputation for championing artists of color and revitalizing the museum after a period of crisis. Her passing, just before she was to announce the theme of the Biennale, leaves a void in the art community. Colleagues and artists remember her as a visionary, institution builder, and mentor who expanded opportunities for African curators and artists worldwide, with her curatorial approach celebrated for its aesthetic, art historical, painterly, and political dimensions.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspapers highlight the government's new immigration plans, focusing on stricter measures against crime-committing migrants and perceived abuses of the legal system. The Daily Mail reports that migrants committing any crime will face deportation, with the Home Office gaining wider powers for removals. The Sunday Express emphasizes that foreign criminals will no longer be able to exploit human rights laws to avoid deportation. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defends the new rules as essential to regain control over immigration, while critics question the Labour government's commitment to abandoning open border principles, the article discusses the potential impact of these changes on the UK's economy and society.</p>

Drummond is now recommitting to the plan that helped her lose over 50 pounds in 2021, emphasizing the importance of building muscle and increasing protein intake. She noted that she is no longer weighing her food or counting calories, relying instead on her increased awareness of portion sizes. While abstaining from alcohol completely during her initial weight loss, she now enjoys wine spritzers in moderation, and she finds the Happy Scale app helpful in tracking her progress.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trump's trade war. The talks have major implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. Trump has indicated a willingness to lower tariffs to 80%, but only if China makes concessions, while China insists it will not make concessions in response to the tariffs. Economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal, and the article notes that even with reduced tariffs, the overall effective tariff rate would still be significantly higher than before Trump's election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers should embrace their flaws rather than strive for perfection. She suggests that being a flawed mother is essential for children to learn to accept their own imperfections and to understand that relationships are not one-sided. Ross notes that psychiatrists have historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, but this overlooks the immense credit mothers deserve. She encourages mothers to stop wondering if they are good enough and to recognize that their imperfections are a valuable part of parenting.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to be held in Turkey on May 15, without preconditions, after European leaders threatened Russia with new sanctions if it did not agree to a 30-day cease-fire. The European leaders, visiting Kyiv, coordinated their efforts with the White House, with President Trump signaling support for sanctions absent a cease-fire. Putin's proposal comes as both Russia and Ukraine seek to position themselves as seeking peace, with the Trump administration proposing the 30-day cease-fire during talks this spring. However, Ukraine reported drone attacks shortly after Putin's announcement, highlighting the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has drawn condemnation from a broad spectrum of Iranians, uniting them across political, ideological, and religious divides. The name "Persian Gulf" has been used since at least 550 B.C. and is deeply ingrained in Iranian national identity. While Trump has the power to change geographical names within the United States, other countries are not obligated to follow suit. The proposal has sparked outrage and could potentially affect ongoing nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, with some experts suggesting it will embolden hardliners in Iran.</p>

While the U.S. already exports hormone-free beef to the EU, it seeks to ease restrictions further, a move that faces strong opposition due to concerns about food culture, smaller family farms, and public opinion.</p>

          <p>Jorgen Boassen, a former bricklayer from Greenland and ardent supporter of President Trump, has become an unlikely political influencer advocating for closer ties between Greenland and the United States. Despite facing hostility from fellow Greenlanders who view him as a traitor, Boassen is working to foster a security alliance between an independent Greenland and Washington, believing Denmark has failed to adequately defend the island. His advocacy has gained him contacts within Greenland's government and a role with American Daybreak, an organization promoting U.S.-Greenland relations. While his views are not widely shared on the island, Boassen believes Greenland must seize the moment while it still has Trump's attention.</p>

          <p>Despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, both countries have accused each other of violating the deal just hours after it was reached. President Trump announced the "full and immediate ceasefire" after talks, but explosions and blackouts were reported in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Indian officials accused Pakistan of border intrusion, while Pakistan blamed Indian forces for initiating the violation. The ceasefire followed weeks of escalated conflict triggered by a deadly attack on tourists, and the article highlights the fragility of peace efforts in the region.</p>

He also stated that Japan will continue to seek a complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports during tariff negotiations with the United States. Despite a recent U.S.-British trade agreement setting tariffs on British exports, Ishiba asserted that a 10 percent tariff rate would not be acceptable for Japan.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that the United States and China made "great progress" in high-level trade talks in Geneva, intended to defuse tariff tensions. The talks marked the first face-to-face contact between senior U.S. and Chinese officials since the United States increased tariffs on goods from China to at least 145 percent. Trump stated that a "total reset" was negotiated in a friendly manner and expressed a desire for China to open up to American business. In retaliation to Trump's tariffs, China has applied a minimum 125 percent duty rate on imported U.S. goods and restricted exports of various critical minerals essential for high-tech industries.</p>

The museum, which relies heavily on Canadian tourists, has experienced a significant decline in sales due to the tariffs and strained relations between the U.S. and Canada. Owners Neil and Krystal King decided to move the museum across the border to avoid the 145% tariffs on their Chinese-made rubber ducks. The relocation aims to ensure the museum's survival and avoid the instability of fluctuating trade policies, as well as being able to maintain prices that Canadians can afford.</p>
