          <p>Black Sabbath's bassist, Geezer Butler, shared a poignant remembrance of Ozzy Osbourne following the singer's death at 76. Butler described Osbourne as appearing "frail" during rehearsals for their final reunion show, a stark contrast to the vibrant "Prince of Laughter" he had known for nearly six decades. The performance, which took place just weeks before Osbourne's passing, was a massive tribute featuring numerous rock legends. Butler expressed gratitude for the opportunity to play one last time with his friend, calling their 57-year journey an "incredible ride."</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is poised to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay increase, a figure the union has labeled "grotesque." With turnout expected to exceed the 50% threshold required for industrial action, the vote raises the possibility of nursing strikes later in the year. The RCN is demanding that ministers enter negotiations over the summer to prevent a formal strike ballot in the autumn. This development follows a similar rejection of the pay deal by the GMB union, which represents other health workers, increasing pressure on the government.</p>

          <p>Major medical organizations, including the American Medical Association (AMA), are voicing "deep concern" over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). This panel of independent experts provides crucial, evidence-based guidelines for preventive care, such as cancer screenings and managing chronic diseases, which also influence insurance coverage under the ACA. The potential move follows Kennedy's recent replacement of a CDC vaccine advisory committee, fueling fears that political interference could erode trust in established medical guidance and disrupt patient care nationwide.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man is facing terrorism charges and 11 counts of assault with intent to murder following a knife attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan.

          <p>A new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union, which establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, is projected to cause a major shift in global trade flows. According to The Observatory of Economic Complexity's Tariff Simulator, global exports to the U.S. could fall by over 46% by 2027, while U.S. exports are expected to rise. The model predicts that countries will reorient their trade relationships away from the U.S., with China, Canada, and Mexico seeing the largest decreases in exports to America. Logistics experts warn that the tariffs will make many products more expensive, potentially reducing product diversity for U.S. consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

This move is designed to encourage innovators to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and pursue high-risk, high-reward scientific research without the fear of professional repercussions from failure.

          <p>The far-right Sanseito party has seen a dramatic surge in Japanese politics, increasing its seats from one to 15 and challenging the long-standing dominance of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). This shift is fueled by public frustration over economic issues like inflation and stagnant wages, alongside a growing anti-immigrant and anti-tourist sentiment. Adopting a "Japan First" slogan inspired by Donald Trump, the party capitalizes on anxieties about the rising number of foreign residents and perceived disrespectful behavior from tourists. Analysts suggest this populist wave, amplified by social media, marks a significant upheaval in Japan's traditionally stable political landscape.</p>

This comes as the Trump administration intensifies pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with Trump recently visiting the Fed to clash over renovation costs.

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to enter and be distributed. The pause will affect populated areas such as Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi, creating secure land routes for the UN and other agencies to address a severe hunger crisis. This move comes after months of warnings about the risk of famine and increasing international pressure on Israel to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe. While the UN welcomed the step, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach everyone in need.</p>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to function as intended during the deadly 2023 earthquake in Turkey. The system should have sent a high-level "Take Action" warning to 10 million people near the epicenter, but instead sent only 469 such alerts for the first major quake. Most users received a lower-level "Be Aware" notification not designed to wake people up, a critical failure as the quake struck in the early morning. Researchers cited limitations in detection algorithms, which have since been updated, but the admission raises concerns about relying on such technology for public safety.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the brilliant and incisive musical satirist who gained fame in the 1950s and 60s, has died at the age of 97. Known for his witty and often controversial songs that tackled subjects like nuclear war, pollution, and politics, Lehrer was a Harvard-educated mathematician who balanced his academic career with his musical pursuits. His work on the show "That Was The Week That Was" and his popular records influenced generations of comedians and songwriters, including "Weird Al" Yankovic. Lehrer retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on teaching, leaving behind a legacy of sharp, intelligent satire.</p>

          <p>Archaeological discoveries at the Keeladi site in Tamil Nadu, India, are sparking a fierce political and historical debate. Artifacts dating back to 580 BCE suggest the existence of a literate, urban society in southern India that is much older than previously thought, challenging the long-held narrative of northern India's civilizational dominance. Tamil politicians and scholars claim the findings prove an independent and ancient Dravidian culture, potentially linked to the Indus Valley Civilization. However, the federal government's archaeological body has been accused of suppressing these findings, turning the site into a flashpoint for Tamil pride and identity politics.</p>

Prominent groups like the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, which identifies children stolen during the dictatorship, have had their government subsidies cut off.

          <p>An investigative report chronicles the search for a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights," where political prisoners were thrown alive into the Atlantic Ocean. An Italian photographer and an Argentine journalist, herself a survivor of a detention camp, tracked the plane to the U.S., where it was being used for skydiving. They obtained its flight logs, which provided crucial evidence of the clandestine missions, helping to convict the pilots in a historic 2017 trial. The plane was eventually returned to Argentina and now stands as a chilling witness and memorial at a former death camp.</p>

Piastri secured the win by taking the lead from Norris at the start, making a brave move through Eau Rouge and benefiting from the slipstream, a known advantage at Spa. Norris, despite having a faster tire compound for the end of the race, couldn't close the gap, hampered by a less-than-perfect start and a few small errors during his chase. The race demonstrated Piastri's strategic judgment and Norris's acknowledgment that he could have done little to prevent the outcome.</p>

          <p>Following a significant drop in Honeywell's stock price despite a positive earnings report, Jim Cramer argues against selling out of frustration. He attributes the decline to factors like the complexity of the company's planned three-way split, a lack of direct data center exposure, and general market impatience. Drawing parallels to past situations with Emerson and Oracle where he sold too early, Cramer expresses his conviction in Honeywell's long-term value, particularly with its role in the reindustrialization of America.

The spill released billions of plastic pellets, known as nurdles, which are now becoming more toxic by absorbing other pollutants from the ocean like a "chemical sponge." These contaminated microplastics, along with hazardous metals from the ship's cargo, have been found in local fish, raising concerns for both the marine ecosystem and human health. The Sri Lankan government is pursuing further compensation from the ship's owner, arguing the initial payments are insufficient to cover the long-term environmental damage.</p>
