          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is replacing Nin Pandit, his principal private secretary, just ten months into her role, making her the third top aide to depart his Downing Street office in less than a year. The BBC understands concerns were raised about Pandit's effectiveness, though No 10 disputes this, stating the Prime Minister retains trust in her. Pandit will transition to a new policy delivery role within No 10, amidst expectations of a wider reshuffle of junior ministers following recent Labour parliamentary rebellions. This move highlights ongoing staffing changes within Starmer's senior team.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh government has proposed changes to controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday properties, which currently require properties to be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower non-domestic rates. The new proposal suggests an average of 182 days let over several years, allowing up to 14 charity days to count. Critics, including Welsh language society Cymdeithas yr Iaith and the Professional Association of Self-Caterers, argue these changes are insufficient and fail to address the housing crisis or the challenges facing Welsh tourism businesses. A consultation is open until November 20, with legislative changes potentially taking effect on April 1, 2026.</p>

Concurrently, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is in Estonia and Denmark for security talks, advocating for stronger cooperation against Russia's 'hybrid aggression,' including undersea cable cutting and GPS disruptions. Wadephul emphasized that Baltic region security is crucial for Germany, acknowledging the Baltic States' foresight in warning about such risks. Separately, the German Insurance Association reported €1 billion in natural hazard losses for the first half of 2025, below long-term averages but with warnings of rising costs due to extreme weather.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $1.05 (adjusted) and revenue of $46.74 billion for the quarter, signaling continued strong demand for AI infrastructure. Despite the overall positive financial performance and a projected revenue of $54 billion for the next quarter, the stock dipped in extended trading as data center revenue slightly missed estimates for the second consecutive period. The company also faced challenges with H20 chip shipments to China due to U.S. licenses, which impacted potential sales. Nvidia's board approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases, highlighting confidence despite geopolitical and market-specific hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was fired by the White House just one month into her tenure, with the administration citing her lack of alignment with the president's agenda. In a departing statement, Dr. Monarez accused Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of 'weaponizing public health,' while her lawyers stated she was targeted for refusing 'unscientific, reckless directives.' Her dismissal triggered the resignations of at least three other senior CDC leaders, who expressed frustration over vaccine policy and Kennedy's leadership. The exodus highlights deep divisions within the nation's public health apparatus regarding scientific integrity and vaccine approach.</p>

          <p>A massive Russian drone and missile attack struck Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, early Thursday, including a rare hit in the city center, killing at least 14 people, including three children, and wounding dozens. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the 'horrific and deliberate killing of civilians,' stating Russia is not seeking peace but new strikes, and called for new, strong sanctions. Ukraine's Air Force reported 598 strike drones and decoys, and 31 missiles launched across the country, making it one of the largest attacks since the 2022 invasion. The attack comes amidst struggling U.S.-led peace efforts and recent Russian military advances into an eighth Ukrainian region.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's complex and decades-long relationship with the NFL, marked by lawsuits, failed team bids, and heated anthem debates, is being re-examined as a new season approaches. Trump, who once owned the USFL's New Jersey Generals and led an anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL, repeatedly attempted to acquire an NFL franchise without success. His criticism of players kneeling during the national anthem in 2017 further fueled tensions, though recent interactions, including NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell joining Trump to announce the 2027 NFL Draft in Washington D.C., suggest a potential shift.

          <p>Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, postponed a trip to Washington aimed at finalizing a tariffs deal, as Tokyo urges the U.S. to accelerate its implementation. The delay stems from the U.S. not yet correcting a mistake where a preliminary 15% tariff on most Japanese goods was mistakenly added to other existing tariffs, rather than replacing them. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized the need for the U.S. to amend its presidential order to correct these reciprocal tariffs and lower duties on autos and auto parts. Japan and the U.S. had previously agreed on a 15% import tax, effective August 1, with a commitment to refund excess duties paid.</p>

Trump accused Moore of being 'very disrespectful to the Office of the President,' likely stemming from a recent feud where Moore invited Trump to walk through Baltimore and later called him 'President Bone Spurs.' Moore, who served in Afghanistan and finally received his Bronze Star in December after paperwork delays, has defended his service and criticized Trump's threats to withhold federal funding for the Francis Scott Key Bridge.

While the U.S. remains a crucial market, especially for premium brands like Jaguar Land Rover, overall UK car manufacturing output for the year is still down 11.7%, attributed to higher labor costs, increased competition, and Brexit.

Travis asserts that Commissioner Roger Goodell's past praise for Kaepernick and encouragement of protests were profoundly wrong, especially given the rise in murder rates during the Black Lives Matter era.

Since 2022, early-career employees in sectors such as software engineering and customer service have experienced a 13% drop in employment, while older, more experienced workers in the same fields have seen growth. The research suggests that older workers possess valuable 'soft skills' and tacit knowledge not easily replicated by AI, making them less susceptible to displacement.

          <p>Seventy years after the brutal lynching of Black teenager Emmett Till, the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum has acquired the pistol believed to be the murder weapon. Till's cousin, Wheeler Parker Jr., the last living eyewitness, expressed that the acquisition brings a form of closure and validates the tragic story. The gun, which belonged to J.W. Milam (one of the acquitted murderers), was confirmed by the FBI and will be displayed to tell a fuller story of the torture and shooting Till endured. This significant artifact joins other historical items at the museum, aiming to preserve and convey American history, especially amidst debates over how to portray difficult past events.</p>

          <p>Wales captain Aaron Ramsey has been omitted from the squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan on September 4. The 34-year-old midfielder recently returned to play for his new club, Pumas UNAM, after a hamstring injury sustained in March, but his limited match fitness likely contributed to the decision. Leeds United skipper Ethan Ampadu is also absent due to a knee injury. The 25-man squad, announced by manager Craig Bellamy, includes uncapped players Dylan Lawlor, Ronan Kpakio, and Kai Andrews, as Wales prepares for both the qualifier and a friendly against Canada.</p>

          <p>The landmark national security trial of pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has concluded in a Hong Kong court after 160 days of closing arguments. Lai, 77, who has been jailed for over four and a half years, faces charges of 'conspiracy to collude with foreign forces' and 'seditious publication' under the Beijing-imposed national security law. The founder of the critical Apple Daily newspaper, Lai could face three years to life in prison if found guilty. His case is seen by Reporters Without Borders as exposing authorities' determination to suppress press freedom in Hong Kong, where critics argue personal liberties are being curbed despite 1997 handover promises.</p>

Analysts attribute Tesla's struggles to intense competition, an aging product lineup, and reputational damage linked to Elon Musk's public rhetoric and relationship with the Trump administration. Chinese brands, led by BYD, are aggressively expanding into the European market, achieving a record market share of over 5% in the first half of the year, putting pressure on established automakers.

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the storm's long shadow continues to impact the lives of its youngest survivors, now adults, who experienced profound trauma and displacement. Arnold Burks and E'jaaz Mason, both 13 during Katrina, recount harrowing experiences of fleeing rising waters and losing homes, with many children suffering persistent mental health problems and disrupted community bonds. The documentary 'Katrina Babies' highlights how many children struggled in silence for years, only later realizing the depth of their trauma. This article also warns that future generations remain vulnerable to climate change and federal agency funding cuts, despite levee upgrades, as the narrative of 'resilience' risks absolving those in power of responsibility.</p>

Authorities found writings and YouTube videos from Westman referencing past mass shooters and schematic drawings of a church, and learned Westman's mother previously worked at the targeted church. Governor Tim Walz confirmed President Trump offered assistance, while Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back against hatred directed towards the transgender community, as Westman's legal name change to Robin from Robert in 2020 was noted.</p>

Critics argue his project is failing, citing a porous defense and poor decision-making, as evidenced by his own signings being dismantled and key players benched.

While such relationships can provide distraction and a sense of community, experts like Arthur C.
