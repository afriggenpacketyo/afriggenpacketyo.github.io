          <p>Intense Israel Defense Forces strikes continued in Gaza City, with one overnight attack reportedly destroying Al-Azhar University. According to the Gaza Government Media Office, 93 airstrikes in 24 hours resulted in 70 Palestinian deaths. Concurrently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated he is on the verge of a major achievement and hopes to announce the return of all hostages soon, while insisting the IDF would remain in Gaza. These military actions occur as President Donald Trump's administration pushes for a ceasefire deal, with Trump warning Hamas to act quickly to release hostages.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 03:45:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent surge in sales, the United States is lagging behind China and Europe in the transition to electric vehicles. Analysts attribute this to weaker government incentives, higher average costs for EVs, and policy uncertainty, particularly with the expiration of a significant tax credit. The article notes that while US carmakers have reported record EV sales, the overall market share remains comparatively low, and future demand is expected to decline without subsidies. The exclusion of affordable Chinese brands due to high tariffs also contributes to the slower adoption rate in the US market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced new powers for police to manage protests by considering their "cumulative impact" on communities. This will allow senior officers to impose conditions, such as changing a demonstration's location, if a site has been subject to repeated protests. The move follows a series of large-scale demonstrations and aims to balance the right to protest with the public's right to live without intimidation, particularly in response to concerns raised by the Jewish community. The government is also reviewing legislation, including the possibility of outright protest bans.</p>

          <p>Three states in India have banned a cough syrup named Coldrif after it was linked to the deaths of at least nine children. Health Ministry tests revealed the syrup, produced by Sresan Pharma, contained toxic levels of diethylene glycol (DEG), an industrial solvent. This incident has intensified scrutiny of India's large pharmaceutical industry, which has faced previous international warnings from the World Health Organization over contaminated medicines. India is a major global supplier of generic drugs, making product safety a significant international concern.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted extensive missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, with a significant focus on the western city of Lviv, located near the Polish border. The attacks resulted in civilian casualties and targeted energy infrastructure, causing power outages in cities like Lviv and Zaporizhzhia. In response to the proximity of the strikes, neighboring Poland scrambled its own and allied NATO fighter jets to secure its airspace. This escalation follows recent statements from a US official supporting Ukrainian strikes deep within Russian territory.</p>

          <p>In a personal account, a Black, British doctoral student at Cornell University details his decision to self-deport from the United States. He describes facing a campus ban after a pro-Palestine protest and going into hiding due to fears of being targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under new policies. The writer suspects he was under surveillance, citing government requests for his Google data, and links his experience to broader issues of AI-driven monitoring of immigrants and activists. He argues that his case highlights a chilling effect on free speech for non-citizens in the US.</p>

          <p>Investigators in the murder of Kenneth Fandrich in Hillsboro, Oregon, faced a major setback when a crucial piece of evidence was destroyed just before they could secure it. The key evidence was a maroon minivan believed to be the primary crime scene, allegedly used by the suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, to kill Fandrich in a parking garage. After tracing the abandoned vehicle through a tow company, detectives arrived at a scrapyard only to be shown a video of the minivan being crushed.

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial £305m acquisition by a Saudi-led consortium, Newcastle United has undergone significant transformation. The club has modernized its training facilities, won its first major domestic trophy in decades, and qualified for the Champions League under manager Eddie Howe. However, growth has been tempered by financial regulations (PSR), which prevent limitless spending, and ongoing criticism from human rights groups regarding Saudi Arabia's record. The club's journey reflects a gradual build rather than an instant overhaul, balancing on-field ambition with off-field financial realities.</p>

The piece points to recent military buildups around Venezuela and attempts to strong-arm Brazil as examples of a regressive "big stick" diplomacy. This approach is seen as self-defeating, potentially strengthening authoritarian leaders like Nicolás Maduro by allowing them to rally nationalist support.
