          <p>Novo Nordisk has ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, alleging that the telehealth company sold illegitimate versions of Wegovy, its weight-loss drug, posing a risk to patient safety. The Danish drugmaker accused Hims & Hers of deceptive marketing and failing to adhere to laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization. This decision came shortly after the companies announced a long-term collaboration to improve obesity treatment accessibility. Novo Nordisk stated it will continue to sell Wegovy on other telehealth platforms committed to patient safety.</p>

          <p>Senator Markwayne Mullin stated that U.S. intelligence indicates Iran did not relocate nuclear material from its Fordo facility before the U.S. airstrikes, contradicting earlier reports. Mullin, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, suggested Iran may have even stored more material there believing the site was impenetrable. He affirmed the U.S. military's capability to destroy heavily fortified targets and warned that the U.S. would work with allies to complete the job if necessary. The Fordo facility, located deep underground, was among the targets of the U.S. strikes.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that Iran launched an attack on the U.S. military base in Qatar as retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Explosions were heard over Doha, where the Al-Udeid Air Base is located, housing approximately 10,000 U.S. service members. Qatar's Defense Ministry claimed its air defense systems successfully intercepted the missiles, with no reported deaths or injuries. The incident led to a temporary closure of Qatari airspace, and the price of crude oil initially fell following the news of the attack.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran announced missile attacks against U.S. bases in the Middle East. According to Middle East security expert Burcu Ozcelik, potential Iranian responses could include attacks on U.S. military assets, closure of the Strait of Hormuz, and asymmetric warfare tactics like terror and cyber attacks. The U.S. operates numerous bases across the Middle East, with significant assets in Qatar and Bahrain, and naval fleets patrolling various seas. Any Iranian retaliation would likely provoke a response from the U.S., potentially endangering the Iranian government's survival.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock performance has diverged from other major tech stocks, trading below its 50- and 200-day moving averages, a trend not seen since 2002.

Investors are increasingly diversifying their tech investments, with broad market bets on the S&P 500 also reflecting significant tech exposure.

Some argue that these criticisms, while rooted in legitimate concerns, often target individual women rather than addressing structural issues.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, experts warn that President Trump's strategy may backfire, potentially escalating the conflict and undermining future diplomatic efforts. While the strikes aim to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, they may incentivize retaliation and encourage more secretive nuclear development. The move also complicates potential diplomatic solutions, as Iran may be less willing to negotiate with the U.S. after the attacks. The long-term impact remains uncertain, but the strikes have significantly limited options for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>The Royal Air Force (RAF) evacuated 63 British nationals from Israel to Cyprus, as the conflict with Iran escalates. A British national was injured in Israel during an Iranian missile attack, prompting increased consular support. The Foreign Secretary urged Iran to return to negotiations following U.S. strikes on its nuclear program. Thousands of British nationals have been stranded due to the closure of Israeli airspace, and the UK government is urging those still in Israel to register their presence.</p>

Germany was reportedly informed of the strikes only after they occurred, similar to the Israeli attacks a week prior. While Germany aims to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, the strikes have sparked concerns about international law and potential escalation.

          <p>Gen Z is experiencing a shift in sex norms due to factors like the internet, social media, the Me Too movement, and the pandemic. Journalist Carter Sherman's book, "The Second Coming," explores how young people are having less sex and are influenced by pornography. Sex education classes have been impacted, often focusing on abstinence rather than comprehensive sexual health. The Me Too movement has raised awareness of sexual assault but has not led to significant institutional change, creating anxiety among young women.</p>

          <p>The joint US-Israeli strikes on Iran reflect a failing strategy based on pressure, coercion, and destabilization, as they aimed to eliminate Iran's nuclear program but instead may have pushed it closer to weaponization. Iran's response to the attacks, including missile barrages, exposes strategic vulnerabilities, and the US is signaling a return to negotiations. The US must reassess its Middle East policy, prioritize regional equilibrium over unconditional support for any one side, and reclaim decision-making in service of long-term US interests. The article argues that a strategy relying solely on coercion is flawed and self-defeating.</p>
