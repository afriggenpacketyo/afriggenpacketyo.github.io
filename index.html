          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-15 00:03:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Numerous U.S. and international news organizations, including the New York Times and Associated Press, have rejected new Pentagon press rules, leading to the revocation of their press access credentials. The policy requires journalists to acknowledge they could be deemed security risks for seeking unapproved information, which outlets argue severely restricts their ability to inform the public on critical national security issues. The Pentagon defends the rules as essential for national security, while media groups condemn them as unprecedented and a direct threat to the principles of a free and independent press. This standoff highlights growing tensions over government transparency and media access.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has repeatedly failed to advance a Republican-led funding bill, marking the eighth such attempt as the government shutdown persists. This ongoing legislative deadlock highlights deep partisan divisions over budget priorities, leaving federal agencies unfunded and impacting various government operations nationwide. The repeated failure to pass a spending measure underscores the severe challenge in reaching a bipartisan agreement to reopen the government and restore full functionality. This political impasse has led to widespread concerns about the stability of public services, the financial well-being of federal workers, and the overall governance of the country, reflecting deep-seated political divisions and a lack of legislative progress.</p>

          <p>A Pennsylvania man, Cody Balmer, pleaded guilty to attempted murder, terrorism, and multiple arson charges for a 2025 attack on Governor Josh Shapiro's mansion. Balmer scaled a fence, evaded police, and used Molotov cocktails, causing millions in damages, though fortunately no one was injured. The plea deal resulted in a 25-50 year prison sentence, with Governor Shapiro emphasizing the importance of accountability for political violence and the lasting impact on his family. This article notes Balmer cited concerns about the Gaza war but denied the governor's faith was a motive, highlighting the complex motivations behind such acts.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol (CHP) stopped a Nissan Sentra in Central California after noticing a suspicious rear license plate, which turned out to be a homemade, hand-drawn piece of art.
