          <p>A state funeral was held in Tehran for dozens of high-ranking military officials and others killed in recent Israeli strikes. The ceremony honored figures such as Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami and was attended by President Masoud Pezeshkian and other senior officials. The event occurs amidst a fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel, with the UN calling for broader de-escalation in the region. The article notes that of the 60 people honored, some were civilians, including women and children.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it will scrap 201 organizations that oversee and run parts of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. This move, part of Labour's new ten-year health strategy, aims to simplify a system Health Secretary Wes Streeting described as overly complex, prioritizing "more doers and fewer checkers." Among the bodies to be abolished are patient advocate Healthwatch England and the whistleblower support group, the National Guardian's Office. Critics and stakeholders have expressed concern that the vital functions of these organizations must be preserved within the new structure.</p>

          <p>While digging trenches in Lima, Peru, utility workers discovered a well-preserved, 1,000-year-old mummy with its dark brown hair still intact. Archaeologists believe the remains belong to a woman from the Chancay culture, which predates the Inca Empire by several hundred years. The mummy was found just 20 inches below the ground in a city that contains around 400 archaeological sites. Experts note that such discoveries are common on the Peruvian coast, where the dry desert climate naturally mummifies remains.</p>

More than 30 embassies and numerous European officials have voiced their support for the march.

          <p>The residents of Littlebredy, a village of 32 homes in Dorset, are facing eviction after the 2,000-acre Bridehead Estate was sold for approximately Â£30 million. The new owner is a company registered to the same address as a private equity firm, Belport, but the ultimate client remains anonymous, leaving residents with a profound sense of powerlessness. Access to parts of the estate grounds, previously enjoyed by the public, has also been terminated. The situation highlights the significant power held by private, often unknown, landowners in rural England and the vulnerability of local communities.</p>

Hoiby, who does not hold a royal title, has previously admitted to acts of violence under the influence of drugs and alcohol.

          <p>The NHL's first non-pandemic remote draft has drawn criticism for its decentralized format, which was plagued by technical issues and a lack of traditional excitement. Team executives made selections from their home cities while draftees in Los Angeles were greeted via video calls, leading to awkward moments like audio failures and delays. Some general managers, including the Kings' Ken Holland, expressed a preference for the old, in-person format, which they felt better celebrated the young players and their families. Despite the logistical problems, the draft proceeded, with the New York Islanders selecting Matthew Schaefer first overall.</p>

          <p>Japanese and U.S. negotiators have agreed to continue discussions over tariffs, though significant differences remain, particularly concerning U.S. duties on Japan's automotive industry. The talks in Washington occurred as a 90-day pause on certain country-specific tariffs is set to expire in early July. The Trump administration has suggested this pause could be extended, but has shown no sign of removing the 25 percentage point tariff increase on imported passenger vehicles. Japan faces a potential total tariff rate of 24 percent, creating uncertainty for its key industries (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique avoids the need for open-skull surgery, as used by technologies like Elon Musk's Neuralink, thereby reducing risk and recovery time. The procedure involved inserting a stent electrode into a patient's intracranial vasculature via a neck vein. The trial successfully helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement, marking a significant advancement in neurotechnology.</p>

The group allegedly purchased legitimate medical equipment companies to facilitate the billing fraud between 2022 and 2024.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 that parents have a right to opt their children out of public school lessons that offend their religious beliefs, specifically concerning the use of LGBTQ+ themed storybooks. The case originated from a lawsuit by parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who objected to a new curriculum that included nine such picture books for elementary students. The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, argued that the books send a moral message contrary to some parents' principles, while the dissent argued that the ruling fails to account for the existence of LGBTQ+ people in society.</p>
