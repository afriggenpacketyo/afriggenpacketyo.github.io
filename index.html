          <p>A Eurostar train traveling from Brussels to London broke down in northern France, leaving passengers stranded for nearly four hours without air conditioning or functioning toilets. Emergency services eventually arrived to distribute water and evacuate the frustrated travelers. Passengers reported that both engines on the train had failed shortly after passing Calais. Eurostar later apologized for the significant delay, which stretched the typically two-hour journey to over five hours, and stated that a replacement train had been arranged to collect the passengers.</p>

          <p>The family of a seven-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis undertook a dangerous boat journey to Italy, seeking medical treatment unavailable in Libya's fractured healthcare system. A photo of the exhausted child, Sohan Aboulsoud, on the smuggler's boat went viral, sparking protests in Tripoli over the lack of essential medicines and services. Although Libya's Government of National Unity publicly promised to cover her treatment costs, the family reports receiving no concrete assistance. This case highlights the desperation of Libyans and the severe impact of the country's long-standing political instability on its citizens' basic needs.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was halted after the electronic line-calling system failed to make a crucial call. A clear out-ball from Kartal was not called, and due to an operator error deactivating the system, the umpire ruled to replay the point, which Kartal then won. Pavlyuchenkova protested that the game was stolen from her, adding to a growing number of complaints from players about the technology's reliability at the tournament. The All England Club confirmed the error but stood by the umpire's decision to replay the point.</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the PLA Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, have called for significant structural changes to effectively counter drone warfare. They argue that the increasing role of unmanned aircraft in recent global conflicts necessitates the creation of specialized counter-drone units capable of rapid response. The article suggests that while dedicated units are a long-term goal, current efforts should focus on integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into existing electronic warfare teams.

          <p>A new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow delves into the complex life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the roots of his iconic humor and enduring cultural impact. The book traces Twain's journey from a modest upbringing in Hannibal, Missouri, to becoming a global literary figure whose work continues to resonate with modern themes of politics, class, and race. Chernow argues that Twain's sardonic wit was often rooted in personal pain and a lifelong fear of poverty. Despite his fame, Twain's life was marked by ill-fated investments and personal tragedies, all of which shaped his unique American voice.</p>

Burns, whose work has been a staple of PBS for decades, expressed concern for the future of the broadcaster, stating that its unique, non-market-driven model allows for the creation of in-depth projects that commercial platforms would not support.</p>

While not definitively linking the cuts to the lack of advance warning for the deadly Texas floods, Spinrad warned that without adequate research and staff, the quality of predictions for all severe weather events will inevitably degrade.

This article traces its transformation into a powerful beacon for immigrants, a shift largely credited to Emma Lazarus's 1883 poem "The New Colossus." The opening of the Ellis Island immigration facility in 1892, within sight of the statue, solidified this new meaning. The narrative explores how, despite periods of restrictive immigration laws, the statue's identity as a "mother of exiles" has endured, shaping America's self-image as a nation of immigrants.</p>

          <p>Despite rising geopolitical and trade tensions at the national level, many local government officials in the United States continue to welcome Chinese investment. According to the chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce in Chicago, city leaders are receptive to Chinese-funded projects, particularly in manufacturing, to stimulate their local economies. While potential investors are concerned about the political climate, the desire to access the wealthy U.S. market, intensified by tariffs, remains strong. Mayors in Midwestern cities like Wausau, Wisconsin, are reportedly actively seeking Chinese investment in sectors such as agriculture and automotive manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A communication expert and author outlines five common phrases that, despite good intentions, can make a person seem judgmental and erode trust in relationships. Phrases like "Why don't you just…" and "Actually…" can come across as dismissive or condescending, implying the other person is wrong or illogical. Similarly, using preambles like "To be honest…" can suggest prior dishonesty and put others on the defensive. The article suggests alternative, more collaborative phrasing, such as asking curious questions, using "yes, and..." to build on ideas, and framing opinions with humility to foster more positive and open communication.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its influence in the Western Balkans through a strategy of "infrastructure imperialism," which includes funding major construction projects like the Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania. This soft power approach, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, extends beyond religion to include economic and military cooperation, such as donating drones and signing trade agreements. Turkish investors are heavily involved in projects across the region, from railways to hotels, which serves to advance Turkey's geopolitical ambitions as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire. This strategy aims to create a vision of a modern, powerful future linked to Turkey.</p>

          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has proposed that football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches. Arguing for a "polluter pays approach," he questioned why event organizers who require a police presence do not pay for it, especially as forces face overstretched funding. The commissioner's comments were part of a broader call for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into 12 to 15 larger ones to improve efficiency.

          <p>China's renewed push to rebalance its economy by boosting domestic consumption is a critical but challenging pivot, especially as global demand falters and geopolitical tensions rise. While policymakers have discussed this shift for over a decade, its success hinges on significant structural reforms. Chinese households continue to maintain high savings rates, driven by long-standing concerns about the adequacy of social safety nets for healthcare, education, and retirement. Despite recent rises in disposable income, translating that growth into broad-based consumer confidence remains a key obstacle for the world's second-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The farmer was hospitalized with wounds to his head, shoulder, and legs.

          <p>Critics and analysts warn that President Trump is overseeing a significant expansion of presidential power, undermining the traditional checks and balances of the U.S. government. In less than six months, he has used executive actions to order a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, impose tariffs by declaring a national emergency, and take control of a state's National Guard against the governor's wishes. This trend, combined with a politically aligned Congress and attacks on the judiciary, is eroding democratic norms and setting new precedents for the authority of the Oval Office, raising concerns about a potential imperial presidency.</p>

Despite a star-studded voice cast and efforts to avoid a preachy tone, the film's on-the-nose evangelism and jarring shifts between solemn drama and uncanny humor may alienate nonbelievers. While successful with its target demographic, the movie misses the opportunity for the nuanced character development and artful storytelling seen in other faith-based hits like "The Prince of Egypt" or "The Chosen."

          <p>Political strategists and commentators are exploring whether the Democratic Party is on the verge of its own "Tea Party moment," similar to the grassroots conservative movement that reshaped the GOP over a decade ago. This potential shift is fueled by a populist, progressive base that is increasingly frustrated with the party's current establishment leadership and is seeking more aggressive, left-leaning policies. The recent primary victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's mayoral race is seen as a key indicator of this rising energy.
