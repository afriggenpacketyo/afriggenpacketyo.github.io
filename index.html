          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 11:25:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A brief 20-minute radar-related issue within the UK's air traffic control system, managed by NATS, triggered extensive travel chaos, leading to 150 flight cancellations and prolonged delays. This marks the second significant failure since a major outage in August 2023, prompting sharp criticism from airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet. While NATS assures the public that the system was quickly switched to a backup and there is no evidence of a cyberattack, critics question the system's resilience. The incident highlights the vulnerability of national aviation infrastructure, where even a minor failure can cause a cascading effect on air travel across Europe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, indicated a 2.6% annual price increase in June, slightly up from the previous month. This rise is partly attributed to President Trump's tariffs on imported goods, which have elevated the costs of items like furniture and computers. The data reinforces the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its current interest rate, as officials assess whether the price hikes are temporary or signal a more persistent inflationary trend. Consumer spending and income saw only modest gains, suggesting ongoing caution among Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An appeals court in Dublin has dismissed MMA fighter Conor McGregor's attempt to overturn a civil verdict that found him liable for sexually assaulting a woman in 2018. McGregor, who was previously ordered to pay £206,000 in damages, had argued that his "no comment" police interviews were improperly presented to the jury. The three-judge panel rejected these arguments, stating there was no risk of an unfair trial and that the jury could not have been confused by the case's details. The accuser, Nikita Hand, expressed relief after the ruling, stating the appeal process had been retraumatizing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 90-day extension of existing tariffs on Mexican goods, postponing a threatened increase to 30% to allow for further trade negotiations. The current duties include a 25% tariff on most imports and cars, along with a 50% tariff on metals. The decision followed what the president described as a successful discussion with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Trump also stated that Mexico agreed to terminate its non-tariff trade barriers, though specific details were not provided, as both nations aim to finalize a comprehensive trade deal within the next three months.

While the traditional pay-TV business continued to shrink, Comcast saw record growth in its mobile division, adding 378,000 new lines. The content and experiences segment, including NBCUniversal and theme parks, also saw strong revenue growth, boosted by successful film releases and the new Epic Universe park.

          <p>A new genetic study proposes a surprising evolutionary origin for the potato, suggesting its lineage began from the hybridization of an ancient tomato and a different nightshade plant. This chance encounter, occurring 8 to 9 million years ago, resulted in a new plant that, unlike its parents, could form tubers. This unique adaptation allowed the proto-potato to thrive in colder, drier climates and propagate asexually, leading to the diversification of over 100 potato species, including the modern cultivated crop. The finding challenges previous views of hybridization as an evolutionary dead end, showing it can sometimes produce radical and successful new traits.</p>

          <p>The United States is planning a new measure to restrict exports of high-quality copper scrap, requiring at least 25% to be retained for domestic use starting in 2027. The goal is to bolster domestic supply chains for the critical metal, which is vital for construction and the power grid. Currently, the U.S. exports nearly one million metric tons of copper scrap annually, with a significant portion going to China. Analysts suggest that if this scrap were processed domestically, it could substantially reduce the country's reliance on imports of refined copper, though industry sources question how the opaque scrap market could be effectively policed.

          <p>Ahead of its quarterly earnings report, Apple is confronting significant investor concerns that have contributed to a notable decline in its stock price this year. Key challenges include a perceived lag in its artificial intelligence strategy compared to competitors, which could delay a major iPhone upgrade cycle. Additionally, the company faces uncertainty from potential U.S. tariffs and ongoing legal battles that could impact its lucrative Services revenue. Analysts suggest the company needs to provide clarity on its plans for supply chain diversification and AI monetization to regain Wall Street's confidence and reverse the negative stock performance.

          <p>Senior aides to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly used polygraph tests on their own colleagues in an attempt to identify the sources of media leaks and undermine internal rivals. The contentious episode involved Hegseth's lawyer attempting to polygraph a senior adviser, a test that was reportedly ordered without the secretary's knowledge and was only stopped after an external Trump adviser intervened. The use of lie detectors continued against other uniformed military officers, fueling concerns about Hegseth's management of the Pentagon and the internal turmoil within his office.

          <p>A radioactive wasp nest was discovered and disposed of at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, a facility that formerly produced components for nuclear weapons. According to a Department of Energy report, the nest was found near tanks holding liquid nuclear waste and showed radiation levels more than ten times the allowable limit. Officials stated the contamination was a result of legacy radioactive material at the site and was not from a new leak or loss of control. While they assured there was no impact on workers or the public, a local watchdog group has demanded more information about the source of the contamination.</p>

          <p>The global demand for popular drugs, such as weight-loss medications like Wegovy and Ozempic, has fueled a dangerous market for counterfeit pharmaceuticals. The World Health Organization estimates that one in ten drugs in low-to-middle-income countries are fake, but the problem is also growing in wealthier nations through unregulated online pharmacies. These counterfeit products may contain incorrect ingredients, have no active compounds, or be produced in unsanitary conditions, posing significant health risks. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe are running campaigns to raise consumer awareness and are coordinating law enforcement actions to crack down on the illicit online sale of these drugs.</p>

          <p>An independent regulatory commission has cleared West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta of charges that he deliberately received yellow cards to influence betting markets. The English Football Association had charged the Brazilian international with four breaches related to spot-fixing, which could have resulted in a lifetime ban. After a nearly two-year investigation, the commission found the four charges to be "not proven." However, Paqueta was found guilty of two separate charges for failing to cooperate with the investigation, and he will face a sanction for those breaches at a later date. Paqueta has maintained his innocence throughout the entire process.</p>

          <p>A group of prominent British lawyers has cautioned the UK government that formally recognizing a Palestinian state could violate international law. In a letter, 43 peers argued that Palestine does not meet the legal criteria for statehood under the 1933 Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined territory and a single, effective government. The warning comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the UK would move toward recognition unless Israel meets certain conditions for peace. A government trade secretary defended the plan, stating that such legal arguments miss the larger point of using diplomatic levers to achieve a two-state solution.</p>

Civil rights advocates and descendants of those interned during WWII are raising alarms, arguing the law allows for targeting people based on national origin rather than individual actions.
