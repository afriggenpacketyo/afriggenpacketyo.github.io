          <h2>German Conservative Leader Faces Second Vote After Initial Chancellor Bid Fails</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 09:16:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, unexpectedly failed to secure a majority in the initial parliamentary vote for chancellor, marking an unprecedented event in modern German politics. Despite his coalition holding enough seats, 18 members of parliament who were expected to support him dissented, leading to a second vote scheduled for later that day. Political commentators viewed Merz's defeat as a significant humiliation, with the far-right party calling for fresh elections. The article notes that Germany's government handover is carefully choreographed, and Merz's failure undermines his hopes of providing stability after the previous government's collapse.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade agreement after three years of negotiations, aimed at easing exports for UK firms, including whisky and cars, to India, while reducing taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. The British government emphasized that the deal does not include changes to immigration policy, including for Indian students in the UK. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds highlighted the 'massive' benefits for UK businesses and consumers. The government projects the deal will boost trade by an additional £25.5 billion annually by 2040, building on the existing £41 billion in trade between the two nations last year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are scheduled to meet at the White House to address ongoing trade disputes and overall economic relations between the two countries. The meeting follows Carney's election win, which was partially fueled by an anti-Trump platform. Trump has criticized Canada and imposed tariffs, while Carney has vowed to fight for the best possible deal for Canada. The historically friendly relationship between the U.S. and Canada is currently strained, and the outcome of this meeting could either ease tensions or exacerbate the situation, especially given existing tariffs on various goods.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that economists and fund managers expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates later this year in response to a wobbling economy characterized by higher inflation, rising unemployment, and increased recession risks. Sixty-five percent of respondents believe the Fed will prioritize addressing economic weakness despite inflation concerns. The survey also revealed increased odds of a recession in the next year, rising to 53% from 22% in January. Despite the downbeat outlook, respondents anticipate a rebound in growth around 2026, driven by the Trump administration's economic policies.</p>

Buffett assesses a business's intrinsic value by examining factors like consistent earnings, cash flow, and debt levels, aiming to determine its resilience against competition. He favors businesses that are fundamentally sound and can be run even by a 'fool,' emphasizing the importance of consistent cash flows and a dominant market position. Buffett's approach involves long-term investments and sound business models, exemplified by his investment in undervalued Japanese companies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been advocating for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, arguing that inflation has cooled and high borrowing costs are unnecessary. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting, taking a 'wait-and-see' approach to assess the impact of Trump's economic policies, including tariffs. Economists predict potential rate cuts later in the year, possibly starting in July, to provide relief on borrowing costs. However, some economists believe the Fed may delay cutting rates until December, depending on labor market conditions and tariff-induced inflation.</p>

          <p>China has released an action plan to decrease the amount of grain used in animal feed, particularly soybean meal, to enhance food security amid global trade uncertainties. The goal is to reduce the proportion of grain in animal feed to 60% and soybean meal to 10% by 2030. This initiative is part of a broader campaign to safeguard domestic crop supplies and minimize grain losses, including warnings against food waste.

          <p>Cattle ranchers along the United States-Mexico border are facing increasing challenges due to President Trump's trade policies, particularly the imposition of tariffs on Mexican goods. The unpredictability of these policies has already cost ranchers millions of dollars in profit losses, threatening the cross-border trade crucial to the U.S. livestock economy. The situation is compounded by existing issues such as parasitic screwworm outbreaks, drought, and personnel shortages at U.S. ports of entry.

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes President Trump for repeatedly mentioning the possibility of serving a third term, despite the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms. The board argues that Trump's behavior is consistent with a desire to wield power without limits, noting his past actions that disregard constitutional checks. They assert that the appropriate response from political leaders, especially Republicans, is to firmly state that Trump is barred from serving a third term, rather than dismissing it as a joke. The editorial emphasizes the importance of upholding the Constitution and its intended restrictions on presidential power.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo states that intelligence agencies do not believe that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's regime controls the criminal gang Tren de Aragua. This finding undermines Trump's claim that the gang committed crimes to destabilize the U.S. at Maduro's direction. The memo's release has led to questions about the administration's forceful criticism of media coverage and its justification for invoking the wartime statute.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings reveals that all non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded 'due process of law,' but the specifics of this process are contested. While not every migrant is guaranteed a 'trial,' the government must take steps to ensure fairness and the safety of vulnerable individuals. The type of 'notice' and 'hearing' depends on factors like legal admission, community ties, and asylum claims. The Supreme Court has ruled that those detained under the Alien Enemies Act must have a chance to seek habeas relief, and those deported to third countries must have a 'meaningful opportunity' to raise safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance, citing an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs. The automaker plans to offset $1 billion of these costs through remediation efforts, volume adjustments, and pricing strategies, resulting in a net impact of $1.5 billion in 2025. Ford cited near-term risks such as potential supply chain disruptions and the possibility of increased tariffs as reasons for pulling its guidance.
