          <p>A 17-year-old has been arrested following a shooting in Manhattan's Times Square that injured three people. The incident reportedly began as a fight inside a restaurant involving a group of teenagers. The altercation then spilled outside, where the suspect allegedly opened fire, wounding his 19-year-old target as well as two bystanders, an 18-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man. All victims are in stable condition, and police have recovered a gun from the scene.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams secured a 31-21 preseason win against the Dallas Cowboys, highlighting promising performances from their backup players. Rookie running back Blake Corum demonstrated his potential to share the workload with Kyren Williams by scoring two touchdowns. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also had a solid outing, completing 16 of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, though he did throw one interception.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The luxury fashion industry is shifting away from the subtle "quiet luxury" trend toward more visible and bold "loud luxury" designs. This change, marked by large logos and statement pieces, is an effort by major brands like Gucci and Burberry to re-engage consumers amid slowing sales. Analysts suggest this pivot is a natural cycle in fashion, driven by the need for novelty and a desire to reignite brand desirability after a period of significant price hikes. The success of this strategy may further divide the market between ultra-luxe brands and more accessible labels. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend highlights the intense competition for AI expertise within China's tech industry.

          <p>The recent deadly shooting at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters is being viewed by some agency staff as a tragic but unsurprising culmination of years of escalating threats. This article details the perspective of CDC employees who feel that political rhetoric, particularly from figures in the Trump administration like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has fueled a climate of hostility and misinformation against them. Staffers expressed frustration with the administration's slow response and feel abandoned after budget cuts, layoffs, and policy changes targeting the agency's scientific work. The incident has left many public health workers feeling unsafe even at their own workplace.</p>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, after experiencing a renaissance fueled by favorable pricing and cultural trends, is now facing a significant downturn. A combination of post-pandemic economic shifts, changing consumer habits among younger generations, and the impact of global trade tariffs has slowed sales growth dramatically. This economic pressure has led to an oversupply of bourbon, driving down prices and causing financial distress for some distilleries, with some filing for bankruptcy. Experts warn that the market has not yet bottomed out and more consolidation may be on the horizon. (not investment advice)</p>

This action follows previous moves to cut federal research funding, which the administration linked to the university's handling of pro-Palestinian protests.

An ad from a leading brand was recently banned for making unsubstantiated health claims.

This phenomenon reflects a love for "junk film," where movies that are earnestly made but fail spectacularly become more entertaining than bland, forgettable blockbusters.

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have issued statements of regret following accusations of cultural appropriation by authorities in Oaxaca, Mexico. The controversy surrounds a new sandal design that Mexican officials say reinterprets and uses the name of a traditional "huarache" sandal unique to the region. The Mexican government is seeking compensation, and local authorities have called for the shoe to be withdrawn. This incident is the latest in a series of conflicts where Mexico has challenged global fashion brands for using Indigenous designs without proper collaboration or compensation.</p>

          <p>Apple shares experienced their largest weekly gain since July 2020, rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed a White House meeting where CEO Tim Cook and President Donald Trump announced Apple's plan to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. President Trump stated that because of this domestic investment, Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips. This news eased investor fears that tariffs could significantly impact the company's profitability, leading to a strong rally in its stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JT Lindsey, a freshman running back for Louisiana State University, has been arrested on felony charges of being an accessory to second-degree murder. He is accused of allowing two teenage friends, who were wanted for a fatal shooting in May, to stay in his on-campus dorm room. U.S. Marshals arrested the two suspects at the dorm, where they also allegedly found multiple firearms. Lindsey's lawyer claims the player was unaware his friends were wanted, but the arrest warrant suggests it was "highly unlikely" he did not know. LSU has suspended Lindsey from all team activities.</p>

          <p>Despite new ownership and a roster overhaul, Rangers FC is exhibiting the same inconsistent form that plagued them in previous seasons. Under new head coach Russell Martin, the team followed a strong Champions League qualifying win with a disappointing draw against Dundee in the Scottish Premiership. Martin acknowledged the team's "lethargy" and questioned their mentality, a familiar problem for the club. With the team already trailing in the league, the manager is asking for patience, stating that changing the club's culture is "no quick fix."</p>

This move, part of Taiwan's broader effort to raise its international profile, comes amid a period of improving relations between China and Japan.

Under the proposal, criminals with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away, with their home country deciding if they serve any remaining prison time. The Ministry of Justice argues this will save taxpayer money and protect the public. Critics, however, warn that some countries may simply refuse to accept the deported criminals, potentially allowing them to go free.</p>

          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the cognitive benefits of pomegranates, recommending them particularly for people over the age of 50. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein buildup associated with Alzheimer's disease. While fresh pomegranates can be costly and seasonal, the article notes that pomegranate extract can be a year-round alternative, though consumers should watch out for added sugars.</p>
