Following the report's release, former President Donald Trump urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While timely bill payments are crucial for credit scores, experts emphasize that they are not the sole determinant of a high score. Many Americans mistakenly believe that consistently paying bills on time is sufficient to improve their credit, but factors such as the type of debt and whether the payments are reported to credit bureaus also play a significant role. For instance, payments for rent-to-own services, private school tuition, and some buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans may not be reported, thus not impacting the credit score. Checking one's credit report is a way to know which payments are influencing your credit.</p>

The planet, named TOI-6894b, is a gas giant with a radius slightly larger than Saturn but only half its mass. Its existence is puzzling because it was previously thought that small stars could not provide the conditions necessary to form such large planets.
