          <p>Israeli naval ships intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla, carrying aid to Gaza, detaining activists like Greta Thunberg. Israel claims the vessels were approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade, while the GSF called the interception illegal and alleged a vessel was rammed. This incident has drawn international condemnation, with Colombia expelling Israeli diplomats and other nations expressing concern. The interception occurs amidst ongoing debate over aid access to Gaza, which the UN states is experiencing famine due to Israeli obstruction.</p>

          <p>Portland police are seeking public assistance to locate an assault suspect after a "dialogue liaison officer" (DLO) lost track of her near an ICE facility. The DLO, a sworn officer tasked with de-escalation and maintaining a safe space for protesters, attempted to engage the suspect to hear her story, but she refused a lawful police order and fled. This incident highlights the challenges faced by Portland's DLO program, implemented after violent 2020 protests, which prohibits DLOs from direct enforcement actions. The case has since been assigned to a detective in the Major Crimes Unit for further investigation.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean chipmakers Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix surged significantly after announcing a partnership with OpenAI's Stargate initiative. This collaboration aims to boost the supply of advanced memory chips crucial for next-generation AI and expand data center capacity in Korea. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with South Korean leaders, securing agreements to develop AI data centers and scale up HBM chip production, solidifying the companies' roles in the global AI value chain. This move is expected to strengthen their competitive position, particularly against rival Nvidia.</p>

These chip heavyweights soared after announcing a strategic partnership with OpenAI to supply memory chips, fueling investor optimism. The broader Asian markets also saw varied movements, with Japan's Nikkei advancing and Australia's ASX surging. This market rally occurred despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, with traders speculating it might be short-lived. (not investment advice)</p>

The campaign, designed by Rethink, aims to connect with coffee-loving renters, a growing demographic. This initiative highlights a significant societal issue, with data showing the median age of first-time homebuyers hitting a record high of 38 and affordability reaching an all-time low.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become the first person in history to achieve a net worth exceeding $500 billion, according to Forbes. This financial milestone is attributed to the rising valuations of his companies, including Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX. His wealth is closely tied to his substantial stake in Tesla, whose shares have surged over 20% this year, partly due to investor confidence in his renewed focus on business over politics. The Tesla board has also outlined an ambitious pay package for Musk, potentially worth over $1 trillion if specific targets are met.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has blocked the release of graphic crime scene photos from the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students by Bryan Kohberger. The ruling prioritizes the victims' families' "extreme emotional distress" over the public's interest in the investigation, ordering redactions of any images showing bodies or blood. While other investigatory records, including videos of distraught friends, can be released, the judge emphasized that the criminal case is closed. This decision aims to prevent further trauma to the families from disturbing images circulating online.</p>

          <p>French asset manager Amundi has largely exited China's September equity rally, reallocating its holdings towards dividend stocks due to persistent doubts about China's economic outlook and valuation concerns.

Amundi's deputy CIO, Philippe d’Orgeval, indicated that while a correction could present a future opportunity, the current macro environment, including unsettled tariffs, remains less supportive for equity markets.

The core of the dispute revolves around a Democratic proposal to reverse recent restrictions on Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens, restoring coverage for legally present immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. While federal law prohibits Medicaid for those without legal status, Republicans argue Democratic efforts could indirectly enable states to fund such care.

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders responded to questions about remaining the team's third-string QB by literally muting himself during a press conference. This silent protest followed the promotion of fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel to starting quarterback over veteran Joe Flacco. Sanders, a former college star, was a fifth-round pick, while Gabriel was a third-round selection. His unique response may be a reaction to critical remarks from former NFL coach Rex Ryan regarding Sanders' previous comments about his backup status.</p>

          <p>Christa Gail Pike, the only woman on Tennessee's death row, has been scheduled for execution on September 30, 2026, over 30 years after she brutally murdered a romantic rival. Pike was 18 at the time of the 1995 attack, which involved beating, stabbing, and carving a pentagram into the victim. If carried out, this would be Tennessee's first execution of a woman in two centuries and only the 19th in modern US history. Pike has expressed remorse, and her attorneys argue her young age and undiagnosed mental health issues at the time warrant life imprisonment instead.</p>

          <p>An expert debunks common myths about cooking oils, offering guidance on their health benefits and suitability for different cooking methods. Professor Nita Forouhi highlights that sunflower and vegetable oils are beneficial due to low saturated fats and high mono/polyunsaturated fats, making them good for cooking. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, with near-zero trans fats. The article clarifies that while extra virgin olive oil is best for dressings, basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying, and vegetable or sunflower oil is ideal for deep frying due to higher smoke points.</p>
