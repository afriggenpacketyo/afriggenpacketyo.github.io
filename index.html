          <p>Ethiopia's inauguration of the US$5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam has ignited a tense diplomatic conflict with Egypt, which views the project as an unlawful unilateral act threatening its vital water supply. Sudan, another downstream nation, has also voiced concerns regarding the dam's safety and the risk of uncoordinated water releases. Despite China's strong ties with all three nations, positioning it as a potential mediator, observers suggest Beijing is unlikely to intervene in the escalating conflict. Egypt has warned it reserves the right to take all measures under international law to defend its people's existential interests, underscoring the potential for further escalation in this critical regional issue, which has global implications for water security and stability.</p>

She announced that TPUSA's events, including AmericaFest, will proceed as planned, emphasizing faith and family. Meanwhile, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines have suspended employees for making celebratory online remarks about Kirk's death, and a Phoenix Suns reporter was fired for similar comments. FBI officials also revealed the alleged assassin, Tyler Robinson, lived with a transgender partner who is cooperating with the investigation, adding a complex layer to the ongoing political discourse surrounding the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion at the "Mis Tesoros" bar in Madrid has resulted in one fatality and at least 25 injuries, with two victims in serious condition and three others potentially serious. Rescue workers discovered the body early Sunday morning amidst the rubble, following a search by firefighters and police. Authorities suspect a gas leak caused the blast, which occurred in the Puente de Vallecas district, though the specific gas type and exact cause are still under investigation. The building housing the bar has been deemed unstable, necessitating the rehousing of residents from nine upper apartments, highlighting the significant structural damage and the ongoing impact on the affected community.</p>

          <p>George Smith IV vanished from his honeymoon cruise in July 2005, sparking a nearly two-decade-long quest for answers by his family, who remain tormented by the unresolved mystery. Initially, suspicion fell on his widow, but the FBI shifted focus to a group of young men last seen with George. A "48 Hours" investigation uncovered failed polygraphs, questionable alibis, and a provocative video made by some men shortly after his disappearance, which contained callous remarks about George's death. The case, which also involved a sexual assault allegation against some of the men, was officially closed by the FBI in 2015 due to insufficient evidence, though George's family vows to continue their relentless search for justice.</p>

However, the proposal faces a significant obstacle: Russia's veto power within the UN Security Council, which authorizes such missions. Efforts to achieve a ceasefire have been stalled for months, with Russia demanding Ukraine address its ambitions to join NATO and the EU before talks can progress, making a peacekeeping mission a distant prospect.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has led to significant professional repercussions for individuals who expressed critical or mocking sentiments about his death. Numerous people, including teachers, firefighters, journalists, and a Secret Service employee, have been fired, suspended, or censured, highlighting the intense public backlash. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has even ordered a search for military members or Pentagon affiliates who condoned the murder. This crackdown highlights a stark contrast with past instances where some of the same figures, including Kirk, had previously mocked victims of political violence, underscoring the deep political rancor and free speech debates in the wake of the tragedy.</p>

The plan includes a "land bridge" with a natural gas pipeline, a road, and port terminals to bypass the canal for certain cargo, particularly LNG. This aims to provide a more reliable and competitive transit option, attracting energy companies. Additionally, the Rio Indo dam project, costing $1.6 billion and set for completion by 2032, will supply supplemental water to Lake Gatun. These initiatives address the canal's rainfall dependency and its vital role in the US economy and global supply chains (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A fatal crash involving an Indian-born Sikh truck driver in Florida has triggered a wave of fear and harassment within the Sikh trucking community in the US, which comprises approximately 150,000 drivers. Despite California officials stating the driver had a legal work permit, the Department of Homeland Security claims he entered illegally. This incident led Secretary of State Marco Rubio to pause work visas for foreign truck drivers and has resulted in increased harassment and racial slurs against Sikh drivers at truck stops. Industry insiders warn of a potential driver shortage if stricter immigration laws and an unwelcoming environment deter this essential workforce, highlighting broader issues of xenophobia and economic impact.</p>

          <h2>Debate Arises Over Risks of Unlimited Contactless Card Spending and Consumer Debt</h2>

          <p>Academics warn that removing or significantly increasing the limit on contactless card payments could lead to a rise in spontaneous spending and increased consumer debt. Currently, a PIN is required for purchases over £100, acting as a crucial "friction point" to control spending. The UK's financial regulator has proposed allowing banks to set their own limits or remove them entirely, prompting debate among banks and consumers. While proponents argue for personal choice and catching up with digital wallets, critics raise concerns about security, particularly for credit cards, and the potential for "limitless economic abuse" by controlling partners in a cashless society.</p>

          <p>German customs officers at the port of Hamburg seized over 400 kilograms (881 pounds) of cocaine and arrested two men after dock workers reported suspicious activity. The workers noticed two individuals boarding a ship and later disembarking with over 20 sports bags, prompting an immediate police intervention. One suspect was apprehended at the scene, while the second was captured later after a major search involving a police helicopter and cordoning off areas of the port. Hamburg, as Germany's largest seaport, is a known hotspot for cocaine entering mainland Europe, and authorities warn of a "cocaine surge" in the region due to market saturation in North America, highlighting an ongoing battle against drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's unprecedented second state visit to the UK is seen by some as a crucial diplomatic move to ensure a strong bilateral relationship and keep the unpredictable president "on side." British diplomatic insiders emphasize the importance of early engagement during his second term to avoid potential tariffs and safeguard British interests, particularly given the UK's reliance on the US relationship. However, critics, including author Michael Wolff, view the visit as primarily a "vanity trip" focused on photo opportunities and bolstering Trump's image, rather than substantive policy outcomes. Despite planned protests and the backdrop of geopolitical turmoil, the UK government deems the diplomatic cost worthwhile for securing future relations.</p>

          <p>The long throw, once a tactical weapon popularized by Rory Delap, has made a significant comeback in Premier League football, with Brentford emerging as its leading exponents. The team demonstrated its effectiveness against Chelsea, scoring a late equalizer from a Kevin Schade long throw to secure a 2-2 draw. Brentford has now scored seven goals from long throws since last season, five more than any other team, proving that this "old school" approach creates chaos and is highly effective. Brentford boss Keith Andrews, a former set-piece coach, embraces the tactic, seeing it as a valuable tool to gain advantages and secure results, despite some "snobbery" in the game, highlighting its renewed strategic importance.</p>

          <p>A "Unite the Kingdom" rally organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson in central London drew up to 150,000 people and resulted in significant violence, leaving 26 police officers injured, four seriously, including broken teeth and a spinal injury. Clashes erupted as some protesters threw bottles and projectiles at officers attempting to separate them from counter-protesters. Twenty-five arrests were made for offenses including violent disorder, and investigations continue. Tech billionaire Elon Musk made a surprise videolink appearance, criticizing "uncontrolled migration" and calling for a "change of government."
