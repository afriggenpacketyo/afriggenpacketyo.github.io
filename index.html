          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee is shutting down a direct communication channel between U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem working on Palestinian issues and agencies in Washington. This channel, located in the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, allowed direct communication with Washington to emphasize the importance of Palestinian issues, treating the West Bank and Gaza Strip as separate from Israel. Huckabee's decision ends the special status of the Office of Palestinian Affairs, requiring them to seek approval from embassy leaders before sending cables to U.S. agencies. Secretary of State Marco Rubio supports the merger, aiming to fully integrate the Palestinian Affairs office into the embassy under Huckabee's supervision, which is one of his most significant decisions since arriving in Israel.</p>

          <p>Travelers who havenâ€™t obtained a REAL ID by the deadline will still be able to fly, but should be prepared for extra scrutiny, according to Homeland Security head Kristi Noem. While 81% of travelers already have compliant IDs, those without may be diverted to a different line for additional identity checks. Passports and tribal IDs will also be accepted at security checkpoints. REAL ID, a federally compliant state-issued license, was recommended by the 9/11 Commission to set security standards for state-issued driverâ€™s licenses and IDs, with the implementation repeatedly delayed since its initial rollout in 2008. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to enforce its policy barring transgender individuals from serving in the military while legal proceedings continue. This decision pauses a lower court order that had blocked the ban nationwide, with Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissenting. The policy stems from an executive order targeting active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria, citing concerns about military readiness, lethality, and cohesion. Legal challenges argue the policy unconstitutionally discriminates against transgender individuals, who meet the same standards as all who serve, but the Justice Department defends the ban as based on a medical condition, not transgender status.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the United States does not need to "sign deals" with trade partners, despite repeated claims from top White House officials that such deals are a top priority. During a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump expressed frustration with questions about when deals would be signed, asserting that other countries need access to the U.S. market more than the U.S. needs theirs. This statement comes after weeks of the administration suggesting that countries were actively seeking bilateral trade talks with the United States, yet no formal agreements have been announced.</p>

          <p>The Gujarat Titans secured a remarkable final-ball victory over the Mumbai Indians in an Indian Premier League match that was heavily affected by rain. The match saw several shifts in momentum, with a second rain delay appearing to favor Mumbai, as Gujarat needed 24 runs from 12 balls and was behind on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method. Following the delay, Gujarat's target was adjusted, requiring 15 runs from the final six balls, which they achieved after a series of dramatic plays and a missed run-out opportunity by Mumbai's captain Hardik Pandya. Titans won by three runs via the DLS method.</p>

Trump, who had criticized Canada's dependence on the U.S. before the meeting, adopted a conciliatory tone, praising Carney's electoral victory. The leaders discussed trade and security issues, with Carney highlighting the need for ongoing discussions beyond trade, but no major breakthroughs were expected from the meeting.</p>

Trump has targeted law firms with executive orders that would cripple their businesses, leading many firms to avoid legal work that challenges his agenda.

D.C. and 17 states are suing Trump and several officials, alleging the administration is halting progress on wind energy development and undermining congressionally imposed responsibilities. The plaintiff states warn against job losses and economic effects, arguing the directive contradicts Trump's claims of needing reliable domestic energy.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston is considering whether noncitizens in the United States have the same constitutional right to free speech as U.S. citizens, as court battles over the Trump administration's revocation of foreign student visas intensify. Judge William Young suggested that it is "not clear" to him that noncitizens have the "full rights to free speech" that citizens have, as the administration attempts to use the speech of some international students to justify their deportations. The case challenges the Trump administration's efforts to revoke visas and detain and deport pro-Palestinian activists, with the groups accusing the administration of "terrorizing students and faculty for their exercise of First Amendment rights."</p>

          <p>Israel's security Cabinet has unanimously approved a plan to widen the military offensive in Gaza, dubbed "Gideon's Chariots," which includes the "conquest of Gaza" and occupying the territory. The plan involves the IDF invading and seizing control of Gaza territory, forcibly displacing the civilian population to the south, and dismantling Hamas. Prime Minister Netanyahu said the offensive aims to defeat Hamas, with the "population will be moved, for its own protection." The cabinet also approved the drafting of tens of thousands of reservists to carry out the operation.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump, asserting that Canada is "not for sale" in response to suggestions of annexation. Carney's body language during the meeting conveyed his strong stance, with a clenched jaw and attempts to interject during discussions on tariffs. Trump launched a scathing attack on Canada on Truth Social moments before the meeting, claiming the U.S. subsidizes Canada by $200 billion a year.
