          <p>The United States federal government remains in a shutdown as political leaders fail to reach a funding agreement, leading to a standstill in Washington. This impasse between the Democratic and Republican parties has halted numerous non-essential government services and furloughed thousands of federal employees. The ongoing situation creates uncertainty for the public and the economy, with no clear resolution in sight. Former President Trump has stated that the Republican party will not be "extorted" by Democrats, signaling that the deep political divisions are unlikely to be bridged in the immediate future, prolonging the disruption to national operations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat experienced a massive surge, jumping over 90% in a single day after a period of significant decline had relegated it to penny stock status. This remarkable rally was primarily triggered by its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME), which unleashed a significant short squeeze as investors betting against the stock were forced to cover their positions. The company also announced an expanded distribution deal with Walmart, further fueling investor optimism. Analysts suggest this speculative frenzy could be a sign of a frothy market where retail traders are driving extreme volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors saw its stock soar by over 15% after the automaker announced third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and profit. The company also raised its full-year financial guidance, signaling strong confidence in its performance and its ability to manage tariff impacts more effectively than anticipated. Despite the positive results from its traditional automotive business, GM reported significant charges related to its strategic pullback in all-electric vehicles. The company acknowledged that achieving profitability in the EV sector is taking longer than expected due to structural costs and slowing consumer adoption rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has cautioned its employees against sharing photos of the ongoing demolition work in the White House's East Wing, where a new, privately funded $250 million ballroom is being constructed at President Trump's behest. The warning was issued after images of the construction, visible from the adjacent Treasury building, went viral online and sparked criticism from political opponents. A Treasury spokesperson stated the directive was a precautionary measure to prevent the accidental disclosure of sensitive security features or confidential structural details of the White House complex during the renovation process, framing it as a matter of national security.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ordered Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, and Instagram head Adam Mosseri to testify in person at an upcoming trial concerning the harmful effects of social media on young users. The judge ruled that the CEOs' testimony is uniquely relevant to allegations that their companies knowingly designed addictive features that caused mental health issues in minors and failed to provide adequate warnings. This decision comes amid a wave of lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny aimed at holding technology companies accountable for child safety on their platforms, which the companies had argued against to avoid business disruptions.</p>

          <p>A third abuse survivor has resigned from the advisory panel for the UK government's inquiry into grooming gangs, intensifying a crisis of confidence in the process. The survivor, known as "Elizabeth," alleged that the inquiry feels like a "cover-up" and has created a "toxic environment," echoing the sentiments of two other survivors who resigned previously. They have raised concerns that the inquiry's scope is being improperly widened to dilute its focus on specific gangs and that potential chairs have conflicts of interest. The government has denied these claims, but the resignations cast serious doubt on the inquiry's ability to deliver justice for victims.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve having initiated an interest rate-cutting cycle, top financial advisors are recommending that investors reassess their portfolios to adapt to the changing economic landscape. Strategies include locking in yields on intermediate-range U.S. Treasury bonds, as lower rates can make existing bond yields more attractive. Advisors also stress the importance of maintaining a well-diversified equity portfolio rather than chasing high-flying sectors, as it is difficult to predict which industries will outperform in a lower-rate environment. The current cycle is considered different from previous ones, as the cuts are occurring amidst a relatively strong economy, requiring a balanced approach. (not investment advice)</p>

Her rise to power was secured through an alliance with a right-wing populist party.

          <p>An analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are fueling inflation and measurably increasing costs for American consumers. The research found that product categories with heavy import reliance, such as furniture, car parts, and electronics, have seen significant price hikes. According to the study, these tariffs added approximately 0.5 percentage points to the headline inflation rate between June and August. While businesses have not passed on the full cost to consumers yet, other research suggests they may eventually pass on over half of the tariff expenses, further straining household budgets.

          <p>Following a major heist at the Louvre, the French Ministry of Culture has confirmed that the priceless stolen jewels were not covered by private insurance. Under French law, collections in national museums are considered state property, and the state acts as its own insurer unless the items are loaned to another institution. This means neither the museum nor the government will receive an insurance payout to cover the value of the stolen treasures, making the financial loss absolute. The revelation underscores the immense cultural and monetary damage of the theft and raises further questions about the state's risk management for its most valuable heritage assets.</p>

Using Orwell's own letters, essays, and diary entries, the film traces how the suppression of truth and the propagation of falsehoods have become common political tools. Peck contends that while generations have recognized the novel's prescient warnings about concepts like Newspeak and thoughtcrime, this awareness has led to a sense of numbness rather than meaningful resistance against the erosion of democratic norms.

          <p>A police pursuit in Los Angeles ended in a graphic and tragic death that was broadcast on live television by news helicopters. The suspect, driving a reportedly stolen van, crashed into a freeway median before climbing out of the moving vehicle. He then stumbled backward into oncoming traffic in the southbound lanes and was immediately struck by an SUV and subsequently hit by several other vehicles. The man was pronounced dead at the scene despite efforts by officers and paramedics to render aid. The incident prompted a major closure of the freeway for several hours as authorities investigated the fatal conclusion of the chase.</p>

          <p>Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the first Asian American rabbi in North America and leader of New York's prominent Central Synagogue, shared her belief that empathy, not power, is the defining characteristic of true faith. Drawing from her personal experience growing up as a Korean Jew and often feeling like an outsider, she explained that this perspective cultivated a deep sense of compassion that now guides her leadership. In her sermons and new memoir, she advocates for "radical compassion," urging people to understand the perspective of the stranger. This message has resonated widely, especially amid rising political tensions and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.</p>

          <p>U.S. cattle ranchers are expressing strong concern over President Trump's suggestion to import beef from Argentina, arguing it fails to address the core threats to the domestic food supply. The U.S. cattle herd is already at its lowest level since 1951 due to persistent drought and is now facing a potential comeback of the flesh-eating screwworm parasite from Mexico. Ranching associations contend that government intervention to import beef would create market chaos and undermine domestic producers. They urge the administration to focus instead on biosecurity measures to eradicate the screwworm threat and allow market forces to stabilize the beef supply chain.</p>

Experts note that warmer winters are allowing ticks to remain active for longer periods, expanding the traditional tick season and increasing the risk of exposure for both humans and animals. The advisory provides practical prevention steps, such as avoiding tall grass and checking for ticks regularly, to mitigate the spread of these infections in the community.</p>
