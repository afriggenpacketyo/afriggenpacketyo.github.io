          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that most Americans who display the U.S. flag do so out of patriotism and support for the military, not as a political statement. However, there are partisan differences, with Republicans more likely to fly the flag for patriotic and political reasons. The survey also found that a majority of Americans believe it should be illegal to burn the flag in protest, a view consistent with polling from 35 years ago. Most respondents also feel it is acceptable to fly the flag of one's heritage alongside the American flag.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman, has been released after nearly five months in ICE custody in Texas. Sakeik, who has lived in the U.S. since childhood and is married to a U.S. citizen, was arrested in February while returning from her honeymoon. Her attorneys state that ICE attempted to deport her twice, actions they condemn as unconstitutional and part of a depraved immigration policy. Sakeik's release followed significant legal and public pressure on her behalf.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for. The blast, which injured two others, ignited multiple grass fires and caused ongoing explosions from undetonated fireworks. Officials have issued evacuation orders and are investigating the incident with assistance from the ATF. It was later discovered that the company lacked the necessary local licenses to store fireworks on the agricultural property, raising questions about regulatory oversight.</p>

          <p>A massive legislative package championed by President Trump is set to become law, enacting long-sought conservative goals of cutting taxes and restricting social safety nets. The bill extends tax cuts from his first term and introduces new ones, but it also fundamentally overhauls Medicaid and the SNAP food assistance program with stricter work requirements. Nonpartisan analyses predict these changes could cause millions to lose their healthcare and food benefits. While Republicans argue the bill curbs waste, critics warn of widespread negative effects on low-income Americans and a significant increase in the national deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

On the economy, growth has been minimal, and some government policies may be weighing on business.

          <p>Rio de Janeiro is deploying one of its largest-ever peacetime security operations for the upcoming Brics summit, which will host leaders from 28 countries. The plan involves approximately 20,000 military personnel, a no-fly zone enforced by armed fighter jets, and the temporary closure of a major domestic airport near the venue. This level of security, including the authority to shoot down threatening aircraft, was last seen during the 2016 Olympics. The measures underscore the high-stakes nature of the summit for the major emerging economies of the Global South.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative David Valadao of California is facing intense criticism for voting in favor of a legislative bill that will significantly cut Medicaid funding. His district has the highest number of residents relying on the program in the state, with roughly two-thirds of his constituents covered by it. Despite previously vowing to oppose harmful healthcare cuts, Valadao supported the bill, citing concessions he negotiated for rural hospitals and agriculture. Democrats have already targeted him over the vote, calling it a betrayal of his constituents ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

          <p>The impacts of President Trump's major tax and spending bill will be staggered, with many key changes taking effect after the 2026 midterm elections. New work requirements for Medicaid recipients are set to begin in 2026, while changes to food assistance programs (SNAP) will start as early as this year. Some tax changes, like deductions for tips and overtime, will be reflected in 2026 tax filings, but tax credits for electric vehicles and green home upgrades will end much sooner. The bill's structure delays some of the most significant effects until later in the presidential term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a report, Pixar's animated film "Elio" was altered to remove LGBTQ+ elements following negative feedback from test screenings. The original director, Adrian Molina, who is gay, reportedly left the project after his vision was changed, which included removing a scene with a male crush for the main character. The changes led to an exodus of talent from the production, with some former staffers stating the final version is inferior. The film also saw actor America Ferrera depart, citing a lack of Latinx representation in the new leadership.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in the Los Angeles Times argues for a new approach to make GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs more affordable through employer-sponsored health insurance. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons and having manufacturers sell the drugs to health plans at the same direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month. Employers could then contribute a portion of the cost, bringing the employee's out-of-pocket expense down significantly. The piece contends this simplified, transparent system would improve public health by increasing access to these transformative medications. (not investment advice)</p>

The report links the trade to international organized crime, forced labor, and illegal immigration, suggesting it is a "golden thread" for understanding serious crime networks.

Trump played a crucial role, personally calling lawmakers and using his social media platform to push the bill over the finish line.
