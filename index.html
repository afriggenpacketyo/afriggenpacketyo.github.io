        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie running back Quinshon Judkins was arrested in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Saturday over an allegation of domestic violence. According to Broward County police records, he faces a charge of "touch or strike/battery/domestic violence." Judkins, a second-round draft pick from Ohio State, was anticipated to be a significant contributor to the team's running game this season. The Cleveland Browns have acknowledged the situation and stated they are currently gathering more information, while Judkins may face disciplinary action from the NFL under its personal conduct policy.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized a proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump to implement a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1. In response, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen threatened potential countermeasures, while Mexico labeled the move an "unfair deal," though both expressed a desire to continue negotiations. The proposed tariffs are part of a broader U.S. trade strategy that has also targeted Japan, South Korea, and Canada. European leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, have voiced significant disapproval, with some calling for the preparation of a firm retaliatory response if an agreement is not reached.

          <p>Iga Swiatek of Poland claimed her first Wimbledon women's singles championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova. The match, which lasted just 57 minutes, marked the first time in 114 years that a Wimbledon women's final ended with one player not winning a single game. This victory gives the 24-year-old Swiatek her sixth Grand Slam title overall and maintains her undefeated 6-0 record in major finals. For the 23-year-old Anisimova, this was her first Grand Slam final appearance following a career break in 2023 to focus on her mental health.</p>

          <p>A group of over 30 active duty and former Navy SEALs are volunteering their expertise in the aftermath of deadly floods in Texas Hill Country. The specialists are aiding in search and recovery efforts along the Guadalupe River, navigating difficult terrain and diving in areas devastated by the deluge. The SEALs, who have recovered several victims, are working through miles of destruction, using chainsaws to clear flattened trees. The effort is supported by the non-profit organization 300 Justice Road, which has been providing thousands of meals daily to the volunteers and first responders on site.</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in Eastpoint, Florida, was traced back to a volatile polyamorous relationship involving her, her boyfriend Zachary Abell, and his other girlfriend, Christina Araujo. Investigators connected Seiden's body, found dumped on a roadside, to a bloody crime scene in a motel room the trio had shared. The investigation revealed a history of alcohol-fueled violence and jealousy within the 'throuple.' Ultimately, both Abell and Araujo were charged, with Araujo taking a plea deal and testifying that Abell led the fatal beating, resulting in his conviction for second-degree murder and a life sentence.</p>

          <h2>FBI Director Kash Patel Dismisses Resignation Rumors Over Epstein Files Decision</h2>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly denied rumors that he plans to resign from his position. The speculation arose following reports of his dissatisfaction with a joint Justice Department and FBI decision to conclude the review of the Jeffrey Epstein files without releasing further information. In a social media post, Patel affirmed his commitment to serving, stating the "conspiracy theories just aren’t true." The decision not to release more files, including a non-existent "client list," has angered some hardline Trump supporters and reportedly caused a rift with FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino.</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to a vast coltan mining site in eastern DR Congo, currently controlled by M23 rebels. The Rubaya mine, which holds 15% of the world's supply of the mineral essential for mobile phones, is a hive of activity for thousands of miners. An M23-appointed supervisor claims the rebel group has brought security and order, but a UN report alleges the group profits heavily by taxing the mineral trade. This visit comes as a fragile ceasefire is in place, with the U.S. reportedly seeking access to DR Congo's mineral rights as part of the broader peace process.</p>

          <p>The reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a significant resurgence in viewership, with its success being amplified by massive engagement on social media, particularly TikTok. While TV audience figures are returning to 2022 levels, the show's official accounts have gained 1.8 million followers this year, with a million of those on TikTok alone. Content creators and fans note that short-form clips, recaps, and analysis make the show more accessible to busy viewers. However, some, including a former contestant, warn that this bite-sized consumption can lead to a distorted perception of the participants.</p>

          <p>A wildfire near Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park has exploded in size, scorching over 20,000 acres and forcing evacuations, while another nearby fire threatens historic structures.

The White Sage Fire in Arizona remains uncontained amid unfavorable weather conditions. Meanwhile, Canada's province of Manitoba has declared a state of emergency due to its own severe wildfires, which have forced thousands to evacuate.</p>

          <p>With the price of package holidays rising, families are adopting various money-saving strategies to afford their summer vacations. Some are finding significant savings by booking last-minute deals, with one couple securing a two-week, all-inclusive trip to Mexico for thousands less than European options. Others utilize travel site filters to find "kids go free" places and travel during off-peak seasons to cut costs by half. Alternative methods like home-swapping, house sitting, and using credit card loyalty points for flights are also proving effective for travelers looking to make their getaways more affordable.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas have resulted in at least 129 deaths, including children at a summer camp, with dozens of people still unaccounted for. The catastrophe, driven by a massive, slow-moving weather system, has prompted a large-scale search and recovery effort. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, as many residents and campers claim they received no alert before the river rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The event has been described as a "100-year flood," overwhelming the flood-prone region.</p>

          <p>A major excavation is set to begin in Tuam, Ireland, at the site of a former church-run home where it is believed hundreds of babies and toddlers are buried in an unmarked mass grave. The St. Mary's home, which operated from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children. A local historian's research uncovered death records for 796 children who died at the home, with evidence suggesting they were buried in a defunct sewage tank. The two-year forensic excavation aims to recover the remains and potentially identify the children, bringing a somber resolution to a dark chapter in Irish history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting immigration officials from "indiscriminately" detaining individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong also bars officials from denying detainees access to legal counsel. The order stems from a lawsuit filed after several individuals, including U.S. citizens, were arrested at a bus stop. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" that officials were conducting unconstitutional "roving patrols" based on factors like race or speaking Spanish, rather than reasonable suspicion.</p>

While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the win, Ohtani's dominant start provided the momentum the team desperately needed.
