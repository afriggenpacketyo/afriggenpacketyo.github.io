          <p>The sister of Jason Corbett, an Irish businessman murdered in North Carolina, is speaking out after his death in 2015. Corbett was killed by his wife, Molly Corbett, and her father, Tom Martens, who claimed self-defense, alleging Jason was abusive and tried to strangle Molly. However, prosecutors argued it was murder, and Tracey Lynch, Jason's sister, is fighting to clear his name, describing him as an amazing human being who wanted to return to Ireland because he was unhappy. Molly Corbett and Tom Martens were convicted of second-degree murder, then released for a new trial, and eventually pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter and were released in June 2024.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee, a bank manager, was forced to rob her own bank in 2000 after masked gunmen kidnapped her and her 7-year-old daughter, Breea, threatening them with fake dynamite. The gunmen, who had followed Renee for months, demanded she steal $360,000 from the bank or her daughter would be killed. After the robbery, Renee returned home to find Breea safe, and investigators eventually arrested the perpetrators, discovering a wealth of evidence, including the fake dynamite components. Despite the overwhelming evidence, the defense attacked Renee's credibility in court, suggesting she was complicit in the robbery, but she was eventually exonerated when one of the perpetrators recanted his testimony years later.</p>

          <p>Three shipyard officials in North Korea have been detained following the unsuccessful launch of a naval destroyer. The incident occurred during a launch ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un, who wants to build a strong naval force. The ship sustained damage to its stern, and Kim Jong Un blamed the failure on carelessness and unscientific empiricism. While North Korea claims the damage is not severe and repairs will take 10 days, observers suggest it could take much longer to fix the vessel, a 5,000-ton-class ship capable of carrying various weapons.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK rail policy. The government says this move represents a "new dawn for rail," with plans to improve services and reinvest profits into infrastructure. While lower fares were not promised, the government assured passengers of great value for money and expressed concerns over outsourcing to private companies. The SWR trains will now be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), which will oversee all railway infrastructure and sport the new GBR livery.</p>

          <p>A wealthy Qatari businessman's campaign to lead the International Table Tennis Federation is being investigated amid concerns of bribery and lavish spending. One of his critics was detained and interrogated in Doha during the sport's world championships. The integrity unit of the federation is investigating whether Khalil Al-Mohannadi or his supporters are trying to influence the vote through monetary means. Al-Mohannadi has been associated with the federation for decades, and accusations of vote-buying have previously surfaced.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani's return to the mound is likely to be after the All-Star break, according to manager Dave Roberts. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters Sunday for the first time since elbow surgery in September 2023. Roberts said that the natural progression of building a starter up to five or six innings makes it unlikely that Ohtani will pitch before the break. The Dodgers initially considered having him return to the mound early in the season, but decided to prioritize his hitting during spring training.</p>

          <p>A new study finds that stress from work can affect dogs at home. Researchers surveyed 85 working dog owners and measured job stress and rumination, then tracked dog stress behaviors. The study found that owners with higher job stress had dogs who showed more stress-related behaviors. The big factor driving the connection was rumination, as owners who mentally took work home were more likely to have stressed-out dogs. Putting work aside when you walk through the door doesnâ€™t just help your own health, it helps your dog, too.</p>
