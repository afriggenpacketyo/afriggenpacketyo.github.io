          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that the impacts of pandemic-era government spending and monetary policy are fading, potentially making the U.S. economy vulnerable to a downturn. Dimon noted that while employment and consumer spending have continued to grow, survey data shows weakening confidence among consumers and business leaders due to the Trump administration's tariff policies. He anticipates a slight decrease in employment and a slight increase in inflation, further complicated by lower levels of immigration. Dimon also expressed concerns about private credit, advising fund managers against buying credit at current prices and spreads. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that consumer prices in the U.S. rose by 0.1% in May, which was less than the 0.2% economists had anticipated. The annual inflation rate stood at 2.4%. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also came in lower than expected at 0.1% and 2.8% respectively. Weakness in energy prices and declines in vehicle and apparel prices helped offset increases in other areas. While the report is reassuring, some experts caution that tariff-driven price increases may take a few more months to appear in CPI data, and Vice President JD Vance called on the Fed to cut interest rates.

          <p>Seventeen police officers were injured during a second night of unrest in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault. Protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. Five people were arrested, bringing the total number of injured officers to 32. The violence has been described by police as "racist thuggery," with some homes displaying stickers outlining the residents' nationalities after a mother said she was fleeing her home with her family after her house was damaged. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the violence, and First Minister Michelle O'Neill labeled it as "pure racism."</p>

          <p>WhatsApp is backing Apple in its legal fight against the UK Home Office regarding user data privacy. WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart stated that the case "could set a dangerous precedent" by potentially encouraging other nations to weaken encryption. Apple initiated legal action after the Home Office requested access to the data of its global customers for national security reasons. Critics argue that this request would compromise the privacy of millions of users. WhatsApp has applied to submit evidence to the court, emphasizing its commitment to challenging any law or government request that weakens encryption.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with China, following negotiations in London. While details are scarce, Trump said the "framework deal" still requires final approval from himself and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% on an annual basis in May, slightly cooler than expected, indicating that President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted consumer prices. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, increased by 2.8% over the past 12 months. The inflation rate was likely tempered by a sharp decrease in gasoline prices, which fell 12% in May compared to the previous year. Experts anticipate the Federal Reserve to maintain current interest rates until later in the year, closely monitoring when Trump's tariffs will be reflected in inflation data.

To secure a good savings account rate, it is advisable to choose a high-yield savings account, explore online banks, and compare different accounts to find the most favorable terms.

The study found that daily mango intake was associated with reduced blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Researchers compared mango consumption to white bread, noting that blood glucose levels rose less after mango intake. While researchers suggest further studies over an extended period are needed, registered dietitian nutritionist Lauri Wright supports adding colorful fruit to the diet, reinforcing the idea that plant-based foods can have heart-protective benefits.</p>

          <h2>Experts Say Trump's Show of Military Force in LA Was Years in the Making</h2>

          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's deployment of troops and marines to Los Angeles amid immigration protests is a culmination of long-term goals, including exerting authority over local governments and cracking down on dissent. The move follows Trump's regret over not taking a more heavy-handed approach to the 2020 protests over George Floydâ€™s murder. Critics, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, have warned that Trump is behaving like a "dictator." Some see the situation as a "test case" that could be replicated in other cities, while others highlight the fear and terror gripping immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Rightwing media figures are decrying protesters in Los Angeles as "invaders" and calling for the arrest of elected officials following demonstrations against immigration raids. Figures like Sean Hannity and Steve Bannon have called for the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Some commentators have also promoted racist conspiracy theories, such as the "great replacement" theory. Charlie Kirk criticized the sight of protesters flying flags other than the stars and stripes and called for U.S. troops to be used in policing US civilians.</p>

          <p>Three Democratic members of Congress are introducing the My Body, My Data Act to limit companies' ability to collect data about people's reproductive health, aiming to protect women from persecution in the post-Roe v Wade era. The bill seeks to block companies from collecting, using, retaining, or disclosing information about someoneâ€™s reproductive health unless that data is essential to providing a requested service. This includes information about pregnancy, menstruation, abortion, and contraception. Law enforcement officials have already attempted to use peopleâ€™s data trails to identify abortion seekers, prompting concerns about online surveillance.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the right of protesters to wear masks, despite President Trump's opposition. It argues that while civil disobedience involves openly breaking the law and revealing one's identity, lawful protest occurs in a different media context. The risk of personal retribution from the Trump administration makes hiding one's identity an understandable act of caution. The Supreme Court has previously defended the right to stay anonymous, declaring it a means to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation. The author concludes that the decision to reveal or conceal their identity should be up to individuals engaged in lawful protest.</p>

Bryant also addresses criticisms about singling out Target and announces a new fast from Dollar General. The pastor believes that Target and other companies underestimate the power of the Black dollar and that they've awakened a sleeping giant.</p>

          <p>Retirement experts weigh in on the safety of annuities during market crashes, noting that different types of annuities offer varying levels of protection. Fixed annuities are generally considered the safest option, providing a guaranteed interest rate and set payment. Variable annuities carry more risk due to their exposure to market fluctuations, while fixed indexed annuities offer a balance between potential returns and principal protection. Deferred income annuities can provide guaranteed income for life, regardless of market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Inflation remained relatively stable last month, with consumer prices up 2.4% from a year ago, as President Trump's tariffs have not yet fully impacted the economy. The price of eggs continued to fall, as the nation's flock of egg-laying hens slowly recovered from a widespread outbreak of avian flu. Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler warned that Trump's tariffs could reverse some of the progress that's been made on inflation over the last two years. The central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates steady again when Fed policymakers meet next week. (not investment advice)</p>
