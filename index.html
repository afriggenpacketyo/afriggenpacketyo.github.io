            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has decided to keep its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision comes amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., as the PBOC seems to be prioritizing the stabilization of the yuan. While China's first-quarter GDP grew at 5.4% year-on-year, consumer prices remain in deflationary territory, creating a complex economic landscape. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of up to 245% on Chinese imports, while China has responded with 125% duties on U.S. imports. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Texas man, Sarmad Ghaled Dafar, has been sentenced for trafficking endangered Mexican baby spider monkeys into Southern California, where he sold them on Facebook.

The crime involved separating the infants from their mothers, disrupting ecosystems, and posing public health risks. The confiscated monkeys are now housed at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, and Dafar has been ordered to pay restitution for their quarantine.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump's escalating tariffs on China may inadvertently make the Chinese economy more resilient. Instead of focusing on trade rebalancing, the U.S. appears to be aiming to stifle China's economic growth through export controls on advanced technology. To counter this, China is likely to use fiscal stimulus and address its internal economic weaknesses, particularly the fragmentation of its domestic market. By focusing on internal improvements, China could emerge as a stronger economic power despite the external pressures.</p>

The rollout of the scheme, which aims to offer 30 hours of childcare per week for eligible working parents, faces hurdles such as increasing demand and rising operating costs for private nurseries. While the government is increasing funding and encouraging schools to open nurseries, some nurseries are threatening to pull out of the scheme due to financial pressures, and many families are ineligible for the support.</p>

These include starting to save early, exploring low-deposit mortgage options, considering shared ownership, using an "income boost" mortgage, and exploring professional mortgages. Experts emphasize the importance of early saving and utilizing government bonuses like the Lifetime ISA. While small deposit mortgages are available, they often come with higher rates and stricter eligibility criteria. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>This article explores why men are less likely to seek medical attention compared to women, citing factors like societal pressure to "tough it out" and a reluctance to appear weak. The article also highlights practical barriers such as appointment systems that don't accommodate work schedules and a lack of preventative check-ups targeting younger men. Personal stories illustrate how men often delay seeking help until symptoms become unbearable, sometimes requiring intervention from loved ones. Experts suggest redesigning services to better meet men's needs, focusing on actions rather than open discussion.</p>
