        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representative Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, expressed caution regarding the recent U.S. attacks against Iran, labeling them a "massive gamble" by President Trump. Himes referenced past U.S. military interventions in the Middle East, such as Iraq and Libya, where initial successes were followed by long-term complications and significant costs. He emphasized that it is too early to assess the success of the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities and urged restraint in celebrating them, highlighting the importance of considering potential long-term consequences. Himes also voiced concerns about the strikes being undertaken without Congressional approval, asserting that Congress holds the sole authority to declare war, underscoring the constitutional implications of the military action. Optimism should be tempered until the full ramifications of the attacks are understood.</p>

          <p>A suicide bombing at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Prophet Elias in Damascus, Syria, resulted in the deaths of at least 22 people and injuries to 63 others. According to the interior ministry, the attacker, affiliated with Islamic State, opened fire during a service before detonating an explosive vest. Witnesses described a scene of devastation, with a heavily damaged altar, broken glass, and bloodied floors, marking the first such attack in Damascus since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch condemned the attack, urging Syrian authorities to protect all citizens, while the UN and US special envoys called for unity and rejection of terrorism in the wake of this violent act.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief expressed "shock and frustration" regarding a planned protest in support of Palestine Action, an organization that recently broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed military planes with red paint. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley emphasized the importance of the right to protest but condemned actions supporting what he described as an "organized extremist criminal group." While the Met lacks the legal authority to prevent the protest before the group is proscribed, they intend to impose conditions to prevent disorder, damage, and serious disruption, with breaches of the law being dealt with robustly. The protest is supported by 35 groups, raising concerns about potential escalation and the need for careful management by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial trade route for crude oil. Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the strait for its oil imports and suggested that its closure would be "economic suicide" for Iran. Iranian state media reported that Iran's parliament backed closing the Strait of Hormuz, while Iran's foreign minister warned that the Islamic Republic "reserves all options to defend its sovereignty" after the U.S. bombed three key nuclear sites over the weekend. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is stationed in Bahrain and tasked with protecting maritime trade in the Persian Gulf, with the U.S. retaining options to deal with Iran trying to close the strait.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns are rising about potential escalation scenarios, including Iran rebuilding its nuclear program or retaliating against U.S. forces or international shipping lanes. While the Trump administration claims the attacks "obliterated" Iran's nuclear capabilities, the actual damage remains uncertain, creating pathways to escalation. The possibility of a full-scale war of regime change, though seemingly distant, cannot be entirely ruled out, particularly if Iran's nuclear program remains intact. The risk of a US-Iran cycle of violence and the potential for broader regional instability, akin to the 2003 Iraq war, highlight the complex and unpredictable nature of the situation.</p>

          <p>The National Terrorism Advisory System has issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following the U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. While there are no current specific threats, the bulletin cautions about potential low-level cyber attacks and possible attacks against U.S. networks by actors affiliated with the Iranian government. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could increase the threat of cyberattacks, acts of violence, and antisemitic hate crimes. The bulletin also warns that violent extremists in the U.S. could independently mobilize in response to the conflict, prompting increased security measures and vigilance.</p>

Democrats are pushing for a vote to restrict Trump's actions under the War Powers Act, highlighting concerns about another full-scale U.S. war in the Middle East.

          <p>Details are emerging about the U.S. air strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, with President Trump claiming the facilities have been "obliterated." The Pentagon reports that all sites sustained "extremely severe damage," while Iran denies suffering a major blow. Operation Midnight Hammer involved 125 U.S. military aircraft, including seven B-2 stealth bombers, with the strikes targeting Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The U.S. deployed deception tactics, including decoys, and used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) to penetrate the deeply buried Fordo nuclear site. The Iranian Atomic Energy Organization condemned the bombing as a "barbaric violation" of international law, and Saudi Arabia and the IAEA say there has been no increase in radiation levels.</p>

          <p>The Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil trade route, has come into renewed focus amid tensions with Iran, particularly after the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The waterway, located between Oman and Iran, connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) describes it as the "world's most important oil transit chokepoint," with Iran reportedly considering blocking it. While experts believe Iran is unlikely to close the strait, disruptions could severely impact global energy markets and economies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending its recent precision strike on Iranian nuclear sites, conducted without Congressional approval or prior notification to top Democratic lawmakers. Administration officials assert that the attack was a limited engagement aimed at disrupting Iranian nuclear capabilities, not indicative of broader plans for involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict. However, some lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, argue that the strikes were unauthorized and that Congress should have been consulted. The debate highlights ongoing tensions between the executive and legislative branches regarding war powers and the legality of military actions.</p>

The operation, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, involved B-2 stealth bombers and cruise missiles, with U.S. officials claiming it dealt a knockout blow to Iran's nuclear program. The mission employed deceptive tactics and decoys to maintain secrecy, with Iran reportedly failing to detect the inbound attack.
