          <p>Minnesota Republican lawmakers plan to introduce a bill that would add "Trump derangement syndrome" to the state's definition of mental illness.  The proposed definition describes the syndrome as an acute onset of paranoia in response to President Trump's policies and presidency. Due to the state legislature's composition, the bill's passage is considered unlikely.</p>
