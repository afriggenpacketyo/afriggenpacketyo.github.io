            <p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff and top diplomat Marco Rubio will meet with European counterparts, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, in Paris to discuss strategies for ending the war in Ukraine. These talks represent the highest level of transatlantic engagement on the conflict since February, marking a significant effort by the US to consult with its European allies. The meetings will include discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron and his team. This engagement is noteworthy, given past instances where the US government has been perceived as not prioritizing consultation with European allies on this critical issue.</p>

This shift comes after China declared that further U.S. tariff hikes would be "meaningless" and that Beijing would "ignore" them. China has implemented non-tariff measures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals and antitrust probes into American companies. The move reflects a growing hostility and a potential decoupling of the two economies. (not investment advice)</p>
