          <h2>Study Suggests Dark Energy is Weakening, Potentially Leading to Universe Collapse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-20 13:39:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) suggests that dark energy, the force driving the universe's expansion, is weakening.  This could eventually lead to the universe collapsing in a "big crunch", though this event is not expected for billions of years.  The findings challenge existing cosmological models and necessitate a re-evaluation of our understanding of the universe.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and fellow Democrats sent a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon expressing concern over the firings of Department of Education employees crucial to the federal student loan process.

          <p>Former Rep. Dean Phillips criticized fellow Democrats for their harsh rhetoric against Elon Musk, arguing that such attacks alienate centrist voters.  He specifically referenced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's use of the term "South African nepo baby" to describe Musk, suggesting it's a counterproductive strategy.
