          <p>Mortgage application volume in the United States saw minimal growth last week, stalling after a significant surge in refinancing the week prior. Despite the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage falling to its lowest level since September 2024, total demand only increased by 0.6%. Refinance applications, which had previously spiked, rose by just 1%, while purchase applications remained flat. Economists note that while interest rates are in a range that should encourage refinancing, market volatility following the Federal Reserve's recent meeting has tempered activity.

          <p>American comedian Tim Dillon has stated he was fired from the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia due to jokes he made about the kingdom's alleged use of forced labor. Dillon, who was scheduled to perform alongside other major comedians, discussed his removal on his podcast, explaining that organizers disliked his comedic references to slavery. The incident highlights ongoing criticism from human rights organizations, who argue that Saudi Arabia uses major cultural events to distract from its human rights record. The festival is part of a broader Saudi initiative to host large-scale entertainment events.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa has passed through China's southern Guangdong province without causing the catastrophic damage initially feared. While cities like Shenzhen experienced powerful winds exceeding 200km/h, the storm weakened as it moved west, and no injuries were reported in the major tech hub. This outcome contrasts sharply with 2018's Super Typhoon Mangkhut, which caused significant economic damage and fatalities. By Wednesday evening, major cities in the region had begun lifting restrictions and downgrading storm alerts as meteorological authorities confirmed the typhoon was losing strength.</p>

          <p>An independent report has revealed that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) engaged in unlawful surveillance practices, including using journalists' phone data to identify internal leaks. The review, conducted by lawyer Angus McCullough KC, found 21 instances of unlawful attempts to uncover reporters' sources, double the number previously admitted. It also detailed a practice of cross-referencing thousands of calls against journalists' numbers provided to the PSNI press office, a tactic deemed not necessary or proportionate. The PSNI's Chief Constable acknowledged the findings and stated the service will improve its processes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is striving to become a global leader in autonomous driving technology but faces substantial challenges that are slowing its progress. Despite authorizing Level 4 autonomy and hosting various pilot projects, the nation's high car ownership, strong taxi lobby, and well-developed public transit network create a difficult market for new mobility services. German manufacturers are also notably cautious, hesitant to release systems that are not fully mature, which contrasts with faster deployments seen in the U.S. and China.

          <p>Nearly 100 active and former doctors from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have issued a collective letter expressing urgent concerns about Trump administration policies. They warn that significant staffing cuts and a rapid increase in outsourcing care to the private sector are threatening the integrity of the nation's largest integrated healthcare system. The physicians argue these changes could lead to facility closures and force veterans into private systems ill-equipped to handle their specialized needs. This letter marks the first time VA physicians have spoken out collectively, citing a duty to protect the high-quality, specialized care the VA provides.</p>

          <p>Gia Giudice, of "The Real Housewives of New Jersey" fame, has publicly appealed to President Trump for assistance regarding her father Joe Giudice's deportation. Inspired by the recent presidential pardon of Todd and Julie Chrisley, Giudice created a video expressing her family's hope for her father to be allowed to return to the U.S. from the Bahamas. Joe Giudice was deported to Italy in 2019 after serving a 41-month prison sentence for fraud charges; he was not a U.S. citizen despite living in the country since infancy. Her mother, Teresa Giudice, supports the effort, stating her ex-husband belongs in America.</p>

          <p>In his book "Psychobabble," licensed psychotherapist Joe Nucci addresses and debunks numerous mental health myths that have gained traction on social media. Nucci argues that the oversimplification of complex psychological concepts like 'love bombing,' 'narcissism,' and 'people pleasing' can be harmful when applied without nuance. He cautions against using diagnoses as personality labels, which can become self-fulfilling prophecies, and emphasizes that while systemic issues impact mental health, individuals still retain personal agency. The book aims to correct popular therapy-speak and promote a more accurate understanding of mental wellness.</p>

          <p>Oregon police have recovered partial remains in the state's oldest unidentified person case, belonging to a woman known as "Oak Grove Jane Doe" who was killed nearly 80 years ago.

Investigators recently located the likely interment site at a cemetery in Oregon City and exhumed the degraded remains.

The bill also includes a controversial provision that could restart executions in the state for the first time since 2006 by allowing alternative methods if lethal injection is unavailable.

          <p>A new gene therapy treatment for Huntington's disease has shown unprecedented success, with researchers reporting it slowed the disease's clinical progression by 75% in trial patients. The single-dose treatment, administered via complex brain surgery, works by reducing levels of the toxic protein that causes the neurodegenerative disorder. This breakthrough offers significant hope for patients and their families, potentially giving them decades of improved quality of life and even raising the possibility of preventing symptoms from ever emerging if administered early. The results have been described as "spectacular" by the research team.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Secretary has launched an urgent review into the cost of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments, following a BBC investigation. The report found that some individuals were being taken on long-distance journeys costing taxpayers hundreds of pounds, such as a 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment reportedly costing £600. The investigation highlighted systemic issues where taxis are automatically booked for necessary travel without public transport being presented as an option. The practice has drawn criticism from politicians who argue the money could be better spent on public services.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup at Bethpage is set to be a highly charged event, with the home crowd's typically boisterous support expected to be amplified by the planned attendance of President Donald Trump. The home team already benefits from course setups tailored to their strengths, but the partisan atmosphere, which some players feel is integral to the event, will be a major factor. Trump's visit is causing logistical concerns and raising questions about the political tone of the tournament, with memories of the controversial 1999 Ryder Cup at Brookline looming. The European team is even using VR technology to prepare for the anticipated heckling.</p>

          <p>A recent announcement from the Trump administration suggesting a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism has provoked a furious backlash from medical professionals and the public. Scientists have condemned the claim as lacking a solid scientific foundation, calling the association spurious. Pregnant individuals expressed frustration, noting their already limited options for pain management, while others view the announcement as a bad-faith political distraction. Many respondents also criticized the negative framing of autism, arguing that such rhetoric is harmful to the neurodiverse community and echoes eugenicist thinking.</p>

          <p>An article written in partnership with the Prison Journalism Project details the profound challenges incarcerated women face managing their periods. With limited and inadequate sanitary supplies, a strict cap on the number of undergarments they can own, and poor laundry facilities, women often experience public humiliation and shame. The piece highlights how the lack of privacy, empathy from predominantly male guards, and insufficient resources turn a natural biological function into a constant struggle for dignity. A proposed simple solution, changing the color of state-issued underwear from white to a darker color, could offer a small but meaningful improvement.</p>

          <p>The city of Portland, Oregon, is in a standoff with the Trump administration over claims that a local Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility is violating its permits. An investigation found that ICE has been holding detainees overnight and for longer than 12 hours, which is explicitly forbidden by the conditional use permit issued in 2011. The city has issued a notice of violation to the building's owner, marking the first step in a process that could hold the federal agency accountable. This conflict arises amidst ongoing protests at the facility and broader tensions between the sanctuary city and the federal government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American workers are increasingly staying in their current jobs, a trend dubbed "job hugging," which experts say is driven by economic anxiety and fear of the unknown. The national quits rate has fallen to a level not seen since 2016, and hiring has slowed to its lowest pace in a decade. While low turnover may seem positive for employers, it can mask rising employee disengagement and underutilization of skills, costing companies in lost productivity. This lack of labor market mobility also poses risks for the broader economy by potentially flattening wage growth and creating stagnation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic explores the political alignment between modern conservatism and the anti-vaccine movement, attributing it to a misplaced nostalgia for a pre-vaccine past. The article argues that figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promote a fantasy of a healthier, more natural past while ignoring the severe dangers of infectious diseases that were once commonplace. This romanticization of a time before modern medicine overlooks grim realities like high infant mortality and deadly outbreaks of measles and polio. The author contends that relinquishing the hard-won successes of vaccination threatens a return to battles that society has already fought and won.</p>

          <p>An analytical article from Vox explores how the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being framed to create the first "martyr" for the MAGA movement. The piece draws parallels not to modern political events, but to the ancient Christian cult of martyrs, which transformed a small sect into a global religion. By venerating Kirk, the movement may be evolving from a personality cult around Donald Trump into a broader faith with a more enduring foundation. The analysis notes how Kirk's specific religious background is being generalized into a generic "Christian" identity to serve the political goals of a nationalist movement.</p>

Goodell stated that the rapidly changing media landscape necessitates flexibility.

Trump attributed his changed view to a new understanding of the economic pressure on Russia, which he called a "paper tiger."
