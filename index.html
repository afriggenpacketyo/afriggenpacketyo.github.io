        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After weeks of rising tensions, India and Pakistan have escalated their military conflict, employing drone warfare in a significant escalation. Pakistan accused India of launching air-to-surface missiles targeting air bases, including one near Islamabad, prompting a strong response. India claims Pakistan attempted aerial intrusions with hundreds of drones to test their air defenses, while Pakistan asserts it shot down numerous Indian drones, accusing India of "drone terrorism." The conflict, sparked by a militant attack in Kashmir, involves intensifying exchanges of gunfire, drone attacks, and misinformation, with diplomatic efforts failing to de-escalate the situation. Civilians are caught in the crossfire, expressing exhaustion and fear as the conflict's unpredictable nature raises concerns about further escalation.</p>

Baraka, along with members of Congress, argued that the facility, which quietly began housing migrants this month, is dangerous and illegal, citing concerns about proper permits and inspections. DHS alleges that members of Congress "stormed the gate" at the ICE facility, which detains "murderers, sexual assaulters, suspected terrorists, and gang members."

          <p>The Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a move that would curtail the constitutional right to challenge detention in court. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller justified the potential suspension by arguing that undocumented migrants are "invading" the United States. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and a president cannot do so unilaterally. The administration's decision depends on whether the courts block the deportation of immigrants, raising concerns about the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are promoting their vision of a multipolar global order, challenging what they see as American hegemony. The two leaders pledged to extend cooperation and counter Washington’s attempt at “dual containment” of their countries. Despite Trump's efforts, neither Beijing nor Moscow has shown signs of backing down on core issues. Trump’s policies have raised concerns about the US-led post-war order.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates due to an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff spotted a suspicious invitation to a meeting and realized it was a "spear-phishing" attempt. As a precaution, students' passwords have been reset, meaning they do not currently have access to school learning resources. The council is prioritizing support for students preparing for exams and has assured that no data has been compromised.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have declared an outbreak of hepatitis A, a highly contagious liver infection.

The virus is spread through the oral-fecal route, and while typically identified in high-risk groups, many recent cases have occurred in people without those risk factors. Public health officials are investigating the potential for food contamination and community circulation of the virus.</p>
