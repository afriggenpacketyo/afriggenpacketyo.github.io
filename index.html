          <p>Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter, nominated by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, has died at the age of 85. Chief Justice John G.

          <p>Chinese citizens are celebrating the reported combat success of the J-10C fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict, with Pakistan claiming to have shot down Indian Rafale jets using the Chinese-made aircraft. However, the Chinese government and official media have remained largely quiet on the matter. A foreign ministry spokesman stated he was ‚Äúnot familiar‚Äù with the reports, urging both sides to exercise restraint. Analysts suggest Beijing's restraint is due to diplomatic considerations regarding the conflict between its neighbor India and its ally Pakistan, as well as military prudence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China to 80% ahead of key trade talks, though this level remains higher than desired by investors. He stated, "80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B," referring to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who will participate in the meetings. While an 80% tariff would be a significant decrease from the current 145%, it is still considered prohibitive.

          <p>President Trump is considering reducing tariffs on China from 145% to 80% before a weekend meeting with Chinese officials, signaling a potential de-escalation of the trade war. Top US officials are expected to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation in Switzerland for the first significant talks since Trump imposed tariffs. Chinese trade with the US slumped in April, even as total exports beat forecasts, amid concerns about the impact of tariffs on prices and supply of consumer goods. The announcement comes after Britain became the first to announce a deal with the US that reduces tariffs.</p>

The spacecraft, designed to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus, may survive its Earth reentry due to its resilient construction. Weighing 495 kilograms and measuring 1.17 meters in diameter, Cosmos 482 is larger than most space debris. Although its reentry is uncontrolled, its smooth shape may allow for reasonably accurate calculations of its descent. The risk of injury from space debris is considered low.</p>
