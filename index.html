          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist recently released from ICE detention after over three months, reiterated his commitment to advocating for Palestinian rights in an interview. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, was detained in March, with the Trump administration citing national security concerns. Judge Farbiarz issued an injunction against the detention, leading to Khalil's release after the government alleged misrepresentation on his green card application, which Khalil denies. Khalil asserts that his activism, which goes against the administration's agenda, is the reason for his detention and vows to continue advocating for Palestinians despite potential future detentions.</p>

          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to oil and gas supplies, leading to volatility in energy prices. While initial price surges have subsided amid speculation that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, ongoing tensions could still squeeze global oil supplies. Experts suggest that Israeli airstrikes on Iranian oil facilities or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on Iraqi facilities pose a greater risk to the region's oil supply. A closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though considered unlikely, could send prices soaring and significantly impact economies dependent on Middle Eastern oil (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery has emerged showing the damage inflicted on Iranian nuclear facilities following the U.S. military operation known as Midnight Hammer. President Trump initially claimed that the targeted sites, including Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz, were "completely and totally obliterated," while other officials have provided more cautious assessments. Experts analyzing the images point to significant damage, including large craters and blue ash at Fordo, extensive destruction of buildings at Isfahan, and a large hole over an underground complex at Natanz. The full extent of the damage remains uncertain, pending further investigation and access for international inspectors.</p>

          <p>Syrian authorities have announced the capture of individuals linked to a suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church near Damascus, which resulted in numerous fatalities. According to Interior Minister Anas Khattab, the operation targeted locations associated with the terrorist organization Islamic State, resulting in the confiscation of explosive devices and a booby-trapped motorcycle. President Ahmed al-Sharaa vowed to bring all those involved in the "heinous crime" to justice, emphasizing the importance of national unity against threats to Syria's security and stability. The attack, which occurred amid heightened political unrest in the Middle East, involved a perpetrator opening fire on worshipers before detonating an explosive device.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the ability to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own without advance notice. This decision lifts an injunction previously issued by a federal District Court judge, allowing the deportations to proceed while the case is appealed. Justice Sotomayor, dissenting along with Justices Kagan and Jackson, criticized the decision as an abuse of the Court's discretion, highlighting instances where the government wrongfully deported individuals despite concerns about their safety in the destination countries. The Supreme Court's order marks a significant win for the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Analysts in Taiwan are raising concerns about the potential impact of increased U.S. military engagement in the Middle East on the island's security. The analysts suggest that the U.S.'s involvement in conflicts like the one between Israel and Iran, combined with its support for Ukraine, could strain its military resources and political attention. This could potentially reduce the U.S.'s ability to respond swiftly and effectively to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait, should China decide to take action against Taiwan. While Taiwan remains a core U.S. interest, the question is whether America can realistically spare resources for Taiwan if managing multiple major conflicts.</p>

          <p>Conflicting statements from officials and experts have surfaced regarding the extent of damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear facilities during a recent U.S. attack. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth initially claimed the Iranian nuclear ambitions had been "obliterated," while President Trump echoed that "monumental damage" had been done. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine cautioned that it will "take some time" to assess the damage, while an Israeli official noted a lack of understanding of the damage's extent. Ballistic experts have expressed skepticism, suggesting the bombs may not have penetrated deep enough to cause significant damage to the underground facilities.</p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, "Elio," experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, grossing $21 million in the U.S. and Canada. This disappointing performance highlights the challenges that original animated films face in attracting audiences in the post-pandemic era, especially when competing with established franchises and live-action remakes. While "Elio" received positive reviews, analysts suggest that marketing and timing may have contributed to its soft opening, as families have limited summer weekends to choose from and may be more familiar with existing intellectual properties. Despite the setback, Disney remains committed to producing original animated content alongside sequels and franchise extensions.</p>

          <p>Despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil, a top U.S. analyst believes that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it. Richard Fontaine, chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, suggests that China's approach would prioritize quiet negotiations and its own self-interest over direct military intervention. He points to China's past agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of its focus on protecting its own interests rather than policing global waterways. This suggests that economic interests would shape China's approach.</p>

          <p>Following Iran's missile attack on a U.S. base in Qatar, which resulted in no casualties, President Trump suggested that Iran may be willing to negotiate in earnest. If no further Iranian attacks occur, Trump seems inclined to hold his fire, potentially leading to a scenario where his high-risk strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities pay off. This situation echoes a similar dynamic in 2020 when the U.S. chose not to escalate after Iran launched missiles at military bases in Iraq. The initial reports indicate that all the Iranian missiles directed at the U.S. base in Qatar were intercepted.</p>

There were no reports of casualties at the base, according to a U.S. official. Iran's attack was in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs over Iran. President Trump stated that "Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran," though Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said a full battle damage assessment is still pending.</p>

          <p>Oil futures experienced a significant drop after President Trump asserted that the U.S. received advance warning of Iran's retaliatory missile strikes against a U.S. base in Qatar. This statement reinforced optimism that neither country intends to further escalate the conflict in the Middle East. Trump's remarks, posted on social media, described Iran's strikes as a way to get "it all out of their 'system.'" The decline in oil prices reflects a shift in market sentiment from concerns about potential supply disruptions to expectations of de-escalation (not investment advice).</p>

This decision effectively suspends a nationwide injunction that required "meaningful notice and opportunity to be heard" before deporting individuals to countries other than their place of birth or citizenship. Justice Sotomayor, dissenting, accused her colleagues of condoning "lawless" behavior by the administration in "matters of life and death."

The order focused on a flight carrying several men from various countries which was initially headed to South Sudan but ended up in the East African country of Djibouti in order to give the men time to dispute their final destination. The U.S. government says the men are violent criminals, convicted of crimes including murder, sexual assault, kidnapping and robbery, and said they don't deserve to stay in the U.S.</p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is ceasing service at Miami International Airport, with the last flight scheduled for September 3. The decision is part of a broader effort to cut costs by eliminating less profitable routes, as outlined by JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty. While JetBlue will no longer operate out of Miami International, it will continue to serve South Florida through nearby Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport. JetBlue customers with flights booked to or from Miami after September 3 will be offered alternative travel options or a full refund.</p>
