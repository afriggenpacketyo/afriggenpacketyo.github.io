          <p>A 39-year-old woman has been arrested after a stabbing attack at a train station in Hamburg, Germany, left at least 12 people injured, three critically. Police are investigating the suspect's background, focusing on the possibility of mental distress, as there is currently no evidence of political motivation. The incident occurred at Hamburg's main train station, prompting a police response to secure the area and investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack.

          <p>In a guest essay for *The New York Times*, Harvard professor Steven Pinker critiques the "unhinged invective" aimed at Harvard University, which he calls "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." Pinker, who has been critical of Harvard in the past, argues that the attacks, including those from President Trump, are disproportionate and harmful. He acknowledges Harvard's issues, such as the erosion of academic freedom and lack of viewpoint diversity, but contends that the university is not the "woke madrasa" its critics claim. Pinker advocates for a balanced approach to addressing Harvard's ailments, urging reform rather than outright destruction, and emphasizes the university's contributions to knowledge and innovation.</p>

          <p>Boeing has reached a new agreement with the Justice Department that would allow the company to avoid criminal prosecution for the two deadly 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. Under the deal, Boeing would admit to obstructing federal oversight, pay a fine, contribute to a compensation fund for the families, and invest in safety programs. This agreement reverses a previous deal where Boeing would plead guilty to conspiring to defraud the FAA. The Justice Department argues that this resolution is the most just outcome, providing financial accountability and compensation while improving air travel safety, though some victims' families object to the non-prosecution deal.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has announced the cancellation of his upcoming concerts due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), a brain disorder affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. A statement posted to Joel's social media accounts said his condition had been "exacerbated by recent concert performances," and he has been advised to refrain from performing during his recovery. N.P.H. occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causing difficulty walking, trouble controlling one’s bladder, and memory problems. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt that bypasses the blocked channel and lets fluid drain.</p>

          <p>Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security announced it would block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accused the administration of "clear retaliation" for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights. A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order, agreeing that the implementation would cause "immediate and irreparable injury" to the university. The move followed demands that Harvard provide records of protest activity and disciplinary actions involving international students, which Harvard said it had complied with.</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn That Trump's Proposed Tariffs Could Backfire</h2>

          <p>Trade and logistics experts are cautioning that President Trump's threats to impose tariffs on Apple and the European Union could have negative consequences for the U.S. economy. While Trump believes the EU has been uncooperative in trade negotiations, experts warn that tariffs could damage a key trade relationship that has shown signs of recovery. Increased tariffs on European imports could make American products more expensive to produce, and U.S. exporters could suffer due to reduced trade. The experts say a 50% tariff on European imports could cause economic harm and potentially lead to retaliation from the EU.</p>
