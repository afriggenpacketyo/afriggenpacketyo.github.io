        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has finalized new economic sanctions targeting Russia's banking and energy sectors to pressure Moscow into accepting President Trump's proposals for ending the war in Ukraine, according to multiple sources. The sanctions could affect major entities like Gazprom, but approval from President Trump remains uncertain due to his past sympathies toward Russia. Kurt Volker, former U.S. envoy to NATO, suggests these sanctions signal increased pressure on Russia as Putin continues to reject ceasefire calls. The article highlights Trump's conflicting actions, including considering large-scale banking sanctions, while his envoy has met with Putin multiple times to advocate ceding Ukrainian territory.

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, claiming the institution deserves it, although it is unclear if the IRS is moving forward with this action. Harvard has responded that there is no legal basis for such a move and that it would severely impact the university's ability to carry out its educational mission, including financial aid and research. The New York Times article notes that federal law prohibits the president from directly influencing IRS tax investigations. This action is part of a broader pressure campaign against elite universities, which the administration accuses of antisemitism and discrimination.</p>

          <p>Germany's Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party has been officially classified as a right-wing extremist organization by the country's intelligence agency, citing its ethnicity-based understanding of the people as incompatible with democratic order. The decision follows AfD's strong showing in recent federal elections, where it secured a record number of seats. This article notes that US officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have criticized the move as tyranny in disguise, prompting a defense from the German Foreign Office, which asserted it was protecting democracy.

          <p>Former White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was observed using a modified version of the Signal encrypted messaging app during a Cabinet meeting, raising questions about data privacy and security protocols. The article reports that the app appeared to be a "fork" of Signal by TeleMessage, which adds archiving capabilities, potentially undermining Signal's end-to-end encryption. Despite the White House's claim that Signal is an approved app, the use of a modified version raises concerns about adherence to records retention laws and the security of communications.
