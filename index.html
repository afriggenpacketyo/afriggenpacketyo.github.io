          <p>Japanese boxing sensation Naoya Inoue is confident in extending his knockout streak as he prepares to defend his super bantamweight title against Ramon Cardenas in Las Vegas on May 4th. Inoue, known as "Monster," acknowledges Cardenas as a well-rounded boxer but aims for a dynamic performance, matching those of heavyweight boxers. He is motivated by fighting in Las Vegas and wants to box as usual, and is excited to relax and explore the city, contrasting with his previous pandemic-impacted trips. The main-event bout will be Inoue's fourth fight in the United States, where lighter divisions seldom have top billing.</p>

          <p>Two US marines stationed in Okinawa, Japan, are under investigation for separate incidents of alleged sexual assault against Japanese women at military bases. The incidents have sparked outrage in Okinawa, which hosts a significant portion of US troops in Japan, and prompted condemnation from the Okinawa governor. The US ambassador to Japan expressed deep concern and pledged to prevent actions that jeopardize the trust between the two countries. These alleged crimes are likely to intensify anti-base sentiment on the island, where there has been a history of high-profile crimes involving US service members.</p>

          <p>British fintech company Revolut has announced its first $1 billion annual profit, marking a significant achievement as it prepares to launch its UK bank later this year. The company's net profit for 2024 reached £1.1 billion, a 149% increase year-over-year, with revenues rising 72% to £3.1 billion. Revolut's success is driven by growth in its wealth unit, subscriptions, and loan book, and the company aims to launch its UK bank later this year, offering services like loans and mortgages after regulatory approval. This transition to a fully operational bank in the UK is a crucial step in Revolut's global expansion and potential IPO.</p>

          <p>Ofcom has finalized regulations requiring tech companies to protect children from harmful online content, setting a deadline of July 25 for compliance. The rules, known as the Children's Codes, mandate age verification checks and algorithm adjustments to filter out content promoting self-harm, suicide, or eating disorders. Platforms must also implement streamlined reporting systems and appoint a designated person accountable for children's safety. While some critics argue the restrictions don't go far enough, Ofcom asserts these measures are a "gamechanger" and failure to comply could result in fines or site blocking in the UK.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges, continuing a trend of criminal investigations against former leaders in the country. The charges relate to the employment of his former son-in-law at a now-defunct budget airline in Thailand, where he allegedly received undue salary and housing allowances. Prosecutors claim the money was a bribe paid to Moon by the airline's owner, Lee Sang-jik, as a favor to the former president's family. Moon, who left office in 2022, faces a criminal trial amidst a history of scandal-ridden political careers of South Korean presidents.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has refuted claims of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States, dismissing them as having "no factual basis."

This denial comes after US President Donald Trump suggested a willingness to reconsider tariffs and claimed that Beijing had contacted Washington to discuss the matter. China insists that the US should heed rational voices and completely abolish tariffs before any meaningful progress can be made.</p>

          <p>Japan will implement a revised road traffic law starting April 2026, imposing fines for minor traffic violations by cyclists aged 16 and older. These violations include using a mobile phone while riding, ignoring traffic lights, and riding with a pillion, with fines ranging from 3,000 to 12,000 yen. The aim is to reduce accidents involving cyclists, especially as bicycle commuting has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company's overall weakness was driven by a significant decline in sales in Asia, North America, and Europe, and Kering anticipates further macroeconomic headwinds for the luxury sector.

While the government claims such videos are illegal under the Online Safety Act, Fergus believes existing laws are insufficient to force platforms to remove harmful content and prevent AI misuse. Several platforms have removed videos after being alerted, and Fergus met with the Justice Secretary to discuss the issue.</p>

          <h2>Russia Claims Right to Use Nuclear Weapons if Attacked by West</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top Russian official, Sergei Shoigu, stated that Moscow reserves the right to use nuclear weapons if facing aggression by Western countries. This statement follows warnings from U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance that Washington could withdraw from peace settlement negotiations in Ukraine if there is no progress soon. Shoigu cited amendments to Moscow's nuclear doctrine, which allows for a nuclear strike in response to a conventional attack on Russia or its ally Belarus that threatens their sovereignty or territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>Boeing is grappling with a $1 billion problem as it needs to find new buyers for 50 planes originally destined for Chinese airlines due to ongoing trade war challenges. Chinese customers are refusing deliveries because of tariffs, prompting Boeing to redirect its planes to markets with more stable demand. Despite this setback, Boeing reported positive first-quarter revenue and narrowed losses, and is actively engaging with the Trump administration to address concerns about the impact of tariffs on the aircraft industry. The company estimates that higher tariffs could cost it $500 million annually.</p>

          <p>The US-China trade war has brought China's tilapia industry, centered in Maoming, to a near standstill, with tariffs of 170% pricing Chinese exports out of the US market. The industry, which involves thousands of people and a vast area dedicated to farming tilapia, faces potential bankruptcy as markets struggle to replace US demand. With local consumers cautious and spending slow, fish farmers and buyers are contemplating abandoning the industry. The trade war has led to a 7% drop in tilapia prices, leaving farmers with no way forward or back.</p>

          <p>SK Hynix, a major supplier to Nvidia, reported strong quarterly revenue and operating profit driven by demand for its high bandwidth memory offerings used in AI chipsets. While revenue rose 42% year-on-year, the company cautioned that macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policy, could create demand volatility in the second half of the year. SK Hynix expects a relatively limited impact from tariffs on its AI server demand, and it anticipates that demand from consumer electronics will benefit from the launch of new products with AI functionalities. The company credited its first-quarter profits to AI's impact in the memory market.</p>

          <p>China is attempting to reshape the global scientific publishing landscape by showcasing its growing scientific soft power through recent changes to its journal ranking system. The National Science Library under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) released an updated Journal Ranking Table in March, covering around 22,000 journals across 21 major disciplines. Some established international top-tier journals were downgraded, while domestic Chinese journals displayed improvements, raising concerns about the ranking system's objectivity and potential bias towards promoting Chinese scientific publications.</p>

The baby was returned to Lucy's womb and later born healthy at the end of January.

Experts have raised concerns that such restrictions could breach offenders' human rights, but victims argue that their safety and well-being should be prioritized.
