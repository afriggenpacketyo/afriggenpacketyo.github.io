        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine's security agency, the SBU, announced it had tracked down and killed two Russian agents responsible for the daylight assassination of an SBU colonel in Kyiv. The suspects were reportedly killed after resisting arrest. The assassinated colonel, Ivan Voronych, was allegedly involved in covert operations within Russia-occupied territories and played a role in a surprising Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk region. This event is part of a larger pattern of targeted killings claimed by both Kyiv and Moscow since the full-scale invasion began, highlighting the intense and personal nature of the intelligence war running parallel to conventional combat.</p>

          <p>In a compelling men's final, world number one Jannik Sinner triumphed over two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to win his first Wimbledon title. The Italian player secured the victory in four sets, avenging a recent, grueling five-set loss to Alcaraz at the French Open. The match showcased the exceptional talent and athleticism of the two young stars who are increasingly dominating men's tennis. Sinner's composed and clinical performance on Centre Court ended Alcaraz's 24-match winning streak, solidifying his position at the top of the sport and earning him his first major title on a grass court.</p>

          <p>A small aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff at London Southend Airport, resulting in a large fire and the cancellation of multiple flights. Eyewitnesses, including a family who had just waved to the pilots, described the plane banking unusually before inverting and hitting the ground, causing a "huge fireball." Emergency services, including police and fire crews, responded to the scene and advised the public to avoid the area. The airport confirmed a "serious incident" and is working with authorities, though official details on casualties have not yet been released.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, the former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died at age 82 in a London hospital after an undisclosed illness. A complex and polarizing figure, Buhari's legacy includes a repressive anti-corruption campaign in the 1980s and a later return to power as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His presidency was marked by initial high hopes but ultimately faced significant challenges, including widespread insecurity, economic decline, and concerns over his health. Despite a fraught tenure, he maintained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north, for his perceived personal austerity.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal, is advancing a sanctions bill described as a "sledgehammer" to pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine. The legislation would grant the president authority to impose tariffs of up to 500% on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's war economy by purchasing its goods. This move signals a potential turning point in U.S. policy, as it follows months of President Trump attempting to bring Putin to the negotiating table. The senators, who recently met with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, believe this powerful economic leverage is essential for diplomacy to succeed.</p>

          <p>A new Senate committee report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign before the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report, marking the one-year anniversary of the event, details requests for assets like counter-assault teams and counter-snipers that were not provided. It also accuses then-Director Kimberly Cheatle of falsely testifying to Congress that no asset requests were denied for the Butler rally. The findings point to a pattern of communication failures, negligence, and a lack of a formal process for resource requests within the agency.</p>

The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is advocating for a significant, bipartisan investment to upgrade forecasting infrastructure, including Doppler radar and ocean buoys. Cantwell argues that better science and data analysis could provide more advance warning for extreme weather events, similar to recent tornado alerts in the Midwest that gave residents two hours to prepare. She warned against proposed budget cuts to NOAA, stating that the cost of prevention is minuscule compared to disaster recovery.</p>

This escalation in pressure comes as the administration criticizes Powell for alleged mismanagement, focusing on a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. The comments suggest the White House may be building a case for Powell's removal before his term expires, a move that would challenge the central bank's traditional independence.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week, following reports that the U.S. plans to sell weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military support for Kyiv by moving equipment from closer European countries. The meeting comes as the administration faces bipartisan pressure to enact tougher sanctions on Russia and its economic partners. Multiple sources also indicate the president is considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time since taking office, signaling a potential shift in his approach to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed ten people, including six children, who were waiting to fill water containers, according to local emergency officials. The Israeli military acknowledged the incident, stating that a "technical error" caused a munition targeting an Islamic Jihad militant to miss its mark and hit the civilians. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the event is under review and expressed regret for any harm to uninvolved individuals. This strike is part of an escalation of Israeli attacks across Gaza, and it has drawn further attention from humanitarian groups concerned about the high rate of civilian casualties.</p>

          <p>For travelers willing to brave the summer heat, luxury hotels in Palm Springs are offering nightly rates at year-round lows. As tourist crowds thin out, high-end properties like the Parker Palm Springs and the Thompson have dropped their prices significantly, with some rates falling from nearly $1,000 to under $350. In addition to lower base prices, many hotels are providing extra incentives such as resort credits, multi-night stay deals, and discounts for residents of nearby states. This seasonal pricing makes a typically expensive desert getaway more accessible for those looking to enjoy pools and air-conditioned amenities during the off-season.</p>

          <p>The search for more than 160 people still missing after the catastrophic July 4 floods in Kerr County, Texas, was suspended Sunday due to a new flood threat. Emergency crews and volunteer search parties were ordered to evacuate the Guadalupe River corridor as the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the area. The region, particularly the town of Hunt where a summer camp was devastated, was hit with heavy thunderstorms, raising fears of another dangerous inundation. The halt in operations complicates the massive recovery effort in a disaster that has already claimed at least 129 lives statewide.</p>

          <p>A top White House economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, has stated that President Trump's threatened tariffs on Mexico and the European Union "are real" and will be implemented if ongoing negotiations do not produce better deals. The statement comes after Trump announced a potential 30% tariff rate on goods from both trading partners starting August 1, escalating tensions. European leaders, including the German Chancellor, are now working intensively to find a solution before the deadline. Hassett's comments reinforce the administration's hardline stance on trade, emphasizing that the president is prepared to proceed with the tariffs to address what he considers unfair trade deficits.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the Trump administration's proposed 50% tariff on Brazil, arguing it is part of a broader strategy to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign production for national security. When challenged that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil, not a deficit, Hassett maintained that an overall strategy is necessary to prevent transshipping and achieve the goal of onshoring production. The justification for the tariff also cited Brazil's handling of a criminal case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, though Hassett downplayed that factor, focusing on the administration's larger economic and security objectives.

Although aware that climate change is making such events more frequent, the family's deep emotional connection to the property, which has been in their lives for nearly a century, is driving their decision.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Critics, including prominent conservative figures, have accused Bondi of withholding information after a recent Justice Department memo failed to reveal a so-called "client list." In a social media post, Trump urged his base to "let Pam Bondi do her job," signaling a desire to move on from the issue. The situation has reportedly caused a rift within the administration, highlighting a division between the Justice Department and some at the FBI over the politically charged case.</p>
