          <h2>ESA Assesses Impact of NASA Budget Cuts on Lunar and Mars Missions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Space Agency is evaluating the repercussions of proposed budget cuts to NASA, particularly concerning the Artemis moon program and the shift towards Mars-focused initiatives. These cuts, potentially removing $6 billion from NASA's budget, could jeopardize major international collaborations. While NASA's human exploration portfolio remains largely untouched with a proposed $1 billion increase for Mars programs, the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft program may be phased out by 2027, potentially replaced by SpaceX's Starship program. The ESA emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in space activities as they assess the full impact of these changes on European researchers' involvement in lunar and Martian endeavors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has responded to California Governor Gavin Newsom's proposal for a federal film tax credit aimed at revitalizing the American film industry. Newsom's request followed Trump's announcement of potential 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S., a move intended to address the industry's recent struggles including a significant drop in production levels. Trump criticized Newsom and the state's handling of the film industry, citing the California High-Speed Rail project as an example of mismanagement, while also expressing a willingness to meet with film executives to address their concerns regarding the proposed tariffs. Despite the criticism, Trump acknowledged a past positive relationship with Newsom and referenced providing assistance during the January wildfires.</p>

Applebaum argues that kleptocracy is a uniting factor among modern dictatorships and a common cause for anti-authoritarian movements. Frum and Applebaum explore how the Trump administration's self-enrichment agenda is linked to attacks on due process, impunity for the favored, and a foreign policy that favors dictators. They also discuss the erosion of norms and laws that enable theft and corruption, as well as the potential for a broader crackdown on civil society as a result.</p>

          <p>During a traffic stop in Ohio, police officers discovered a pet raccoon named "Chewy" with a glass methamphetamine pipe in its mouth, sitting in the driver's seat of the vehicle. A subsequent search of the car revealed methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and additional drug paraphernalia. The vehicle was stopped due to the registered owner having an active warrant and a suspended license. The owner, Victoria Vidal, was arrested and charged with drug possession and other offenses, while the raccoon was unharmed and confirmed to be legally owned with proper documentation.

Historians and activists are working to gain recognition for the crimes and abuses endured by Germany's Black community, which has been part of the country since the late 1800s. The Nazis viewed Black people as racially inferior, restricting their economic and social opportunities through discriminatory laws and policies. Despite the hardships, many Afro-Germans demonstrated resilience and courage, resisting the regime in various ways.

          <p>The Trump administration intends to eliminate the Energy Star program, a 33-year-old initiative that certifies energy efficiency in appliances. The decision was announced at an EPA meeting, with the agency citing a reorganization effort. The Energy Star program, created in 1992, helps consumers save money and reduce energy consumption by identifying products that meet EPA standards. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse criticized the move, arguing it would force Americans to buy less efficient appliances and waste more energy. The EPA claims the reorganization will benefit Americans and advance the agency's core mission.</p>

          <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have traded wide receiver George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys after a period marked by both talent and emotional outbursts. Pickens, known for his highlight-reel catches, also struggled with immaturity and emotional control. The Steelers, having acquired DK Metcalf, deemed Pickens expendable and traded him for draft picks. Pickens joins a Cowboys offense seeking a downfield threat to complement CeeDee Lamb. The trade signifies the Steelers' decision to prioritize team cohesion and reliability over Pickens' raw talent.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether credit card debt forgiveness is a suitable option for seniors, noting that while it can provide financial relief, it also carries risks. Experts advise that debt forgiveness may be beneficial for seniors with high medical expenses, low income, or limited assets, particularly if repaying debt would compromise basic needs. However, it may not be wise for seniors with substantial assets or those who plan to use credit in the future, as it can damage credit scores and have tax consequences. The article also offers alternative strategies for reducing credit card debt, such as contacting card issuers for lower interest rates and choosing a debt repayment strategy.
