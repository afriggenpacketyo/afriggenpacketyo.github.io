          <p>A chaotic shooting incident in a Midtown Manhattan office tower resulted in four fatalities, including a New York City police officer, and left one person wounded. The 27-year-old gunman, Shane D. Tamura, opened fire in the lobby of the building, which houses major firms like the NFL and Blackstone, before continuing his spree on the 33rd floor and taking his own life. The event prompted widespread fear, shelter-in-place orders, and a significant law enforcement response in the heart of New York City. Authorities are investigating the motive behind this tragic attack.</p>

          <p>A Russian airstrike on a prison in Ukraine's southeastern Zaporizhzhia region killed 17 inmates and wounded 42 others, damaging surrounding homes. Ukrainian officials condemned the attack as a war crime, noting four high-explosive aerial glide bombs hit the Bilenke penitentiary. This incident follows a stark ultimatum from US President Donald Trump to Moscow for a ceasefire or face sweeping sanctions, which has not halted Russia's ongoing barrage. Further missile and drone attacks in the Dnipropetrovsk region also resulted in additional casualties, highlighting the escalating conflict.</p>

          <h2>Venezuelan Detainees Recount Horrific Conditions in El Salvador's 'Cecot' Prison After US Deportation</h2>

          <p>Venezuelan former detainees have shared harrowing accounts of their 125-day incarceration in El Salvador's 'Cecot' terrorism confinement center, a prison described by its warden as a 'cemetery of the living dead.' They detailed physical and psychological abuse, including beatings and threats, after being deported by the US as part of a Trump administration anti-immigrant campaign. The 252 Venezuelans, many with no criminal background, were freed in a prisoner swap deal between Washington and Caracas. Their testimonies offer a rare glimpse into the human toll of authoritarian crackdowns and immigration policies, prompting calls for legal action against the US government.</p>

This act highlights the escalating and lucrative kidnapping industry in the region, where criminal gangs known as 'bandits' operate. Despite a 2022 law making ransom payments illegal and abduction punishable by death, families often feel compelled to pay due to the government's inability to ensure safety, leading to continued atrocities.</p>

          <p>Details are emerging about Shane Devon Tamura, the 27-year-old identified as the suspect in the Midtown Manhattan office building shooting. Tamura, who recently lived in Las Vegas, was a registered gun owner and held a concealed firearms permit. He had a documented mental health history and reportedly drove from Las Vegas to New York for the attack. Authorities found additional ammunition, a revolver, a backpack, and medication in his vehicle. The motive for targeting the specific Park Avenue building, which houses Rudin Management on the 33rd floor, remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire outside the Grand Sierra Resort casino in Reno, Nevada, killing three people and wounding three others before being shot and arrested by police. The suspect, whose motive remains unclear, had no known connection to the victims. The incident began in the valet parking area, where the gunman's weapon initially malfunctioned before he fired multiple shots. Swift police action, arriving within three minutes, prevented the shooter from entering the casino-hotel, potentially averting further casualties. The suspect remains in critical condition.</p>

These facilities, described as dynamic ecosystems bringing together computing power, data, and talent, aim to industrialize AI manufacturing. The EU has committed €10 billion for 13 AI factories and €20 billion as a starting point for gigafactories, marking the 'largest public investment in AI globally.' While significant private investment is needed, these initiatives aim to address Europe's limited computing capacity and leverage its strong research base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines (SIA) plummeted over 8% after the carrier reported a 59% decline in net profit for the first quarter of its financial year, falling to S$186 million ($144 million). The significant drop was primarily attributed to reduced interest income and losses from its associated companies, notably Air India, in which SIA holds a 25.1% stake. Analysts suggest Air India's losses were 'significantly deeper than expected' and are likely to remain a drag on SIA's bottom line. Despite strong travel demand, rising competition and operating costs pose challenges to SIA's margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was convicted of witness tampering and bribery in a landmark trial, a ruling that could tarnish his legacy. The court found sufficient evidence that Uribe conspired to influence former paramilitary members to alter testimonies linking him to a paramilitary group. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, is a polarizing figure, credited by many for combating insurgency but criticized for human rights violations. He faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal, with the ruling sparking clashes between supporters and opponents outside the courthouse.</p>

The discussion, lasting about 45 minutes, reaffirmed both nations' commitment to advancing their strategic cooperative partnership.

          <p>China has introduced its first nationwide subsidy aimed at boosting birth rates, offering parents 3,600 yuan ($500) annually for each child under three. This initiative comes as China's population continues to shrink, despite the abolition of the one-child policy nearly a decade ago. The scheme, applied retroactively from 2025, will benefit approximately 20 million families. Several provinces have already piloted similar payouts, with some cities offering up to 100,000 yuan for third children. Raising a child in China is among the world's most expensive, making these subsidies a crucial step in addressing the looming demographic crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

This abrupt reversal of long-standing practice affects individuals with deep community ties, who were previously released if not deemed a flight risk or public safety threat. Advocates argue the policy, which applies to all undocumented immigrants, is a 'draconian interpretation' of the law, causing 'catastrophic' harm by separating families and denying due process. The lawsuit seeks to block this policy, which immigration lawyers describe as a 'sleight-of-hand trick.'</p>
