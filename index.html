          <p>In response to the devastating floods that have claimed over 90 lives, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared an official "Day of Prayer" for the victims and their families. The move reflects a broader turn towards faith within the affected communities, with political leaders from both parties encouraging prayer and support. Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp that suffered immense losses, has also centered its public statements on faith and prayer during this time of unimaginable grief. This spiritual response underscores the significant role of religion in the region as it grapples with the immense loss of life.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly defended former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt, calling the prosecution a "WITCH HUNT." In a social media post, Trump urged Brazilian authorities to "LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE," comparing the case to his own legal challenges. Brazil's current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, swiftly rebuked the comments, stating that Brazil is a sovereign nation and will not accept "interference from anyone." The exchange highlights the continued political alliance between the two right-wing leaders and creates diplomatic friction between the U.S. and Brazil.</p>

          <p>Russia's Minister of Transport, Roman Starovoy, has died from a suspected suicide just hours after being fired by President Vladimir Putin, according to state media. Starovoy was found with a fatal gunshot wound in his car west of Moscow. His dismissal followed a weekend of major air traffic disruptions in Russia caused by Ukrainian drone attacks. In a separate, strange incident, another senior transport ministry official also died suddenly of a reported cardiac arrest during a meeting. These deaths add to a series of sudden and unusual fatalities among high-profile Russian officials and business leaders.</p>

          <p>David Jones, a former Conservative cabinet minister who served as Welsh Secretary, has announced he is joining the Reform UK party. Jones, who did not seek re-election as a Tory MP, stated he had become "disillusioned" with his former party and believes only Reform UK is determined to tackle the country's problems. His defection follows that of two other former Tory MPs, signaling a continuing trend of right-wing political figures shifting to Nigel Farage's party. The move underscores the ongoing fragmentation and realignment within the UK's conservative political landscape.</p>

          <p>A new mural in North Hollywood celebrates Los Angeles Dodgers player Kiké Hernández, honoring his public support for the city's immigrant community. The artwork by local artist Louie Palsino was inspired by a recent social media post from Hernández, a native of Puerto Rico, in which he condemned the treatment of immigrants during recent enforcement raids. The mural, which features Hernández's image alongside the words "Born X Raised" and "Los Angeles," has been placed on a building that already features murals of Dodgers legends Vin Scully and Fernando Valenzuela, cementing his place as a beloved community figure.</p>

As a result, some global central banks are increasing their gold reserves as an alternative safe haven asset.

This deduction is available to individuals with incomes up to $75,000 and couples up to $150,000, and it is set to expire in 2028.

However, state officials express concern that these gains could be reversed by the Trump administration, which has signaled it may abolish the new monuments and has terminated the national version of the 30x30 plan. The situation highlights a growing conflict between state-led environmental initiatives and the federal government's changing priorities on public lands.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old suspect was killed by law enforcement after he opened fire on the U.S. Border Patrol sector annex in McAllen, Texas. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, fired numerous rounds at the entrance of the federal building but did not gain entry. Border Patrol agents and local police neutralized the suspect, and two officers and a Border Patrol employee sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The motive for the attack is currently unknown, and authorities found additional weapons and ammunition in the suspect's vehicle, which prompted a temporary delay of all flights at the nearby McAllen International Airport.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 76,000 immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, effective in early September. This policy change removes long-standing work permits and protections from deportation for individuals who have lived in the U.S. for decades, many since Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America in 1999. The Department of Homeland Security argued that conditions in those countries have improved sufficiently to end the program. The move is part of a broader effort to curtail humanitarian immigration programs and could lead to the separation of thousands of families.</p>

          <p>The number of measles cases in the United States has reached its highest level in 33 years, with nearly 1,300 infections confirmed across 38 states and the District of Columbia. According to the CDC, 92% of the cases were in individuals who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. The outbreak, which has resulted in at least three deaths and 155 hospitalizations, is most severe in Texas. Health officials attribute the spread to lower vaccination rates in some communities and growing anti-vaccine sentiment, raising concerns that the U.S. could lose its measles elimination status.</p>

The Israeli strike was part of a broader wave of attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen, which the IDF stated was a response to repeated Houthi aggression against Israel.

          <p>The deadly Texas floods have sparked intense debate over the adequacy of emergency warnings and whether federal budget cuts impacted the National Weather Service's forecasting capabilities. While the NWS issued 22 alerts for Kerr County, the most urgent warnings came in the pre-dawn hours, and local officials did not issue their own evacuation orders. Some officials claim the rainfall exceeded forecasts, while critics point to NWS staffing shortages and suspended programs as potential contributing factors. The controversy has led to political finger-pointing and calls for investigations into the preparedness and response to the catastrophic event.</p>

          <p>The racing film "F1: The Movie" has become Apple's highest-grossing theatrical release ever, speeding past $293 million at the global box office. Distributed by Warner Bros.

The film's success has been significantly boosted by a partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over 20% of its total ticket sales. While the high-budget film still has a way to go to reach profitability, its box office performance is a major milestone for Apple's growing ambitions in the film industry.</p>

          <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former California governor, recently spoke at a naturalization ceremony at Mount Vernon, George Washington's historic home. In his remarks, he praised Washington's defining leadership trait: his willingness to relinquish power rather than cling to it. Schwarzenegger contrasted this ideal of civic stewardship with the modern political climate, drawing a parallel between Washington's return to his farm and his own return to Hollywood after public service. The article uses Schwarzenegger's pilgrimage to reflect on the enduring American ideal of leadership as service, which continues to inspire new citizens and leaders alike.</p>

Meanwhile, in Seattle, two young brothers and chess champions, Vivaan and Sarang Sankrithi, donated their tournament winnings to help a 10-year-old boy suffering from chronic pancreatitis. These acts of compassion demonstrate how individuals are choosing to support others, turning moments of hardship into opportunities for hope and connection.</p>

An investigation by The Observer newspaper alleges that the couple's homelessness resulted not from a bad investment, as claimed in the book, but from legal issues related to fraud. The report also raises skepticism from medical experts about her husband's rare neurological diagnosis, given his long-term survival and physical capabilities. Winn has called the article "highly misleading" and is seeking legal advice, while a charity has severed ties with the family over the controversy.</p>

The statement came during a contentious court hearing where a federal judge is trying to determine the administration's plans for him.
