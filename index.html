          <p>Donald Trump expressed doubts about Vladimir Putin's commitment to ending the war in Ukraine following a meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Pope Francis's funeral. Trump noted Russia's attacks on Kyiv, suggesting Putin may not be serious about peace. The meeting was described as "very productive" by the White House and "symbolic" by Zelenskyy, marking their first face-to-face encounter since February. Trump also said that Putin was "tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?'".</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41, according to her family. Her family's statement to CBS News indicates that Giuffre was a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking. Giuffre had alleged that Epstein sexually trafficked her to Prince Andrew, allegations which Andrew has denied. Giuffre formed a nonprofit called Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (SOAR) to advocate for sexual abuse victims and her attorney said she was an incredible champion for other victims.</p>

          <p>Recent polls reveal that Americans, including Republicans, are losing faith in Donald Trump across key issues, with a majority describing his second term as "scary." Only 24% believe Trump focuses on the right priorities, and his approval ratings on the economy and immigration are low. Even among Republicans, support for Trump's priorities is narrow, and independent voters show significant disapproval. The polls also indicate concerns about Trump's handling of foreign policy, trade, and the economy, as well as his use of presidential powers.</p>

          <p>A letter written on board the Titanic by first-class passenger Archibald Gracie IV sold for nearly $400,000 at auction in the United Kingdom. Gracie wrote the letter the day the Titanic set sail from Southampton to New York, before the ship struck an iceberg. Gracie survived the sinking and later wrote a detailed account of the disaster. The letter, described as an "exceptional museum-grade piece," was purchased by a private collector from the United States.</p>

          <p>The FBI's arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan has ignited strong reactions from Republican and Democratic politicians. Republicans are calling for her removal, while Democrats view her arrest as a reflection of the Trump administration's increasing disregard for judicial independence amid its push to deport immigrants. Dugan is accused of helping a man evade US immigration officers at her courthouse. The arrest has sparked debates about the separation of powers and the role of the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett questions the feasibility of shifting U.S. iPhone assembly to India, suggesting it may not effectively reduce costs associated with tariffs. Moffett argues that since iPhone components would still be manufactured in China, the move wouldn't fully address tariff-related issues. He also notes that Apple's supply chain would remain anchored in China and could face resistance. Moffett cut his Apple price target, citing concerns about valuation and the impact of tariffs on consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>
