            <p>Scientists are studying the Santorini volcano in Greece to assess the risks of future eruptions, using the research vessel Discovery to explore underwater vents and magma chambers. The research aims to understand how seawater mixing with magma affects explosivity and to create geohazard maps for the Greek Civil Protection Agency. Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, and the recent earthquake swarm served as a reminder of the seismic activity beneath the popular tourist destination. The data collected will contribute to forecasting hazards from underwater volcanoes globally.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans detained in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, following an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to deport the individuals without due process, potentially to a dangerous prison in El Salvador. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, claiming the court acted prematurely, but the majority decision ensures the detainees have a chance to argue their case in court. The case highlights ongoing legal battles surrounding immigration enforcement and the use of the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

            <p>Professor Yan Anlin, a mainland China expert on Taiwan studies, believes it will likely take another five to 10 years to achieve full reunification with Taiwan peacefully. He cautioned against setting a timetable, as it could be counterproductive and that peaceful reunification becomes no longer feasible if Taiwanese independence forces push matters to the extreme. Yan's views reflect Beijing's cautious approach to the sensitive issue of cross-strait relations.</p>

The bullpen stepped up, with strong performances from Luis García, Anthony Banda, Ben Casparius, Jack Dreyer, Evan Phillips, and Tanner Scott.

One officer was dismissed, and another will be reprimanded. The Palestine Red Crescent Society dismissed the report as invalid, maintaining that the incident was not due to personal error.</p>
