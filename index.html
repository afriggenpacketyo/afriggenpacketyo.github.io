          <p>Hamas has submitted its response to President Trump's Gaza peace plan, agreeing to release 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of others in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. The group expressed willingness to hand over Gaza's administration to a Palestinian technocratic body but seeks changes, notably regarding its disarmament and future governance role. Trump issued an ultimatum for Hamas to accept the deal by Sunday, warning of severe consequences otherwise, while Netanyahu reiterated Israel's intent to "finish the job" if Hamas rejects it. The plan, welcomed by many international leaders, aims for an immediate end to fighting and increased aid to Gaza, where the health system is collapsing under immense strain, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has playfully claimed to be Taylor Swift's biggest fan, expressing his enthusiasm for her potential attendance at the upcoming Thanksgiving game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Jones acknowledged the significant interest Swift has brought to the NFL, stating he "can't get enough Taylor Swift" and would offer her an elaborate seat. While the Cowboys' offense has performed well, Jones expressed concern about the team's struggling defense, which will face Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce. Swift has frequently attended Chiefs games since dating Kelce, boosting viewership and engagement for the league and drawing new demographics to football.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch announced that the Conservative Party will withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if they win the next election. This decision follows a legal review, led by Lord Wolfson, suggesting the ECHR significantly constrains government efforts on migration reform, veteran protection, and public services. While Badenoch previously expressed skepticism, she now argues it is necessary to "protect our borders, our veterans, and our citizens." The announcement, made on the eve of the party conference, signals a significant policy shift, drawing criticism from Labour, who accuse the Conservatives of adopting a previously opposed stance under pressure from Reform UK. Legal experts warn of serious political and legal consequences, including potential breaches of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <p>Sophie Roske was sentenced to eight years and one month in prison, along with a lifetime of supervised release, for attempting to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022. Roske, who pleaded guilty, had traveled from California with weapons and researched methods to silently kill, aiming to "alter the constitutional order for ideological ends" after the abortion ruling leak. The judge acknowledged Roske's mental health issues and remorse, noting she called the police on herself, but emphasized the incredibly serious nature of the "preplanned, coldblooded murder" attempt, deeming it an abhorrent form of terrorism. Prosecutors had initially sought a 30-year sentence, highlighting the gravity of targeting a judge to influence government conduct.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence chipmaker Cerebras has withdrawn its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This decision comes after the company recently raised $1.2 billion at an $8.1 billion valuation, a year after initially filing for the IPO. Cerebras stated the original prospectus was outdated, particularly given rapid developments in AI, and confirmed the company still intends to go public eventually, rather than continuing to raise venture capital. The company has also shifted its focus from selling systems to providing a cloud service for accepting queries to models that utilize its underlying chips.</p>

          <p>Actor and R&B singer Tyrese Gibson turned himself in to Fulton County authorities after a warrant was issued for his arrest on animal cruelty charges. He was subsequently released on a $20,000 bond. The charges stem from an incident where his four Cane Corso dogs allegedly escaped his mansion and killed a neighbor's Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Henry. Gibson's legal team stated he has cooperated fully, while authorities, including Fulton County Chairman Robb Pitts, emphasize the need to impound the dogs, which they deem dangerous due to past complaints.

Senator Bernie Moreno indicated that the changes would reward automakers with final assembly in the U.S., potentially extending a tariff offset and adding U.S. engine production to the relief.

This article outlines several common methods for acquiring these assets, including setting up a gold or silver Individual Retirement Account (IRA), investing in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that track metal prices, or purchasing shares in gold and silver mining companies.

This dramatic shift follows escalated complaints from conservatives and allies of Donald Trump, who accused the groups of unfairly maligning their viewpoints.

          <p>The Atlantic critically reviewed FBI Director Kash Patel's newly designed "challenge coin," describing it as "ridiculous" and a symbol of the "hollowness of Patel’s leadership." The coin features imagery resembling the Marvel character Punisher, a skull with spiders, and the initials "K$H," along with pistols and a tommy gun, drawing comparisons to a "Goth-horror movie-gamer coin." The article argues that such a design lacks the gravitas expected of an FBI director, contrasting it with the agency's serious history and accomplished leaders. It suggests the coin reflects a preference for internet culture over professional decorum, undermining the FBI's image and failing to inspire respect among colleagues or the public.</p>

This article outlines common disqualifying factors, such as failing the means test for Chapter 7, having recent bankruptcy discharges within specified periods, or not completing mandatory credit counseling. Fraudulent behavior, like concealing assets, making fraudulent transfers, or recent luxury purchases on credit, also leads to disqualification and potential criminal charges. If bankruptcy is not an option, alternatives like debt consolidation, debt settlement, debt management programs, or asset liquidation can provide viable paths to debt relief.

The monetary offer is intended to support reintegration efforts post-departure, but requires approval from an immigration judge. Critics, like attorney Melissa Adamson, warn that "dangling money before vulnerable children distorts this process and could endanger their lives," arguing for meaningful legal guidance instead of cash payouts.

The White House, blaming Democrats, warned of potential mass layoffs to keep essential services operating, with President Trump considering cuts to "Democrat agencies" that do not align with his administration's values. The impasse has already led to freezes in federal infrastructure funding for several states, causing economic repercussions and public concern.</p>

          <p>A terror attack occurred outside a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, resulting in the deaths of Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, and leaving three others seriously injured. The suspect, 35-year-old British citizen Jihad Al-Shamie, drove a car into worshippers, then stabbed people before being shot dead by police. One victim, Daulby, was mistakenly hit by police gunfire while helping hold the synagogue doors shut. The attack is being treated as a terror incident, with police believing Al-Shamie was influenced by extreme Islamist ideology. Worshippers and security staff were praised for their "immediate bravery" in helping to stop the attacker from entering the building, which could have led to more casualties.</p>

          <p>Hamas has accepted most of President Trump's terms for ending the war in Gaza, agreeing to release all Israeli hostages—both dead and alive—and relinquish control of the enclave to a "technocratic" Palestinian body. This response came after Trump issued an ultimatum, threatening "all HELL" against Hamas if a deal wasn't reached by Sunday evening. However, Hamas's acceptance fell short on the crucial point of surrendering its weapons, insisting this would only happen as part of a broader deal leading to an independent Palestinian state. The group stated that further issues would be discussed within an inclusive Palestinian national framework that includes Hamas, reflecting ongoing complexities in the peace process.</p>

          <p>Amazon is closing four more Fresh supermarkets in Southern California, continuing to adjust its grocery strategy to focus on Whole Foods and delivery services. These closures follow previous ones in other U.S. states and the U.K., where 14 Fresh stores are shutting and five converting to Whole Foods. An Amazon spokesperson stated that "certain locations work better than others," leading to these decisions, and the company is assisting affected employees in finding new roles. Despite these closures, Amazon maintains over 60 Fresh stores in the U.S. and continues to innovate in online grocery, including launching a new "price-conscious" brand and expanding same-day fresh food delivery, indicating a strategic rather than a failing approach.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police have made three additional arrests in connection with the Manchester synagogue attack, bringing the total number of suspects in custody to six. A man and two women, aged 18 to mid-40s, were detained on suspicion of commission, preparation, and instigation of acts of terrorism. Authorities confirmed the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, had a non-terror criminal history, including a recent sexual assault allegation for which he was on bail. Police believe Al-Shamie "may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology" and are investigating his actions, including a confrontation with synagogue security before the attack. The Independent Office For Police Conduct is also investigating the use of lethal force by police, as one victim was mistakenly hit by a police bullet.</p>

          <p>A large fire at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo, Los Angeles area, has been contained following an explosion reported on Thursday night. Emergency crews, including the refinery's own fire department and LA County Fire, responded quickly, with witnesses describing the explosion as feeling like a small earthquake. El Segundo Mayor Chris Pimentel confirmed no injuries were reported. While residents were advised to stay indoors due to potential air quality impacts, the South Coast Air Quality Management District has not detected elevated toxin levels, though conditions could change as smoke settles. The fire, involving gasoline and diesel at the West Coast's largest refinery, is expected to burn out or be fully extinguished soon, without impacting nearby LAX operations.</p>

          <p>During a government shutdown, federal workers, whether furloughed or deemed essential, are legally entitled to back pay once funding resumes, as stipulated by the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019. However, independent contractors and private sector workers supported by federal grants and contracts lack this protection, facing significant financial hardship. Former Labor Department chief of staff Dan Koh noted that many federal employees live paycheck to paycheck, making even short delays in pay stressful. While some fully funded contracts may continue, payment processing can be delayed if personnel are furloughed, and incrementally funded contracts are particularly vulnerable to termination, leaving millions without guaranteed compensation and creating widespread economic ripples.</p>

          <p>Recent college graduates are encountering a uniquely difficult job market, with the unemployment rate for "new entrants" reaching a nine-year peak, and their share of the total unemployed population spiking to decades-high levels. Data indicates that a bachelor's degree no longer guarantees access to white-collar jobs as reliably as it once did, a trend described as "unusual" by economists. This challenge is partly attributed to an increasing number of graduates and the rising influence of artificial intelligence, which is automating entry-level roles. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted a "low-firing, low-hiring environment" making it tough for new entrants, leading to widespread anxiety and self-doubt among young job seekers who often face lengthy job hunts.</p>

They particularly rejected the proposed "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump, stating the future of Palestine must be in Palestinian hands. UNICEF also reported dire conditions for mothers and newborns in Gaza, describing hospital corridors filled with new mothers and babies sharing oxygen supplies, emphasizing the "farcical" nature of designated safe zones amidst ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>U.S. sales of all-electric vehicles, led by Tesla and General Motors, reached record highs this year, surpassing 1 million units through September and achieving a 10.5% market share in the third quarter. This surge was largely driven by consumers rushing to purchase EVs before federal incentives of up to $7,500 per vehicle ended in September due to the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." While Tesla maintained its lead, its market share declined as competitors released new models, with GM making significant gains. Industry analysts, including Ford CEO Jim Farley, anticipate a potential drop in EV sales, possibly to 5% market share, following the expiration of these credits, creating a boom-and-bust cycle.</p>

          <p>OpenAI, valued at $500 billion, is operating at a reported loss of over $1 billion this year, funded by recursive investments from Nvidia and Oracle. This article questions whether the company's astronomical valuation is justified by its current offerings, such as creating recipes or workout routines. While generative AI is seen as a bet on future dominance, concerns about its "hallucinations," mental health risks, and limited direct consumer payments raise skepticism. Many compare the current AI hype to the dot-com bubble, with researchers noting a "generative-AI paradox" where high adoption rates don't always translate to improved bottom lines, suggesting a disconnect between investment and tangible returns.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly urged his followers to cancel Netflix subscriptions, citing concerns over a "transgender woke agenda" linked to the animated show "Dead End: Paranormal Park" and alleged comments by its creator. This call for a boycott follows similar conservative backlash against other major corporations, like the Bud Light controversy. Despite Musk's influence, analysts at Wedbush Securities and other firms believe the boycott is unlikely to significantly impact Netflix's subscriber numbers or its nearly $490 billion market cap, as its shares lost only about 5% over the week. They suggest any potential losses could be offset by increased ad revenue, viewing the controversy as a fleeting headline event rather than a major threat to the company's financial stability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department is reportedly considering a controversial $1 coin design to commemorate America's 250th anniversary in 2026, as authorized by bipartisan legislation. The draft design, shared by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, features Donald Trump's profile with a clenched fist under an American flag, alongside the words "fight, fight, fight." This imagery references Trump's defiant response after narrowly surviving an assassination attempt during his 2024 campaign. The move has sparked debate, especially given Trump's plummeting approval ratings and criticism over his administration's policies on healthcare and nutrition assistance. While the Treasury states it's not the final design, it aims to reflect the nation's "enduring spirit of our country and democracy."</p>
