          <p>Hong Kong developer Road King has defaulted on over $1.5 billion in offshore debts and nearly $900 million in perpetual securities, following creditors' rejection of proposed amendments. This critical financial situation leads to the suspension of interest payments and deferred distributions, which could prompt creditors to demand immediate repayment. The company is now committed to exploring a comprehensive restructuring solution, indicating that proceeds from asset sales will be used to fund this broader overhaul rather than repurchasing notes. Road King aims to engage in constructive dialogue with bondholders and other creditors to devise new terms for its substantial financial challenges, emphasizing a holistic approach to address its current difficulties.

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney expressed strong disappointment over Tom Brady's "very unfair" comments regarding his work ethic as Birmingham City's head coach. Rooney, who was sacked after 83 days, argued that Brady, a minority owner, misunderstood the nuances of football management, which differ significantly from the NFL's shorter season, emphasizing the necessity of player rest. He defended his tenure by highlighting the club's pre-existing organizational challenges and the subsequent struggles faced by other managers. Despite the public criticism, Rooney maintains respect for Brady's athletic achievements and acknowledges Birmingham's current positive trajectory, attributing it to necessary player changes and substantial investment.</p>

          <p>Over 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières, are urging Israel to stop the "weaponization of aid" in Gaza, as starvation intensifies. These groups report being increasingly denied aid delivery unless they comply with stricter Israeli regulations, which include providing detailed information on Palestinian staff and refraining from "delegitimizing" Israel. While Israel denies restrictions, stating rules prevent Hamas involvement, aid organizations contend that most major international NGOs have been unable to deliver essential supplies for months. This situation has led to severe shortages in hospitals and increased deaths from hunger and preventable illnesses, raising significant concerns about humanitarian access.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore, despite its reputation for financial prudence, is experiencing a significant increase in residents living paycheck to paycheck, with 60% of workers affected in 2024. This rise, notably higher than regional peers, is primarily attributed to escalating living costs, including expensive housing and imports, which have outpaced income growth, leading to a decline in real median employment income since 2019. Beyond macroeconomic factors, cultural shifts also contribute, as younger generations increasingly prioritize experiences and aspirational spending on luxury items and buy-now-pay-later schemes over traditional long-term savings. This trend highlights growing financial strain, particularly among middle-income earners, despite the country's mandatory retirement savings system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for a record-breaking $6.1 billion. This transaction marks the highest price ever paid for an American professional sports team, with Chisholm acquiring at least 51% ownership and full control anticipated by 2028, potentially valuing the franchise at $7.3 billion. The new ownership group includes existing shareholder Rob Hale and Bruce Beal Jr., succeeding Wyc Grousbeck's group, which purchased the team in 2002 for $360 million and guided them to two NBA championships. This sale reflects the increasing valuation of major sports franchises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has concluded a six-year legal dispute, ruling that Pinkfong's globally popular "Baby Shark" did not plagiarize US composer Jonathan Wright's work. The court upheld lower court verdicts, determining that Wright's 2011 recording of the children's folk song "had not reached a level of substantial alteration" from the public domain original to qualify for separate copyright protection. Pinkfong's 2016 version became a massive viral sensation, accumulating billions of views on YouTube and inspiring numerous adaptations. Wright initiated the lawsuit after Pinkfong threatened legal action against a political party for using their song, prompting him to re-evaluate his own copyright claims on the tune.</p>

          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has directed state police to launch a criminal investigation into allegations that staff at Centreville High School in Fairfax County arranged and potentially funded abortions for minor students without parental consent. Reports suggest school administrators might have known about these actions in 2021, with public funds possibly being misused. Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) has initiated its own external investigation, stating that such a situation would be unacceptable. Pro-life groups have vehemently condemned the alleged "secretly arranged" abortions, labeling them as "state-funded child exploitation" and calling for the accountability of all officials involved.</p>

          <p>American fugitive Nicholas Rossi, who previously faked his death and fled to Scotland, has been found guilty of sexual assault in the United States following his extradition. Rossi, also known as Nicholas Alahverdian, had denied all charges, with this conviction stemming from an attack in Salt Lake County. He still faces another sexual assault trial scheduled for September in Utah County. The victim, referred to as MS, testified that Rossi became controlling after they met online and became engaged, culminating in the sexual assault when she attempted to end their relationship. The defense had questioned the victim's timing in reporting the incident, which occurred 13 years prior.</p>

Graded from Pass to Starred Distinction, their future was recently debated due to government plans to streamline post-16 education. However, the Labour government has since decided to retain funding for 157 "key courses," ensuring the continued availability of these vocational routes alongside T-levels.</p>

Despite this, European leaders remain nervous about potential land concessions, especially as Russia reiterates maximalist demands for Ukraine's withdrawal from occupied regions and NATO renunciation, which Kyiv and its partners consider unviable.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts' late-game pitching changes proved ineffective, as relievers squandered a one-run lead in the eighth inning. Despite Shohei Ohtani's strong performance in his first full-length pitching start since surgery, the team's ongoing bullpen issues ultimately overshadowed individual efforts and led to their continued decline.</p>

However, Judge Charles Breyer expressed deep concern over the apparent "absence of any limits to a national police force" and the continued presence of troops, particularly once the initial threat had subsided.

Experts link this decline to a growing understanding that any alcohol intake can heighten risks of cancer, depression, and anxiety. Young adults, aged 18-34, exhibit lower drinking rates and a stronger belief in alcohol's harm. Societal shifts, including the rising popularity of sobriety movements, non-alcoholic beverages, fewer in-person social gatherings, and the cost of alcohol, also contribute to this significant change in drinking habits.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning regarding mousse sunscreen products, including those from popular brands like Supergoop!, stating they may not offer effective UV protection. The FDA sent five warning letters, highlighting that these products are often packaged to resemble whipped cream, raising concerns about accidental ingestion. Classified as drugs, these sunscreens reportedly lack the required FDA approval for their specific formulation and are considered "misbranded" due to their deceptive packaging. Supergoop! has affirmed its commitment to product efficacy and safety, indicating it is working to resolve the "product labeling" issue with the agency.</p>

          <h2>China's Xiluodu Dam Replaces Western Chips Amid Security Concerns</h2>

          <p>China's Xiluodu Dam, the world's fourth-largest hydropower station, has stopped using Western industrial chips from companies such as Siemens and Schneider due to increasing national security concerns. This strategic decision is influenced by growing anxieties over vulnerabilities in industrial control systems, exemplified by past cyberattacks like the Stuxnet virus, which reportedly targeted Siemens PLCs in Iran's nuclear program. The mega dam, a vital piece of national infrastructure with a substantial power generation capacity, is now relying on domestic alternatives. This move underscores China's broader initiative to bolster its technological self-reliance and safeguard critical infrastructure from potential cyber threats.</p>

          <p>As the Trump-Putin summit approaches, the family of David Barnes, an American serving a 21.5-year sentence in Russia, is hopeful for his inclusion in a potential prisoner exchange. Barnes, detained since January 2022, was convicted of child sexual assault based on his Russian ex-wife's claims, despite Texas prosecutors finding no corroborating evidence. His sister, Margaret Aaron, maintains his innocence and urges his official designation as "wrongfully detained." Barnes traveled to Russia to seek custody rights after his ex-wife took their children there. The family is appealing to President Trump and Senator Marco Rubio for assistance, drawing on precedents from recent prisoner swaps.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai is in the final stages of his national security trial, facing accusations of colluding with foreign forces. The 77-year-old, who could receive a life sentence, has seen his hearing postponed due to a typhoon. Critics assert that his case exemplifies the weaponization of Hong Kong's legal system to suppress political opposition. A self-made "rebel" who fled mainland China, Lai built a media empire and became a vocal critic of Beijing after the Tiananmen Square massacre, launching influential pro-democracy publications. His son, Sebastien, has urgently called for his release, highlighting the dire implications for his father's health and the city's freedoms.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump is threatening to sue Hunter Biden for over $1 billion after he alleged she was introduced to Donald Trump by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Her legal team asserts the claim is "false, disparaging, defamatory and inflammatory," causing "overwhelming financial and reputational harm." Hunter Biden made the controversial remarks during an interview where he criticized Donald Trump's past association with Epstein. The first lady's lawyers are demanding a retraction and apology, accusing Biden of using others' names for personal attention. There is no evidence to support the claim, and a previous media article making a similar assertion has since been retracted.</p>

Kim also accused Seoul of misleading its public regarding de-escalation efforts. While South Korea's military stands by its assessment of some loudspeaker dismantling, it urges caution when interpreting official statements from Pyongyang.

The Menifee Police Department initiated an investigation following a complaint and then requested an independent probe by the Riverside County Sheriff’s special victims unit. Pesina faces serious charges, including sexual assault, sodomy, and forced oral copulation. Authorities discovered further evidence during searches of his home and workplace. Police Chief Chris Karper expressed profound disappointment, emphasizing that these actions do not represent the department's integrity and that accountability is a top priority, as investigators suspect more victims exist.</p>

          <p>The UK has experienced a significant surge in chikungunya virus cases, reporting over 70 infections in the first half of this year, more than double the previous period. All documented cases are linked to international travel, predominantly from regions in the Indian Ocean experiencing outbreaks, such as India, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius. Chikungunya, a mosquito-borne illness not endemic to the UK, typically causes sudden fever and severe joint pain, which can unfortunately persist for several years, although fatalities are rare. The UK Health Security Agency is advising travelers to higher-risk destinations to implement robust mosquito bite prevention measures and consider available vaccinations.</p>

Ten individuals face felony charges, while others were charged with misdemeanors, including animal cruelty. All 3,500 seized birds were regrettably euthanized, deemed unsuitable for rehabilitation due to their breeding for fighting. Investigators also confiscated over $259,000 in cash, 12 firearms, and substantial quantities of illicit drugs. Animal welfare advocates emphasize the strong links between cockfighting and other criminal activities like gambling and drug trafficking, advocating for more stringent penalties in California.</p>
