          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio tempered expectations for an imminent peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, stating that while progress has been made, a deal is "still not there." Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Rubio emphasized the need for a swift resolution and suggested a critical evaluation of continued U.S. involvement as a mediator. President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the Vatican, described as "very symbolic," adds another layer to the ongoing diplomatic efforts. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov highlighted Russia's openness to dialogue, noting that Trump and Putin are free to arrange their own meeting.(not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed cautious optimism following the meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, citing it as a "sliver of hope" given Trump's previous pro-Russia stances. Sullivan highlighted Trump's earlier concessions to Putin, including recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and promising Ukraine would not join NATO. He hopes Trump is realizing Putin may be misleading him. Sullivan criticized the administration's approach to foreign policy, noting damage to America's credibility and the benefits reaped by China. </p>

          <p>A recent Army Black Hawk helicopter crash near Ronald Reagan National Airport, which resulted in multiple fatalities, is being attributed, in part, to the pilot's request to use “visual separation”. This procedure allows pilots to navigate around other aircraft without relying on air traffic controller guidance. While visual separation is common, aviation experts have warned of its potential dangers if not executed properly. The air traffic controller approved the request shortly before the crash, which occurred as the helicopter flew south along the Potomac River.</p>

          <p>The Green Party is urging the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to withdraw its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it "ill-considered and impractical." The guidance, issued after a UK Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" by biological sex, suggests trans women should not be permitted in women's facilities in places like hospitals and shops, but also shouldn't be left without facilities. Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argues the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination, while Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey raises concerns about enforcement.

          <p>An article reflects on President Gerald Ford's decision to welcome South Vietnamese refugees to the U.S. in 1975, framing it as a moral imperative despite public opposition and economic concerns at the time. Ford argued that the U.S. had a profound obligation to intellectuals and leaders who supported the alliance with America. The article contrasts this with current anti-immigrant sentiment, highlighting the successful integration and contributions of Vietnamese refugees over the years, including notable figures in various fields. The piece underscores the strength derived from diversity in a nation of immigrants and suggests that Ford's leadership serves as a model for today's leaders.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Meeting with Zelenskyy Offers Ukrainians Hope</h2>

          <p>Ukrainians are finding a glimmer of hope in President Trump's recent statement questioning why Putin would continue striking Ukraine while the U.S. is trying to broker peace. Trump suggested Putin may need to be "dealt with differently" and implied the possibility of new sanctions. This sentiment marks a potential shift from the U.S.'s previous push for Ukraine to accept a peace plan that would require them to abandon NATO aspirations and recognize Crimea as Russian. This new stance has been viewed as a victory for Zelenskyy and Ukraine, particularly after a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Two individuals have been arrested for throwing powder paint onto Tower Bridge during the London Marathon as the men's elite runners passed. The protesters, associated with a group called Youth Demand, wore T-shirts stating "Youth Demand: Stop Arming Israel." Police said the paint appeared to be chalk-based and did not pose a hazard to the runners. The London Marathon event staff intervened to remove the protesters from the race route, ensuring the race continued unobstructed.</p>

          <p>Leaving a corporate job to join a family business involves understanding the real reasons behind the decision and recognizing the challenges involved. While the idea of building value for one's family is appealing, it requires establishing trust with employees and customers, overcoming a credibility gap, and dealing with potential conflicts. Business owners face daily battles with customers, employees, and financial risks. However, returning to the family business can bring expertise, new ideas, and peace of mind to parents, while also offering more control over one's life, which is the real value of being a business owner.</p>

Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise bombardment on the territory and has since been carrying out daily waves of strikes.

          <p>A psychotherapist who has worked with over 100 couples identifies five common habits that can destroy relationships: assuming your partner can read your mind, keeping score, passive-aggressive behavior, backseat driving their life, and listening for the sake of responding. These habits can lead to resentment, a transactional relational dynamic, and a lack of genuine communication. Instead, successful relationships require open communication, giving without expecting anything in return, and actively listening to understand each other's needs and perspectives.</p>

M&S says contactless payments are now working and gift cards can be used.
