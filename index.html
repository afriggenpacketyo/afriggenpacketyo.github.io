          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant surge, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising over 1,000 points, as investors reacted positively to potential signs of de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's comments about easing conflict with China and President Trump's statement that he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell helped calm market anxieties. However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cautioned that the escalating trade war and policy uncertainty would negatively impact U.S. economic growth, projecting a decrease of a full percentage point from the previous year. Despite the day's positive market performance, the Dow is still on track for its worst April since 1932 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Tesla reported disappointing first-quarter earnings, with automotive revenue dropping 20% due to factory updates for the Model Y and lower average selling prices. Net income also experienced a significant decrease, falling 71% compared to the previous year. CEO Elon Musk is spending a lot of time in President Donald Trump's White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. Concerns about Trump's sweeping tariffs, which could increase costs for essential electric vehicle components, are also impacting the company. Tesla has refrained from promising growth this year and will revisit its 2025 guidance in the next quarter (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Tesla's first-quarter profits have significantly decreased, with a 71% drop attributed to declining auto sales amidst a backlash against Elon Musk's involvement in a US government jobs-slashing program. Musk announced plans to reduce his work for President Trump's administration in May to focus more on Tesla. The company's performance has been affected by the global trade war and increased competition in the electric vehicle market. This announcement comes as investors are questioning Musk's focus, as he also manages SpaceX and owns X (formerly Twitter).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, aiming to address potential health concerns, including links to ADHD and other conditions. The FDA will work with food companies to transition to natural alternatives and is seeking to revoke authorization for certain synthetic food colorings. While the food industry expressed concerns about the timeline and potential supply disruptions, the Consumer Brands Association indicated its members would cooperate with the administration. The plan is contingent on an understanding with major food companies that consumers want the artificial dyes removed from the food supply.</p>

Powell's tenure, which began in 2018, is set to continue until at least May 2026, as he was nominated for a second term by former President Joe Biden.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting that the food industry voluntarily cease using synthetic food dyes, aligning with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The International Association of Color Manufacturers expressed concerns about the proposed timeline and the complexity of food production, while HHS claims the FDA will work with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes and accelerate the approval of natural color additives.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year, despite projecting higher-than-expected inflation for the UK. The IMF forecasts UK inflation to be the highest among advanced economies at 3.1%, attributing it to higher energy and water bills. The organization also revised down its UK economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1.1%, citing the global fallout from US trade tariffs. The report comes as economic policymakers gather in Washington for the IMF's spring meeting (not investment advice).</p>
