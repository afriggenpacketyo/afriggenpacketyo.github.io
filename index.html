          <h2>India Resists England After Ben Stokes Century in Fourth Test</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the fourth Test at Old Trafford, India mounted a strong resistance against England, closing the fourth day at 174-2. This effort was led by an unbroken 174-run partnership between Shubman Gill and KL Rahul, who defied an English attack missing the bowling of Ben Stokes. Earlier, Stokes had scored his 14th Test hundred, a knock of 141, to help England post a massive total of 669. Despite England remaining favorites to win the match and the series, India's determined batting has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

          <p>An aid distribution in Gaza, designated as a "women only" event to ensure safety, ended in tragedy with at least two women killed. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) organized the food box giveaway, but witnesses described a chaotic scene where crowds were met with pepper spray and stun grenades. One victim, Mary Sheikh al-Eid, was reportedly shot in the head while trying to get food for her seven children. The incident highlights the extreme dangers Palestinians face when attempting to access humanitarian aid amid the ongoing conflict and severe food shortages.</p>

The blast, which occurred last Friday, killed three veteran deputy sheriffs who were working on two "military-style" grenades seized a day earlier. Officials believed the devices were inert, but one detonated unexpectedly during disposal procedures. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms is investigating the incident, and the sheriff has ordered a review of the department's explosives handling policies, stating all future devices will be treated as live.</p>

          <p>A USAID analysis of over 150 reported incidents of aid loss in Gaza found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion by Hamas, according to a reviewed presentation. This finding challenges claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have been used to justify a new aid distribution model and limit other humanitarian channels. The report, compiled before USAID ceased independent operations, noted that in most cases the perpetrator of aid theft could not be identified. The State Department and the Israel Defense Forces have strongly pushed back against the report's conclusions, insisting that significant diversion of aid by Hamas does occur.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that Israel's offer to allow airdrops of aid into Gaza is an act of desperation that will not solve the widespread hunger crisis. The article draws on past experiences in Iraqi Kurdistan and Bosnia, where airdrops proved to be a crude and sometimes dangerous method, with aid pallets killing people or landing in minefields. Humanitarian professionals view airdrops as a last resort, and the article contends that land access via ports and border crossings is far more efficient and feasible. It concludes that only a full ceasefire and a sustained, unrestricted ground-level aid operation can truly address the starvation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Varna's mayor, Blagomir Kotsev, has triggered protests in his city and across Bulgaria, with demonstrators voicing concerns about authoritarianism and the politicization of the justice system. Kotsev, a member of the reformist PP party, was arrested on accusations of running a criminal extortion group, charges his supporters claim are politically motivated. The case has become a symbol of public frustration with the conservative GERB party-led government, which critics accuse of using the prosecutor's office to target political opponents. The protests highlight ongoing worries about the state of democracy and rule of law in the country.</p>

          <p>Media executive Tom Rogers, a former self-proclaimed "raging bull" on Netflix, has expressed growing concerns about the streaming giant's future. While acknowledging its strong earnings and catalogue of hit shows, Rogers points to a decline in viewing time per subscriber and rising competition from free content on platforms like YouTube. He also described artificial intelligence as a "double-edged sword" for the company. AI can help Netflix with ad targeting and cost-cutting, but it also empowers amateur creators on YouTube to produce professional-looking content, further intensifying the competition for viewer engagement.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris has secured pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, narrowly outpacing his teammate Oscar Piastri in a competitive qualifying session. Norris set his fastest time on his first run in the final session, and while Piastri improved on his second lap, a late mistake cost him the top spot. The result sets up an intriguing race, especially with rain forecast for Sunday, which could neutralize the slipstream advantage for the cars starting behind Norris. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start third, just ahead of four-time champion Max Verstappen, who was disappointed with his fourth-place qualifying performance.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's ambitious promises about driverless cars and a robotaxi service, Tesla investors are showing increased concern over the company's immediate financial challenges. Following a dismal earnings report, Tesla's stock fell sharply as focus remained on slumping vehicle sales, thinning profits, and rising competition from lower-cost EV makers. Automotive sales declined 16% year-over-year, and the company warned of a "few rough quarters" ahead. Analysts noted that while long-term projects like robotaxis are interesting, the market currently needs to see growth and stability in the company's core automotive business.

          <p>A U.S. research team has discovered the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," in many reusable period products. The study, from the University of Notre Dame, tested items like period underwear and menstrual cups, finding that nearly a third contained PFAS, some at very high levels. These chemicals, which do not break down in the environment, are linked to serious health issues including cancer, fertility problems, and immune system effects. Researchers noted that since many products tested did not contain PFAS, their use is unnecessary for functionality, urging consumer awareness to drive industry change.</p>

Years earlier, a routine pre-surgery X-ray incidentally revealed he had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and terminal lung disease, despite him having no symptoms. After medications failed and his lung function degraded, doctors gave him less than a year to live but offered the transplant as a final, curative option.

          <p>In an effort to manage political fallout, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of all grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. The Justice Department has subsequently filed requests in federal courts to unseal transcripts from grand juries that investigated Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The move comes amid intense public and political pressure on the administration to be more transparent about the case. However, legal experts caution that these transcripts may not reveal the full scope of Epstein's crimes or network, suggesting that FBI interview summaries and other internal files hold more significant information.</p>

The song, from his surprise album "Swag," has reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The article argues the album's success stems from its soothing, R&B-influenced, and gauze-wrapped production, which resonates with the current cultural mood more than upbeat party anthems. Departing from his previous pop sound, Bieber's new music is described as downtempo yet detailed, capturing a sense of gentle melancholy that seems to be on trend in a world grappling with widespread stress.</p>
