            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House violated the First Amendment by barring Associated Press reporters from accessing secure spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One after the AP refused to adopt the Trump administration's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. The judge, Trevor McFadden, stayed the order to allow the White House time to appeal. The AP sued to regain its access, arguing the ban was viewpoint discrimination. The Knight First Amendment Institute supported the AP's lawsuit, emphasizing that the government cannot control what news outlets say.</p>

            <p>US secretary of defense Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday that the Panama canal faces ongoing threats from China but that together the United States and Panama will keep it secure. Hegseth’s remarks triggered a fiery response from the Chinese government, which said: “Who represents the real threat to the Canal? People will make their own judgement.” Hegseth alluded to ports at either end of the canal that are controlled by a Hong Kong consortium, which is in the process of selling its controlling stake to another consortium including BlackRock Inc.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to restart deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang, but clarified that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review. The high court split 5-4 in granting a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in the dispute over President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without a hearing. Detainees must receive notice that they face removal under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

            <p>President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle. On Monday, April 7, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the administration to resume deportations using the law, but said that individuals subject to removal are entitled to judicial review. The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an "invasion or predatory incursion" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation.</p>

            <p>Stocks shed gains after an earlier rebound, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling after the Trump administration announced it would impose a 104% tariff on China. The losses added to a three-day sell-off amid anxieties about the economic impact of the tariffs. Investors had initially hoped that the tariffs could be pared back, but optimism faded after the White House confirmed the steep levies. Corporate earnings season is underway, with banks and airlines reporting their latest results. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Senate's budget resolution, backed by President Trump and key to extending his tax cuts, faces opposition from House Republicans who want deeper spending cuts. The House must adopt the resolution to move forward on the president's agenda, but Johnson's slim GOP majority means he can afford to lose the support of just three Republicans. The president met with Republican holdouts to try to coax them to back the resolution, but some remain skeptical. The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process.</p>

Coatti worked for the RSB for eight years and was remembered as a passionate and dedicated scientist. He left the RSB at the end of 2024 to volunteer in Ecuador and travel in South America. Santa Marta's Mayor, Carlos Pinedo Cuello, said a reward of 50,000,000 Colombian pesos (£8,940) was being offered for information leading to the capture of those responsible for the death of the Italian citizen.</p>

            <p>A public feud has erupted between Peter Navarro and Elon Musk, with Navarro claiming Tesla is merely an assembler of foreign parts and Musk countering that Tesla has the most American-made cars. Factually, Musk is largely correct. Tesla is more vertically integrated than most automakers, building its own batteries and even a lithium refinery. Government data shows that Tesla's Model 3 Long Range has 75% of its parts sourced from the U.S. or Canada, ranking it high for American-made content.</p>

The panel heard appeals in a case where a judge invalidated leases of VA land and ordered the construction of thousands of housing units. The panel questioned whether the judge overstepped his authority in assuming control over the land. The court will decide on the scope and intention of the injunction.</p>

The park is expected to generate 28,000 jobs before it opens in 2031. Universal estimated the 476-acre complex could attract 8.5 million visitors in its first year and generate £50bn for the UK economy by 2055. Universal, which produced films such as Minions and Wicked, currently has theme parks in Orlando and Los Angeles in the US, as well as Osaka, Japan, Sentosa, Singapore, and Beijing, China. </p>
