          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has announced that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to protect players from high temperatures. This decision follows concerns raised during the current Club World Cup in the US, where conditions were described as dangerous. Infantino highlighted that venues in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver will be prioritized for daytime kick-offs. He also declared the revamped 32-team Club World Cup a major financial success, generating over $2 billion in revenue and marking the start of a "golden era of global club football."</p>

          <p>A rumored vacation visit by Vice President JD Vance to Disneyland sparked a large protest outside the resort's Grand Californian Hotel. The demonstration follows recent ICE raids in nearby immigrant communities, with local officials and advocates describing the VP's visit as insensitive given the administration's policies. Protestors, some traveling for hours, gathered with flags and signs to voice their opposition. While the Vice President's office did not confirm the trip's purpose, online footage later appeared to show Vance with his children inside the park, accompanied by a significant security presence.</p>

Coach Andy Farrell faces difficult choices, particularly in the back-row, where Jac Morgan has been highly impressive. The recent arrival of Owen Farrell adds another layer of intrigue, with the veteran fly-half likely to secure a spot on the bench after a strong cameo appearance, his first since early May.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' pitching prospect Jacob Misiorowski has been named a Major League Baseball All-Star after just five career games, a move that has generated significant debate. The 23-year-old, known for his 103-mph fastball, has been impressive in his limited starts, but his selection is the fastest for any player making their first All-Star team. While some commend MLB for promoting a young star, many critics argue the spot was unearned. They point to more established pitchers like Philadelphia's Christopher Sanchez, who has a lower ERA over many more starts but was not selected for the prestigious game.</p>

          <p>Hartford Bakery, Inc. has issued a voluntary recall for hundreds of loaves of its "Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf" bread because it may contain undeclared hazelnuts. The recall affects approximately 883 loaves distributed to retailers like Kroger and Walmart across 12 states. The product poses a risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reactions to individuals with a nut allergy. While no major injuries have been reported, the company initiated the recall after receiving customer complaints, including one person who experienced digestive discomfort. Consumers are advised to return the product for a full refund.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to revoke the U.S. citizenship of his longtime critic, actress Rosie O’Donnell, calling her a "Threat to Humanity" in a social media post. Trump stated he was giving "serious consideration" to the action, suggesting she should remain in Ireland, where she recently moved. O'Donnell responded by calling the president a "criminal con man" and a "dangerous old soulless man with dementia." Legal experts note that birthright citizenship is a protected right under the 14th Amendment and cannot be unilaterally revoked by a president.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting more than 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a major reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The staff reductions are aimed at cutting the department's U.S. workforce by about 15% to streamline what the administration calls a "bloated bureaucracy." Many of the cuts have hit offices focused on human rights, refugee resettlement, and foreign assistance, prompting sharp criticism from Democratic senators. They argue the move weakens the nation's diplomatic corps at a time of complex global challenges, putting U.S. security and interests at risk.</p>

Relatives of the 260 people killed, including 53 UK nationals, are demanding more transparency and accountability from the investigation.

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has agreed to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine and weapons smuggling. Macias, leader of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador. His escape and the subsequent gang warfare led the government to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." This will be the first extradition from Ecuador since a new law was passed to help combat the country's powerful criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly fired at least 20 prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into President Trump. According to sources, the dismissals have targeted individuals identified by the Justice Department's "weaponization working group," some of whom were support staff with no significant role in driving the prosecutions. The firings have reportedly sent a "chill" through the department's career workforce, echoing concerns about politically motivated purges within the Justice Department.

The study considered traditional metrics like GDP and job growth, as well as new factors like each state's dependence on federal spending and exposure to international trade wars. Florida was named number one for the third consecutive year, praised for its strong growth, solid finances, and relative insulation from tariffs. The report highlights how states are positioning themselves for stability amid economic uncertainty and a shifting global trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising trade war uncertainty, companies are increasingly using U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce the financial impact of tariffs. These zones allow businesses to import components and assemble products duty-free, with taxes only being collected when the final goods enter U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow and provides flexibility in a volatile trade environment. However, a recent executive order by President Trump has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit for FTZs, which previously allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product.

          <p>An investigation has found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) repeatedly approved requests to remove buildings at Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp, from its 100-year flood map in the years before a catastrophic flood killed 27 children and counselors. These exemptions from the "Special Flood Hazard Area" designation loosened safety regulations and insurance requirements as the camp expanded in a known flood plain. Experts find it disturbing that a camp responsible for children would seek such exemptions in a high-risk area.

          <p>Military experts are analyzing the reasons behind Russia's recent escalation of drone and missile attacks across Ukraine. The intensified campaign is believed to have two primary strategic aims: to cripple Ukraine's military-industrial complex and to demoralize the civilian population, thereby pressuring the Ukrainian government. This strategy is enabled by Russia's expanded domestic drone production, reducing its reliance on foreign suppliers. Experts suggest these attacks are a prelude to a potential new summer offensive, designed to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and force the country into a subordinate position by the end of the year.</p>

The rules, enforced by Ofcom, will require age verification, with non-compliant companies facing heavy fines. However, the measures are already facing criticism for not covering content shared on private messaging, risky online challenges, or the full scope of AI chatbots. This article notes that while the rules are a significant step after years of campaigning, the rapid pace of technology means the government already sees a need for future updates.</p>
