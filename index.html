          <p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez's lawyers contend she remains in her role, arguing only President Trump can legally dismiss a presidential appointee. This stance follows the White House's announcement of her firing, reportedly due to her refusal to align with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine policy changes and dismiss health experts. The dispute has led to the departure of at least four other top health officials, further destabilizing the agency. Kennedy criticized the CDC's past Covid response, signaling ambitious reform plans for the institution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. banking industry is experiencing significant consolidation, with the number of FDIC-insured banks nearly halved since 2005 due to mergers by large institutions. This trend raises concerns about reduced competition, innovation, and pricing for consumers. In contrast, Canada's highly concentrated banking system was lauded as the soundest globally during the 2008 financial crisis, benefiting from the collective economic strength of its large players. However, critics caution that market domination, while stable, can stifle competition and innovation, with new policies potentially leading to further consolidation in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Law enforcement is investigating potential motives, including reviewing YouTube videos believed to be associated with Westman that contained disturbing writings and references to violence.

The company has already increased prices on some items as a "last resort" and launched a third-party marketplace to boost growth.

His daughter also received $195,000 for emotional distress. Gluck, a director, sustained permanent disfiguring injuries and traumatic brain injury, with the projectile lodged in his nasal cavity for nearly a year.

          <p>A 59-year-old man has been arrested by Lancashire Police on suspicion of malicious communications, following reports of "disgusting and appalling" racist abuse sent via social media to England footballer Jess Carter. The messages were sent during the UEFA Women's Euros in July, prompting a police investigation. Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the NPCC lead for football policing, commended Carter for coming forward and emphasized that such racist abuse will not be tolerated, warning of more arrests to come. This action reinforces the commitment to hold online offenders accountable.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that understanding China's fundamental "needs" – such as regime survival, economic growth, food, and energy security – is more revealing than focusing on its "wants" in international relations. These domestic constraints drive Beijing's foreign policy as risk management for internal stability. Recognizing this perspective, rather than viewing China's actions as unbounded ambition, could help prevent the US-China rivalry from escalating into a more dangerous confrontation. The article argues that policy leverage lies in acknowledging where China is most vulnerable due to these essential needs.</p>

          <p>Fire crews battling a wildfire in England's North York Moors National Park face heightened danger from nearly 20 exploding World War II-era bombs and tank shells hidden beneath the dense vegetation. The fire, which has charred about 10 square miles, is burning through a former WWII tank training ground, causing the ordnance to detonate. This unusual hazard has forced fire services to adopt a "very defensive fire-fighting strategy" and seek assistance from other agencies. The atypical scale of the wildfire is attributed to an exceptionally hot and dry spring and early summer.</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim is in a precarious position after the team's Carabao Cup defeat to League Two Grimsby Town, marking their third match without a win this season. The loss has intensified scrutiny on Amorim, who inherited a struggling team last November and previously indicated he would step aside if poor form continued. Critics question his team selection and the club's persistent cycle of managerial changes without improved performance. The defeat also eliminates one route back to European football, increasing pressure on league results.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling nearly 500,000 vehicles in the U.S., including its Edge SUV (2015-2018) and Lincoln MKX (2016-2018), due to a brake fluid leak issue that could extend stopping distances and increase crash risk. While no accidents or injuries have been reported for this specific defect, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 1% of recalled vehicles have the problem. Separately, Ford is also recalling over 213,000 vehicles for faulty tail lights and 100,900 for airbag tear risks, highlighting multiple safety concerns across its product lines.</p>

          <p>A new Stanford study indicates that generative AI is significantly impacting the U.S. job market, particularly for early-career workers. The research found a 13% decline in employment for individuals aged 22-25 in AI-exposed fields like software engineering and customer service since 2022. Conversely, more experienced workers in these sectors and those in less AI-exposed roles have seen stable or growing employment. The study suggests AI can replace "book learning" but struggles with the "tacit knowledge" gained through experience, highlighting a shift in demand towards workers with advanced soft skills.

          <p>The UK Department for Transport has unveiled a grant scheme offering significant discounts on electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage wider adoption and transition away from petrol and diesel cars. The Ford Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier are eligible for a £3,750 discount, while 26 other models qualify for £1,500 reductions. These grants apply to EVs costing up to £37,000 and are automatically applied at the point of sale, funded by a £650 million scheme over three years.

          <p>The creators and cast of "The Summer I Turned Pretty" have issued a plea for fans to "start acting normal online" and cease the "unhinged" abuse directed at cast members. Amid intense fan rivalries over the show's romantic storyline, particularly regarding characters Belly and Jeremiah, actors like Lola Tung and Gavin Casalegno have been targeted. Author Jenny Han emphasized that posting images of violence, even in jest, is unacceptable, and the show's TikTok account highlighted that "the show isn't real but the people playing the characters are."

          <p>A new report by University of Chicago researchers reveals that climate-driven wildfires, particularly Canada's worst season on record, are reversing decades of clean air progress in both Canada and parts of the United States. The annual Air Quality Life Index highlights that particulate pollution from these fires soared to levels not seen in years, impacting life expectancy comparable to smoking. The report links human-caused climate change to increased frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires. While the U.S. made significant strides through the Clean Air Act, these fires reintroduce harmful particulates, posing serious public health threats.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is addressing a crisis of "ludicrously high" grade inflation, with an average GPA of 3.8, and a corresponding decline in student academic effort. A committee report found students prioritize extracurriculars over coursework, leading to a "shadow system of distinction" through highly competitive clubs that mimic job applications. This environment, where most students get near-perfect grades, ironically increases stress as students struggle to differentiate themselves meaningfully. Harvard aims to reverse this trend by standardizing grading, emphasizing attendance, and refocusing on academic rigor to restore the value of learning.</p>

While concerns about AI-driven cheating persist, many educators are shifting from banning to leveraging AI productively.

          <p>The Welsh government is proposing "small changes" to its controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodation, which currently require properties to be let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower business rates.

Industry groups criticize these changes as insufficient, arguing the 182-day threshold harms tourism and that many businesses are struggling to meet it.
