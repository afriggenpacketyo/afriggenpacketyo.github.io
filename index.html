          <p>Paul Doyle, a 53-year-old father of three and former Royal Marine, has been charged in connection to the Liverpool parade crash that injured 79 people. Doyle is accused of driving a car into fans celebrating Liverpool's Premier League victory. He faces multiple charges, including causing grievous bodily harm with intent, dangerous driving, and unlawful wounding with intent, with one charge relating to a child victim. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims stated that seven people remain hospitalized, and detectives are reviewing CCTV and mobile phone footage to understand the incident, emphasizing their commitment to justice for all victims. The neighbors of the suspect expressed shock and disbelief regarding the accusations against him, and the investigation is ongoing. The optimism score for this event is relatively low due to the number of injuries sustained by innocent bystanders. </p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, suggests that financial sanctions could become a new battleground in the US-China rivalry, though he believes full-scale sanctions are unlikely. Lian Ping warns that the US might initially target specific Chinese entities before expanding sanctions to exclude China from the US dollar system. He notes that cutting China off from SWIFT could severely damage the system itself, given China's significant role in global trade and investment. Lian suggests that such a move could prompt countries to shift to China's CIPS, undermining Swift's importance (not investment advice).

          <p>Japan has stated it will not purchase defense equipment from the United States in exchange for the easing of tariff measures, ahead of the fourth round of bilateral trade talks. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani emphasized that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters. He added that any equipment purchases would be based on the country's defense needs, not trade negotiations. This stance follows comments from Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggesting defense equipment purchases could help reduce the trade deficit.

          <p>A driver for the Moorpark Unified School District has been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence while transporting students. A concerned parent reported smelling alcohol on the driver, prompting authorities to investigate. The students were safely transferred to a backup van and arrived at school on time. The driver, Jason Watson, was arrested and booked at the Ventura County Jail, and the school district commended the parent and police for their actions. The optimism score is relatively low due to the danger and risk to the students.</p>
