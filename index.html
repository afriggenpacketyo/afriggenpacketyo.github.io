          <p>Country singer Carrie Underwood is fully embracing a traditional, self-sufficient lifestyle on her family's farm near Nashville, Tennessee. Alongside her husband and two sons, she practices homesteading by growing her own produce and raising livestock. Underwood has shared her experiences with canning foods, crocheting, and even a spiritual encounter with a snake in her orchard, all part of a personal goal to eventually no longer rely on grocery stores for food. Her commitment to this simpler life reflects a desire to connect with nature and provide for her family directly from their land.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed how a convicted fraudster named James Kenny orchestrated a large-scale, completely fictitious music festival called Monmouth Rising. Kenny managed to convince suppliers, employees, and even government bodies of the event's legitimacy by claiming major headliners like The Killers and significant investment, all while operating from his mother's kitchen. The scheme unraveled when he failed to pay employees and suppliers, and documents he provided as proof of funding were discovered to be forgeries. The man has since apologized, but many who were duped are left with financial losses and embarrassment.</p>

          <p>Arkansas State Police are investigating a potential double homicide after a 43-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman were discovered dead on a trail in Devil's Den State Park. Authorities were alerted to the scene on Saturday afternoon and have since launched a search for a suspect. The suspect is described as a white male who was seen leaving the park in a black, four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda, with its license plate obscured by tape. Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders has stated that law enforcement will not rest until the perpetrator is brought to justice.</p>

          <p>Several members of the United States swim team are suffering from an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis at the World Aquatics Championships. The illness reportedly began during a pre-competition training camp in Thailand and has already impacted multiple athletes' performances, forcing some to withdraw from their events. Reigning Olympic champion Torri Huske and teenager Claire Weinstein were among those pulled from their races. While team officials have not specified the exact number of swimmers affected, the outbreak casts a shadow over the team's efforts to rebound from a disappointing performance at the recent Paris Olympics.</p>

          <p>The government in England and Wales is planning to reform licensing rules to shield pubs and music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, aiming to reverse the decline in the pub industry. The reforms also seek to fast-track permissions for new businesses and expanded outdoor areas to invigorate high streets. While Labour supports the move to cut red tape, the Conservatives argue that Labour's own tax policies have harmed the hospitality sector in the first place.</p>

However, the ambitious project faces significant hurdles, including the need for an estimated $4 billion in funding and infrastructural challenges like an unstable power supply.

The accused, Brian and Jill Griffeth and Dallin and Liberty Griffeth, allegedly kept some of the children in plywood cages under bunk beds. The victims, aged 7 to 16, were also allegedly beaten with canes and sprayed with vinegar as punishment. An investigation began after a church member raised concerns, revealing that the adopted children in the home were treated unfairly compared to the biological children and were forced to lie about the abuse.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Official's Remarks on Ancient Kingdoms Rekindle Historical Sensitivities with South Korea</h2>

          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has reignited a sensitive historical dispute with South Korea by calling for a clearer presentation of ancient history from a Chinese perspective. The official, Huang Qiang, referred to the ancient kingdoms of Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai, which existed in what is now northeastern China and the Korean peninsula. These kingdoms are known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae, and are considered a core part of Korean history. The call to frame their history as distinctly Chinese touches on long-standing academic and nationalistic disagreements between the two countries over historical claims in the region.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Update Suggests Crashed Jeju Air Jet Had One Functioning Engine</h2>

          <p>An update from South Korean investigators into a fatal Jeju Air crash indicates the plane could have continued flying on a damaged but still-working engine. The Boeing 737-800 crashed during an emergency landing after a bird strike, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. According to the investigation, pilots shut down the less-damaged left engine, while the more heavily damaged right engine was still generating enough output to sustain flight. This new information raises questions about the crew's actions in the moments before the disaster, though a final report assigning cause has not yet been released.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Citizens Complain Online as Government Suppresses Coverage of Mass Attacks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 23:21:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chinese government has been increasingly censoring news about mass attacks, such as incidents where drivers or knife-wielding assailants injure multiple people. In several recent cases, initial reports and photos were quickly scrubbed from the internet, and official police statements omitted key details, like the involvement of children or the location being near a school. This heightened information control has led to online pushback from some citizens demanding transparency and the truth. Experts suggest the censorship may be an attempt to prevent copycat crimes and allow local authorities to cover up security failures.</p>

          <h2>Sudan's Paramilitary RSF Forms Rival Government, Deepening National Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 23:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that threatens to permanently fracture the war-torn nation. The new administration, with RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as president, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government. This development stokes fears of an escalation in the country's 27-month civil war, which has already displaced millions and pushed the population to the brink of famine. The RSF's move is seen as an attempt to gain international legitimacy and could further undermine diplomatic efforts to resolve the devastating conflict.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Ceasefire Agreement Between Thailand and Cambodia, but Shelling Persists</h2>

          <p>Donald Trump announced he had personally mediated a ceasefire between the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia following recent deadly border clashes. Both nations publicly thanked Trump for his efforts and expressed a willingness to de-escalate, with Cambodia accepting the ceasefire request. However, despite the diplomatic intervention, reports indicated that shelling continued along the border overnight, casting doubt on the immediate effectiveness of the agreement. The dispute, rooted in a century-old border demarcation, has resulted in dozens of casualties and displaced thousands of civilians on both sides of the border.</p>
