          <h2>Researchers Use Sensor-Equipped Sharks to Improve Hurricane Forecasting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are attaching sensors to sharks to gather crucial ocean data for improving hurricane forecasts. This innovative approach uses the animals as natural, wide-ranging ocean monitors to collect information on water temperature and conductivity, which are key factors in hurricane development. Researchers hope that by turning sharks into data collectors, they can access information from vast, otherwise inaccessible areas of the ocean more efficiently than with robotic gliders. The data will eventually be fed into computer models to enhance the accuracy of hurricane predictions.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for child sex trafficking, was questioned for two days by the U.S. Deputy Attorney General in Florida. Her lawyer stated that she answered questions about approximately 100 different people and addressed "every possible thing you could imagine." The meetings come as Maxwell appeals her conviction and as the Trump administration faces pressure over the handling of files related to her accomplice, Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed no offers of clemency were made for her cooperation.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a University of New Mexico dormitory resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and left a 19-year-old hospitalized with gunshot wounds. The incident occurred when an 18-year-old suspect allegedly opened fire on three other people while they were playing video games in a dorm room. Authorities have since taken the suspect into custody, and an investigation is ongoing. The university closed its central campus for a day as a precaution and is providing counseling services to the community.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunisia's capital, marking the fourth anniversary of President Kais Saied's seizure of power by demanding an end to his rule. Demonstrators criticized what they call an "authoritarian regime" that has led to mass arrests of political opponents, journalists, and activists, turning the nation into an "open-air prison." The protests highlight the deep political divisions and growing dissent in the country since Saied dissolved parliament and began ruling by decree in 2021, a move critics labeled a coup.</p>

          <p>Nearly 4,000 NASA employees, representing more than one-fifth of the agency's workforce, have applied to leave through a deferred resignation program initiated by the Trump administration. This potential exodus comes as the space agency faces proposed budget cuts of 25% for fiscal year 2026 and navigates a period of leadership instability. The significant reduction in personnel raises concerns about the agency's ability to maintain safety and pursue its ambitious exploration goals, including missions to the Moon and Mars, while becoming a more streamlined organization.</p>

The investigation is now focused on finding the unaccounted-for explosive and determining the origin of both military-grade grenades.

          <p>In an effort to save Texas's bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease, wildlife biologists have undertaken a rescue mission. The team captured dozens of healthy sheep from the state's only remaining disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range. This relocation aims to establish a new, protected breeding population. Recent observations confirmed the sheep, including newborn lambs, are surviving and thriving in their new habitat, offering hope for the species' future in the state.</p>

          <p>Multiple former federal prosecutors have described the direct involvement of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell as highly unorthodox and concerning. They question the credibility of any information from a convicted, sentenced individual and suggest the high-level meeting appears to be driven by political concerns rather than standard prosecutorial practice. Experts noted that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge to assess truthfulness, raising concerns about the integrity of the process.</p>

          <p>This article investigates common health benchmarks like drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps a day. Experts weigh in on whether these targets are scientifically rigid or if there is flexibility, with some arguing that listening to your body's cues, like thirst, is often sufficient. The consensus suggests that while the guidelines are useful for general health awareness, a balanced and less rigid approach to a healthy lifestyle is often more practical and beneficial for most people.</p>
