          <h2>US Urges China to Deter Iran from Closing Strait of Hormuz</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 14:29:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil trade route. This appeal follows Iran's warning that it reserves the right to defend its sovereignty after the U.S. bombed key nuclear sites. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz could severely impact the global economy, potentially driving oil prices above $100 per barrel, as approximately 20% of the world's crude oil passes through this narrow waterway. Rubio stated that such an action would be "economic suicide" for Iran and would warrant a strong response from the U.S. and other nations. The U.S. Fifth Fleet, stationed in Bahrain, is responsible for safeguarding maritime trade in the Persian Gulf. Optimism regarding the situation is cautious, given the potential for escalation. </p>

          <p>A suicide bomber detonated explosives inside the Mar Elias Church in Dweil'a, Syria, resulting in at least 13 deaths and 53 injuries, according to Syrian state media. The attack, which occurred during prayers, is the first of its kind in Syria in years, raising concerns about sleeper cells of extremist groups. The Syrian Interior Ministry attributed the attack to an extremist from the Islamic State group who fired at people before detonating an explosives vest. Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mostafa condemned the attack as a terrorist act and reaffirmed the state's commitment to combating criminal organizations and protecting society. Church Bishop Moussa Khoury reported that the attacker also threw a grenade into the church during the Mass. The attack is a setback to the Syrian government's efforts to win support from minorities.</p>

          <p>Former WNBA player Angel McCoughtry has criticized Chicago Sky rookie Hailey Van Lith, suggesting her large social media following played a significant role in her draft selection. McCoughtry questioned whether Van Lith would be in the league without her popularity, asserting that there may be more talented but less popular players. Van Lith, a guard who played for Louisville, LSU, and TCU, was one of the most-followed collegiate athletes on social media. McCoughtry later apologized for singling out Van Lith, acknowledging that she worked hard for everything she has achieved. Van Lith has been limited to a bench role in her rookie season, averaging 5.1 points and 1.5 assists per game.</p>

Despite Thembinkosi Lorch reducing the deficit for Wydad, Yildiz completed his brace in the 69th minute, and DuÅ¡an VlahoviÄ‡ added a penalty in added time to secure the win.

          <p>A gunman opened fire during a service at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, wounding one person before being shot and killed by a security guard. The person shot was the security guard, and no one else was injured because a church member ran the attacker over with a truck. The pastor, Bobby Kelly Jr., stated that the church started a security team about a decade ago in response to violence at other places of worship. About 150 people, including children, were attending the service when the shooting occurred. The slain intruder was described by police as a 31-year-old white male.</p>

          <p>Raul A. Reyes argues that the increasing practice of federal agents, particularly ICE agents, wearing masks is detrimental to law enforcement. He cites incidents where masked agents detained individuals, raising concerns about accountability and potential civil rights violations. Reyes points out that while there isn't a specific federal policy prohibiting masks, the practice contradicts Department of Homeland Security regulations requiring agents to identify themselves. He argues that masked agents can confuse the public, leading to interference in law enforcement actions and creating an impression of a secret police force. Reyes calls for Congress to prohibit the use of masks by immigration agents, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that President Trump had approved a plan to potentially strike an Iranian nuclear facility. Steve Bannon, after speaking with Trump by phone, thought it was a bad idea, and was armed with specific talking points: Israeli intelligence canâ€™t be trusted, the bunker-buster bomb might not work as planned, and the risk to U.S. troops in the Middle East wasnâ€™t clear if Iran retaliated. However, a White House official insists that Trump had already decided to hold off on the strike by the time he met with Bannon.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance asserted that the United States is at war with "Iran's nuclear program," not with Iran itself, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. This statement comes after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Iran's "nuclear ambitions have been obliterated." Vance emphasized that the U.S. desires peace but only in the context of Iran not possessing nuclear weapons. White House officials have touted the success of the mission, but the extent of the damage remains uncertain. Vance stated that the U.S. has substantially delayed Iran's development of a nuclear weapon, which was the primary goal of the attack.</p>

The IAEA has not been able to verify the location of Iran's near-bomb-grade uranium stockpile for over a week.

          <p>A bulletin from the National Terrorism Advisory System warns of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following the U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. The bulletin notes the potential for low-level cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and possible attacks against U.S. networks by actors affiliated with the Iranian government. It also warns that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to attack targets. Law enforcement officials in New York City have deployed additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites as a precaution. The bulletin is a comprehensive threat assessment designed to communicate information directly to the public about potential threats.</p>

          <p>New satellite photos reveal the aftermath of the U.S. military strike on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, showing damage to the mountainside where the underground site is located. The U.S. military used multiple 30,000-pound "bunker-buster" bombs in the attack, also hitting the Natanz and Isfahan facilities. The images show craters and ash on the ridge at Fordo, with tunnel entrances appearing blocked by dirt. At Isfahan, satellite images show extensive building damage, while Natanz shows a hole directly over part of the underground complex. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency has reported "no increase in off-site radiation levels" following the strikes.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces a delicate diplomatic situation following the U.S. airstrikes on Iran, despite his calls for de-escalation. The UK was not asked to participate in the military action, though it was given advanced warning. There is speculation that U.S. B-2 stealth bombers could have used the UK's Diego Garcia airbase as a waypoint. The UK government has supported the outcome of delaying Iran's nuclear weapons program, but the legality of any UK involvement has been debated. The US could request military support from the UK in the coming weeks, potentially prompting further difficult decisions for the prime minister.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials have revealed details about the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, describing it as the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The mission, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran, while another group acted as decoys. The bombers dropped 14 "bunker-buster" bombs on the Fordo and Natanz sites, and Tomahawk cruise missiles targeted the Isfahan site. The Pentagon warned Iran against retaliatory action, stating that U.S. forces remain on high alert. The mission aimed to devastate the Iranian nuclear program without targeting Iranian troops or the Iranian people.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda identifies five toxic phrases that make children refuse to listen: "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," "Stop crying. You're fine," "How many times do I have to tell you?" and "You know better than that." She suggests alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while holding boundaries, promoting cooperation. These phrases emphasize respect, emotional safety, and involvement in the process, reducing power struggles and fostering emotional resilience. The key is to view defiance as a signal for connection, clarity, or emotional support.</p>
