          <p>A tour bus carrying over 50 passengers overturned on the New York State Thruway, resulting in five fatalities and numerous injuries. The bus was returning to New York City from Niagara Falls when it lost control and entered a ditch, though no other vehicles were involved. Authorities have ruled out mechanical failure and operator impairment, with the cause remaining under investigation. Passengers, ranging from 1 to 74 years old, included individuals of Indian, Chinese, and Filipino nationalities, and several received critical care at local hospitals.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted searches at former National Security Adviser John Bolton's Maryland home and Washington D.C. office, reportedly in connection with a classified documents investigation. President Trump commented on the raid, calling Bolton "not very smart" and "unpatriotic." The Justice Department had previously investigated Bolton for allegedly publishing classified information in his 2020 memoir, "The Room Where It Happened," which was critical of Trump. The Biden administration later closed that investigation and dropped a related lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador and allegedly tortured, has been released from detention in Tennessee and reunited with his family in Maryland while awaiting trial. He faces human smuggling and gang membership charges, which his family denies. Despite his release, the Trump administration may still seek his deportation, potentially to Uganda, a move condemned by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. A federal judge had ordered his return to supervised release, requiring 72 hours' notice for any deportation outside El Salvador.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant political divide is emerging between young men and women in the UK, with young women increasingly identifying as left-wing and young men leaning towards the right. Polling data from 2024 and 2025 indicates higher support for Labour and the Green Party among young women, while young men show greater backing for Reform UK or the Conservatives. Researchers attribute this trend to factors like higher education rates among women and differing views on gender equality. Social media's role in offering alternative political engagement is also suspected to contribute to this divergence.</p>

          <p>Newly released Department of Justice interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell, granted immunity for her testimony, shed light on her involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell denied the existence of an Epstein "client list" and stated she did not believe Epstein died by suicide, suggesting internal prison mismanagement. She claimed never to have witnessed President Trump or Prince Andrew in any inappropriate settings, and maintained that former President Bill Clinton never visited Epstein's private island. Maxwell attributed memory issues to her two years on suicide watch and described Epstein's character change after taking testosterone.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to be armed, intensifying the Trump administration's crime crackdown. This decision reverses a previous stance that troops would not carry weapons. President Trump lauded the mission as bringing "total safety" to D.C. and suggested expanding it to Chicago, despite local opposition and polls showing the deployment is deeply unpopular. Attorney General Pam Bondi reported over 700 arrests and 91 illegal firearms seized, while Mayor Muriel Bowser questioned the federal intervention given a claimed "30-year violent crime low."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as part of its crime crackdown, with U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro vowing to pursue charges vigorously. However, criminal justice experts caution that arrest numbers alone are not reliable indicators of public safety, as many arrests may not lead to convictions. Concerns are also raised about the transparency of the data, including which agencies made the arrests and their specific nature. Critics suggest that "flooding the zone" with law enforcement can inflate arrest figures and increase the risk of excessive force, questioning the long-term effectiveness of the strategy.</p>

The rejected deal, which proposed a 20-year concurrent sentence, was deemed insufficient by victims who sought a more severe punishment.

          <p>President Trump's aggressive crime crackdown in Washington D.C., including clearing homeless encampments, draws parallels to San Francisco's controversial policies following a 2024 Supreme Court ruling.

Critics argue such punitive measures merely displace individuals without addressing underlying issues like mental health, addiction, and housing shortages.
