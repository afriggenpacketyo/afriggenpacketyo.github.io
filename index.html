            <p>The commander of the US military base in Greenland, Colonel Susannah Meyers, was fired after reportedly sending an email distancing herself from Vice-President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark's security spending in Greenland. The email, released by Military.com, stated that Vance's comments were "not reflective" of the base. The Space Operations Command cited a "loss of confidence in her ability to lead" and adherence to nonpartisanship as the reason for her removal. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell linked the firing to actions undermining the chain of command and President Trump's agenda.</p>

            <p>Scientists have identified an ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan as belonging to Denisovans, an enigmatic group of early human ancestors. This finding expands the known range of Denisovans beyond Siberia and Tibet, suggesting they were capable of adapting to diverse habitats. The jawbone, dated to the Pleistocene era, was analyzed using protein sequencing due to the impossibility of extracting ancient DNA. While some researchers urge caution before definitively labeling the fossil as Denisovan, the discovery contributes to the understanding of early human interactions and the genetic legacy of Denisovans in modern populations.</p>

Iran's leverage lies in its advancements in uranium enrichment and missile technology, while the U.S. holds options like sanctions and potential military action. Trump has threatened to "bomb" Iran if talks fail, with some questioning the timeline given expiring JCPOA-era sanctions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK economy grew by 0.5% in February, exceeding economists' predictions of 0.1%, driven by a strong performance in the services sector and a boost in manufacturing and production. However, analysts caution that this growth may be short-lived due to the impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported to the US. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the encouraging sign but emphasized the need for further action to kickstart economic growth and secure a trade deal with the US. A 3D printing company in Warwickshire is reconsidering its expansion plans due to domestic factors like changes to National Insurance contributions and the minimum wage.</p>

            <p>Despite rising tensions between the U.S. and both China and the European Union due to President Trump's tariffs, analysts believe a close alliance between China and the EU is unlikely. Economic competition, particularly in the automotive and clean tech sectors, and fundamental differences regarding human rights and China's support for Russia pose significant hurdles. While China may seek to exploit loosening U.S.-EU ties, existing trade disputes and mistrust in areas like intellectual property and technological surveillance will limit deeper engagement. The EU has imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles while China has launched anti-dumping probes into EU exports of pork and brandy.</p>

Unlike the NBA, NFL, and NHL, MLB lacks a salary cap, resulting in lower EBITDA margins.

While this may enforce a stalemate, Trump could escalate by invoking non-tariff measures, potentially leading to more dangerous geopolitical escalations. Even with a truce, trust between the two countries remains low, making a return to negotiations uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

Scientists are working to breed sunflower sea stars in captivity, with the goal of eventually releasing them into the wild to control urchin populations that devour kelp. The lack of genetic diversity among the starfish is a key challenge, but researchers are transferring animals from Alaska to California to help diversify the population. If successful, the reintroduction of sunflower stars could revive kelp forests, which are vital for carbon sequestration and marine life.</p>

            <p>California Sen. Alex Padilla is pushing for his Fix Our Forests Act to be signed into law, aiming to overhaul forest management and prevent wildfires. The bipartisan bill would create a wildfire intelligence center, streamline wildfire risk reduction, and ramp up research into mitigation technologies. While some environmental groups oppose the measure, citing concerns about endangered species protections, Padilla argues that his bill addresses these issues. The legislation has garnered support from California leaders, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, who points to his own efforts to speed up rebuilding after the L.A. fires.</p>

Mothersbaugh, who has created thousands of pieces of art, has been hesitant to sell his work but was encouraged by his family to share it with the public. His art, like Devo's music, is often endearingly odd and reflects his perspective as a "social scientist."</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's abrupt reversal and then re-implementation of tariffs has created chaos in the international trade system and raised doubts about the economic rationale behind his policies. Theories range from stock manipulation to advisors finally convincing Trump of the economic damage, but there is no clear explanation for his actions. Experts argue that Trump's policies will ultimately be most damaging to the U.S. economy, as the U.S. relies on China for vital goods that cannot be easily replaced. The result could be stagflation, with higher prices and a shrinking economy.</p>

            <p>As protest movements gain momentum, it's crucial to assess their strategic value and potential pitfalls, avoiding the stereotypes and narratives that undermine their effectiveness. Trump exploits a class-based cultural divide, portraying protesters as privileged elites, so it's important to emphasize relatable aspects of identities and punch up at powerful economic culprits. Building organizations with structure and capacity for sustained campaigns is key to transforming episodic outrage into lasting change. The goal is to build people's movements that win a real voice for working people in determining policies that impact their lives.</p>

He is asserting an executive-branch role in governing the mechanics of a federal election that has never before been claimed by a president. The theoretical legal underpinnings of Trump’s executive order portend a near-limitless authority to use federal resources to ensure that Trump and other MAGA Republicans never lose another election.</p>
