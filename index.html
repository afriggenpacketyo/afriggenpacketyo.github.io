          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the administration's new domestic spending bill, arguing its economic growth projections are more accurate than those from the Congressional Budget Office. He dismissed concerns about its impact on the deficit and asserted that new Medicaid work requirements would encourage employment rather than cause a massive loss of coverage. Hassett also signaled that several international trade deals are close to being finalized ahead of an upcoming deadline, with the U.S. prepared to send letters to partners to accelerate negotiations.

          <p>Representative Tom Suozzi offered a sharp rebuttal to the White House's recently promoted legislative package, labeling it the "big, ugly bill." He argued that the legislation will significantly increase the national deficit, fuel inflation, and cause many Americans to lose healthcare coverage through its changes to Medicaid. While acknowledging some positive elements like border security funding, Suozzi contended that the tax cuts for the wealthy are fiscally irresponsible and will ultimately harm working-class families and the nation's economic stability.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won his first home victory at a dramatic, rain-soaked British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The race was marked by chaotic conditions and two safety car periods, which significantly influenced the outcome and shuffled the standings. Norris capitalized on a 10-second penalty given to his teammate Oscar Piastri for erratic driving during a restart, allowing him to take the lead in the final stages of the race before a massive home crowd.

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal came ashore near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday morning with sustained winds of around 50 mph. The storm is bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to the eastern Carolinas, with flood watches in effect for coastal and some inland areas. The National Hurricane Center expects Chantal, the third named storm of the season, to weaken into a tropical depression as it moves further inland and dissipate by Monday, though it could still cause localized flash flooding.</p>

          <p>An NPR producer in Gaza has documented the life-threatening journey required to obtain food from a new U.S.-supported distribution site, which the UN has called a "death trap." His harrowing account details facing Israeli military fire, armed private contractors, and desperate crowds to secure basic rations amid widespread hunger and lawlessness. The report illustrates the extreme risks Palestinians face daily, where the quest for food often ends in injury or death, with bodies of the deceased sometimes shrouded in the empty food sacks they had hoped to fill.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has declared the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," via a post on his social media platform, X. This announcement follows his public criticism of President Trump's major spending bill, which Musk has labeled a form of "debt slavery." The move appears to have garnered interest from other billionaires like Mark Cuban and Anthony Scaramucci, and it represents a significant escalation in the public feud between the tech mogul and the president, his former ally.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made in northern Peru with the unearthing of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico. Researchers believe the city served as a vital trading center, connecting coastal communities with those in the Andes and the Amazon basin. The site, which contains ceremonial temples and residential complexes, is seen as crucial for understanding the evolution of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, after it was likely impacted by major climate change events.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is handing over previously unreleased audio recordings of the 1985 torture and murder of DEA agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena to the defense team of an accused Mexican drug lord.

The release is a major development in a case that transformed the U.S. war on drugs and has long been surrounded by controversy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Statue of Liberty was originally conceived not as a symbol of immigration, but as a tribute to the end of slavery in the United States, designed to be standing on broken chains and shackles. Its meaning transformed over time, largely due to Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus," which reimagined the statue as a "mother of exiles." This new identity was solidified with the opening of the Ellis Island immigration center and later championed by President John F. Kennedy, cementing its role as a powerful beacon for immigrants worldwide.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the international response to Israel's war in Gaza is causing a dangerous collapse of the post-WWII global order. The author contends that the failure to enforce international laws, such as those preventing the bombing of hospitals or the use of starvation as a weapon, sets a perilous precedent for future conflicts. This erosion of norms is mirrored domestically in Western nations, where free speech is being curtailed for those protesting the war, creating a chilling effect on political dissent.</p>

The funding of large mosques, such as the Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania, is a key element of this approach, which experts describe as "infrastructure imperialism." This policy, which also includes investments in everything from railroads to hotels, is part of President Erdogan's broader effort to position Turkey as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire's legacy.</p>

          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has suggested that UK football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches. Arguing for a "polluter pays" approach, the commissioner questioned why organizers of large events that require a police presence do not pay for the service, which diverts resources from local communities. The proposal comes amid calls for radical police reform to better manage overstretched funding and the demands of modern policing.</p>
