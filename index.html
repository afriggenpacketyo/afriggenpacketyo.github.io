            <p>After an initial surge of optimism, United States stocks closed lower on Tuesday, reversing an earlier rally spurred by hopes of eased trade tensions. President Trump's tariff announcements last week triggered market turbulence, with the S&P 500 nearing bear market territory after falling 1.5%. Despite positive openings in Asian and European markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 319 points, and the Nasdaq fell by 2.1% as the reality of the tariffs' impact set in, highlighting ongoing trade standoffs, particularly with China.

            <p>The Dutch parliament has voted to ban the purchase and use of fireworks by the public, but the ban will not take effect until after New Year's Eve 2026. A majority of MPs supported the ban, citing the scale of injuries and damage caused by fireworks in recent years. The delay is due to concerns about compensation claims from fireworks suppliers. New Year's celebrations in the Netherlands have become associated with antisocial behavior, and public support for a ban has grown.</p>

Other options include buying materials to keep the blast furnaces operational, which supply steel for almost all UK rail tracks. The government is aligned on considering steel of “huge strategic importance” and is exploring all options, including nationalisation.</p>
