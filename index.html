          <p>China is accelerating efforts to finalize an upgraded free-trade agreement, known as Cafta 3.0, with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) by the end of the year. This move aims to strengthen economic ties with its largest trading partner and diversify exports as global supply chains evolve. The agreement will expand market access in key sectors like agriculture and digital trade, while also deepening cooperation in emerging areas such as the green economy and artificial intelligence. This initiative is viewed as a strategic effort to bolster regional trade networks in response to increasing US tariffs and protectionist policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng has announced plans for the international launch of its affordable Mona series in 2026, starting with Europe next year. The Mona M03 model, priced aggressively under $17,000 in China, is expected to intensify competition with both Chinese rivals and established global automakers. CEO He Xiaopeng noted that the company's international expansion is proceeding faster than anticipated and signaled openness to acquiring other EV companies to navigate the highly competitive market. The move comes as Chinese EV makers are gaining market share in Europe while domestic price wars continue. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>

          <p>At a recent virtual summit, India urged fellow BRICS nations—Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa—to address significant trade deficits, particularly with New Delhi. The call comes as the bloc collectively opposes U.S. tariffs, which have been characterized as disruptive to the global economy. India's trade deficit with China reached a record high, and its deficit with Russia has also surged due to increased oil imports. While China and Russia view BRICS as a geopolitical alliance, India has focused on its economic aspects, pushing for smoother trade flows and solutions to the imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially entered the contest to become the next deputy leader of the Labour Party, following the recent resignation of Angela Rayner. She is the most senior party figure to declare her candidacy so far, joining backbencher Bell Ribeiro-Addy in the race. Candidates face a tight deadline to secure the necessary nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs by Thursday evening. The compressed timeline has drawn criticism from some within the party, who argue it limits broader discussion about Labour's future direction and policies.</p>

          <p>New league tables rating the performance of NHS trusts across England have been released, with specialist hospitals securing the top positions. The rankings evaluate trusts on seven metrics, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial management, sorting them into four performance categories. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables are intended to increase public transparency and accountability, with top-performing trusts gaining more autonomy.

The bond, which is denominated in yuan but issued outside mainland China, allows the company to capitalize on relatively low Chinese interest rates. This move is part of a broader trend of issuers turning to dim sum bonds as an alternative to US dollar assets. The issuance follows Baidu's second-quarter report, which showed a decline in both revenue and net profit compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

Thaksin, an influential figure in Thai politics, returned from self-imposed exile in 2023 to face corruption charges but spent only hours in a cell before being transferred to a hospital. The court found this transfer to be unlawful, a decision that comes shortly after his daughter, Paetongtarn, was removed from her role as prime minister.

The author argues that by erasing complex histories of imperialism, slavery, and civil rights struggles, these movements seek to dismantle the democratic and social progress of the 20th century.

          <p>As the UK government plans to close hotels used to house asylum seekers, tensions are rising in local communities over the use of alternative accommodations like shared houses, or HMOs. In Warrington, residents have held protests outside an asylum hotel, citing safety concerns and feelings of unfairness. Meanwhile, in nearby Wigan, a town with a high concentration of HMOs housing asylum seekers, residents report issues of intimidation and a lack of consultation. The situation highlights a complex social and political challenge, with concerns that shifting from hotels to HMOs could exacerbate community tensions and strain local resources.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Colorado Rockies 3-1 in a game where their pitching staff came close to a combined no-hitter for the second time in three days. Starter Tyler Glasnow pitched seven hitless innings before the bullpen took over, with the no-hitter finally broken up by a double in the top of the ninth. Unlike a similar situation over the weekend that ended in a loss, the Dodgers' relievers held on to secure the victory. A key two-run single from Mookie Betts in the seventh inning provided the decisive runs, keeping the Dodgers one game ahead in the National League West race.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is preparing to commission its Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a massive $5 billion hydropower project that has been a source of national pride and regional tension for over a decade. The project was funded domestically after international lenders stayed away, but its construction has been marred by reports of thousands of worker deaths. Downstream nations Egypt and Sudan continue to raise alarms that the dam poses an existential threat to their water supplies, and years of negotiations have failed to produce a water-sharing agreement. Ethiopia maintains the dam is for development and is open to further discussions.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has released documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a "birthday book" that contains a controversial page attributed to Donald Trump. The entry, under the "Friends" category, features a signed note and a drawing of a woman's body, which Trump has vehemently denied creating. The release has intensified scrutiny of Trump's past association with Epstein, with the White House calling the letter a "fake" and a "smear." The book also includes messages from other prominent figures and was reportedly compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted co-conspirator.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has launched "Operation Midway Blitz," an enhanced immigration enforcement action in Chicago, targeting what it calls "criminal illegal aliens." The move has drawn sharp criticism from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who stated they received no prior notice and accused the Trump administration of focusing on fear rather than coordinated public safety. The operation is framed by DHS as a response to sanctuary city policies, while city officials have expressed opposition to "militarized immigration enforcement," citing concerns over potential human rights abuses and constitutional violations.</p>

The vacancy coincides with a recent cabinet reshuffle that many observers viewed as a shift to the right, causing unease among the party's left-wing members. The election provides an opportunity for different factions to assert their influence and could result in the selection of a constructive critic to the government. The outcome will shape the internal dynamics of the party and determine how Prime Minister Keir Starmer integrates the new deputy into his administration.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has voiced serious concern that the country could be forced to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), similar to the 1976 sterling crisis. She argued that without a credible plan for economic growth from the Labour government, the UK risks falling into a "doom loop" of rising taxes and unstable public finances. Badenoch pointed to rising government borrowing costs as a worrying indicator and offered to work with Prime Minister Keir Starmer on cutting welfare spending.

The tariffs, implemented by the Trump administration, are being passed on to importers, with shipping companies like DHL adding processing fees that can significantly inflate the final cost. This has led some international retailers to suspend shipments to the U.S. The policy was intended to boost domestic manufacturing, but recent data shows a decline in manufacturing jobs since the tariffs were announced.
