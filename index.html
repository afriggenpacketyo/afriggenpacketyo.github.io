          <p>An FBI investigation led to the arrest of a Wisconsin county judge, Hannah Dugan, on obstruction charges for allegedly interfering with the arrest of an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, by immigration authorities at her courthouse. According to a sworn statement by an FBI agent, Flores-Ruiz was deported from the United States in 2013 and illegally reentered the U.S. again. Dugan is accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents and escorting Flores-Ruiz out of the courtroom through a non-public exit, hindering his apprehension, after being alerted to their presence. Dugan's arraignment is scheduled for May 15.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans, which may lead to the garnishment of federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits. Social Security recipients could see up to 15% of their monthly benefits reduced, while the entire federal tax refund can be seized. To avoid collection activity, borrowers are advised to get out of default by enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for loan rehabilitation. Borrowers can request a retroactive forbearance to cover missed payments, and a temporary forbearance until they can get enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan.</p>

          <p>Consumers are reacting to tariffs by adjusting their spending habits, with a rush to purchase cars ahead of price hikes and a general hesitancy to spend on other items. Some shoppers are delaying major purchases, such as homes and appliances, due to tariff-related uncertainty. While the auto sector has seen a surge in sales, other retailers are not experiencing widespread stock-ups, indicating a conservation mentality among consumers.</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that tariffs imposed by President Trump would disproportionately hurt the poorest U.S. households compared to the wealthiest. The analysis found that in 2026, taxes for the poorest 20% of households would rise about four times more than those in the top 1% due to the tariffs. Economists analyze the financial impact of policy relative to household income because it illustrates how their disposable income — and quality of life — are impacted.</p>
