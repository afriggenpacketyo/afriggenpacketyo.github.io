          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously blocked Mexico's lawsuit against major U.S. gun manufacturers, citing a federal law that shields them from civil suits. Mexico argued that gunmakers knowingly aided the unlawful sale of firearms to straw purchasers, who then trafficked them to drug cartels. The court stated that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gunmakers criminally aided retail dealers' unlawful sale of weapons to Mexican traffickers. Justice Elena Kagan delivered the opinion, stating that Congress enacted the law to prevent lawsuits like Mexico's. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of a heterosexual woman who alleged discrimination at her job, effectively lowering the burden of proof required for majority group members to make discrimination claims.

The justices voted unanimously, stating that anti-discrimination laws should apply equally to all Americans. The court did not consider Ames' original discrimination suit, leaving it to lower courts to evaluate the case under the clarified evidence standards. </p>

Trump has ordered consulates to intensify screening of visa applicants for anti-Semitism and “anti-American” beliefs.
