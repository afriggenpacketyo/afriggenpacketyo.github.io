          <p>The new U.S. Ambassador to Japan, George Glass, expressed optimism regarding ongoing tariff talks between the U.S. and Japan, stating that the two countries are in a "golden age" economically and friendship-wise. Glass emphasized the dedication of both nations' experts to improving economies and enhancing cooperation. Ishiba highlighted the importance of strengthening the alliance and discussing global contributions, while also acknowledging the complications arising from Trump's protectionist trade policies, including tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. Both parties agreed to enhance the alliance's deterrence and response capabilities while easing the burden on communities hosting U.S. bases. Optimism score: 70</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sister of James Lee Williams, known as The Vivienne, revealed that her family only learned about his struggle with ketamine addiction after watching Drag Race UK, with James having kept his hospitalization due to the drug a secret. The family later announced that the 32-year-old died of cardiac arrest caused by taking ketamine, after a long period of sobriety before relapsing. Chanel Williams is now campaigning to encourage open conversations about substance abuse and reclassify ketamine as a Class A drug, hoping to prevent similar tragedies and remove the stigma that may have prevented James from seeking help. She said that their family found it "extremely difficult" to talk about James's death but that they hoped "something positive could come from the complete tragedy".</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks worldwide, offering potential relief from dollar-denominated debt and import inflation, but also complicating export competitiveness. Some central banks may consider currency devaluation to boost exports, but this carries risks such as capital flight and potential retaliation from the U.S. government. While a weaker dollar provides some breathing room for interest rate cuts, central banks must carefully balance this with the need to maintain stability and avoid currency wars.

          <p>U.S. stocks and the dollar experienced a significant decline after President Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all fell sharply, reflecting investor concerns about economic recession and the impact of Trump's tariffs. The dollar index also dropped to its lowest level since 2022, while gold prices reached a record high as investors sought safe-haven assets. The market turmoil is fueled by uncertainty surrounding U.S. policymaking and the ongoing clash between the president and the Fed. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>China witnessed the establishment of nearly 2 million new private firms in the first quarter, a 7.1% increase year-on-year, signaling resilience amid the U.S.-China trade war. Private businesses, contributing over half of China's exports, are expected to be significantly impacted by increased tariffs. The State Administration for Market Regulation highlighted the "strong resilience" of the private economy, despite the challenges. However, analysts suggest that private and small businesses are more vulnerable to reciprocal tariffs compared to state-owned enterprises. Optimism score: 60</p>

Khalil, a legal permanent resident and former spokesperson for campus activists, is considered a national security risk by the federal government.

Harvard's president, Alan Garber, stated that no government should dictate what private universities can teach or whom they can admit.
