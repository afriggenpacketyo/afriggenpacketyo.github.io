        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities are a popular retirement tool offering guaranteed income, but accessing funds before the scheduled payout phase can be complex. This article outlines several strategies for withdrawing money, including taking penalty-free partial withdrawals, which many contracts allow for up to 10% of the value annually. Other options discussed are taking a loan against the annuity, surrendering the contract for its cash value, or using a 1035 exchange to move funds to a new contract with better terms. Each method comes with different tax implications and potential penalties that should be carefully considered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A resolution has been introduced by Representative Buddy Carter to remove Representative Ilhan Omar from her House committee assignments. The move comes in response to an interview where Omar criticized the past rhetoric of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated, while also calling his death "mortifying." Republican colleagues have accused her of disparaging Kirk's legacy and inciting violence, a charge Omar's office has refuted by stating her words were taken out of context and that she has repeatedly condemned the murder.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a former federal prosecutor and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, claiming her firing in July was unlawful and unconstitutional.

Comey, who worked on high-profile cases involving Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, is seeking reinstatement to her position in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed his call for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to eliminate the requirement for public companies to issue quarterly earnings reports, suggesting a shift to semi-annual disclosures instead. He argues that the change would save companies money and encourage executives to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. While supporters believe this move would ease regulatory burdens, critics express concern that it would reduce transparency and deprive investors of timely financial data needed for informed decision-making.

          <p>Many federal student loan borrowers are facing confusion and potential financial risk as their loans are transferred to new servicing companies, often without clear or direct communication. Some have discovered their accounts were placed into administrative forbearance without their request, which can lead to costly interest accrual while payments are paused. Financial experts advise affected borrowers to proactively monitor their accounts, save money for payments during the transition, and confirm their new servicer has the correct information to avoid any disruptions or negative credit impacts.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have each been sentenced to 14 years in prison for the gross negligence manslaughter of their newborn baby, Victoria. The couple had gone on the run to avoid having the child taken into care by social services, leading to a 53-day nationwide manhunt. The infant's body was eventually discovered in a shopping bag in an allotment shed in Brighton, with the court concluding she had died from hypothermia while the couple was living in a tent on the South Downs during winter.</p>

          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.21 trillion with average interest rates near 22%, consumers are warned against common mistakes that can make their balances more expensive. The article highlights that paying a bill late can trigger immediate fees and a high penalty APR, significantly increasing borrowing costs. It also emphasizes the danger of carrying a balance from month to month, as daily compounding interest can cause debt to spiral, and advises exploring options like 0% balance transfers or consolidation loans to manage and reduce debt effectively.

          <p>A detailed analysis of energy production costs indicates that renewable sources, particularly onshore wind and utility-scale solar, are the most affordable forms of new energy generation. Using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric, the report shows that even without government subsidies, the lifetime cost of producing renewable energy is lower than that of fossil fuels like natural gas and coal. While renewables require significant upfront investment, their extremely low operating and fuel costs make them more cost-competitive than traditional power sources, which are subject to volatile fuel prices.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to implement its first interest rate cut since 2024 during its upcoming meeting, signaling a potential shift in monetary policy. This move could offer some relief to consumers with variable-rate debts, such as credit card balances, although the immediate impact of a small cut would be limited. In anticipation, financial experts recommend that individuals prioritize paying down high-interest debt, lock in the current high yields on savings accounts and CDs, and work on improving their credit scores to secure more favorable loan terms.</p>

With key provisions of the deal never implemented and trust broken, analysts warn that the escalating political crisis is pushing the nation to the brink of renewed, full-scale armed conflict.</p>
