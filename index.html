          <p>A man in Washington, D.C. has been federally charged with assaulting a Customs and Border Protection officer by allegedly throwing a sandwich at him. The incident occurred amidst a verbal confrontation where the man reportedly shouted profanities at the officer. This event unfolds against a backdrop of heightened tensions regarding the increased presence of federal law enforcement in the city, a move authorized by the President citing rising crime, though local statistics show a decrease in violent crime.</p>

          <p>Stargazers across the U.S. East Coast were treated to an unusual sight of spiraling lights in the night sky. The phenomenon, initially a mystery, was later attributed to the upper stage of an Ariane 6 rocket launch from French Guiana. An astrophysicist explained that the perfect spiral shape is formed when sunlight reflects off the frozen plume of rocket fuel in the vacuum of space. A second rocket launch from Florida may have also contributed to sightings in that region.</p>

          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, faced a hostile crowd of protesters during an anti-Trump rally on Staten Island. Demonstrators, some identifying as supporters of his opponent Curtis Sliwa, shouted at Mamdani to leave the borough, characterizing it as "Trump country." Mamdani stated that while the language was saddening, it was not surprising and would not deter him from campaigning in all boroughs. The confrontation highlights the deep political divisions within New York City.</p>

          <p>Newly installed temporary river barriers have largely prevented widespread damage in Juneau, Alaska, after a glacial lake outburst flood sent record-breaking water levels down the Mendenhall River. While some streets and yards experienced minor flooding, the fortified walls protected hundreds of homes from the severe damage seen in previous years. This annual event, caused by the Mendenhall Glacier damming a meltwater basin, is reportedly intensifying due to climate change, which has warmed Alaska twice as fast as the rest of the U.S.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its decision to cancel billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid. The court's decision was based on procedural grounds, stating that the plaintiffs, a group of humanitarian nonprofits, were not eligible to bring the lawsuit. This ruling is a significant setback for global aid organizations and reinforces the administration's power to impound funds, with potential impacts on global health programs and the separation of powers.</p>

Despite positive initial reviews for its performance, recent auction results show tepid demand, with several examples failing to sell and others fetching lower-than-expected prices. This contrasts sharply with the strong resale performance of other C8 Corvette models, like the Stingray and Z06.

          <p>Air Canada has announced it will begin cancelling flights on Thursday to prepare for a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The airline stated the move is to ensure an orderly shutdown of operations if a labor agreement is not reached by the Saturday deadline set by the union. In response to the union's 72-hour strike notice, Air Canada issued a lockout notice. Key issues in the contract dispute include wages and compensation for time when planes are not in the air.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old American pilot has been detained on King George Island in Antarctica while attempting a solo flight across all seven continents. Chilean authorities have charged him with submitting a false flight plan, an accusation his legal team denies. His lawyers claim he encountered dangerous icing conditions and instrument failure, forcing him to divert and land at the Chilean base to avoid a crash. The teen, who was raising money for cancer research, has reportedly been confined to the island for over a month, leading to a severe decline in his health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study predicts that global reindeer populations could decline substantially over the next several decades due to the effects of climate change. Researchers found that North American populations, also known as caribou, are at the highest risk and could see a reduction of up to 80% by the year 2100. Using ancient DNA and computer models, the study concluded that while reindeer have survived past warming periods, the current rate of climate change poses a more severe threat. The loss could also have cascading ecological effects.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining around 2%, in contrast to a decline in some megacap technology stocks. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. Lower rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely more heavily on borrowed capital for their operations and expansion. This optimism has put the Russell 2000 on track for its best weekly performance since November. (not investment advice)</p>
