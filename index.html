          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has announced a recall for over 100,000 Paris Hilton Mini Beauty Fridges due to a significant fire and burn risk. The recall affects multiple 4-liter and 10-liter models manufactured before August 2024, which were sold at major retailers like Walmart and Amazon. Although no injuries have been reported, there have been at least 27 incidents of the units overheating and catching fire. Consumers are instructed to immediately stop using the fridges, unplug them, and visit the importer's website to register for a full refund by providing photographic evidence of the recalled unit.</p>

          <p>Before their game against Vanderbilt, the University of South Carolina's football team held a moment of silence to honor conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated last week at the age of 31. This tribute was one of several across the sports world, including honors from the NFL, a Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher, and a NASCAR driver. The university's Turning Point USA chapter president remembered Kirk for inspiring young conservatives to be unafraid to voice their beliefs. The shooting occurred during an event on the Utah Valley University campus, and authorities have since arrested a suspect in connection with the attack.</p>

          <h2>Expert Warns America Is in an Era of 'Violent Populism' Amid Rising Political Tensions</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>University of Chicago professor Robert Pape, an expert on political violence, stated that the United States has entered a watershed moment he terms the "era of violent populism." He pointed to a clear rising trend of attacks and assassination attempts against political figures from both parties, including the recent killing of Charlie Kirk. Pape's research indicates a corresponding groundswell of public support for political violence, which he attributes not just to the internet as an accelerant, but more fundamentally to the nation's demographic shift towards a white-minority democracy. He urged political leaders to condemn violence jointly to de-escalate the situation.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox revealed that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect arrested for the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is not cooperating with authorities. While the suspect has not confessed, Cox noted that those around him, including family and acquaintances, are providing information to investigators. The governor also addressed reports of the suspect joking about the shooting on the platform Discord, confirming those conversations occurred. Cox stated that initial information from the suspect's family suggests he was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology," but emphasized that more details will emerge when formal charges are filed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final stage of the prestigious Vuelta a España cycling race was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid, knocking down barriers and occupying the road. The demonstrations, which were part of ongoing protests against the participation of the Israel-Premier Tech team, led to the immediate declaration of Jonas Vingegaard as the overall winner. Despite a heavy police presence of over 1,000 officers, the situation escalated, with clashes continuing after the race was officially ended. The cancellation sparked political controversy, with Madrid's mayor blaming comments from the Spanish Prime Minister for instigating the disruptive protests.</p>

Fellow boxers like Amir Khan and Tyson Fury, along with football star Wayne Rooney, remembered Hatton as a "warrior," a "legend," and the "people's champion." Known for his aggressive fighting style and everyman appeal, Hatton won world titles in two weight classes and was one of Britain's most popular athletes. After a celebrated career that included major fights against Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao, he was candid about his struggles with mental health and addiction.</p>

          <p>As Americans' attention spans shrink, theme parks like Universal's new $7 billion Epic Universe are engineering increasingly overwhelming and expensive experiences to compete with digital entertainment. This article explores how parks are creating meticulously detailed, self-contained worlds based on popular franchises to fully immerse visitors, from true-to-scale Parisian streets to animatronic creatures. The industry is also pushing the physical limits of roller coasters to command visitors' full attention, with rides becoming taller, faster, and more intense than ever. This evolution reflects a strategy to provide tangible, awe-inspiring experiences that cannot be replicated on a smartphone.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually abused her. In an interview, Giuffre's brother stated that the prince has not faced sufficient consequences, despite being stripped of royal duties and reaching an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022. He argued that public shaming is not enough and that anyone involved, regardless of their status, should be held to the fullest extent of the law. The family also urged President Trump to release the remaining documents related to the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right CDU party is projected to finish first with around 34% of the vote. However, the results also show a significant surge for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which more than tripled its support from the last local elections in 2020 to capture approximately 16.5%. The center-left SPD saw its support decline, while the Green Party experienced a substantial drop from its 2020 peak. The election is seen as a major test for Merz's federal coalition and reflects a growing rightward shift in western Germany.</p>

          <p>The rapid adoption of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is posing a significant challenge to traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are diverting transaction volume and revenue away from credit cards. Financial institutions are also concerned because BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating what one expert calls a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile. This lack of visibility makes it difficult for lenders to accurately assess a borrower's total debt and overall financial risk.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a visit aimed at managing diplomatic tensions following an Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar. The strike, which targeted Hamas leadership, has angered key U.S. allies in the Arab world, particularly Qatar, which has been a crucial mediator in negotiations. While Rubio conveyed President Trump's displeasure with the attack, he also reaffirmed strong U.S. support for Israel's security. The visit occurs as Israel faces mounting international criticism over its military operations in Gaza and the expansion of settlements in the West Bank.</p>
