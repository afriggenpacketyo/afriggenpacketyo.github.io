          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% expansion in the first three months of the year, surpassing analysts' predictions of 0.6%, according to the Office for National Statistics. The growth was primarily fueled by the services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted that the UK's economic growth outpaced that of the US, Canada, France, Italy, and Germany during this period, indicating a robust start to the year for the British economy. The figures reflect the economic state before the US imposed tariffs in April, impacting future trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>Hopes for direct peace talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Turkey were dashed as both Putin and former US President Donald Trump decided not to attend. Zelenskyy had conditioned his participation on Putin's presence, while Trump, who had urged Ukraine to meet with Russia, also opted out. The Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, while the US will send senior envoys, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The uncertainty casts doubt on whether Zelenskyy will still attend, as Kyiv expresses skepticism about Russia's commitment to meaningful dialogue.</p>

          <p>A faint, water-stained manuscript held in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years has been identified as an original 1300 version of Magna Carta, one of only seven such documents in existence. Two British academics, David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, made the discovery while researching digital images of Harvard's collection. The document, purchased for $27.50 after World War II, is now recognized as a valuable historical artifact, especially relevant given current challenges to institutions from the state. The manuscript was authenticated through ultraviolet light and spectral imaging, techniques that enhanced undetectable aspects of the historical document.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 economies, including the United States and China, has cautioned about a potential sharp slowdown in their collective growth, attributing the risk to tariff tensions and policy uncertainty. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forecasts growth to decrease to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% in the previous year. Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit, Carlos Kuriyama, noted that the current trade environment is not conducive to investment due to tariff hikes and non-tariff barriers. Restoring confidence requires easing tensions and improving transparency in trade rules.</p>

          <p>Alabama lawmakers have passed legislation that provides additional legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans argue the bill supports law enforcement, while Democrats fear it could lead to excessive force against Black individuals. The bill allows a judge to decide if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties, and it also requires departments to collect data on use of force complaints. The governor is expected to sign the bill into law.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, boosted by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate in the coming years, according to the International Monetary Fund. While the economy grew by 3.7% in 2024, projections indicate a slowdown to 2.9% this year and 1.8% in 2026 due to anticipated weakness in export growth, particularly in pharmaceuticals. The IMF notes that Denmark is shielded from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports because most Danish drug products are neither produced nor cross its borders. The growth has been significantly driven by Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications.</p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has enacted an immigration crackdown, drawing parallels to policies implemented by the Trump administration. The decree tightens citizenship restrictions, requiring immigrants to spend two uninterrupted years in Argentina or make a significant financial investment to secure a passport. It also makes it easier to deport migrants who enter the country illegally or commit minor crimes, and mandates that all travelers to the country hold health insurance. Critics worry the new rules will challenge Argentina's tradition of openness, while the government claims it will address "chaos and abuse."</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of stockpiled rice to address near-record high prices, according to sources familiar with the matter. The government is studying the release of 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned. The move aims to combat a rice shortage caused by a poor harvest and increased consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements to encourage greater participation from rice distributors.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling approximately 274,000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs in the U.S. due to a potential defect that may cause a loss of brake function. The front brake lines in these vehicles may come into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, leading to brake fluid leaks and reduced braking ability. The recall affects models from 2022 to 2024, and Ford will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe as needed, free of charge. Impacted drivers may experience increased pedal travel and a brake warning light.</p>

Tensions escalated after a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, leading to airstrikes deep into Pakistan and retaliatory drone attacks. The Trump administration intervened to de-escalate the situation, recognizing the global implications of a nuclear war between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The average cost of private school education in the UK has increased by 22.6% in the last year, exceeding government predictions, following the introduction of VAT on fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) anticipates a decrease in private school enrollment due to the higher costs. The average termly fee for a day school in January was £7,382, which includes 20% VAT. The Treasury maintains that the fee increases are not solely attributable to VAT, while the ISC cites additional financial pressures from national insurance changes and the end of charitable business rates relief.</p>
