          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the Constitution by refusing to overturn the 2020 election results. In his acceptance speech, Pence emphasized the importance of the Constitution as a unifying force and highlighted his differences with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues like spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine. Pence recounted his duty to ensure the peaceful transfer of power, referencing the pressure from then-President Trump and the events of January 6th. The award recognizes public officials who take principled stands, regardless of potential consequences, and Pence has emerged as a Republican willing to challenge the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities. Neuroscientists have found that learning a new language reshapes neural pathways, improving information processing. A German study showed that Syrian refugees' brains rewired as they became more proficient in German, leading to increased gray matter in language processing areas and enhanced connectivity between brain regions. While multilingualism may improve memory and problem-solving, it's unclear if it directly correlates with higher intelligence; however, it definitely broadens verbal repertoire and opens doors to new cultural experiences.</p>

          <p>After eight years of weekly written dialogues, New York Times columnists Gail Collins and Bret Stephens conclude their popular feature, "The Conversation," and reflect on its impact. The columnists discuss the ease and popularity of their conversational tone, highlighting how they maintained civility and humor despite political differences. They attribute the column's success to a silent majority's desire for a different tone in political discourse, contrasting it with the outrage-driven algorithms of social media. Collins and Stephens emphasize the importance of entering conversations without the intent to "win" and striving to understand opposing viewpoints, as well as the importance of humor.</p>

          <p>Jack Goldsmith argues that Donald Trump's presidency has exposed the unchecked power of the executive branch, building on precedents set by previous administrations. Goldsmith contends that Trump's actions, such as using emergency powers and disregarding statutory restrictions, echo those of presidents like Nixon, Bush, Obama, and Biden. He suggests reforms are needed to limit presidential power, including potential constitutional amendments, to restore the balance of power with Congress. Goldsmith emphasizes that curbing the presidency requires leaders with internal checks and balances, and a public willing to elect such individuals.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed a potentially universal antivenom using antibodies extracted from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who intentionally subjected himself to hundreds of snake bites over 18 years. Friede's self-immunization process made him "hyper-immune" to snake neurotoxins, enabling researchers to isolate antibodies effective against 19 of the world's deadliest snakes. The new antivenom, proven protective in mouse trials against venom from black mambas, king cobras, and others, offers hope for a broad-spectrum antidote that could be administered in rural settings via a "venom EpiPen." The researchers plan to expand trials to treat dogs and create antivenom for viper bites.</p>

Prosecutors plan to present a 2016 hotel security video showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend Casandra Ventura as evidence.

The discussion explores how societal views on aging have evolved and how classifications can impact healthcare, research, and cultural perceptions. The conversation emphasizes the importance of promoting dignity, purpose, and opportunity for individuals of all ages and extending healthspan, the period of life spent in good health, rather than solely focusing on lifespan.</p>

          <p>Copper thieves brought Spain's high-speed train network to a standstill, stranding thousands of passengers at stations and trapping some on trains overnight. The thefts occurred in four areas within a 10-kilometer radius, with the Transport Minister calling it a "serious act of sabotage." Train services on the affected lines were suspended, and authorities are working to replace the stolen cables and reestablish service. The high-speed network, which connects most of the country's big cities, is vulnerable to cable thefts due to its vast stretches of empty countryside.</p>
