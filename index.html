          <p>SpaceX is seeking to establish Starbase as a new town in Texas, a move that could grant the company control over local infrastructure like Boca Chica Beach. Residents are concerned about restricted access to the beach, environmental damage from rocket launches, and rising living costs. SpaceX aims to launch rockets up to 25 times a year, but locals worry about the impact on their community and the environment. Texas legislators are debating bills that would give Starbase the authority to close beaches and roads, sparking concerns about public access to the shoreline. The residents of Brownsville want SpaceX to be able to continue their exploration, but not at the cost of the natural resources and lifestyle they are accustomed to.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second consecutive three-year term, marking the first time in 21 years an Australian leader has achieved this milestone. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's underperformance during the campaign. Energy policy and inflation were central issues, with both parties addressing the rising cost of living. Albanese's Labor Party also highlighted improved relations with China, leading to the removal of trade barriers that had previously impacted Australian exporters. Both parties also focused on housing affordability for first-time buyers, but ultimately the Prime Minister has won the general approval of the Australian people.</p>

          <p>Inspired by NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's public service announcement about atrial fibrillation, Warren Donaldson sought medical attention for his symptoms and doctors discovered an orange-sized mass inside his heart. Donaldson had been experiencing shortness of breath and heart palpitations, but dismissed them until seeing Abdul-Jabbar's message urging people to get checked. Doctors at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center found a rare pericardiac cyst embedded in his heart muscle, compressing his right ventricular outflow tract. Following open-heart surgery to remove the cyst and reconstruct his RVOT, Donaldson is now recovering and grateful for Abdul-Jabbar's PSA.</p>

          <p>Steep tariffs on imports from China are raising costs for wedding dresses and threatening the small shops that sell them, according to industry experts. Bridal shops and wedding dress designers are facing increased expenses due to the tariffs, with some brands adding a tariff surcharge. An estimated 90% of wedding dresses are made in China, making the industry particularly vulnerable to the tariffs. David's Bridal is speeding up efforts to move production out of China to avoid the tariffs, but smaller businesses are struggling to manage the higher costs without raising prices for brides.</p>

          <p>Japan insists on a review of all U.S. tariffs as a prerequisite for reaching a trade agreement, according to top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa. The U.S. is unwilling to back off from duties on automobiles, steel, and aluminum, while Japan hopes for the elimination of such levies. The Japanese government is particularly concerned about the 25 percent duties targeting the auto industry, which accounts for nearly 30 percent of total exports to the United States. In addition, a 25 percent tariff on certain auto parts took effect, further complicating negotiations.</p>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has expressed interest in sending "despicable human beings" far from America, and the Rwanda deal could involve financial compensation for the country. Rwanda has experience handling deportees, citing a past deal with the United Kingdom, though that deal sparked significant legal and political controversy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, part of President Trump's plan to boost domestic manufacturing, follow earlier levies on imported cars. The impact is broad because even U.S.-made cars often use foreign-produced components. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico, the tariffs are expected to raise car prices, reduce the supply of affordable vehicles, and create financial stress for suppliers. This could lead to parts shortages and unpredictable side effects in the auto industry.</p>

          <p>A new training program is teaching aides in care facilities to avoid using "elderspeak," which is communication that sounds like baby talk when addressing older adults. Elderspeak includes inappropriate endearments, plural pronouns, and exaggerated vocal qualities, stemming from ageist assumptions. Studies show that elderspeak can lead to resistance to care among residents with dementia. The CHAT training program has demonstrated success in reducing elderspeak and resistant behaviors, as well as potentially lowering the use of antipsychotic drugs.</p>

          <p>A helicopter from a China Coast Guard ship briefly violated Japanese airspace near the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, according to the Japanese Defense Ministry. The helicopter took off from one of four Chinese coast guard ships that entered Japan's territorial waters around the Senkakus. Japanese patrol vessels issued warnings, and the Air Self-Defense Force scrambled jet fighters. This incident marks the first intrusion by Chinese vessels into the area since April 7 and the 11th such incident this year, escalating tensions in the region.</p>

The US is enduring the largest measles outbreak in a quarter-century, with cases also surging in Europe. Experts attribute the rise to declining vaccination rates and the spread of misinformation about vaccines, fueled by figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The medical community emphasizes that the best way to treat measles is through prevention with the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has achieved significant gains in local elections, now controlling 10 councils and winning two mayoral races. Farage aims to implement a "Doge" system, mirroring Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, to slash council spending. Reform plans to target climate change initiatives, DEI programs, and remote work, prioritizing essential services like social care and pothole repair. The party also intends to resist central government placements of asylum seekers in Reform-led counties, but it is unclear how Reform can effect such policy given it's lack of national power.</p>
