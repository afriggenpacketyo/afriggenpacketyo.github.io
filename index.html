            <p>An opinion piece criticizes Donald Trump's administration for attempting to impose political authority over academic life by demanding viewpoint diversity at universities like Harvard. The author argues that Trump's approach, which includes mandating the hiring of faculty based on their political views, is a form of social engineering that undermines scholarly objectivity. While acknowledging the lack of viewpoint diversity in universities can be a real issue, the author suggests the proposed solutions, such as affirmative action for conservatives, risk institutionalizing political identities and making political beliefs legitimate criteria for admission and recruitment. The author advocates for encouraging the capacity of the human mind to stay on the move between different points of view.</p>

            <p>Malaysian durian growers are experiencing a surge in exports to China, driven by increasing demand for fresh, naturally ripened fruit. Improved logistics and steady supply have contributed to this growth, with suppliers expecting a 30% increase in exports this year. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, where pre-cutting methods are common, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen naturally on the tree before being harvested, a factor that appeals to Chinese consumers. This creates significant opportunities for Malaysian growers in the Chinese market.</p>

            <p>America's oldest serving astronaut, Don Pettit, returned to Earth on his 70th birthday, along with his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner. The Soyuz MS-26 space capsule made a parachute-assisted landing in Kazakhstan after a 220-day mission on the International Space Station (ISS). Pettit has now spent a total of 590 days in space during his four missions. While he is not the oldest person to fly in orbit, that record belongs to John Glenn.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that his government will not include security discussions in its trade talks with the United States, despite President Donald Trump's calls for reducing the U.S. burden in defending Japan. Ishiba emphasized that security and trade should be addressed separately. He also pledged to review Japan's automobile regulations to move forward negotiations with the United States and address the U.S. trade deficit. The Prime Minister reiterated Japan's commitment to free trade and cooperation with ASEAN and the European Union.</p>
