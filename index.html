          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash floods in central Texas has climbed to over 100, with many still missing days after the event. Search and rescue teams are navigating difficult conditions with more rain forecasted, diminishing hopes of finding more survivors. A Christian girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, suffered immense tragedy, confirming at least 27 fatalities among its campers and staff. The White House has defended against claims that budget cuts to the National Weather Service hampered the disaster response, calling the event an "act of God."</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Central Texas, which have claimed over 100 lives, were concentrated in the Texas Hill Country, particularly in Kerr County. This area, located west of Austin, experienced a rapid and extreme rise in the Guadalupe River due to intense rainfall. Maps based on National Weather Service data pinpoint the hardest-hit locations, including the town of Hunt, where Camp Mystic is situated. The camp, located directly on the riverbanks, was the site of a significant number of the fatalities.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for top Taliban leaders, including Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, for the crime against humanity of persecuting women and girls. Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed severe restrictions on females, barring them from education past age 12, most jobs, and traveling without a male chaperone. The Taliban government rejected the warrants, stating it does not recognize the ICC's authority. Human rights organizations have applauded the move as a step toward justice for victims of the Taliban's oppressive regime.</p>

          <p>An Argentinian man has become the 140th "stolen grandchild" to be identified, nearly five decades after he was born in a clandestine detention center during the country's military dictatorship. His parents, left-wing activists, were "disappeared" in 1976, and his mother gave birth while in captivity before she was killed. The activist group Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, which has long worked to identify these children, announced the discovery after a DNA test confirmed his identity. The man's older sister expressed her joy at the news, highlighting the ongoing search for an estimated 300 others who were stolen as infants.</p>

          <p>During a recent Cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump recounted a disagreement with former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, regarding the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump stated that he clashed with Milley over the decision to leave billions of dollars worth of U.S. military equipment behind. According to Trump, Milley had argued that it was cheaper to abandon the equipment than to transport it out of the country. Trump declared that this reasoning was when he "knew he was an idiot" and described the withdrawal as an embarrassing moment for the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently signed spending package includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, a move that will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry. While Medicaid reimbursements are lower than private insurance, some drugmakers have greater exposure to this market. According to analysis from Leerink Partners, companies like Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences rely more heavily on Medicaid, which accounts for 25% and 22% of their U.S. revenue, respectively. In contrast, firms like Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer have the lowest exposure, at just 4% each, indicating the financial effects of the cuts will be unevenly distributed across the sector.

          <p>A new trend dubbed "revenge saving" is emerging as Americans, particularly younger generations, adjust their financial habits based on anxious feelings about the economy. A survey found that 44% of people have engaged in "vibe-based budgeting," saving more due to worries about inflation and a potential recession. Financial experts advise against letting emotions drive financial decisions and instead recommend intentional strategies to boost savings. They suggest methods like "reverse budgeting," where savings goals are prioritized first, and using separate accounts for different objectives like emergencies and retirement to build financial security.

Turner claimed she stabbed Trussler in self-defense during a physical altercation, but the surveillance footage captured audio of a woman's voice yelling phrases like "So f****** die." Although Turner initially denied it, she later admitted to the argument. Prosecutors used this audio, along with footage from an in-home camera, to argue against her self-defense claim. A jury found Turner guilty of second-degree murder, and she was sentenced to over 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has stated that the Indian government ordered it to block 2,355 accounts within the country, including those belonging to the Reuters news agency. According to a post from X's global government affairs account, the demand from India's IT ministry required immediate action without providing justification. This incident is the latest in an ongoing legal and ideological conflict between X and the Indian government over online censorship. X sued the government in March, accusing it of unlawfully expanding its power to remove content, a move that clashes with Musk's stated commitment to free speech.</p>

          <p>Gregg Wallace has been sacked as the presenter of the BBC's 'MasterChef' following an inquiry into alleged misconduct, with 50 more people coming forward with fresh claims against him. The new allegations, which Wallace denies, include accusations of groping and indecent exposure. This follows an initial investigation where 13 people accused him of making inappropriate sexual comments. In a statement, Wallace apologized for inappropriate humor and language but denied the most serious allegations. The claims have raised new questions about safeguarding practices at the BBC and the production companies he worked for.</p>

          <p>The UK's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned that the annual cost of the state pension triple lock policy is projected to be three times higher than originally estimated by 2030. The policy, which guarantees the state pension rises by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%, is now estimated to cost £15.5 billion annually by the end of the decade. The OBR's report highlighted that the UK's public finances are in a vulnerable position, with rising government debt exacerbated by recent reversals on planned spending cuts.

          <p>The killing of a decorated police bloodhound named Bruno has caused widespread outrage in Italy and prompted a criminal investigation. Bruno, a 7-year-old dog credited with finding nine people during his career, was found dead after being fed food laced with nails. His trainer suspects the act was a targeted attack related to his work rescuing dogs from illegal fighting rings. The incident has drawn condemnation from Premier Giorgia Meloni and animal rights activists, who are pushing for justice under a new law that stiffens penalties for animal cruelty.</p>

The poll found that the U.S. is more frequently named as both the most important ally and the greatest threat compared to China. In eight countries, including Canada, Indonesia, and South Africa, the U.S. was the most commonly mentioned threat. In contrast, China was viewed as the top threat by a plurality of respondents in only three nations: the U.S., Australia, and Japan.

The proposal would allow the government, with parliamentary approval, to call up conscripts if a defense situation requires a rapid increase in armed forces personnel. The bill is seen as a compromise, aiming to make voluntary service more attractive with higher pay while establishing a mechanism for a draft in times of need.

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, conspiracy theories blaming "cloud seeding" for the disaster have circulated on social media, amplified by some political figures. However, meteorologists and atmospheric scientists have unequivocally dismissed these claims as false. Experts explain that cloud seeding can only slightly enhance rainfall from existing clouds and is physically incapable of creating a massive storm system like the one that caused the flooding. Furthermore, any seeding particles from operations conducted two days prior would have dispersed long before the catastrophic rainfall began.</p>
