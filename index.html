          <p>The Environment Secretary has announced a "water revolution" aimed at halving sewage discharges into England and Wales waterways by 2030. This initiative responds to widespread public concern over water quality, with plans including tougher penalties for water company executives. While the government rules out public ownership, it promises significant investment in infrastructure, which is expected to lead to increased consumer bills. The pledge comes ahead of a landmark Water Commission review, emphasizing accountability for future improvements.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to hold their inaugural joint army training exercise this month in southern China's Guangxi region. This marks a significant deepening of military cooperation between the two nations, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties. The exercise, themed "joint border patrol training," follows Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Vietnam, where he advocated for cooperation against "unilateral bullying" amidst escalating US tariff disputes. The drills highlight growing regional alignment and defense ties.</p>

          <p>At least 35 people have died and several remain missing after a tourist boat, the Wonder Seas, capsized in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay during a sudden storm. Most victims were Vietnamese families visiting the popular UNESCO World Heritage site. Rescue efforts were hampered by heavy rain, though a 10-year-old boy was miraculously rescued from an air pocket. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the tragic accident, with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh offering condolences.</p>

          <p>Six months into his second term, President Trump's ambitious foreign policy promises, such as quickly ending wars in Ukraine and Gaza, remain unfulfilled. Despite his belief in the "force of personality" to bend nations, challenges like Russia's continued aggression in Ukraine have tested his approach. While he has achieved some successes, such as increasing NATO defense spending and brokering regional ceasefires, these fall short of his initial, grander objectives. Foreign policy experts suggest his core principles, like viewing alliances as burdens and favoring autocrats, impede global effectiveness and foster mistrust.</p>

          <p>Linda Duffey Gwozdz was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey, in a case that became known for its unusual 'Bugs Bunny defense.' Duffey Gwozdz claimed the shooting was an accident, stemming from a game where she believed the gun was unloaded, mimicking cartoon characters. Prosecutors, however, argued it was an execution, presenting forensic evidence and inconsistencies in her story. After a hung jury in the first trial, a second, more streamlined prosecution secured a guilty verdict, leading to a sentence of 40 years to life.</p>

          <p>The iconic Blue Bird, the first car to break the 150mph barrier in 1925, is set to return to Pendine Sands in Wales for a ceremonial start-up, marking its centenary. Driven by Sir Malcolm Campbell, the 350-horsepower Sunbeam achieved an average speed of 150.766mph, catapulting him to international fame. Sir Malcolm's grandson, Don Wales, part of a family lineage of record-breakers, will be present for the event. The car, now meticulously cared for at the National Motor Museum, symbolizes a pivotal moment in automotive history and the relentless pursuit of speed.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Alarming Rate of Skipped Handwashing in Hospitals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 02:06:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the University of Surrey, in partnership with Bispebjerg hospital in Denmark, indicates that nearly one in two people using hospital toilets do not wash their hands. The 19-week study, utilizing sensors on toilet and sink pipes, found that 43.7% of flushes were not followed by handwashing, with figures peaking at 61.8% in certain weeks. This behavior, especially prevalent at the start and end of the day, directly impacts patient safety despite heightened awareness post-Covid-19. Experts advocate for more effective behavioral strategies beyond simple visual reminders to foster lasting handwashing habits.</p>

          <p>The sister of Aamir Siddiqi, a schoolboy murdered in a mistaken-identity hit 15 years ago, has made an emotional appeal to the prime suspect, Mohammed Ali Ege, to surrender. Aamir, 17, was fatally stabbed by contract killers who went to the wrong address in Cardiff. Ege, suspected of ordering the killing, was arrested in India in 2011 but escaped during extradition proceedings and is now believed to be in the Middle East. Aamir's family emphasizes that Ege is not truly free and lives a life of exile, urging him to face justice for their enduring grief.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin man, Doug Detrie, was cleared of his girlfriend Nicole Vander Heyden's murder thanks to data from his Fitbit, which corroborated his alibi. Vander Heyden was found beaten and strangled, and initial evidence pointed to Detrie. However, his Fitbit data showed minimal movement during the time of the murder, leading to his release. Subsequent DNA analysis and Google Dashboard data from another man, George Steven Burch, placed him at the crime scene, leading to his conviction. This case highlights the increasing role of high-tech devices in criminal investigations, both for incrimination and exoneration.</p>
