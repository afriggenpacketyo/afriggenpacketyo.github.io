          <p>Four survivors have withdrawn from the panel of a UK inquiry into child grooming gangs, demanding the resignation of Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips. They accuse Phillips of publicly dismissing their concerns about the inquiry's direction as "untrue," which they described as a betrayal that destroyed their trust. The controversy has created a toxic environment, leading one potential chair, Jim Gamble, to withdraw his candidacy. Despite the turmoil, the government has confirmed that Phillips will remain in her post, citing her long history as an advocate for abuse victims.</p>

          <p>A builder named Mark Killick has been found guilty of defrauding 37 victims out of more than £1.25 million for incomplete construction work across the West of England. Known for using his "charm and charisma" to lure customers, Killick has a history of similar offenses, with this being his fourth fraud conviction since 2008. The prosecution highlighted his lavish spending on luxury items, such as a £25,000 Rolex, while his business was failing. Killick is scheduled for sentencing in December and has been told to expect a lengthy prison sentence for his crimes.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced significant new sanctions targeting Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's two largest oil companies, in a major policy shift by the Trump administration. The move comes after President Trump expressed frustration that talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin were failing to advance peace negotiations in Ukraine. While the immediate economic impact is debated, the sanctions are intended to pressure Moscow by targeting its primary revenue source. The decision was welcomed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European allies, who are also increasing pressure on Russia's energy sector.</p>

          <p>The final debate for New York City's mayoral election was marked by tense exchanges and personal attacks between the three main candidates. Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani faced criticism for his perceived inexperience from independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Cuomo, in turn, was challenged over the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation as governor. Despite the acrimony, all three candidates found common ground in condemning recent immigration raids targeting street vendors in Manhattan. Polls currently show Mamdani holding a significant lead ahead of the November 4th election.</p>

          <p>Over 1,500 police agencies across the U.S. and Canada are now utilizing virtual reality (VR) technology from Axon to improve officer training in high-stress situations. The program immerses recruits in realistic scenarios involving de-escalation, mental health crises, and use-of-force decisions, allowing them to practice responses in a controlled environment. A study by PwC found that VR learners train four times faster and show a 275% increase in confidence in applying their skills compared to traditional classroom methods. This technology helps departments maximize training hours and better prepare officers for the complexities of real-world encounters.</p>

Analysts note that while real estate investment fell nearly 14% in the first three quarters, high-tech manufacturing grew by 9.6%, reflecting Beijing's strategic focus. This divergence highlights the government's view that risks in the property market have been mitigated, a perspective not shared by all market observers. Factors like falling home prices, demographic shifts, and job uncertainty continue to weigh on homebuyer sentiment, suggesting the property market's bottom is not yet in sight.

French political turmoil, including the departure of the former interior minister who championed the tougher stance, is cited as a key reason for the delay.

A potential disruption from chip supplier Nexperia, due to a dispute with its Chinese owners, and a sharp drop in China's rare-earth exports are compounding challenges for carmakers. These issues underscore a larger problem: while domestic suppliers are struggling, the supply chains for essential electric vehicle components like chips, batteries, and magnets are heavily concentrated in Asia.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's long-held policy of "strategic patience" is now seen by some as inaction, with no clear path to restart nuclear negotiations or address severe domestic turmoil. Internal criticism is slowly emerging, with officials acknowledging the limited success of past military actions and the public growing anxious over economic decline. With inflation soaring and no clear successor to the aging Supreme Leader, the nation seems trapped in a precarious state.</p>

          <p>As the Chinese Communist Party's fourth plenum concludes, an editorial in its official mouthpiece has praised the country's socialist system as a crucial anchor for economic development and global stability. The article highlights the practice of formulating five-year plans as a core strength, contrasting it with what it describes as the short-term and inconsistent policymaking of multiparty systems. It asserts that the party's unified national strategy and decisive leadership ensure that China's "economic ship sails steadily." This messaging reinforces the party's official narrative of strength and reliability as it prepares to unveil its next five-year plan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article investigates the difficulties residents face when seeking compensation from cities for property damage caused by fallen public trees. It highlights the case of a Burbank woman whose car was damaged by a dead tree, but her claim was denied by the city, which cited "Mother Nature." Since 2021, Los Angeles has paid over $18 million in such settlements, but cities often deny claims initially. Legal experts advise residents to document a tree's poor condition in writing, consult an arborist, and consider legal action, as cities can be held liable if they were previously notified of a tree's ill health and failed to act.</p>

          <p>China is closely observing the strengthening defense ties between countries like India and South Korea, viewing them as efforts to create a regional counterweight amid concerns over a potential reduction in the U.S. military presence. This is exemplified by the first-ever joint naval exercise between India and South Korea, which recently took place in the port of Busan. The exercise involved an Indian naval vessel on deployment to the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific, signaling a strategic move to enhance military cooperation. Analysts suggest these closer alliances reflect a shared concern among regional powers about maintaining security and stability in the Asia-Pacific.</p>

          <p>A four-alarm fire erupted at a General Motors design studio in Pasadena, involving hazardous materials including lithium-ion batteries and prototype vehicles. Over 100 firefighters responded to the blaze, which proved challenging to extinguish as water cannot be used on lithium-ion battery fires due to the risk of chemical reactions and explosions. At one point, a firefighter became trapped inside the smoke-filled structure and issued a mayday call but was safely rescued without injury. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and crews are expected to remain on scene overnight to manage the hazardous materials.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has not released a full list of donors, details are emerging about the private funding for a new White House ballroom, estimated to cost around $300 million. Many potential donors come from the tech and cryptocurrency sectors, including companies like Google, Microsoft, and Coinbase, some of which have benefited from lucrative government contracts or favorable policies. Donations are being managed by the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall, with Google's parent company, Alphabet, contributing $22 million as part of a legal settlement.

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the thirteenth named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center forecasts 5 to 10 inches of rain in some areas, warning of potential flash flooding and landslides. The storm is moving very slowly and is forecast to strengthen, possibly becoming a hurricane by Friday. While its long-term track remains uncertain, current projections suggest it is unlikely to have a major impact on the mainland United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that on Saturn's moon Titan, molecules that are normally incompatible can combine in the extreme cold to form co-crystals never seen before. Scientists found that non-polar molecules like methane and ethane can slip into the crystal lattice of the polar molecule hydrogen cyanide, a key component for prebiotic chemistry. This interaction contradicts the basic chemical rule that "like dissolves like," which typically prevents such substances from mixing. The discovery, made through lab experiments and computer modeling, could reshape our understanding of Titan's geology and the complex chemical processes occurring on its hydrocarbon lakes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has expanded its campaign against alleged drug traffickers by conducting its first airstrikes in the Pacific Ocean, destroying two boats and killing five people. These attacks mark a significant widening of the operation, which had previously been confined to the Caribbean Sea. The Guardian reports that the CIA is providing the bulk of the intelligence for these strikes, which the Trump administration justifies under a controversial legal theory framing cartels as terrorist organizations. This unprecedented use of lethal military force against smugglers has raised legal questions and drawn condemnation, as past administrations relied on law enforcement.</p>
