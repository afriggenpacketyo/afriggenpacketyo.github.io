          <p>President Vladimir Putin used Moscow's Victory Day celebration to showcase Russia's military capabilities and international alliances, particularly with China and North Korea, amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The parade featured new Russian-made drones and emphasized the support from the Russian population for the "special military operation." Putin asserted that "truth and justice are on our side," signaling his resolve to continue the war. Despite Western isolation, Putin's welcoming of leaders from China and Brazil aimed to demonstrate Russia's sustained global ties, contrasting with the unified support for Ukraine displayed by leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland during their joint visit to Kyiv.</p>

Police were alerted by another family member who found the couple in their bedroom after the teenager reported his discovery.

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years and likely splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The mission failed due to a rocket booster malfunction, leaving the spacecraft stranded in Earth's orbit. The article highlights the historical context of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's Venera program, which successfully sent probes to Venus.

          <p>Indian officials reported that Pakistan has been moving troops into forward areas, following attacks by Pakistan across 26 locations in India. India's Foreign Secretary, Vikram Misri, stated that these Pakistani actions are provocative and escalatory.

India's Air Force Wing Commander Vyomika Singh refuted claims of damage to India's military infrastructure from Pakistani strikes.

          <p>President Trump's stance on reducing U.S. support for European security has prompted allies to re-evaluate their defense priorities, which has in turn affected the supply of weapons to Ukraine. European nations are struggling to provide Ukraine with necessary military aid, leading Ukraine to seek continued American assistance through deals involving future revenue from natural resources. While European leaders are willing to increase weapons production, it will take time to reach the required capacity. This situation underscores the dual challenge of rearming themselves and supporting Ukraine, with limited industrial capabilities to meet both needs in the short term.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, in response to judicial challenges to immigration detentions. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller argued that the Constitution allows for such suspensions during times of "rebellion or invasion." Legal experts have questioned this interpretation, emphasizing that the power to suspend habeas corpus lies with Congress, not the president.

The international community, including the U.S. and European leaders, has called for calm, while Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. have offered to mediate. This escalation follows a recent attack on Hindu tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir, which India blames on Pakistani-backed militants, and has led to fears of further conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations.</p>

Mazzone, known for his work with the Atlanta Braves, advocates for a focus on movement, change of speeds, and location over raw power. He criticizes the strict pitch limits and reliance on computer-driven metrics, which he believes have led to more injuries and less engaging baseball. Mazzone's traditional approach, which prioritizes craft and control, stands in contrast to the modern game's obsession with maximizing pitch velocity.</p>

          <p>The remote town of Bolinas, California, is celebrating the return of its post office after being without one for over two years due to a dispute between the U.S. Postal Service and the landlord. Residents creatively campaigned for its reopening, picketing, marching, and writing letters and poems. The reopening, slated for fall 2025, is seen as a major victory, especially amid concerns about potential privatization of the Postal Service. The post office is essential for the town's elderly residents, who rely on it for mail, checks, and prescriptions.</p>

          <p>In California's "salad bowl," farmers are investing in housing for H-2A guest workers due to an aging workforce and stricter immigration enforcement. These modern housing complexes aim to alleviate the regional affordable housing crisis, but some community members are skeptical, arguing that local farmworkers are not benefiting from this development. While some see it as a win-win, others point out the need for more affordable housing for longtime farmworkers, many of whom are undocumented. The Trump administration's immigration policies have pushed growers to seek legal avenues for labor, highlighting the challenges and complexities of the agricultural workforce in California.</p>

The director of the Detroit Opera's production chose to focus on the lives of the wrongfully accused men and their journey, noting that their story is more compelling than Trump's.
