          <h2>Newsom Responds to Trump's Deployment of National Guard to Los Angeles Amid Immigration Protests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 19:55:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that he was informed that an additional 2,000 National Guard troops are being sent to Los Angeles by President Donald Trump, following an initial deployment of 2,000 troops. Newsom criticized the move as reckless and disrespectful to the troops, asserting that it is not about public safety but about satisfying Trump's ego. He noted that the initially deployed troops lacked adequate resources and were largely unused, emphasizing his disagreement with the federal intervention in local matters. Newsom views the deployment as an overreach of presidential power and a politically motivated act that undermines the state's autonomy, especially as local law enforcement could have requested support from state partners if it had been necessary. Optimism surrounding this article is low given the disagreement between the President and Governor, but the governor's remarks suggest a level of stability in his response. </p>

          <p>The North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT) and a ward manager were found guilty of health and safety failings in connection to the 2015 death of Alice Figueiredo, a mental health patient who took her own life in Goodmayes Hospital. Alice's parents spent a decade battling for the truth, selling their home twice and quitting their jobs to work full-time on the case. The jury decided that NELFT and the ward manager did not do enough to prevent Alice from killing herself. Alice's parents hope the verdicts will bring major change to psychiatric care providers around the country, urging them to improve their duty of care to patients.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The move was met with criticism from doctors groups, who argued it disrupted a transparent process that has saved lives. Kennedy's decision comes after months of criticism regarding his handling of public health agencies, including changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance and spreading myths about measles shots. The American Public Health Association denounced the action as an undemocratic coup, raising concerns about public confidence in vaccine safety and the integrity of government health processes.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Asset Management suggests that Chinese equities may not be as cheap as they appear due to weakened corporate earnings from the nationâ€™s economic slowdown. Mark Davids, co-head of Asia-Pacific equities, notes that investors need to carefully screen stocks and sectors to identify potential winners. He stated that for a re-rating to occur, there needs to be an improvement in the profitability of Chinese companies, which is challenging given the weak economy.

          <p>Families and lawyers are struggling to contact workers arrested in immigration raids in Los Angeles, describing the situation as a "kidnapping" by federal agents. The raids, which occurred in the fashion district and at a Home Depot, have sparked backlash and led to the deployment of the National Guard. Lawyers report that those detained are being held in deplorable conditions without adequate food, water, or beds, and some have been deported without proper paperwork. The ACLU held a rally demanding humane treatment and access to lawyers for all detainees, highlighting concerns over violations of due process and human rights.</p>

However, Money in the Bank faced criticism for its ladder matches and controversial outcomes, particularly regarding the winners of the briefcases. The surprise return of R-Truth, now known as Ron Killings, during the main event provided a positive moment for fans, potentially salvaging the event's overall reception, although the company's initial decision to let him go was met with immense fan backlash.</p>

          <p>Dr. Phil's presence during ICE raids in Los Angeles, alongside Trump's border advisor Tom Homan, has drawn criticism and raised questions about his role in shaping immigration policy. As neither a journalist nor an immigration expert, McGraw's involvement is seen by some as a move to normalize the raids and promote Trump's agenda. His interview with Homan and the use of his platform, Merit Street Media, to disseminate a pro-Trump message has fueled concerns about the politicization of immigration enforcement. The situation has led to discussions about the appropriateness of using entertainment figures to influence public opinion on sensitive political issues.</p>

However, the project faces opposition from groups like Stop Sizewell C, who believe it will prove costly and add to consumer bills.

European manufacturers are racing to develop their own affordable EVs, such as Renault's EV hub in France, but face challenges in competing with China's cost advantages and established supply chains.

          <p>President Trump's actions in California, including deploying the National Guard and threatening to cut federal funding, exemplify the strained relationship between the federal government and the state. The deployment of the National Guard, against the wishes of Governor Newsom, is seen as an overreach of federal power. Trump's approach is characterized as a centralization of control, contrasting with traditional conservative views on states' rights. The situation has led to increased discussions about state autonomy and the potential for further conflict between Washington and the states.</p>
