          <p>An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.0 has resulted in at least 1,109 fatalities and nearly 3,000 injuries in eastern Afghanistan. The quake, which struck near the city of Jalalabad, also destroyed approximately 8,000 homes, with the majority of deaths occurring in Kunar Province. Rescue efforts are ongoing, but responders face challenges in reaching remote villages where more victims may be trapped under rubble. This disaster adds to a series of deadly earthquakes that have recently plagued the region, compounding the country's existing humanitarian challenges.</p>

          <p>Scholars in China are calling for a more "truthful" account of World War II, challenging what they describe as Western "historical nihilism." Academics argue that Western-centric narratives often downplay the significance of the Eastern theater and China's contributions to the anti-fascist war. This push, amplified in state-run media, is part of a broader effort by Beijing to reshape global historical memory and assert the legitimacy of the post-war international order from its perspective. The debate is presented as crucial for understanding collective memory and future global peace.</p>

Now comprising 26 countries, including full members, observers, and dialogue partners, the bloc has become a major Eurasian organization addressing security, economic, and diplomatic issues. Key milestones include its official renaming and expansion in 2001 with Uzbekistan's entry and the signing of the SCO Charter in 2002.

          <p>Margin buying in mainland China's stock markets has reached a record high of 2.28 trillion yuan (US$319.2 billion), surpassing the previous peak set just before a market crash in 2015. This surge in trading with borrowed money is seen by some analysts as a sign of improved market sentiment and a liquidity-driven rally. However, it also raises concerns about potential market overheating, as leveraged investors fuel sharp rises in small-cap and technology stocks. This activity has prompted some companies to issue warnings about investment risks associated with their rapidly climbing stock prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The region is largely inaccessible to international aid due to the ongoing civil war between the Sudanese military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

          <p>Manchester United has signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens for £18.1 million, choosing him over the more experienced Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa. This decision aligns with the club's long-term "Project 150" strategy, which aims to build a title-winning team by the club's 150th anniversary in 2028. While Martinez is a proven Premier League and World Cup winner, United's data analysis highlighted Lammens' exceptional potential in key metrics like shot-stopping and distribution. The move is considered a risk due to Lammens' relative inexperience, but it reflects the club's new focus on building for the future.</p>

          <p>The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, were visible across large parts of the United Kingdom, from northern Scotland down to Norfolk and Kent. The rare spectacle was caused by a strong solar storm, resulting from a coronal mass ejection on the Sun's surface. This increased solar energy interacted with gases in Earth's atmosphere to create the vibrant display of colors. Forecasters at the Met Office Space Weather Centre suggest that the heightened solar activity could continue, potentially increasing the chances of the aurora being visible again across the entire country.</p>

          <p>The Belgian government has declared its intention to officially recognize an independent Palestinian state at the upcoming UN General Assembly. Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot also announced that "tough sanctions" would be imposed on the Israeli government, citing the "humanitarian tragedy" in Gaza and violations of international law. This move aligns Belgium with several other nations, including France, Canada, and Australia, that have recently announced similar plans. The decision aims to increase pressure on both the Israeli government and Hamas, while Israel has consistently condemned such recognitions, arguing they reward terrorism.</p>

          <p>The sport of pickleball is experiencing a significant surge in popularity in China, mirroring the trend seen in the United States. Online sales of pickleball-related equipment have increased more than six-fold compared to the previous year, reaching an average of $1.2 million per month. This growth is attributed to a broader shift toward active lifestyles, promotion by social media influencers, and a renewed interest in racquet sports. The sport's accessibility and the development of a structured tournament system under the Chinese Tennis Association are helping to fuel its rapid expansion, creating new business opportunities.</p>

          <p>Utah is grappling with a severe housing affordability crisis, prompting Governor Spencer Cox to set a goal of building 35,000 starter homes within five years. However, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started so far. The state has offered incentives like low-interest construction loans, but builders have been hesitant to participate, and lawmakers have resisted bolder zoning reforms like eliminating minimum lot sizes. Despite these challenges, some developers are embracing the initiative, creating more affordable homes for first-time buyers, though prices remain high relative to just a few years ago.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick's first game as head coach for the University of North Carolina's football team resulted in a 48-14 blowout loss at home against the TCU Horned Frogs. Despite an opening-drive touchdown that energized the home crowd, the Tar Heels were overwhelmed as TCU scored 41 unanswered points. The Horned Frogs' offense, led by quarterback Josh Hoover, effectively dismantled the North Carolina defense, while their own defense forced key turnovers, including an interception returned for a touchdown. The highly anticipated debut served as a stark introduction to the challenges Belichick faces in transitioning to college football.</p>

          <p>A research team in Beijing has designed a potential solution for washing clothes in space: a compact, detergent-free washing machine that uses mist and ozone. The device, developed at the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre, weighs 12kg and uses only 400ml of water per cycle to clean clothes. Instead of soap, it uses ultrasonic atomization to create a fine mist and ultraviolet light to generate ozone, a powerful disinfectant. This innovation addresses the long-standing challenge of laundry on long-duration space missions, where water is a scarce and precious resource.</p>

          <p>Ticks capable of transmitting Lyme disease have now been detected in all 21 counties of New Jersey, prompting a public health warning. This widespread presence means residents are at risk not only in wooded areas but also in suburban backyards and parks. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in the U.S., and its spread is linked to climate change, as warmer temperatures allow ticks to expand their territory and lengthen their active season. Health officials are urging residents to take precautions, such as using repellents and checking for ticks after being outdoors, to mitigate the risk of infection.</p>

          <p>New policies are enacting what is estimated to be one of the largest cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in its history, affecting over 40 million low-income Americans. As millions are expected to lose benefits or see them reduced, grocers are preparing for a shift in consumer behavior. While independent grocers in low-income areas fear a significant drop in sales, analysts predict that large discount retailers may benefit as consumers seek to stretch their dollars further. The changes, which include stricter work requirements, will have ripple effects on the grocery industry. (not investment advice)</p>
