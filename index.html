          <h2>Tesla Investors Urge Musk to Prioritize Automaker Over Government Role Amidst Sales Decline</h2>

          <p>Tesla's first-quarter results revealed a sales and profit dip, prompting investors to question Elon Musk's focus on his role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Investors are concerned that Musk's political activities and involvement with DOGE, which includes federal worker cuts and data access, are alienating consumers and negatively impacting Tesla's stock price. Analysts suggest that Musk's government involvement could permanently decrease Tesla demand by 15-20%. Investors are eager for reassurance that Musk will refocus his efforts on Tesla and its strategic initiatives, such as the rollout of a cheaper Model Y and a robotaxi service.

          <p>A federal judge in Denver issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the removal of migrants from Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU argued that two Venezuelan men were at risk of deportation to a prison in El Salvador, where 11 men from Colorado have already been sent. The judge's order requires that individuals subject to deportation under the AEA receive 21 days' notice, information about their right to judicial review, and access to legal counsel in a language they understand. The ruling comes after the Trump administration invoked the Act to detain or deport noncitizens deemed "dangerous."</p>

          <p>Tesla's first-quarter earnings report showed a 20% plunge in automotive revenue, falling short of Wall Street estimates, with net income plummeting by 71%. The company cited factors such as factory updates for the Model Y refresh, lower average selling prices, and sales incentives as reasons for the decline. Tesla also cautioned that trade policy and changing political sentiment could impact demand, referencing protests related to Elon Musk's support for Germany's far-right AfD party. Tesla is struggling to compete with lower-cost rivals in China and the robotaxi market, though it still plans to launch a driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, by June.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 16:32:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts warn that the Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers could contribute to an economic slowdown. Approximately 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections starting in May, potentially leading to wage garnishments and reduced consumer spending. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. economic activity, and the resumption of loan collections could further dampen consumer sentiment amid rising inflation and slowing growth. The policy clarifies the path forward for loan payments after years of uncertainty, but the timing may be unfortunate given the potential for a recession.</p>

The IMF's chief economist noted that tariffs are acting as a negative supply shock for the economy, with the projections based on data available as of April 4, including the U.S.'s "reciprocal" tariffs.

          <p>The White House reported a 95% decrease in illegal migrant apprehensions in the Swanton Sector of the northern border in March, compared to the previous year. This sector, which stretches over 300 miles, had previously been a "main hotspot" for illegal crossings. In fiscal year 2024, nearly 20,000 illegal immigrants from 97 countries were apprehended in the sector.

          <p>Sarah Palin lost her defamation case against the New York Times in a retrial, marking a second defeat for the former Republican vice-presidential candidate. The federal jury found the newspaper not liable for allegedly defaming Palin in a 2017 editorial about gun control. The case garnered attention due to its implications for free speech and the legal standard of malice, requiring the plaintiff to prove false information was published knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth. The case has been seen by Palin and other conservatives as a possible vehicle to overturn the US supreme court’s 1964 landmark New York Times v Sullivan ruling, which established the “actual malice” standard.</p>

          <p>Dallas Mavericks General Manager Nico Harrison admitted he underestimated the level of fan outrage following the trade of Luka Doncic to the Lakers. Harrison defended the trade, citing the need for improved defense, but acknowledged the unpopularity of the decision. He expressed hope that a healthy team with new additions would have quieted the criticism, but injuries prevented the envisioned starting lineup from playing together. Harrison believes that winning will ultimately repair the relationship with the fans, despite Doncic's disappointment with Harrison's public comments about the trade.</p>

          <p>Meta's online advertising business could suffer a $7 billion blow this year as President Trump's China tariffs impact retailers like Temu and Shien, potentially leading to reduced advertising spending on Facebook and Instagram. China accounts for a significant portion of Meta's revenue, and a decline in ad spending from Chinese advertisers could substantially impact the company's 2025 ad sales. Analysts warn that a broader economic recession, coupled with the U.S.-China trade dispute, could further exacerbate the situation, potentially wiping out $23 billion in ad revenue and significantly impacting earnings.

          <p>Housing construction in Los Angeles experienced a sharp decline during the first quarter of 2025, with developers pulling permits for nearly 57% fewer new homes compared to the same period last year. The drop-off is attributed to factors such as high interest rates, tariffs, economic uncertainty, and the city's transfer tax Measure ULA. The January wildfires also likely contributed to the decline by causing widespread business disruptions. A sustained pullback in housing development could worsen the city's affordability crisis and negatively impact tax revenue.</p>
