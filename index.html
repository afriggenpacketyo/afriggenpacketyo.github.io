          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, a move intended to address ongoing protests at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision to keep troops off Chicago streets. However, it allowed the Trump administration to maintain federal control over the National Guard troops already federalized. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul hailed the ruling as a victory for state and local law enforcement, emphasizing community rights.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse involved in a widely publicized incident last year where horses galloped through London streets, has been retired. The horse suffered a broken bone and serious bleeding after being spooked by construction noise. Five soldiers were also injured in the event. Quaker will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in rural Buckinghamshire, as his injuries prevented a return to ceremonial duties. This marks a positive outcome for the animal, ensuring his welfare in retirement.</p>

While animal care at the zoo will continue, beloved animal cams will be turned off. This closure underscores the widespread impact of the ongoing dispute over government funding, affecting cultural institutions and public services across the nation.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in central London for a march, just a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect in Gaza. Organized by the Palestine Coalition, demonstrators carried Palestinian flags and slogans, advocating to "stop arming Israel" and for a "free Palestine." While speakers acknowledged the ceasefire as positive, they deemed it precarious and insufficient to address the conflict's root causes. The Metropolitan Police made 14 arrests, including for breaches of public order, amidst a small counter-protest.</p>

          <h2>Charter Airline Verijet Files for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, Ceases All Flights</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 13:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Charter carrier Verijet has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, leading to the immediate cancellation of all its flights. The Vero Beach, Florida-based airline accumulated over $38.7 million in liabilities and faced numerous lawsuits following the sudden death of its founder. Chapter 7 bankruptcy signifies a move directly to liquidation, rather than restructuring. Verijet, once the 13th-largest operator of charter flights, expanded rapidly since 2020 but struggled with financial problems, including significant debts to jet card customers and lessors, leaving many travelers stranded.</p>
