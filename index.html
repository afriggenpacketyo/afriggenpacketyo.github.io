          <p>The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan have announced the formation of a rival civilian government, significantly deepening the country's 27-month civil war. Led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the new administration directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and stokes fears of a permanent national division. This move follows an agreement between paramilitary, rebel, and civilian groups to establish a secular state. The ongoing conflict has already displaced up to 13 million people and pushed large parts of the population toward famine.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. Prosecutors argued she killed him to win a bitter custody battle over their daughter, while the defense claimed it was self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The trial detailed their turbulent relationship, which included accusations of poisoning, violence, and manipulation from both sides. Benefield was ultimately sentenced to 20 years in prison, bringing a complex and tragic case to a close.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man armed with a folding knife stabbed eleven people in what authorities are describing as a random attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The incident occurred near the checkout area, leaving multiple victims in serious or critical condition. A sheriff's deputy, with assistance from citizens, apprehended the suspect within minutes of the attack beginning. Governor Gretchen Whitmer called the event a "brutal act of violence," and the FBI is providing support to the local investigation.</p>

          <h2>Psychologists Offer Advice on Managing Fan Anxiety During High-Stakes Football Matches</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists are explaining the intense physical and emotional reactions that accompany high-stakes sporting events. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, leads to increased heart rate and jitters, which are signs of deep emotional investment. Experts recommend managing this anxiety by resting, planning the day, eating well, and using physical movement to release energy, thereby reframing the nerves as part of a positive, shared experience.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently in the midst of its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures dipping below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the persistent chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold, deep ocean water to the surface. While residents and tourists are bundling up, experts caution that the region's hottest weather often arrives in September and October, so the cold spell may not last.</p>
