          <p>Anutin Charnivirakul, a conservative royalist and leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, has been elected as Thailand's new prime minister following a special parliamentary session. A 58-year-old construction firm heir with nearly three decades in politics, Anutin previously served as health minister, where he notably led the campaign to legalize cannabis. His appointment was secured with the unusual support of the opposition People's Party, which agreed to back his premiership on the condition that he dissolves parliament and calls new elections within four months. Anutin has pledged to address pressing national issues, including the cost of living and border tensions with Cambodia.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted an interim request from the Trump administration, permitting the removal of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter for the time being. The decision puts a lower court's order to reinstate Slaughter on hold while the Supreme Court considers the administration's broader appeal. This case is part of a larger legal battle over the president's authority to dismiss appointees at independent agencies, with Slaughter arguing her removal violates the Federal Trade Commission Act. The administration contends that court-ordered reinstatement infringes upon the constitutional separation of powers, creating an urgent conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is prepared to impose a "second phase" of sanctions against Russia following its largest-ever drone and missile strike on Ukraine. The attack, which involved over 800 drones, resulted in four deaths, including a mother and her baby, and damaged a government building in Kyiv. Despite expressing his displeasure with the assault, Trump stated he still plans to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the coming days to work towards a resolution. The potential for new sanctions comes as European leaders are scheduled to visit Washington to discuss strategies for ending the ongoing war, and as Ukrainian forces report recapturing a key town in Donetsk.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in New York has affirmed the $83.3 million judgment against President Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019. The court rejected Trump's claims of presidential immunity, stating he failed to provide grounds to reconsider the prior holding on this issue. The panel of judges found that Trump acted with at least reckless disregard for the truth when he denied Carroll's sexual abuse allegation, calling her a liar and stating she was not his type. The court also ruled that the jury's damage awards, which include $18.3 million in compensatory and $65 million in punitive damages, were fair and reasonable given the circumstances.</p>

          <p>Following his sixth Grand Slam title at the US Open, 22-year-old Carlos Alcaraz is being statistically compared to tennis legends, and the results are remarkable. By defeating world number one Jannik Sinner, Alcaraz demonstrated a new level of dominance, particularly with an improved and powerful serve. He has now won two Grand Slams on each of the sport's three surfaces—hard, grass, and clay—a feat achieved by only a few players in history, and at a younger age than most. The article highlights that Alcaraz took only 18 tournaments to win six slams, tying a record set by Bjorn Borg and far outpacing legends like Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic at the same age.</p>

          <p>The anonymous street artist Banksy has claimed a new artwork that appeared outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The mural portrays a judge in a traditional wig beating an unarmed, fallen protester with a gavel. Banksy authenticated the piece via an Instagram post, a common practice for the artist. While not explicitly stated, activists interpret the work as a commentary on the U.K. government's recent ban on the group Palestine Action, which led to nearly 900 arrests at a protest. The mural was quickly covered with plastic sheeting and placed under guard by security officials shortly after its discovery.</p>

Emil's journey recently caused a significant disruption when he wandered onto the main railway tracks in St. Pölten, forcing the closure of a major train line for several hours. Local authorities and animal protection groups have urged the public to give the moose space and refrain from approaching or feeding him, emphasizing that the animal does not need human interaction.</p>

          <p>A survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that American workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to an all-time low. In August, the perceived probability of securing new employment after a job loss dropped to 44.9%, the lowest point since the survey began in 2013. This data signals a significant reversal from the "Great Resignation" period, as a cooling labor market and economic uncertainty lead more employees to stay in their current roles. The report aligns with recent Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showing a dramatic slowdown in hiring and a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.3%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Congress over spending authority by asking the Supreme Court to allow it to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid. The emergency request seeks to halt a lower court order that mandates the spending of over $4 billion appropriated by Congress, which President Trump is attempting to claw back via a pocket rescission. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that forcing the executive branch to spend funds it opposes raises a "grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers." This legal battle is part of a broader administration effort to cancel federal funding that it deems misaligned with its policy goals.</p>

Duterte, the first former Asian president to be charged by the ICC, was arrested in March and is accused of orchestrating a "widespread and systematic attack" that killed thousands.

The disease is caused by a parasite in the bug's feces, which can enter the body through a bite wound or mucous membranes.

          <p>An inquest into a fatal house explosion in Swansea has heard that a next-door neighbor smelled gas for weeks leading up to the incident. Brian Davies, 68, was killed when his home on Clydach Road was destroyed in the explosion on March 13, 2023. His neighbor, Claire Bennett, who had to be rescued from her own destroyed home, testified that she had noticed a strong gas smell but attributed it to nearby maintenance work. The explosion also injured three other people and caused significant trauma to the survivors. The inquest is examining the circumstances of the explosion and Mr. Davies' death.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people have died in Italy's mountains since June, a grim statistic that experts are linking to the effects of climate change. Italy's national rescue organization reports that while some deaths were due to falls and illness, warming temperatures are creating more dangerous conditions, such as melting ice and permafrost leading to rockfalls and collapsing glaciers. The surge in mountain tourism, as people seek to escape the heat, has also led to overcrowding on trails. The phenomenon highlights the immediate dangers posed by a warming planet, which destabilizes natural environments and increases risks for outdoor recreational activities.</p>

          <p>As of September 8, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,633.31 per ounce, though this value is in constant flux. The article explains that the price of this precious metal is influenced by a variety of factors, including basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset during times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, causing its price to rise as investors seek stability. Other significant factors include interest rates, the strength of the U.S. dollar, market sentiment, and the buying or selling policies of central banks around the world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to kill Donald Trump at his golf course, began with a challenging jury selection process. Routh, who is representing himself, was barred by Judge Aileen Cannon from asking potential jurors a series of questions she deemed irrelevant and "politically charged." Routh has pleaded not guilty to five criminal charges, including attempting to kill a presidential candidate, which could result in a life sentence. Prosecutors allege he planned the attack for months, hiding in the bushes with a rifle before being spotted by a Secret Service agent and fleeing the scene.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations in Nepal against government corruption and a recent ban on social media platforms have led to violent clashes, resulting in at least 19 deaths and numerous injuries. Thousands of protesters, largely identifying as Gen Z, gathered near the parliament in Kathmandu before security forces used water cannons, batons, and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds. The government implemented the ban on platforms like Facebook and X to combat misinformation, but protesters argue it is an authoritarian move to silence dissent. The protests also reflect broader public dissatisfaction with the country's economic issues and what many perceive as rampant corruption.</p>

This article details the devastating cycle of illnesses, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and malaria, that can afflict a single child. Experts explain that diseases like pneumonia and rotavirus-induced diarrhea are leading causes of death in children under five, with outcomes worsened by malnutrition and crowded living conditions. Even if a child survives, they can suffer permanent disabilities like hearing loss, blindness, or intellectual impairment. The crisis underscores the critical role of vaccination programs, which are often the first casualties of conflict.</p>

While the dam is a source of national pride and is expected to double the country's electricity generation, it is a point of major contention for downstream nations Egypt and Sudan. Both countries have warned that the dam poses an existential threat to their water security, as the Blue Nile supplies over 80% of the Nile River's water. Despite years of failed negotiations, no agreement is in place for managing the dam's water flow, raising regional tensions.</p>

          <p>According to a communication expert, the key to being effortlessly likable is not about being overly agreeable but about making other people feel seen and valued. This is achieved through small, consistent habits that demonstrate genuine interest and respect. These habits include remembering small details about others, giving credit freely to colleagues, responding to everyone regardless of their status, and readily admitting when you are wrong. Another important practice is making time for brief, informal conversations, as these small interactions build stronger, more human connections over time. The article emphasizes that likability is a skill that can be learned rather than an innate trait.</p>

Head coach John Mitchell faces a choice between the less experienced specialist full-back Emma Sing and the versatile, more seasoned Helena Rowland. Rowland, who has 43 caps, delivered a strong performance off the bench after Kildunne's injury, and many pundits believe she is the more polished option for a high-stakes knockout match.</p>
