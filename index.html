          <p>Ukrainian drones targeted Moscow for the second consecutive night, disrupting preparations for the Victory Day celebrations, which are expected to be attended by world leaders such as Xi Jinping. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported that at least 19 Ukrainian drones were shot down en route to the capital overnight, with another four shot down near Moscow on Sunday night. Ukraine's continued strikes have already forced Russian authorities in occupied Crimea to cancel their planned Victory Day parade, citing security concerns. The article also notes that Russian long-range strikes into Ukraine continued, with 11 people injured by a drone strike in Kharkiv.</p>

          <p>DoorDash has announced its intent to acquire British food delivery firm Deliveroo for Â£2.9 billion ($3.9 billion), marking a significant overseas push for the American company. Deliveroo's board has agreed to the offer, which values the company at 180 pence a share, a 44% premium to Deliveroo's closing price on April 4. The acquisition will create a company with operations in over 40 countries and a combined population of over 1 billion people. DoorDash CEO Tony Xu expressed excitement about the prospect of the two companies working together to provide more local businesses with the tools and technology they need to thrive.</p>

          <p>The takeover of Deliveroo by DoorDash exemplifies the diverging fortunes of US and UK stock markets, as DoorDash's offer values Deliveroo at Â£2.9 billion. The article highlights that DoorDash is now worth 35 times as much as its UK counterpart, Deliveroo. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favor of US listings due to higher valuations and greater financial firepower. The article notes that UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shriveled over the last 30 years, partly due to financial regulation and the perception of better returns in US markets.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge after the fashion retailer posted a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales and reaffirmed its full-year guidance. The company reported a 2% revenue decrease on a currency-adjusted basis, slightly ahead of analysts' forecasts. Weaker sales were primarily driven by soft demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, due to uncertain consumer outlook. The group confirmed its 2025 outlook, forecasting full-year sales to be in line with last year's figures, while closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Liz Peek analyzes the potential for Kamala Harris to run for president in 2028, noting a slight buzz forming around her chances despite her previous campaign failures. The article argues that the Democratic Party lacks visible leadership and a clear message, relying heavily on opposition to Donald Trump. Peek suggests that Harris' ties to the far-left wing of the party could hinder her chances of success, as only a minority of the country identifies as liberal. The article concludes that embracing progressive policies failed to put Harris over the finish line in the last election and is unlikely to lead to a win in 2028.</p>

          <p>After 20 years, the REAL ID deadline is finally here, requiring individuals to have compliant identification for air travel and federal facilities. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, aimed to make state-issued IDs harder to counterfeit and improve verification processes. However, the law faced resistance from states citing cost, privacy concerns, and the burden of providing extra documentation. The article explores the history and challenges of implementing REAL ID, as well as the implications for undocumented individuals and the ongoing debate over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>South Korea's government investigation into human rights violations in past international adoptions has stalled, leading to criticism from adoptees and advocates. The investigation, which began in 2022, found that adoption agencies falsified or obscured documents in many cases. However, commissioners are divided over the issue of accurate documentation, and the commission decided to put the remaining cases on hold. Adoptees who petitioned for the investigation hoped the commission would help them trace their roots and validate their struggle with adoption agencies and the South Korean government.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in "foreign countries" has created uncertainty and potential damage for the Hollywood film industry. The article argues that the proposal is nonsensical and lacks clear implementation details, as the film industry is a complex, globalized service industry. The article suggests that the purpose of the proposal is to prank the liberal media rather than help the American film industry. Even if the tariffs are not implemented, the mere threat has already damaged the industry by stalling production plans and creating unease.</p>
