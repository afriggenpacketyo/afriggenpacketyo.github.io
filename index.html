The 45-year-old defeated American JJ Spaun on the third sudden-death hole after both players finished the tournament at 16-under par. This victory marks Rose's 12th PGA Tour title and makes him the first player in his 40s to win on the tour this season.

After several failed attempts to secure and tow the vehicle, the individuals abandoned the car and fled the scene.

          <p>The man suspected of the deadly shooting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention campus in Atlanta was allegedly driven by anger toward the COVID-19 vaccine. According to law enforcement sources and acquaintances, Patrick White, 30, believed the vaccine was the cause of his declining health and mental state. The targeted attack resulted in the death of DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose and caused four other people to be hospitalized for stress-related reasons. The CDC has instructed most employees to work remotely as the investigation into the targeted violence continues.</p>

          <p>A rapidly growing wildfire in western Colorado has forced the complete evacuation of a state prison and triggered warnings for residents in remote areas. The Lee fire has burned over 167 square miles in Garfield and Rio Blanco counties, making it the sixth-largest single fire in Colorado's history, with containment at only 6%. All 179 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center were safely relocated as a precautionary measure. Over a thousand firefighters are battling the blaze, which is being fueled by gusty winds and low humidity, while smoke from the fire has prompted air quality warnings.</p>

          <p>A "60 Minutes" report revisits the horrific and little-known story of the Cap Arcona, a German luxury liner turned into a floating concentration camp during World War II. In May 1945, just days before the war's end, the ship was packed with thousands of prisoners in the Baltic Sea when it was mistakenly attacked and sunk by the British Royal Air Force, who believed it was carrying fleeing Nazi officials. The friendly fire incident resulted in the deaths of approximately 7,000 prisoners. The article shares the harrowing accounts of the few survivors and examines the historical oversight that led to one of the war's deadliest maritime disasters.</p>

          <p>The broadcaster Al Jazeera has reported that four of its journalists were killed in an Israeli airstrike near the main gate of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The victims, identified as correspondents and cameramen, were in a designated press tent when it was targeted. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it struck one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas "terrorist cell" leader, a claim Al Jazeera has previously condemned as part of an "incitement campaign." The Committee to Protect Journalists notes that 186 journalists have been killed since the conflict began in October 2023.</p>

This devastation forced China to essentially rebuild from scratch after the war, a critical factor in shaping its subsequent political and social trajectory.

          <p>A man in Austria survived a dangerous ordeal after clinging to the exterior of a high-speed train that had departed a station without him. The incident occurred in Sankt Poelten when the passenger, who had reportedly stepped onto the platform for a cigarette, grabbed onto the space between two carriages as the train pulled away. Passengers noticed him banging on the windows, prompting the conductor to perform an emergency stop so the man could be brought safely on board. A railway spokesman condemned the act as incredibly irresponsible, noting such actions are often fatal.</p>

          <p>A coalition of key European leaders has issued a joint statement urging that Ukraine be directly involved in any peace negotiations between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. While welcoming diplomatic efforts to end the war, leaders from France, Germany, the U.K., and the EU stressed that a path to peace "cannot be decided without Ukraine." Their statement calls for a resolution that protects Ukraine's security interests and combines diplomacy with continued pressure on Russia. The call comes ahead of a planned summit in Alaska between the U.S. and Russian leaders to discuss a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A violent attack at a nightclub in Santa Lucía, Ecuador, has left eight people dead and three others injured, according to local authorities. The shooting occurred in the coastal province of Guayas, one of the country's most dangerous regions, when heavily armed suspects on motorcycles and in vehicles opened fire on the patrons. This incident is the latest in a wave of extreme violence that has plagued Ecuador, which authorities attribute to disputes between organized crime groups linked to transnational drug cartels. The country has seen over 4,000 homicides in the first five months of 2025.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his government's plan to take military control of Gaza City, calling it the "best way to end the war," while facing widespread condemnation at an emergency UN Security Council meeting. At the UN, nations including the U.K. and France warned the plan could violate international law and endanger the remaining hostages. Netanyahu asserted the offensive would be swift, would "free Gaza from Hamas," and denied accusations of deliberately starving Gazans, instead blaming Hamas for looting aid. The U.S. defended Israel at the meeting, stating the war could end if Hamas released the hostages.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California enacted a landmark law to protect outdoor workers from heat, farmworkers across the state continue to suffer and die from preventable heat-related illnesses. Advocates and lawmakers attribute the ongoing problem to ineffective enforcement by the state's occupational safety agency, Cal/OSHA. A recent state audit criticized the agency for inadequate inspections and outdated procedures. With climate change bringing more intense heatwaves, and many undocumented workers fearing retaliation for reporting unsafe conditions, the risks for this vulnerable population are higher than ever, highlighting a systemic failure to protect them.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators, led by the UK's chief rabbi, marched through central London on Sunday to demand the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Protesters carried Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the captives, with some expressing anger at the UK government's plan to potentially recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a "reward for Hamas." The march, organized by the Jewish direct action group Stop The Hate, aimed to keep the plight of the hostages in the public eye. The Metropolitan Police made three arrests, two for assault within the crowd and one for a racially aggravated offense.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actor James van der Beek, who was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer, has revealed that his only early warning sign was a subtle change in his bowel movements. The 48-year-old "Dawson’s Creek" star said he initially dismissed the symptom, attributing it to his coffee consumption, as he otherwise felt perfectly healthy. He is sharing his story to raise awareness, particularly since the recommended screening age has dropped to 45. Medical experts confirm that changes in bowel habits are a key red flag and that screening via colonoscopy is crucial for early detection and prevention, as many colorectal cancers develop without obvious symptoms.</p>
