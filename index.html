          <p>The granddaughter of a 79-year-old victim of the Air India Flight 171 crash expressed that she cannot find peace until the root cause is determined and those responsible are held accountable. A preliminary report found that the fuel supply to the Boeing 787's engines was cut moments after takeoff from Ahmedabad, leading to the crash that killed 260 people. Relatives of the 53 UK nationals on board described the report as an incomplete but necessary step in a painful journey toward understanding the tragedy. The final investigative report is expected in about 12 months.</p>

          <p>Despite securing progression in the Euro 2025 tournament, Germany's national team displayed alarming defensive frailties in their match against Sweden. After taking an early lead, Germany's defense collapsed, conceding three quick goals due to individual errors and a lack of coordination, ultimately losing the match. The performance has raised serious questions about team selection and tactical approach under coach Christian Wück, particularly concerning the backline and the absence of key defensive players. Wück acknowledged the need to address these issues before their quarterfinal match.</p>

          <p>A review of the book "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America" delves into the political dynamics that led to Donald Trump's return to the presidency. The book, written by journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf, argues that Trump capitalized on widespread frustration with the political system, with his legal troubles resonating with supporters who felt institutions were stacked against them. The review highlights the book's deep sourcing and its examination of "what-if" scenarios, such as Joe Biden not running for re-election, and the internal divisions within the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly stated he is considering revoking the U.S. citizenship of his long-time critic, Rosie O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland. In a social media post, Trump claimed O'Donnell is "not in the best interests of our Great Country." Legal experts note that the President has no authority to strip a native-born U.S. citizen of their citizenship, a principle affirmed by a 1967 Supreme Court ruling. This marks the latest instance of Trump threatening to use his executive power against political opponents and public figures who disagree with him.</p>

          <p>The final day of the BST Hyde Park music festival has been canceled after headlining act Jeff Lynne's ELO pulled out due to the frontman's health issues. Lynne, 77, withdrew on his doctors' advice following a "systemic infection," a similar reason for the band's recent cancellation of a Manchester concert. The band stated that Lynne was "heartbroken" but must focus on his health and rehabilitation. This performance had been hinted at as potentially being the band's final show. Festival organizers announced that all ticketholders for the canceled day will receive a full refund.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has stated that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to address concerns about extreme heat. This decision follows criticism regarding player welfare during the current Club World Cup in the U.S., where temperatures have been dangerously high. The plan will leverage covered venues in host cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver to ensure safer conditions for players.

          <p>The U.S. stock market has shown resilience, remaining near all-time highs even as the Trump administration renewed its tariff campaign against major trading partners like the EU, Mexico, and Canada. Despite a slight dip on Friday, major indices held steady, a stark contrast to the panic seen during a similar tariff blitz in April. Analysts suggest investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation tactics and are focusing more on long-term economic drivers. Key factors supporting market optimism include deregulation and the continued, largely unfettered growth of the artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>
