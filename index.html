          <p>Santos shares experienced a significant increase after receiving an $18.7 billion non-binding takeover offer from a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The offer represents a substantial premium over Santos' previous closing price, prompting the company's board to indicate its intention to recommend shareholders approve the transaction, contingent on the absence of a superior proposal. The acquisition would grant the consortium control over key Australian liquefied natural gas operations and stakes in other significant projects in Papua New Guinea. This move highlights the growing interest of Middle Eastern players in Santos as a strategic asset in the global energy market. (not investment advice)</p>

This surge provides a positive sign for China's economy, which has been grappling with deflationary pressures, and the improving consumption is attributed to trade-in programs and increased online shopping. However, industrial output slowed slightly, and property investment continued to contract, indicating ongoing challenges in the real estate sector.
