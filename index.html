        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A gunman opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas, resulting in the deaths of one person and the shooter, who took his own life. The attack, which injured two others, is being investigated by the FBI as an act of targeted violence with an ideological motive. Authorities found unspent ammunition near the suspect engraved with anti-ICE messages, prompting federal officials to describe the incident as the latest in a series of violent attacks against the agency. The shooting has heightened concerns about the safety of federal law enforcement personnel.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to Rolex's CEO questioning whether the company's invitation to former President Donald Trump to the U.S. Open was an attempt to influence U.S. tariff policy. Warren expressed concern that the Swiss watchmaker might be seeking special treatment to avoid a 39% levy on Swiss exports, drawing parallels to actions by other major corporations. The letter highlights the timing of the high-profile event, which occurred as Swiss industries face significant financial pressure from the new tariffs. The White House dismissed Warren's inquiry as a conspiracy theory.</p>

          <p>A drone launched from Yemen struck the southern Israeli town of Eilat, injuring twenty people, with two sustaining serious limb injuries. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that the drone hit the Red Sea coastal town after attempts to intercept it were made. While the Yemeni Houthi group has not officially claimed responsibility, they are widely suspected of carrying out the strike. This attack represents one of the most significant Houthi-linked incidents in terms of casualties, escalating regional tensions and prompting the Israeli military to urge residents to remain in protected areas during alerts.</p>

The album was developed while Carey was mourning the deaths of her mother and estranged sister, who passed away on the same day last year. In a recent interview, she described the period as extremely difficult but also spoke of finding healing in her final moments with her mother. The new album is described as having a classic yet fresh sound, featuring collaborations with artists like Anderson .Paak.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, two House Republicans have introduced legislation to memorialize him on a U.S. silver dollar coin. The bill, proposed by Reps. August Pfluger and Abe Hamadeh, directs the Treasury to mint 400,000 coins bearing Kirk's likeness and the phrase "well done, good and faithful servant." This is one of several recent proposals by GOP lawmakers to honor Kirk, which also include awarding congressional medals and establishing a day of remembrance. If passed, Kirk would become one of the youngest Americans ever featured on U.S. currency.</p>

          <p>The Dallas ICE field office where a deadly shooting occurred this week was also the target of a bomb threat in August, highlighting a pattern of threats against federal facilities. In the August incident, a man was arrested after claiming to have a bomb in his backpack, though it was later found to be false. Wednesday's shooting, which killed two people before the gunman took his own life, is being investigated as an act of targeted violence, with evidence showing anti-ICE messages on the shooter's ammunition. This context underscores the heightened security concerns for federal law enforcement agencies in the region.</p>

While initial data showed a decrease in rat-related complaints to the city's 311 service, her departure leaves the future of the ambitious pest control program in question.

This move represents a continued White House strategy to secure direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains, which are vital for technologies like electric vehicle batteries. The potential deal would exchange more favorable loan repayment terms for a small government equity stake to reduce taxpayer risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has imposed restrictions on Iranian officials attending the UN summit in New York, barring them from shopping at wholesale clubs and purchasing luxury goods. A State Department spokesman described the move as part of a "maximum pressure" campaign, preventing what he called a "shopping spree" while Iranians face economic hardship. The notice specifies that officials cannot visit stores like Costco and must seek permission to buy items such as watches or electronics valued at over $1,000. This action is the latest measure tied to U.S. sanctions that have severely impacted Iran's economy.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost sales of its F-150 pickup truck, Ford Motor is offering special financing rates to consumers with subprime credit scores, typically below 620. This promotion provides lower interest rates, usually reserved for buyers with higher credit ratings, to make the vehicles more affordable and reduce inventory levels. While such programs can increase sales, they also carry risks, as borrowers with lower scores are more likely to default on loans. Ford Credit stated that it only finances customers it deems creditworthy and that the move is part of a national program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered a massive and mysterious object in the early universe that could be a primordial black hole. If confirmed, this finding would challenge the standard cosmological model, which posits that stars formed before black holes. Primordial black holes are theorized to have formed from quantum fluctuations just after the Big Bang, predating any stars. While further observation is needed to verify the object's nature, its existence could force a significant revision of our understanding of how cosmic structures evolved after the universe began.</p>

Some critics argue that his broadcasting job, which grants him access to other teams' players and coaches, creates a conflict of interest and an unfair advantage for the Raiders. In his newsletter, Brady dismissed these concerns as products of paranoia and distrust, stating that he has a "moral and ethical duty" to the sport. He asserted that the intersection of his passions is not a point of conflict but a position from which he can help improve the game.</p>

An earlier deal could inject billions more into the league, potentially increasing team valuations and the player salary cap, while giving media companies extended control over the nation's most valuable television content.

The plan calls for "hypervigilant policing" and a focus on quality-of-life offenses, tactics that a 2024 DOJ report concluded led to excessive force and unlawful stops, particularly against Black residents, without reducing violent crime. Despite local opposition and concerns that the strategy will strain community trust, Tennessee's Republican governor supports the deployment, highlighting a growing tension between state and local officials.</p>

Through interviews with her family, she contrasts their childhood of shared resources, like community mango trees, with the modern, more individualistic landscape shaped by urbanization and globalization.
