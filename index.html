          <p>James Gunn's "Superman" has provided a significant boost to Warner Bros.'s DC Studios with a $122 million domestic and $217 million global opening weekend. Despite costing an estimated $225 million to produce, the film received positive reviews from critics and audiences, securing an "A-" CinemaScore. The debut, while robust, fell slightly short of some analyst predictions, potentially due to competition and political commentary surrounding the film's themes. The movie's success is considered crucial for the planned revitalization of the DC cinematic universe under its new leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The criticism stems from a Justice Department memo that did not contain the major revelations some had anticipated about Epstein's death and alleged client list. Trump urged his followers to let Bondi perform her duties and not to focus on the Epstein matter. The situation highlights a growing rift between the Justice Department and some FBI officials, as well as figures like Elon Musk and Laura Loomer.</p>

          <h2>FIFA Agrees to Implement Mandatory Rest Periods for Professional Football Players</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:32:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant development for player welfare, FIFA has agreed in principle to introduce mandatory rest periods for professional soccer players. Following discussions with the global players' union, Fifpro, the new guidelines will include a 72-hour gap between matches and a minimum three-week off-season break. This consensus was reached amid concerns over an increasingly congested fixture calendar, highlighted by the expansion of the Club World Cup. The move is seen as a crucial first step by Fifpro in its ongoing effort to protect players from burnout and injury.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders has called for the NCAA to enforce more stringent uniform standards in college football, similar to the NFL's system of fines. Speaking at Big 12 Media Days, Sanders expressed his disapproval of players wearing "biker shorts" and lacking proper knee pads, stating it shows a lack of respect for the game. He suggested that financial penalties should be implemented to ensure players adhere to traditional uniform aesthetics. Sanders also addressed questions about his health, confirming his commitment to coaching the team following a recent contract extension.</p>

          <p>Years before a deadly flood at Camp Mystic in Texas resulted in the deaths of 27 children, many of the camp's buildings were reportedly removed from official flood risk maps at the camp's request. According to records cited by US media, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had initially designated the riverside camp as a high-risk flood zone in 2011. Camp Mystic successfully appealed these designations, a decision experts now find troubling given the camp's location and the vulnerable population it served. This revelation raises serious questions about regulatory oversight and safety protocols in the lead-up to the catastrophic event.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is showcasing new security enhancements. The agency has deployed a fleet of military-grade drones to improve aerial surveillance and prevent unauthorized aircraft, a key failure during the 2024 incident. Additionally, new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to ensure direct and reliable radio communication with local law enforcement.

Cloud seeding is a weather modification technique used to increase precipitation, but scientists state it is incapable of generating the massive and sustained rainfall seen in the disaster. These experts warn that spreading such misinformation is dangerous as it erodes public trust in scientific institutions and distracts from the real, complex causes of extreme weather events.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice, under the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi, has dropped all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah doctor accused of destroying COVID-19 vaccines and administering saline shots to children. Moore had been indicted in 2023 for allegedly running a scheme to provide fraudulent vaccination cards in exchange for payment. In her statement, Bondi asserted that Moore "gave his patients a choice," a sentiment echoed by figures like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The decision reflects the Trump administration's skeptical stance on pandemic-era mandates and has been praised by critics of the vaccines.</p>

          <h2>Beijing Policy Adviser Argues Chinese Think Tanks Must Adopt a 'Self-Centred' Approach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks need to become more "self-centred" and develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He contends that many academic institutions are too reliant on Western frameworks and textbooks, limiting their ability to explain China's unique practices to the world. According to Zheng, think tanks should focus on empirical research grounded in China's own practical policy experiences. This approach, he believes, is essential for accurately analyzing the country's development and predicting its future trajectory on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) has announced that two agents working for Russia were "liquidated" after they resisted arrest on Sunday. The two individuals were suspects in the assassination of a senior Ukrainian intelligence officer, Col. Ivan Voronych, who was shot and killed in Kyiv on Thursday. According to the SBU, the agents had been tracking the colonel and were found at a hideout after a joint investigation with national police. This incident highlights the intense and deadly counter-intelligence operations being conducted by both sides amid the ongoing war, which has seen several high-profile assassinations.</p>

          <p>According to a psychologist who studies relationships, couples in the happiest partnerships intentionally practice five small habits during the work week that many others neglect. These rituals include building a brief morning routine together, sending thoughtful check-in texts during the day, and taking individual time to decompress after work before reconnecting. They also prioritize a short period of daily, distraction-free "us time" and end the day with a quick, quiet check-in to stay emotionally aligned. The article suggests these simple, intentional acts are key to maintaining intimacy and connection, even amidst the chaos of a busy schedule.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have successfully docked in geostationary orbit, potentially for a first-of-its-kind autonomous refueling mission. According to the US-based space awareness company COMSPOC, the satellites were observed in prolonged "rendezvous and proximity operations" in early July, during which they seemed to be visually merged. If confirmed as a refueling, this would represent a significant leap in China's space servicing capabilities, a feat the United States has not yet accomplished with autonomous systems. The maneuver was reportedly monitored by nearby US surveillance satellites, highlighting its geopolitical significance.</p>

She expressed frustration that the BBC can take a long time to acknowledge and investigate issues that are immediately apparent to the public.

          <p>This article examines the cultural phenomenon of the "rightwing sports bro," a new generation of influential media personalities like Pat McAfee and Dave Portnoy who have reshaped sports commentary. Their style, characterized by a rejection of "woke" culture, glorification of traditional masculinity, and a delight in controversy, aligns closely with Trump-era politics. The piece argues that these figures, who command massive audiences of young men, serve as important cultural emissaries for right-wing ideas, often couched in the ostensibly apolitical language of sports. Their success and "unsinkable" nature reflect a broader shift in public discourse.</p>

Despite this, she has remained a beloved and interesting figure, pursuing activism, writing, and now, a respected acting career with her role in "The Last Showgirl."

The father, a man who appreciates the "beautiful thing" in the world, shares observations with the narrator.
