          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites; however, Qatari air defenses intercepted the missiles, preventing casualties. President Trump acknowledged the attack as a "very weak response" and thanked Iran for providing early notice, which allowed for effective countermeasures. The Qatari government condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and international law, reserving the right to respond. The U.S. Embassy in Qatar had issued a shelter-in-place order prior to the attack, and Bahrain also temporarily closed its airspace. The overall sentiment suggests a controlled escalation with both sides signaling a desire to avoid further conflict. The US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend after more than a week of Israeli attacks on Iranian targets and Iranian strikes on Israel.</p>

          <p>Anna Repkina, a Russian woman, was found murdered in Oregon after relocating to the U.S. to marry William Hargrove, whom she met online. Hargrove was engaged to Repkina while simultaneously involved with Michelle Chavez, creating a complex love triangle. Chavez issued an ultimatum, pressuring Hargrove to choose between her and Repkina, leading to Repkina's murder. Hargrove was initially convicted of the murder, with the prosecution arguing that he was a deceptive individual who relied on lies to maintain both relationships, and it was his trash that betrayed him. However, Hargrove's murder conviction was overturned on appeal in 2023, but in June 2025, Hargrove was reconvicted and resentenced to life in prison with a possibility of parole after 25 years.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court lifted a lower court order, allowing the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to third countries without providing them the opportunity to raise fears of torture or persecution. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, with Sotomayor accusing the government of unlawful conduct and arguing the decision undermines due process. The administration has been approaching countries like Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda to accept migrants who are not their citizens. The ruling follows a lawsuit filed by migrants arguing they are entitled to notice and an opportunity to contest their removals, highlighting the ongoing legal battles over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>An experimental weight-loss drug, amycretin, developed by Novo Nordisk, has demonstrated significant weight loss in early-stage trials, with participants losing nearly 25% of their body weight. The drug replicates hunger hormones amylin and GLP-1, suppressing appetite and boosting insulin secretion, and unlike other weight-loss treatments, amycretin did not appear to cause a weight-loss plateau. Common side effects were primarily gastrointestinal symptoms, and researchers emphasize that while promising, amycretin is not a cure-all for obesity and is most effective when combined with other interventions. Novo Nordisk is planning phase 3 trials for both oral and injectable forms of the medication.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, officials and experts have offered conflicting assessments regarding the extent of the damage. While some officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, claimed Iran's nuclear ambitions were "obliterated," others cautioned that it would take time to assess the full impact. Ballistic experts have expressed skepticism, noting that the underground facility at Fordo may not have sustained significant damage due to its depth and design. The IAEA Director-General emphasized that the true extent of the damage cannot be ascertained until international inspectors are allowed access to the sites.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show harms they could face. The justices lifted a judicial order that required the government to give migrants set for deportation to so-called “third countries” a “meaningful opportunity” to tell officials they are at risk of torture at their new destination, while a legal challenge plays out. The court’s three liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented from the decision. As part of its pattern of assailing various judges who have taken actions to impede Trump policies challenged as unlawful, the White House in a statement called Murphy “a far-left activist judge”.</p>

U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant drops, reaching their lowest levels since Israel started bombing Iran on June 13. The oil market sell-off indicates that investors believe the conflict will de-escalate after President Donald Trump hit Iran over the weekend, with some analysts suggesting a "peace through strength" strategy.

The amendment, if selected and supported by a majority of MPs, could halt the welfare reform bill's passage through Parliament.

Justice Sotomayor dissented, stating that the government had taken an approach that was the opposite of caution. The government argued that the migrants had committed heinous crimes and had a final order of removal, but their native countries were unwilling to take them back.</p>

However, other officials have been more cautious, stating that a full battlefield damage assessment is needed. Images show damage to Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz, with experts pointing to large craters, ash, and blocked tunnel entrances, although the full extent of the damage remains uncertain until international inspectors gain access. Experts believe the presence of one large crater at Natanz shows that multiple MOPs were used on the facility hitting the same crater more than once, to improve the depth of penetration.</p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways will cease operations at Miami International Airport as part of a cost-cutting strategy to eliminate less profitable routes, with the final flight scheduled for September 3. The airline will continue to serve South Florida through Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport. The decision aligns with CEO Joanna Geraghty's plan to wind down underperforming routes amid softening travel demand, as the company relies on borrowed cash to maintain operations. JetBlue customers with flights booked after September 3 will be offered alternative travel options or a full refund.</p>

          <p>President Trump's strikes on Iran could have significant economic consequences for Americans, including rising oil prices and disruptions to global trade. The conflict also puts American soldiers stationed in the Middle East at risk, and Iran has warned of potential terrorist attacks within the United States. The article suggests that Trump's actions may have inadvertently made Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons more likely, as diplomacy has been undermined and the regime may see nuclear weapons as essential for its security. The article also suggests that the world may have now lost visibility into its nuclear activities (not investment advice).</p>

EMDR is a mental health therapy method that helps treat conditions resulting from past traumas by stimulating certain senses while recalling traumatic memories. During a session, a clinician will ask questions to stimulate components of a memory, including sensory information, and add in eye movements and tapping to facilitate information processing. Cyrus described her EMDR experience as watching her life like a movie, observing her past pass her by through the windows.</p>

The decision comes after a series of actions by the group, including a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, and is based on a long history of criminal damage and increased activity since 2024. The ban would make membership and support of the group illegal, punishable by up to 14 years in prison, but Cooper emphasized that the measures are specific to Palestine Action and do not affect lawful protest groups. Palestine Action stated that the real crime is the UK government's complicity in Israel's genocide and that they have instructed lawyers who are pursuing all avenues for legal challenge.</p>

          <p>Indiana Pacers' Tyrese Haliburton suffered a torn Achilles tendon during Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, impacting his team's chances of winning. Haliburton's injury is the third superstar to suffer an Achilles tear during the playoffs, following Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum. The article notes that a high-grade calf strain Haliburton suffered in Game 5 may have been a precursor to the Achilles injury. The Thunder prevailed, 103-91, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was named Finals MVP.</p>
