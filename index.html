        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China has been dropped by UK prosecutors. The Director of Public Prosecutions explained the collapse was due to the government's inability to provide evidence officially designating China as a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. This legal threshold, established in a separate case, proved insurmountable, leading to criticism and questions about the government's official stance on China and its intelligence activities.</p>

          <p>American golfer Collin Morikawa has commented that US fans "probably crossed the line" with their behavior towards the European team during the recent Ryder Cup. The event, which Europe won, was marked by verbal abuse directed at players, particularly Rory McIlroy, who was a primary target. Morikawa, who had previously encouraged a "chaotic" atmosphere, clarified that his intention was not for fans to be rude or disrespectful, highlighting a need to define appropriate conduct at such events.</p>

This strategic acquisition is part of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's vision to advance "Physical AI," aiming to merge advanced artificial intelligence with robotics. The sale provides immediate value to ABB shareholders and cancels the company's previous plans to spin off the robotics unit as a separate entity.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of people affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal, suggesting an average payout of around £700 per agreement. The scheme addresses unfair commission arrangements and inaccurate information provided to buyers for 14 million agreements between 2007 and 2024, with total lender payouts potentially reaching £8.2 billion. While the FCA aims for fair redress, some advocates question if the amount adequately reflects the financial harm suffered. (not investment advice)</p>

The aircraft was returning to its dispatch point after transporting a patient when it experienced an in-air emergency. Remarkably, no vehicles on the busy freeway were involved in the crash, a fact one official described as "mind blowing." The NTSB and FAA are investigating the cause of the incident.</p>
