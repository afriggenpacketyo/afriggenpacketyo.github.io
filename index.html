          <p>British luxury brand Burberry will rejoin the FTSE 100 index later this month, marking a return after a year's absence.  This upgrade follows CEO Joshua Schulman's successful company overhaul strategy, which has helped Burberry regain market traction.  The move is part of a quarterly reshuffling at the London Stock Exchange, with other companies entering and leaving the FTSE 100 index.  Burberry shares experienced a slight dip following the announcement.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate passed a bill that facilitates lawsuits against those who mail abortion pills into the state.  This legislation also prohibits the manufacturing of abortion drugs within Texas, representing a significant step in the ongoing debate surrounding abortion access.  The bill expands the scope of existing laws allowing private citizens to sue those who aid in abortions, potentially leading to further legal challenges.  While exceptions are made for medical emergencies, the bill is expected to significantly restrict abortion access in Texas.</p>

Authorities are investigating the cause of the derailment, while the city has halted operations of other streetcars for safety inspections.  The Gloria funicular, in operation since 1885, connected downtown Lisbon to the Bairro Alto district.</p>
