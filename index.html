          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's GOP congressional delegation are urging President Trump to reconsider the denial of federal disaster relief following severe storms in March. FEMA denied the request, citing reasons not yet disclosed. This marks the first instance of Republicans publicly challenging a FEMA denial under the Trump administration. The situation underscores ongoing tensions between states and the federal government regarding disaster relief, with Trump previously criticizing FEMA's effectiveness during a visit to North Carolina earlier this year.

The universities assert their commitment to free exchange of ideas and opinions without fear of retribution and oppose the use of research funding as a coercive tool.

          <p>Chinese state media is renewing calls for local governments and businesses to avoid unhealthy competition, warning that it damages the nation's economic competitiveness. The term 'involution' (neijuan) refers to a self-defeating cycle of excessive competition leading to low prices, low quality, and ineffective repetition. The Economic Daily urges a focus on long-term economic health over short-term gains, highlighting concerns about unsustainable incentives offered by local governments and excessive price wars among businesses, both of which hinder innovation and sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that almost half of U.S. residents live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution, with 25 million more people exposed compared to last year. The American Lung Association's report attributes the rise to climate change, which exacerbates conditions for wildfires and extreme heat, worsening ozone pollution. While the Clean Air Act has reduced emissions overall since 1970, recent analyses show pollution is increasing again, particularly in central and eastern states. The EPA is also considering rolling back environmental regulations, potentially putting decades of progress at risk.</p>

          <p>A dozen states have sued the Trump administration to halt its tariff policy, claiming it is unlawful and disruptive to the American economy. The lawsuit challenges Trump's authority to impose tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The states argue that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs and that the president's actions have upended the constitutional order. The lawsuit follows a similar action by California.</p>

          <p>The FDA is planning to phase out six petroleum-based food dyes, with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. calling on companies to replace them with natural alternatives by the end of next year. The move comes amid concerns about potential safety issues and a lack of nutritional value in the dyes. The food dye industry maintains that artificial dyes are essential for consistency and visual appeal. The FDA will be accelerating the review and approval of new natural color additives.</p>
