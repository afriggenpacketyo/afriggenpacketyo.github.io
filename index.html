          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to send troops to Portland, Oregon, to address what he describes as attacks by "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists" on federal facilities. The directive authorizes the use of "full force" if necessary to protect properties like the local ICE facility, which has been a site of frequent protests. This move has drawn sharp criticism from Oregon's governor and Portland's mayor, who stated there is no need for federal military intervention and accused the president of attempting to provoke conflict. Democratic senators for the state described the plan as authoritarian.</p>

          <p>Coastal communities in the southeastern United States are on alert for a developing storm system, Tropical Depression 9, which is expected to strengthen and make landfall early next week. In response, South Carolina's governor has declared a state of emergency, urging residents to prepare for significant wind, heavy rain, and widespread flooding. The National Hurricane Center warns the system could reach or be near hurricane intensity as it approaches the coast. This threat comes just a year after the region was devastated by Hurricane Helene, highlighting the increasing severity of storms.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Ashley Hinson is calling for a Department of Education investigation after her son's high school aired announcements about "Bisexual Plus Awareness Week." The student-run news segment explained terms like "non-monosexual identities," which Hinson labeled as inappropriate and an indoctrination of minors without parental consent. The Linn-Mar Community School District has stated it is reviewing the incident to determine if any policies were violated. Hinson argues this is an encroachment on parental rights and is seeking accountability from both the school and federal officials.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. The enduring mystery has captivated the public for decades, with the prevailing theory being that she crashed in the Pacific Ocean after running out of fuel. The order follows a request from a lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands, citing accounts that Earhart may have been captured by the Japanese on the island of Saipan. While it is unclear what classified information exists, the move aims to bring transparency to one of history's most famous unsolved cases.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. media reports, the FBI has fired a group of 15 to 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during a 2020 protest following the death of George Floyd. The termination letters allegedly cited a "lack of judgement" in their actions, which occurred amid widespread demonstrations against police brutality. The FBI Agents Association has condemned the dismissals, asserting that the agents' rights were violated. This move is seen by some as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to remove officials perceived as having left-wing sympathies from federal agencies.</p>

He specifically condemned Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as one of the "most shocking things" the party has said. As Labour trails Reform in some opinion polls, Starmer is positioning his party as a patriotic alternative to what he calls the "toxic divide and decline" offered by Nigel Farage's party.

          <p>This article analyzes how President Donald Trump's approach to controversy has reshaped the nature of political scandals in the United States. Unlike past presidents who sought to conceal misconduct, Trump often openly acknowledges or even boasts about actions that would have previously ended political careers. This brazenness, combined with the sheer volume of controversies, has led to a desensitized public and has taken the sting out of what were once devastating revelations. Observers suggest this normalization of public corruption erodes traditional standards of accountability and alters public perception of what constitutes an impeachable offense.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume fermented fruit, ingesting a daily amount of alcohol equivalent to a small bottle of beer for a human. Researchers in Uganda and the Ivory Coast analyzed popular fruit varieties and calculated the animals' intake based on their diet. This observation challenges the long-held belief that alcohol consumption is a purely cultural phenomenon for humans. The findings suggest that this behavior could have deep evolutionary roots shared with our closest primate relatives, providing a new perspective on human alcohol use.</p>

          <p>Robert Cary McNair Jr., son of the late Houston Texans founder Robert McNair, has filed a lawsuit against the National Football League for "tortious interference." The suit alleges that the NFL conspired with his brother, Cal McNair, to remove him from his role as CEO of the family business. McNair Jr. claims he was silenced after he began questioning player scandals that could have implicated the league. The lawsuit seeks over $60 million in damages, alleging the NFL's intervention was designed to prevent him from influencing NFL-related matters within the Texans organization.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, has been operating on emergency diesel generators for five consecutive days after its last external power line was severed. U.N. and Ukrainian officials have expressed grave concerns about the situation, as a sustained loss of power for cooling systems could lead to a catastrophic meltdown. This is the tenth such blackout since Russia's 2022 invasion, with Greenpeace warning that Russia may be deliberately disconnecting the plant to connect it to its own grid.

This scenario would present a dilemma for the Fed, which is mandated to maintain both price stability and full employment. The central bank could face a situation where the economy is strong, but the unemployment rate is steadily rising, complicating monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
