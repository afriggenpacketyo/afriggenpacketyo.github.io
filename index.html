          <p>A vehicle deliberately rammed into a crowd outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 people, with at least seven in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday after a fight reportedly broke out nearby. Police state the driver made a U-turn before accelerating into the line of people waiting to enter the venue. After the crash, bystanders attacked the driver, who was also shot by an unknown assailant who then fled the scene; the driver is undergoing surgery and will face charges.</p>

          <p>Germany is deepening its security and defense cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new "E3" alliance. This strategic pivot comes in response to the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty surrounding the United States' commitment to European security under President Trump. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a bilateral treaty with the UK, following a similar state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron. The E3 framework aims to bolster Europe's defense capabilities, potentially supplementing the US security guarantee with French and British nuclear deterrence.</p>

          <p>Andy Byron, the CEO of technology firm Astronomer, has resigned after a video of him embracing the company's chief people officer at a Coldplay concert went viral. The video, captured on the venue's large screen, showed the pair quickly hiding after being featured, prompting singer Chris Martin to joke about a possible affair. The company, which recently secured a $93 million investment, launched a formal investigation and placed Byron on leave. Astronomer's board accepted his resignation, stating leaders must meet a high standard of conduct.</p>

          <p>During the third round of The Open Championship, Rory McIlroy experienced a highly unusual moment on the 11th hole. While hitting his ball from a trampled-down area, his swing unearthed a second, completely hidden golf ball that was buried directly underneath his own. The unearthed ball popped into the air as McIlroy's shot traveled 117 yards into the fairway. McIlroy, who expressed his disbelief at the "weird, ridiculous" incident, went on to bogey the hole but still finished the day strong at 5-under par, moving up the leaderboard.</p>

          <p>Reports from Ukraine indicate that individuals with documented, severe mental health conditions are being drafted into the military, raising concerns about their safety and the well-being of their units. One case involves a man with a personality disorder who was deemed fit for service despite a history of psychiatric care. Ukrainian law should prevent this, but gaps in the medical database system and doctors' distrust of documentation, fearing draft evasion, can lead to such errors. Human rights officials acknowledge the problem, stating the system struggles to properly assess recruits with health issues.</p>

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler is being observed, remembering the actions of Claus von Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators. The plot, known as "Operation Valkyrie," involved planting a bomb in Hitler's military headquarters but failed to kill the dictator, leading to the swift execution of the plotters. While initially viewed as traitors, the conspirators are now honored in Germany as symbols of resistance. Historians note the plotters were conservative elites motivated by looming military defeat, and their remembrance often overshadows other resistance efforts.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have released CCTV footage connected to the murder of 15-year-old Rene Graham, who was shot and killed at a music festival in July 2024. The footage shows a suspect walking into the park where the shooting occurred and later chasing a second individual down the street while holding a gun. Graham was shot in the chest in a park in an incident that happened in front of over 200 people. A £20,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to the conviction of the person responsible for the teenager's death.</p>

          <h2>Deadly South Africa Building Collapse Was 'Entirely Preventable,' Minister Says</h2>

          <p>A government report has concluded that the collapse of a five-story apartment building in George, South Africa, which killed 34 construction workers last year, was "entirely preventable." Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated that the tragedy resulted from multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and the ignoring of structural cracks. Red flags had reportedly been raised up to a year before the collapse, with a health and safety officer even resigning in protest while work continued. The minister called for criminal accountability for the negligence.</p>

          <p>A pregnant stay-at-home mom called into "The Ramsey Show" for budgeting advice, revealing a much deeper issue within her household. She explained that although her husband earns $156,000 annually, the family struggles to afford groceries because he spends hundreds of dollars a month on tobacco and marijuana, with spending spiking to $700 recently. Host Dave Ramsey challenged the caller's framing of the problem, shifting the focus from a simple budget question to her husband's potential addiction and the need for direct intervention, highlighting the intersection of financial stress and addiction.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than initially anticipated. Muncy, who was injured in a slide at third base on July 2, has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings. Doctors told him he was extremely lucky to have avoided a more severe, season-ending injury. His return is seen as crucial for the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled significantly in his absence. Manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism that Muncy would be back "a lot sooner than anticipated."</p>

          <p>The members of Great Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m relay team were finally presented with their world championship gold medals during a ceremony at the London Diamond League meeting. The team, including Roger Black and Iwan Thomas, was upgraded from silver 28 years after the event. The original winners, the United States, were disqualified after team member Antonio Pettigrew confessed in 2008 to doping during that period. The belated ceremony allowed the athletes to receive their long-overdue recognition and hear their national anthem in front of a large home crowd.</p>

          <p>Russia launched another large-scale air assault across Ukraine, hitting ten different regions with over 340 drones and 35 missiles, killing at least three people. A woman died in Odesa after a residential building was struck, and two others were killed in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where the city of Pavlohrad was subjected to intense attacks. President Zelenskyy reported that critical infrastructure was also damaged in the Sumy region, causing power outages. While Ukraine's military intercepted many projectiles, dozens still reached their targets in Russia's intensified aerial campaign.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has escalated its support for former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro by revoking the U.S. visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges. The move targets judges involved in the prosecution of Bolsonaro for an alleged coup attempt, including the lead investigator Alexandre de Moraes. This action follows President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports. Brazilian President Lula condemned the visa revocations as "unacceptable interference" and an "affront to national sovereignty," as the diplomatic conflict between the two nations deepens.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, was registered as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) in a federal filing, a designation meant to help businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals gain preferential access to government contracts. The filing was made shortly before a funding round valued the company at $9 billion. The designation was made while Musk, the world's wealthiest person, was leading a Trump administration initiative to cut government spending. A Neuralink spokesperson stated the box was checked erroneously and has since been corrected.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has officially announced the launch of a massive dam project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in the Tibet autonomous region. The facility is expected to become the world's largest hydroelectric plant and is part of Beijing's broader strategy to harness the hydropower potential of the Tibetan Plateau. The project has raised significant concerns in downstream countries, particularly India and Bangladesh, where the river is a vital water source known as the Brahmaputra. The dam's scale has created geopolitical tensions over water rights and environmental impacts.</p>
