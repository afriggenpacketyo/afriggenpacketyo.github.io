          <h2>New US Law Overhauls Federal Student Loan System, Reducing Repayment Options</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 09:03:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law signed by President Trump, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," significantly changes the federal student loan system. It streamlines the numerous repayment plans down to just two options: a standard 10-to-25-year plan and a new income-driven plan. The law also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants for students on full scholarships and introduces new borrowing caps for Parent PLUS loans and graduate degrees. These changes, set to be phased in by 2026, have drawn both praise for simplifying a confusing system and criticism for potentially extending repayment periods for borrowers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Trust, a major UK heritage and conservation charity, has announced plans to eliminate 550 jobs, which constitutes 6% of its workforce. The organization cited significant financial strain from an inflated pay bill and tax hikes, including increased National Insurance contributions, which have added over £10 million to its annual wage costs. The cuts are part of a broader strategy to achieve £26 million in savings. The Prospect union, representing many employees, acknowledged the cost pressures but also attributed the financial difficulties to management decisions, expressing concern over the potential loss of vital institutional knowledge.</p>

          <p>Two elderly women, one in her 90s and another in her 80s, have died following an incident where a stolen BMW crashed into their care home in Sunderland, UK. The crash occurred after a police chase, causing extensive damage and forcing the evacuation of residents. Eight other residents were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Two 21-year-old men, who were initially arrested in connection with the crash, have been rearrested on suspicion of manslaughter as police investigate whether the incident contributed to the women's deaths.</p>

          <p>Despite the immense financial and logistical strain that the childcare system places on the majority of American families, a large-scale political movement demanding reform has failed to materialize. This article explores the historical, cultural, and political reasons for this inertia, tracing the issue back to a 1970s presidential veto that framed childcare as a private family matter. While newer advocacy groups are gaining traction, deep-seated ideologies, a lack of political salience, and the absence of a unified vision for a solution continue to hinder progress, leaving the US lagging behind other developed nations that have successfully reformed their systems.</p>

          <p>In response to escalating tariff threats from the United States, China is adopting a more pragmatic, long-term strategy focused on strengthening its own economic alliances. Rather than relying solely on strong rhetoric, Beijing is working to rally its trade partners by offering tangible benefits like greater market access and regional integration. Analysts suggest this approach is designed to build a more unified regional market and fortify China's position for future negotiations with Washington. The strategy aims to collectively push back against what is perceived as US protectionism while securing China's economic stability.</p>

          <p>In a surprising development, the Shanghai branch of China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has urged state-backed firms to explore the role of digital assets.

This pronouncement is particularly noteworthy given the Chinese central government's long-standing ban on most crypto-related activities.

By avoiding the necessary conflicts, compromises, and negotiations of authentic friendships, children may fail to develop empathy, resilience, and the ability to repair relationships.

          <p>A German backpacker, 26-year-old Carolina Wilga, has been found alive after being missing for 12 days in the remote Australian Outback. Her abandoned van was discovered stuck in mud in a vast nature reserve, sparking a large-scale search. A member of the public found Wilga wandering on a forest trail in what police described as a "fragile" state but without serious injuries. Police called her survival in the hostile environment, with its challenging terrain and fauna, a "remarkable story" and a "miracle."</p>

          <p>A proposal by Israel's defense minister to establish a "humanitarian city" in Rafah to contain the entire 2.1 million population of Gaza has drawn widespread condemnation. Critics, including international human rights groups, lawyers, and academics, have denounced the plan as a blueprint for a "concentration camp" and a form of ethnic cleansing. The plan, which would involve security screening and preventing Palestinians from leaving, has reportedly caused friction within Israel's own government and military. It has also alarmed Palestinian negotiators, creating a new obstacle in ceasefire talks.</p>

The tapestry, believed to have been made in England shortly after the battle, will be displayed at the British Museum starting in September 2026 while its home museum in Bayeux, France, undergoes renovations. In exchange, the British Museum will loan several of its own treasures to museums in Normandy.</p>

          <p>Hiring managers are encountering a rising number of job-seeking impostors who use deepfake technology to cheat in remote video interviews, according to a new survey. Experts warn that this trend is not only defrauding U.S. companies but also poses a potential national security threat, as some fake candidates have been tied to North Korea. In May 2024, the Justice Department alleged that over 300 U.S. firms had unknowingly hired IT workers linked to North Korea, who used stolen identities. The ease of creating convincing deepfakes is undermining the credibility of the hiring process and creating significant disruption.</p>

          <p>The International Fencing Federation (FIE) has abandoned its independent vetting process, allowing Russian athletes with direct military links to compete as neutrals. This policy change permits five-time Olympic medalist Sofya Velikaya, a major in the Russian army, to participate in the upcoming world championships, a decision that has sparked outrage in Ukraine and among some European officials. The FIE defended the move by calling the previous vetting process "burdensome and particularly costly."

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to take effect on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs and the cross-border flow of fentanyl as primary reasons for the steep levy. He warned that if Canada chooses to retaliate again, the U.S. will add that increase on top of the 35% rate. This move marks a significant escalation in trade tensions between the two closely allied nations, coming just after they had agreed to resume trade talks.</p>

Notably, Trump has refrained from criticizing Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican ally, for the handling of the crisis. This approach contrasts sharply with his public criticism of Democratic governors during other state emergencies, such as the California wildfires. The president's visit comes as he has also avoided questions about his administration's plans to potentially phase out the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</p>
