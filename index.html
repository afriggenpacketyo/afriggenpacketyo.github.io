          <p>Kemi Badenoch has responded to anonymous criticism from within the Conservative Party, labeling the critics as "cowards." The criticism appeared in an article in the Critic magazine, where anonymous Tories called for her replacement by Robert Jenrick. Badenoch stated she is not worried about criticism from those unwilling to attach their names to it, dismissing the claims as potentially unreal and lacking credibility. The anonymous article described her as unpopular and suggested the party has not come to terms with its recent defeat, while also touching on the possibility of an electoral pact with Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Walmart and other major US retailers have reportedly instructed some manufacturers in China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to resume shipments to the United States. This decision comes after a period of slowed shipments due to escalating trade tensions and tariff hikes between the US and China. According to a major exporter in Ningbo, Walmart will bear the costs of the new import duties. Other exporters in Jiangsu have also been asked to prepare for a recovery in demand, signaling a potential shift in trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is projected to win the country's federal election for the fourth consecutive time. The Liberals are expected to secure enough seats in Parliament to form a government, although it remains unclear whether they will achieve a majority. The election focused on key issues such as the country's response to US President Donald Trump's tariffs and calls to make Canada the 51st state. Carney took over the Liberal leadership after Justin Trudeau resigned, facing a strong challenge from Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "border czar," Tom Homan, defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, asserting it was not a mistake despite a previous withholding order. Homan claimed the facts surrounding the order had changed, alleging Garcia is now a terrorist, referring to the administration's designation of certain gangs, including MS-13, as terrorist organizations. Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny he is a gang member and note he has no criminal record, while Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has refused to send him back to the United States. A federal judge has ordered a deadline for the Trump administration's response regarding efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.</p>

          <p>A Chinese political scientist has cautioned Southeast Asian countries (ASEAN) to carefully weigh the risks of siding too closely with the United States in the ongoing trade war, as such alignment could lead to isolation by China and hindered growth prospects. Zheng Yongnian from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, argues that the US aims to bring manufacturing back to America, whereas China is better positioned to support ASEAN's industrialization goals. He warned that prioritizing economic and trade relations with China is crucial for ASEAN member states to avoid significant challenges.</p>

The union's contract expired at the end of March, and they expressed outrage over what they deemed an insultingly low pay offer from the county.

          <p>Four former opposition lawmakers, who were jailed in Hong Kong's national security case last year, have been released after completing their prison sentences. These are the first of 45 convicted individuals to be released from jail. The opposition members pleaded guilty and were each sentenced to four years and two months in prison in November. They were arrested under a national security law imposed by Beijing in response to pro-democracy protests, accused of conspiring to subvert state power through a plan to secure a legislative majority and reject the government budget.</p>

The community gathered for an impromptu vigil, grappling with the enormity of the tragedy. Authorities have stated that the motive for the attack did not appear to be terrorism, and the suspect, a 30-year-old man with a history of mental illness, has been charged with murder. The victims included a 5-year-old girl and her parents, as well as a school guidance counselor, prompting fund-raising efforts to support the wounded and repatriate the remains of those killed.</p>

The investigations, initiated by the Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services, stem from concerns that policies and practices for journal membership and article selection may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

          <p>President Trump has decided to provide relief to automakers by easing some of his tariffs, a move seen as a retreat from his previous get-tough policy. Importers of foreign auto parts will be able to receive reimbursement from the government for tariffs over the next two years. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the break will reward domestic manufacturers while providing a "runway" for those needing time to invest in domestic plants. The decision comes after complaints from automakers about the high tariffs, although the United Auto Workers has praised the tariffs for potentially bringing more manufacturing jobs back to the United States.</p>

Researchers attribute the increase in saltwater intrusion to drought, sea level rise, severe storms, and dredging.

In the study, 82 out of 103 participants responded so well to the drug that they no longer required an operation. While the results are promising, the study was conducted at a single hospital and focused on patients with tumors that had a "mismatch repair defect," a genetic problem that makes cells more likely to respond to immunotherapy. The findings suggest that immunotherapy could transform cancer treatment by reducing the need for invasive surgeries.</p>
