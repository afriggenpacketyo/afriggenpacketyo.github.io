          <p>Gap's stock price experienced a significant drop of over 15% after the company announced that potential tariffs could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. While Gap reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, the tariff concerns overshadowed the positive financial results. The company plans to mitigate these costs by diversifying its supply chain and reducing its reliance on China, aiming to lessen the financial impact. Despite these challenges, Gap's CEO remains optimistic, believing strong brands can succeed in any market, and the company does not anticipate raising prices for consumers.

          <p>Salesforce shares experienced a decline of approximately 3% despite the company exceeding Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter estimates and raising its full-year guidance, which was attributed to tailwinds from artificial intelligence. The company's results come shortly after the announcement of its intent to acquire Informatica for $8 billion, a move aimed at strengthening its AI offerings. Analysts attribute the stock's reaction to a slight miss in current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a minor operating margin miss. Despite this, analysts maintain a positive outlook on Salesforce's demand environment and product cycle.</p>

The optimistic outlook is attributed to a projected $7 billion in shipments of artificial intelligence systems during the quarter, which have higher profit margins than other Dell products.

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily pause a lower-court ruling that had struck down most of President Trump's tariffs. The administration argued that the trade court's ruling should be halted for the duration of the appeals process and threatened to seek "emergency relief" from the Supreme Court if the pause was not granted. The appeals court has given plaintiffs one week to respond to the administration's bid for a stay pending appeal, with the U.S. able to reply by June 9. The White House criticized the trade-court judges, accusing them of bias and threatening to undermine the credibility of the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump's tariffs are illegal, arguing that the Constitution places strict limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The court argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), which Trump relied on, does not give him unlimited tariff authority. The court also notes that a separate federal law, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's power to impose tariffs in response to trade deficits, limiting tariff rates to 15 percent and a duration of 150 days. The decision, which can be appealed, may prevent Trump from reimposing sweeping tariffs.</p>

The Federal Reserve meeting on June 18, where a potential rate cut could be discussed, also bears watching, as gold prices and interest rates often have an inverse relationship. Savvy investors may want to monitor these dates for potential buying or selling opportunities, though gold's response can be unpredictable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>MLB commissioner Rob Manfred described the decision to reinstate Pete Rose from the permanently ineligible list as "difficult," citing factors such as honoring agreements and Rose's place in baseball history. Manfred emphasized that the list is effectively a ban on working in the game and that Rose, who died in September 2024, should be considered by the Hall of Fame like other players, including "Shoeless" Joe Jackson. He also noted that Rose entered a settlement agreement with the league, which allowed the Hall of Fame to consider him, and that Commissioner Giamatti stated the settlement should not affect the Hall of Fame's decision.</p>

The nonbinding framework outlines BRICS priorities, including the reform of multilateral development banks, scaling up concessional finance, and mobilizing private capital to support climate efforts in the Global South. The document will be submitted to BRICS heads of state at their July meeting and aims to establish a shared position ahead of COP30 in Brazil.

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have declined again, making them one of the cheapest ways to borrow money. However, potential borrowers should consider the volatility of variable rates and calculate long-term affordability closely. Homeowners should be prepared for rates to potentially rise or fall unexpectedly and could refinance into a home equity loan with a fixed interest rate in the future. Understanding these factors can help homeowners make informed decisions about using their home equity effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates that 2.2 million delinquent student loan borrowers saw credit scores decrease by over 100 points between January and March 2025. This decline in credit scores can lead to reduced credit limits, higher interest rates on new loans, and difficulty securing mortgages and car loans.
