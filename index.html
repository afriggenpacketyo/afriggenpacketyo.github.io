          <h2>Ageism Concerns Arise for Chinese Tech Workers at 35</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 21:00:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many tech workers in China fear the 'curse of 35,' where they risk layoffs due to age discrimination. This term originated on social media and reflects a growing trend of companies preferring younger employees, with many job listings explicitly stating candidates should be no older than 35. This practice is fueled by a tight job market and a perception that older workers are less adaptable or demand higher salaries, leading to concerns about career longevity for those in the tech industry. The 'curse' affects various sectors, with tech being particularly susceptible due to its fast-paced and innovative nature.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum publicly declined an offer from U.S. President Donald Trump to send American troops to assist in fighting drug cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized that Mexico would never accept the presence of the U.S. Army on its territory, asserting the country's sovereignty. While open to collaboration and information sharing, she insisted on maintaining territorial integrity. The White House acknowledged ongoing cooperation with Mexico on border security, but stressed the need for further action to protect Americans from drug trafficking and violence. The Heritage Foundation suggests potential military actions, but only with Mexican coordination or as a last resort.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Democratic Party is grappling with the question of whether its leaders are too old, as some members push for a mandatory retirement age for state and local officeholders. The debate stems from concerns about leaders holding onto power past their prime, referencing instances like Dianne Feinstein's declining health while in office. A resolution calling for exploring a mandatory retirement age will be considered at the statewide party convention, sparking heated discussions about ageism and the value of experience. While the proposal faces significant hurdles, it reflects a broader national conversation about generational change in politics and the fitness of elderly leaders.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, the newly elected Prime Minister of Canada, is preparing to confront Donald Trump's protectionist policies and perceived threats to Canadian sovereignty. Carney, who previously served as a central bank governor, plans to use his economic expertise to navigate the trade war and advocate for Canadian interests. His campaign focused on unifying Canadians against external threats, drawing support from both left-leaning voters and Quebec separatists concerned about American dominance. Carney's victory was unexpected, as his Liberal Party was initially trailing significantly in the polls before Trump's imposition of tariffs and suggestions of a US-Canada merger.</p>

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel 'Conclave,' which was adapted into an Oscar-winning film, draws parallels between the process of selecting a new Pope and the TV show 'The Traitors.' Harris suggests that the dynamics of a conclave, where cardinals secretly vote to choose a new leader, share similarities with the show's premise of identifying 'traitors' among a group. He argues that the ancient, secretive ritual in the Sistine Chapel is an effective method for selecting the right person to lead an organization, a process that political parties should emulate. Harris expresses his view that women should be included in the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has started to rescind grants following President Donald Trump's announcement of a budget plan that seeks to eliminate the agency. The NEA, along with other cultural agencies, is targeted for disbandment in Trump's 2026 budget proposal. The Portland Playhouse in Oregon was among the first to announce the withdrawal of their grant, impacting their current production. Arts advocates fear that the elimination of the NEA will negatively affect small-town programs that rely on NEA funding.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a plan to reinstate over 1,000 Voice of America (VoA) employees after a previous court ruling temporarily stayed Donald Trump's executive order to dismantle the news service. The decision suggests that courts must defer to the executive branch on employment matters. The VoA was effectively shut down after Trump's order to dismantle or shrink seven agencies, including the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). While the other broadcasters are private non-profit organizations, the funding freeze has already forced them to make staffing cuts and reduce content.</p>
