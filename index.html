        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Knicks are in a tough spot, trailing the Indiana Pacers 0-2 in the Eastern Conference Finals after losing both home games. Pascal Siakam's playoff career-high 39 points led the Pacers to a 114-109 victory in Game 2. Despite Jalen Brunson's 36 points and 11 assists for the Knicks, the Pacers' strong fourth-quarter performance and Siakam's dominance proved too much to overcome. No NBA team has ever lost the first two games at home and come back to win a series in the conference finals.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be opening specialist mental health crisis centers across the country to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These centers will be open to walk-in patients, GPs, and police referrals and staffed with specialists to treat individuals experiencing acute mental distress. NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails this new model as a way to provide appropriate support sooner, potentially reducing hospital admissions. However, concerns are raised regarding funding and the complexity of separating physical and mental health needs, with calls for robust testing before national rollout.</p>

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic emphasized that EU-US trade must be guided by mutual respect. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best way forward.</p>

          <p>More and more young Japanese workers are "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study reveals that 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to admit it. This shift is attributed to a desire for more personal time, disillusionment with corporate sacrifices, and a reevaluation of priorities following the coronavirus pandemic.

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming for a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms to ease the burden of soaring rice prices on consumers. The government intends to bypass auctions to control prices and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution. This initiative follows criticism of the government's failure to curb the spike in rice prices, which has been hurting households amid rising inflation.</p>

          <p>Germany is often praised for confronting its Nazi past, but this reckoning is selective, according to this article. The author argues that Germany's vigilance against revisionism is selective at best, pointing to the Herbert Quandt Media prize, which celebrates a Nazi supporter who oversaw factories where thousands were abused and killed. This is just one example of how Germany avoids confronting the depths of societal entanglement with state violence and genocide, as well as their enduring injustice or the atrocities of their allies.</p>
