          <p>A new Senate report reveals the Secret Service denied at least 10 requests for enhanced security for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign before the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report, led by Senator Rand Paul, accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials. It highlights significant communication failures and a lack of formal processes for resource requests, which contributed to the tragic and preventable security lapse. The agency has since stated it has implemented substantive reforms.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash flooding in Central Texas has resulted in at least 129 fatalities, with search and recovery efforts ongoing for missing individuals. The National Weather Service has issued life-threatening flood warnings for multiple counties as heavy rainfall continues, with some areas seeing rivers rise over 20 feet in just a few hours. Volunteer groups, including former Navy SEALs, are assisting in the difficult search through miles of debris and destruction left by the violent waters. The situation remains critical with a continued risk of high-impact flooding.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Policy Adviser Argues for an 'Indigenous' Approach for the Nation's Think Tanks</h2>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a policy adviser in Beijing, asserts that Chinese think tanks must adopt a "self-centred" approach to effectively project the country's soft power. He argues that these institutions should focus on developing an "indigenous knowledge system" based on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic models. This shift would enable a better explanation of Chinese policies and a more accurate prediction of the nation's future trajectory. Zheng contrasts this with university research, which he suggests is often stuck in Western textbook theories.</p>

While not confirming specific details like grants, she guaranteed that announcements later in the week will focus on affordability to encourage more drivers to switch. The move comes alongside a £63 million investment in charging infrastructure, including "cross-pavement gullies" for homes without driveways. The high upfront cost of EVs compared to petrol cars is seen as a major barrier to meeting the UK's 2030 sales targets.</p>

Ahead of their first pre-season match, Slot advised his players to be true to their emotions, whether that means laughing or crying, and to handle the situation as the authentic Jota would have. The team and staff attended the funeral, paid respects at Anfield, and have retired Jota's number 20 shirt in his memory. Tributes are planned for the upcoming match to honor the late Portuguese forward.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the European Union to "defend European interests resolutely" in response to Donald Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on nearly all EU imports. Macron urged the EU to accelerate preparations for countermeasures if a deal is not reached by August 1, suggesting a readiness for a potential trade war. While other European leaders from Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands called for a more pragmatic and calm approach, the threat has sent shockwaves through the bloc. EU ambassadors are meeting to discuss strategy ahead of a trade ministers' summit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights several significant mistakes retirees make when filing for Social Security, using anecdotal examples to illustrate the financial consequences. One common error is claiming benefits at age 65, mistakenly believing it is the full retirement age (FRA), which can lead to a permanent reduction in monthly payments. Another oversight is not considering how an early claim can negatively impact a spouse's future survivor benefits. The article also notes the "earnings test," where working while collecting early benefits can cause a temporary reduction in payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China National Nuclear Corporation has announced that its new uranium project in Inner Mongolia, which uses an innovative in-situ recovery method, has yielded its first barrel. This "no tunnel, no toxic waste" approach involves injecting chemicals underground to dissolve uranium directly from sandstone deposits, avoiding traditional excavation and minimizing environmental impact. The success of this demonstration project is being hailed as a significant step toward a greener, more efficient, and safer method of uranium extraction. This technology could boost China's competitiveness in the global natural uranium sector.</p>

          <p>This commentary reflects on the five years since the murder of George Floyd, arguing that initial corporate and political gestures failed to address the movement's core demands for systemic change. The authors contend that instead of transformation, the response has been a counterinsurgency, with increased police budgets and repressive tactics against protestors. They argue that true safety comes from community-led initiatives like mutual aid and non-police crisis response, not from a punishment-based system. The piece calls for continued organizing to build a world rooted in care rather than control.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated a landmark 2023 civil rights settlement that mandated Alabama to resolve a decades-old raw sewage crisis in impoverished, majority-Black Lowndes County. The administration dismissed the agreement as an "illegal" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative, thereby removing the federal requirement for the state to provide functioning sanitation systems. This decision jeopardizes a program that was set to install proper septic systems for residents, many of whom live with raw wastewater on their properties. The move is part of a broader administration effort to dismantle programs aimed at tackling systemic inequalities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of deadly floods, this article analyzes the political and cultural reasons behind Texas's reluctance to invest in disaster preparedness despite being the most disaster-prone state in the US. It points to a pattern of inaction following major events like Hurricane Ike and Winter Storm Uri, where calls for preventative infrastructure are often stalled by a political ideology favoring small government. The piece suggests that the powerful influence of the fossil fuel industry and official skepticism of climate change contribute to a focus on recovery rather than proactive mitigation, a costly approach as extreme weather intensifies.</p>

However, it criticizes the show for its weak handling of real-world issues, such as the unceremonious removal of two contestants for past use of racial slurs. The show's producers avoided explaining the real reasons for the departures, highlighting a disconnect between its diverse casting and its willingness to engage with reality.</p>

          <p>A child has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, a death confirmed amid a regional surge in the highly contagious virus. The hospital has seen a spike in "seriously unwell" children admitted with measles, treating 17 cases since June. Health officials attribute the rise in infections to a decline in uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency is urging vaccination, as measles can lead to serious complications and, in rare cases, death, particularly in young or immunocompromised children.</p>
