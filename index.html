          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats have returned to the state capital, restoring the quorum needed for legislative business. Their return clears the path for Republicans to advance controversial new congressional maps, which could add up to five GOP seats in the next election. While Democrats state they will now build a legal case against what they call a "discriminatory map," civil arrest warrants remain active for members who were absent. The move signals a new phase in the partisan battle over redistricting, which has drawn national attention and prompted similar considerations in other states.</p>

          <p>The two-time defending champions, Oval Invincibles, solidified their top position in the men's Hundred tournament with a decisive seven-wicket win against the Southern Brave. The team's bowlers were instrumental, dismissing the Brave for 133 runs, with standout performances from Jason Behrendorff and Rashid Khan. In response, a powerful partnership between Jordan Cox (56) and Sam Curran (50 not out) guided the Invincibles to victory with 11 balls remaining. This win places them four points clear at the top of the table, strongly positioning them for the final stages of the competition.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn as Bitcoin's price fell to approximately $116,000 after recently achieving a new all-time high of over $124,000. This price correction was fueled by broader macroeconomic concerns, including higher-than-expected inflation data, which triggered over $500 million in forced liquidations of long positions. Ether also saw a decline, dropping by 2.5%. Despite the pullback, analysts note that strong inflows into crypto ETFs and institutional adoption provide underlying support for the market.

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener is advancing legislation that would make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers, including federal ICE agents, to wear face-obscuring masks while interacting with the public. The move was spurred by an incident where agents in ski masks appeared at a press conference held by Governor Gavin Newsom. Wiener, who is also positioning himself as a potential successor to Rep. Nancy Pelosi, framed the bill as a necessary measure to ensure accountability and prevent intimidation by "Trump's thugs." The proposal highlights ongoing tensions between California Democrats and federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, will be observed on Monday, September 1, marking the unofficial end of summer for many. The holiday originated from the labor movement in the late 19th century to secure better working conditions and rights. While government offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed, most major retailers, grocery stores, and fast-food chains are expected to remain open, though some may have reduced hours. The day is now commonly associated with travel, family gatherings, and retail sales, providing a final long weekend before autumn begins.</p>

          <p>The cable news network MSNBC is rebranding to "MS NOW," a move that reflects significant shifts within the mainstream media landscape. While the new name is officially an acronym, the change is seen as a strategic decision by parent company Comcast to distance its core NBC brand from the politically charged news channel. This rebranding occurs as both MSNBC and CNN are being spun off by their corporate owners, a move driven by the declining cable business and, analysts suggest, a desire to avoid political retribution from the Trump administration. The decision highlights how major corporations are adapting their strategies to navigate an increasingly polarized and punitive political environment.</p>

          <p>A common accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, could temporarily overstate profitability as new U.S. tariffs take effect. RIM uses an average cost-to-retail price ratio across broad categories rather than tracking the actual cost of each item, which can delay the full financial impact of rising import costs. This accounting nuance means that initial earnings reports may not fully reflect the pressure on gross margins from tariffs. While this effect normalizes over several quarters, it creates a potential disconnect between a company's operational efforts to mitigate costs and its reported financial results.

          <p>While there are no strict federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old for immediate annuities. These limits are based on risk assessment, as the buyer's age and life expectancy directly impact the product's pricing and payout structure. Financial advisors often suggest that the optimal time to consider an annuity is in one's late 50s to mid-60s, balancing the potential for growth with favorable rates. However, purchasing later in life can result in higher monthly payments, making the decision dependent on individual health, financial goals, and overall retirement strategy.

          <p>During a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump stated that a peace deal to end the war with Russia might not require a preliminary ceasefire. This marks a reversal from his position just last week, when he had threatened Russia with consequences if a ceasefire was not agreed upon. Trump argued that ceasefires can allow forces to regroup and that a comprehensive peace deal could be negotiated while fighting continues. The discussion, which also included European leaders, highlighted the complexities and shifting dynamics of the U.S. administration's approach to resolving the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is expected to announce its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts forecasting a 1.6% rise in U.S. same-store sales. If confirmed, this would mark the third consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth in its domestic market, signaling a potential recovery from a prolonged slump in the housing sector. The expected growth is attributed to easing year-over-year comparisons and a renewed consumer focus on larger discretionary projects. Investors will be watching for signs that the home improvement market is stabilizing, despite high interest rates, as the company enters what it calls its "Super Bowl" season.

Other additions include "tradwife," referring to a trend of embracing traditional gender roles, and "broligarchy," describing powerful male tech leaders.

He initially studied pre-med in college before realizing his true passion was performing, though he never expected SNL would hire an "effeminate Asian man." Yang, who is now Emmy-nominated, also discussed co-hosting his popular podcast "Las Culturistas."</p>

          <p>A new analysis from Bankrate indicates that average wage growth for American workers has lagged behind the rise in the cost of living by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years. This gap means that despite pay increases, the typical worker's purchasing power has been eroded by persistent inflation since the pandemic. The study found that some professions, particularly in education, have fallen further behind than others, while jobs in high-demand sectors like leisure and hospitality have seen wages outpace inflation. The findings align with public sentiment, as a majority of Americans report their incomes are not keeping up with rising prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The conservative media network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. The suit alleged that Newsmax knowingly aired false claims that the company's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump. This settlement follows a similar, much larger $787.5 million agreement between Dominion and Fox News in 2023. While agreeing to the payment, Newsmax did not apologize and maintained in a statement that its coverage was fair and balanced, despite court filings revealing internal communications where network staff acknowledged the fraud claims were baseless.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of aid to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion shows that European nations combined have committed more financial support than the United States. According to data from the Kiel Institute, European countries have provided $165.7 billion, compared to the U.S. total of $130.6 billion. This contradicts claims made by President Donald Trump, who has frequently criticized European allies for not contributing enough. While the U.S. remains the largest single-country donor, the data clarifies that the overall European contribution, comprising a mix of loans and grants from the EU and individual nations, is greater.</p>

His comments echo growing concerns from other financial experts that the massive influx of capital into AI is creating overvaluations.
