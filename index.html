          <p>Rescue services in Russia's far-eastern Amur region have located the wreckage of an Angara Airlines An-24 plane that disappeared from radar. The aircraft, carrying 48 people including six crew members and five children, was approaching Tynda airport when it went down. The fuselage was found burning on a hillside, and initial reports suggest there are no survivors from the crash. Authorities are investigating potential causes, including pilot error in poor weather or a technical malfunction with the nearly 50-year-old aircraft.</p>

          <p>The European Union is navigating tense trade negotiations with the United States as an August 1 deadline for potential new tariffs approaches. While there is speculation about a possible deal that would set a 15% baseline tariff rate on EU imports, officials caution that nothing is finalized and depends on President Trump's decision. In the absence of a guaranteed agreement, Brussels is preparing countermeasures, including a combined list of retaliatory tariffs on US goods totaling 93 billion euros. The uncertainty leaves European businesses and economies in a precarious position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of 1.485 billion euros, significantly surpassing analyst expectations and leading to a notable rise in its share price. Despite mixed results in its investment banking unit and challenges from a strong euro, the bank expressed confidence in meeting its full-year targets. The firm highlighted a 34% year-on-year increase in pre-tax profit and a solid capital ratio, though it noted a slowdown in corporate loan growth. The positive results come amid broader economic uncertainty in Europe, particularly concerning potential U.S. trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed three executive orders focused on artificial intelligence, including one aimed at preventing the use of "woke AI" by the federal government. The order targets what it calls ideological agendas like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), mandating that government-procured AI models be neutral and prioritize truthfulness. Another order seeks to remove regulations hindering AI development, while a third establishes a program to promote U.S. AI exports. These actions are part of a broader "Winning the AI Race" plan to accelerate innovation and establish American leadership in the field.</p>

          <p>The transfer of English forward Marcus Rashford to FC Barcelona has generated significant discussion among fans and journalists in the Catalan capital. While Rashford offers tactical flexibility, able to play on the wing or as a striker, he was reportedly not the club's first choice and joins a well-stocked forward line. Commentators believe the move is a major opportunity for Rashford to revitalize his career after a period of poor form, though he will face stiff competition for a starting position. His arrival is also seen as a positive development, potentially encouraging more English players to join La Liga.</p>

          <p>India's aviation regulator, the DGCA, has issued warnings to Air India for significant breaches of safety standards, including issues with crew fatigue management and inadequate training. Government notices revealed 29 violations, such as pilots not receiving mandatory rest and insufficient simulator training, which the airline self-reported. These "systemic issues" have led the regulator to threaten enforcement action, which could include fines or the removal of executives. The scrutiny follows a recent fatal crash of an Air India jet, although these warnings pertain to separate, ongoing compliance failures.</p>

          <p>Vehicle production in the United Kingdom during the first half of the year has dropped to its lowest point since 1953, not counting the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car output declined by 7.3%, while van production fell by 45%. The downturn is attributed partly to uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, which caused some manufacturers to slow production. While a recent U.S.-UK tariff deal and new electric vehicle grants may offer some relief, the industry faces significant challenges to meet future production targets.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a significant overcapacity problem in its waste-to-energy incineration sector, with an estimated 40% of its capacity sitting idle. While the country rapidly built the world's largest network of incinerators, the growth of municipal solid waste has not kept pace, due in part to an economic downturn and slowing urbanization. Since 2019, incineration capacity has more than doubled, but the amount of waste generated has only increased by about 11%. This mismatch has left many of the optimistically planned facilities seriously underutilized and struggling to find enough waste to burn.</p>

          <p>The competition between the United States and China has evolved into a technological arms race for the next generation of "superweapons," particularly in artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Achieving a breakthrough in either field first could provide a decisive and potentially permanent economic and military advantage, from breaking modern encryption to deploying massive cyberattacks. While the two nations remain deeply intertwined economically, both are investing heavily in these sensitive technologies. The article suggests this creates a complex dynamic, as the U.S. relies on Chinese talent for research even as it tries to secure its technological developments from its primary rival.</p>

          <p>China is set to introduce a direct fiscal support program for its senior citizens, offering monthly electronic coupons to help cover the costs of elderly care. The policy aims to alleviate the financial burden on families, stimulate consumption in the senior-care sector, and address the challenges of a rapidly aging population. The allowances, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan per month, will be available to seniors assessed as having moderate to severe disabilities. This move is seen by economists as a step toward strengthening China's social safety net, which could help unlock domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

The threatened tariffs, which could take effect on August 1, have created significant uncertainty for European exporters.

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate quashed by a UK court. The ruling is a significant development in one of the major scandals of the post-financial crisis era and raises numerous questions. The decision may pave the way for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their sentences. It has also led to renewed calls from senior politicians for a full public inquiry into the scandal, including the role that senior bank managers and central banks played.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision to block President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, ruling the plan is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the order's interpretation, which would deny citizenship to many people born in the United States, violates the 14th Amendment. This ruling keeps a nationwide injunction in place, preventing the administration from denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens or permanent residents.

While universities have increased investment in wellbeing services, they stress they are not a replacement for clinical NHS services.
