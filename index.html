          <p>This article provides a five-year retrospective on the 2020 pro-democracy protests in Belarus, concluding that hopes for meaningful change have been extinguished. The authoritarian regime of Alexander Lukashenko has since intensified its crackdown, imprisoning thousands of political opponents and systematically erasing digital evidence of the popular uprising. With unwavering support from Russia, the government continues to persecute dissenters and uses political prisoners as bargaining chips in its dealings with the West. Experts cited in the article suggest that while Western leverage is limited, more could be done diplomatically to negotiate for the release of individuals suffering under the regime.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance stated that while America and the United Kingdom may disagree on specific tactics, such as the U.K.'s potential recognition of a Palestinian state, they share the ultimate goal of achieving peace in Gaza. Speaking before a meeting with U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Vance emphasized the U.S. has no plans to recognize a Palestinian state, citing the lack of a functional government. The discussion comes as Israel moves forward with plans to occupy Gaza City, a decision facing international scrutiny but which Israeli leaders defend as a necessary step to dismantle Hamas.</p>

          <p>Spain's national ombudsman is investigating a decision by the Jumilla local authority to prohibit Muslim groups from using public facilities for religious festivals. The measure, proposed by the far-right Vox party and approved by the conservative-led council, has been condemned as discriminatory and Islamophobic by Muslim organizations and Spain's migration minister. While the town's mayor claims the rule is not targeted at any single group, critics, including Catholic bishops, argue it violates fundamental rights to worship and promotes an exclusionary vision of Spanish identity, creating significant social and religious division.</p>

          <p>The daughter of Bhim Kohli, an 80-year-old man killed by teenagers, claims police inaction could have prevented his death. She states that authorities were aware of the identities of youths who had racially abused and assaulted another man two weeks prior—an incident her father witnessed—but failed to make arrests until after his killing. A police report confirmed the delay, citing officer schedules and a bank holiday as reasons. The family is now calling for the police watchdog to reopen its investigation, believing that a swifter and more decisive response would have deterred the subsequent fatal attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude oil, a move intended to limit funding for Russia's war in Ukraine. However, experts believe this development is unlikely to derail negotiations for a long-delayed EU-India free trade agreement. The sanctions are seen as largely symbolic, with analysts arguing that the greater pressure on India stems from potential U.S. tariffs. This American pressure might paradoxically push India to solidify its trade relationship with the EU, viewing it as a more reliable and predictable economic partner in a volatile global landscape.</p>

The new venture is operated by The Brand House Collective, which acquired the license to develop stores under the iconic brand's name. In a nod to its legacy, the new store will honor all expired 20% off coupons from the original chain.

          <p>The U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, launched a sharp, undiplomatic attack on U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his criticism of Israel's military operations in Gaza. Responding to Starmer's call for a ceasefire, Huckabee provocatively compared Israel's actions to the Allied bombing of Dresden during World War II, questioning if the U.K. would have surrendered to the Nazis. The comments represent a significant public rebuke of a key ally's leader and reflect Huckabee's history of making strongly pro-Israel statements that diverge from traditional diplomatic norms, further straining discussions on the conflict.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record high of over $1.21 trillion, many Americans are struggling with compounding interest. This article outlines several strategies to combat these charges and regain financial control. Options include transferring balances to a credit card with a 0% introductory APR, which allows for principal-focused payments for a promotional period. Other effective methods discussed are enrolling in a credit card issuer's hardship program, consolidating debt with a lower-interest personal loan, or making payments before the statement closing date to avoid interest accrual.

          <p>As interest rates are expected to decline, savers can benefit from a CD laddering strategy to lock in currently high returns while maintaining financial flexibility. This approach involves opening multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates, such as three-month, six-month, and one-year terms. By doing this, savers can take advantage of today's favorable rates before they drop further, without committing all their funds to long-term accounts. This method provides regular access to portions of the savings, which is crucial in an unpredictable economic climate where liquidity is valuable. (not investment advice)</p>

The book, which follows its 51-year-old protagonist Clarissa Dalloway over a single day, masterfully juxtaposes the vibrancy of life with the looming specter of mortality. While often read in youth for its innovative stream-of-consciousness style and depiction of post-war trauma, the novel offers deeper resonance to older readers. It captures the complex feelings of being both young and aged, and the realization that happiness can be found in ordinary life despite past choices.</p>

          <p>Shares in rare earth miner MP Materials increased after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the second quarter and record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. The company's sales jumped 84% year-over-year, fueled by a 119% increase in the output of NdPr, a key component for magnets in electric vehicles and electronics. This positive performance, along with a recent $400 million investment from the U.S. Defense Department, has boosted investor confidence as the company ramps up its magnet production facility in Texas to supply manufacturers like General Motors.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly demanded the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, accusing him of being "highly conflicted" due to his alleged investment ties to Chinese companies linked to the military. The unusual presidential intervention in corporate leadership follows concerns raised by Republican Senator Tom Cotton. Intel, a major recipient of U.S. government funding to rebuild domestic semiconductor manufacturing, saw its shares fall after the president's social media post. In response, Intel defended its CEO and reaffirmed its commitment to U.S. national security interests and the "America First agenda."</p>

The jury found the defendant guilty after hearing he attacked Harvey with a hunting knife following a social media quarrel. The defendant had admitted to manslaughter but denied murder, claiming he "snapped" and had been bullied. Prosecutors argued the act was premeditated, presenting evidence of the defendant's interest in weapons and his desire to appear "hard."

          <p>While Texas Democrats' flight to Chicago to block a Republican redistricting plan has successfully drawn national attention, its practical goal of stopping the new maps is likely to fail. Experts suggest that the pressures of being away from home, combined with mounting political and financial threats from Republican leaders, make the standoff unsustainable long-term. Historically, similar efforts have ended with the lawmakers returning and the majority party eventually passing its legislation. The quorum break serves as a powerful messaging tool for Democrats, but it is ultimately a temporary tactic against a determined Republican majority in the state.</p>

The order comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the Miccosukee Tribe and environmental groups, who argue the project violates federal environmental laws by threatening sensitive wetlands without proper review. The pause affects activities like paving and fencing but does not impact detainees currently held at the facility. This is one of two legal challenges against the state-built detention center, with another suit focusing on alleged civil rights violations.</p>

This strategy is designed to create a more durable, fee-based revenue stream with less cyclicality than dealmaking.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed revoking a 2009 "endangerment finding" that serves as the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. If passed, the move would repeal existing emissions standards and could significantly alter the U.S. auto industry's strategy, which has been heavily focused on developing electric vehicles to meet strict regulations. Experts suggest this would give automakers more flexibility to align their production of EVs and gas-powered cars with actual consumer demand, which has recently shown signs of slowing. The proposal is expected to face legal challenges, creating uncertainty for the industry's long-term planning.</p>
