          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has called for a sober and calm response to numerous drone sightings over German airports and military sites, stating they have not posed a concrete threat so far. He acknowledged Russia's strategy of provoking fear and uncertainty but emphasized that while Germany must prepare for worst-case scenarios, an attack on a NATO country is not considered inevitable. The incidents have prompted Germany to step up its drone defense capabilities, with discussions about creating a joint defense unit to address these new hybrid threats.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that police will be given broader powers to impose conditions on recurring protests, citing the cumulative impact on communities. The Home Office stated that senior officers can consider the disruption from previous demonstrations when deciding whether to restrict a new one, potentially moving it to a different location. This move follows recent large-scale protests and arrests, with Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood emphasizing the need to balance the right to protest with residents' freedom to live without intimidation, particularly within the Jewish community.</p>

The eastern Ilam district was hit particularly hard, where multiple villages were swept away and 18 fatalities were confirmed, including six members of a single family whose home was buried. The severe weather has disrupted domestic flights and blocked major highways, hampering ongoing rescue and relief operations as authorities warn of continued rainfall.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a major overnight assault on Ukraine, firing over 50 missiles and hundreds of drones at infrastructure targets across multiple regions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that five people were killed in the strikes, with four of the fatalities occurring in the western city of Lviv. The attacks, which also targeted regions like Zaporizhzhia and Odesa, caused power outages and prompted neighboring NATO member Poland to scramble its fighter jets to secure its airspace due to the proximity of the assault.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections following the removal of longtime leader Bashar Assad, though the process is not a popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210 seats in the People's Assembly will be chosen by electoral colleges in various districts, with the remaining third directly appointed by the interim president. The interim authorities cited the difficulty of creating an accurate voter registry due to widespread displacement as the reason for this system, but the process has raised concerns about inclusivity and potential manipulation.</p>

          <p>The electric vehicle market in the United States is bracing for a significant slowdown after a period of record sales, which analysts attribute to a rush to buy before a $7,500 federal tax credit expired. Despite recent growth, the U.S. lags behind Europe and China in EV adoption, a gap credited to weaker government support, higher vehicle prices, and policy uncertainty. With the subsidy gone and new tariffs in place, automakers like Ford and GM expect demand to drop, posing a major challenge to the industry's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has dispatched senior envoys, including Jared Kushner, to Egypt to help finalize the details of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. The diplomatic push comes after President Trump stated that an agreement is "very close" and Hamas indicated its acceptance of key parts of the U.S. peace proposal.
