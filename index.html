        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has moved forward with the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate certain cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. The bipartisan measure aims to establish industry standards and protect consumers by mandating that stablecoin issuers hold reserves of underlying assets and prioritize repayment in case of bankruptcy. Supporters believe the act will legitimize the crypto industry and foster competition, while critics like Sen. Elizabeth Warren argue it's a weak set of regulations that fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns, especially those exemplified by President Trump's crypto ventures. The bill also includes a stipulation prohibiting members of Congress or senior executive branch officials from issuing stablecoin products during their time in public service.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced tough questions from Senate Democrats, particularly Sen. Chris Van Hollen, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Van Hollen criticized Rubio's relationship with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele and the administration's handling of the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, a migrant erroneously deported to El Salvador. Rubio defended his policy on deportations and the El Salvador detentions, leading to a heated exchange where Van Hollen accused Rubio of making unsubstantiated comments and compared his policies to McCarthy-era tactics. The confrontation required Chairman Jim Risch to intervene, highlighting the deep divisions on foreign policy and immigration.</p>

CEO Sundar Pichai describes it as a "total reimagining of search," intended to disrupt Google's traditional search business before AI competitors can. The A.I. transition also includes personalized email replies and a shopping tool that automates clothing purchases, but it comes amid antitrust pressures and concerns from web publishers about potential traffic disruption.</p>

          <p>The FDA has outlined new regulatory guidance for Covid-19 vaccine boosters, requiring more rigorous clinical trials for healthy Americans. The agency will now demand randomized, placebo-controlled trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of boosters for adults and children without high-risk conditions. This decision reflects a shift towards balancing regulatory flexibility with gold-standard science, particularly for those at low risk of severe illness. For high-risk individuals, the FDA will continue to accept immunogenicity data as sufficient evidence for approval. This change comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is overhauling the nation's health agencies and immunization policy.</p>

          <p>Following President Biden's announcement of an aggressive form of prostate cancer, experts provided context on the diagnosis and treatment options. The doctors emphasized that while the cancer is advanced, modern treatments can effectively manage it for years. They noted that prostate cancer is common in older men and that screening guidelines often change after age 70. The standard treatment will likely involve androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to block testosterone production, which can slow the cancer's growth. They expressed optimism about Biden's prognosis, citing advancements in cancer research and treatment.</p>

Noem defended her support for habeas corpus but also asserted the president's authority to suspend it, raising concerns about due process for undocumented migrants.

Key questions include whether retirement savings have changed, whether retirement plans have been altered, and whether delaying securing a long-term care insurance plan is advisable. Considering factors such as market fluctuations, Social Security adjustments, and potential changes in living arrangements can help seniors determine if long-term care insurance is a prudent investment to cover potential costs of assisted living or in-home care.</p>

          <p>Despite the opening of the border for aid trucks into Gaza, the UN reports that no aid has yet been distributed, citing complexities imposed by Israel. The UK has suspended trade talks with Israel over its "morally unjustifiable" military escalation, while the EU is reviewing its trade agreement. The UN estimates that 600 trucks a day are needed to address Gaza's humanitarian crisis. The UN also highlighted the urgent need to save an estimated 14,000 babies suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza. The leaders of the UK, France, and Canada have called on Israel to immediately allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home electricity bills are projected to reach an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high due to rising electricity costs and high temperatures. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) reports that the rising cost of electricity, outpacing inflation, combined with increased cooling demands, will strain household budgets. Low-income families, who already spend a larger portion of their income on energy, may struggle to afford cooling, posing health risks. Modernizing public assistance programs and improving home energy efficiency are recommended to mitigate the impact of rising costs.</p>

          <p>The United States suffered its worst commercial honeybee crash on record, with an estimated 62% of commercial colonies perishing. Federal funding cuts to the USDA have hampered efforts to identify the causes of the die-off and provide aid to beekeepers. The USDA has approached Cornell University to take on pesticide testing due to staffing cuts, and beekeepers are still awaiting the agency's report. Experts fear that without fully funded USDA labs, beekeepers won't know why their colonies are dying, which could impact crop yields and force the U.S. to import more produce.</p>

The classification system also considers the patientâ€™s social environment. The goal is to replace the oversimplified "mild, moderate, severe" categories with a more comprehensive evaluation that can lead to better treatments and research.</p>

While acknowledging the validity of concerns about Biden's age, the author argues that the "cover-up" of his condition is less significant than the obvious reality of his declining abilities. The author notes that politicians and their staff are not always forthcoming and that the president's condition has been apparent for years, making any attempts to conceal it futile.</p>

Walmart's CFO stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases is more than any retailer can absorb, but the company remains committed to maintaining low prices.

Despite Trump's appeal, divisions remain within the Republican caucus, with some members demanding a larger State and Local Tax (Salt) deduction and others expressing concerns about cuts to federal safety net programs like Medicaid. While Trump insisted that the bill would not affect Medicaid and that cuts would only target waste, fraud, and abuse, the bill is estimated to cost $3.8 trillion through 2034, causing friction with fiscal conservatives.</p>
