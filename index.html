          <p>A 15-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering a fellow student, Harvey Willgoose, at a Sheffield high school. The stabbing, which occurred during a lunch break, followed a social media dispute between the two teenagers. While the defendant admitted to manslaughter and possessing a knife, he denied murder, claiming he "snapped." Prosecutors argued the act was premeditated, presenting evidence of the defendant's interest in weapons and desire to appear "hard."</p>

          <p>Youth sports in America have transformed into a high-stakes, commercialized industry, creating significant pressure on children and families. The shift from free, play-based community programs to expensive pay-to-play leagues has driven up costs, with the average family spending over $1,000 annually on their child's primary sport. This professionalization, fueled by college admission anxieties, is linked to increased youth anxiety, overuse injuries, and a growing class divide that excludes lower-income children from participating.</p>

          <p>New York City's primary utility provider, Con Edison, has significantly increased household electricity disconnections, cutting off over 88,000 customers in the first half of 2025. This aggressive approach to debt recovery comes as the company seeks an 11% price increase and coincides with extreme heatwaves, raising public health concerns. Reports indicate that these shutoffs disproportionately affect Black and Latino residents, exacerbating energy poverty for vulnerable families already struggling with high living costs.</p>

          <p>The Republican party's stance on healthcare has shifted from praising the American system's innovation to actively dismantling it under the second Trump administration, according to this analysis. The article argues that while historically supporting medical research, the administration is now cutting funds for vital projects, such as mRNA vaccine research, and elevating anti-science figures. This new approach combines opposition to universal coverage with a turn against scientific advancement, creating a system that is both less accessible and less innovative.</p>

          <p>A new dating safety app called Tea, which allows women to anonymously review men, has surged in popularity but is facing significant criticism. The app, intended as a modern "whisper network" to screen potential partners, has raised concerns about privacy, potential for defamation, and the commodification of safety. Despite its goal of protecting women, experts argue that its "name and shame" model is flawed, and a recent cyberattack exposing user data has further highlighted the platform's vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>As a deadline set by President Trump for Russia to cease hostilities arrives, Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines remain deeply pessimistic about the prospects for a diplomatic peace. With Russia's slow but costly advance continuing, troops engaged in intense battles in regions like Donetsk believe defeating Russia militarily is the only viable option. Their skepticism is compounded by fears that a potential summit between Trump and Putin could sideline Ukraine's interests in negotiations to end the war.</p>

          <p>A new term, "healthocide," has been proposed in the BMJ Global Health journal to define the intentional and systematic destruction of a population's health services and overall well-being. Coined by academics in response to increasing attacks on healthcare in conflict zones like Gaza, Lebanon, and Sudan, the word aims to draw urgent attention to these violations. While some in the humanitarian community welcome the term to galvanize action, others argue that existing legal definitions like "war crimes" are sufficient.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that a clear majority of voters in Germany believe Chancellor Friedrich Merz should apply more pressure on Israel regarding its actions in the Gaza Strip. This public sentiment aligns with the government's recent shift in tone, including a call for restraint and a partial ban on military exports for use in Gaza. The survey also shows that only a minority of Germans, 31%, now believe the country still has a "special responsibility" for Israel's existence, suggesting a notable evolution in public opinion.</p>

Despite spending billions to develop "personal superintelligence," Zuckerberg's stated goals focus on enhancing consumer products like Instagram Reels and smart glasses to sell more ads. The author argues this vision pales in comparison to the world-changing potential of AI and is unlikely to inspire the top talent Meta is trying to recruit.

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a controversial five-point plan to take control of Gaza City, the most populous city in the enclave before the war. The plan's stated objectives include disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, establishing Israeli security control, and creating an alternative civil administration. While a specific timeline has not been announced, the move is seen as a major escalation and a potential first phase of a full occupation, drawing strong condemnation internationally and within Israel.</p>

The plan extends repayment terms from the current 10 years up to 25 years for those with higher balances. While this may lower monthly payments, experts warn of a "cliff effect," where a small difference in loan balance can add years to the term. This extension means borrowers will pay significantly more in total interest over the life of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>
