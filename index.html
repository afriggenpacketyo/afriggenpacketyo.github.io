          <p>India's consumer inflation rate cooled significantly to 2.1% in June, marking its eighth consecutive monthly decline and falling to a more than six-year low. This figure was well below economists' forecasts, providing the Reserve Bank of India with more latitude to consider further monetary policy easing. The positive outlook is supported by predictions of a good monsoon season and strong crop production, which are expected to keep food prices stable, although concerns remain over potential U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The global professional footballer's union, Fifpro, has issued a scathing condemnation of FIFA's expanded Club World Cup, labeling the event a "fiction" that disregards player welfare. The union's president compared FIFA's leadership to the Roman emperor Nero, accusing the governing body of prioritizing revenue at the expense of players' health and bodies. This statement intensifies the ongoing dispute, which includes a legal complaint filed by Fifpro against FIFA over the increasingly congested fixture schedule.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger's recent guilty plea in the murder of four University of Idaho students has brought a conclusion to the legal case but left the public without a clear motive. By pleading guilty, Kohberger avoids the death penalty but also a trial that might have revealed why he committed the horrific crime. With key questions unanswered, a new wave of documentaries and books is attempting to piece together the evidence, including his alleged stalking behavior and the overwhelming DNA and digital evidence that led to his plea.</p>

          <p>The British government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the state-owned Post Office, suggesting it could be transformed into a mutual, employee-owned organization. This move is part of an effort to reform the institution's culture following the devastating Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The consultation will explore how the Post Office can better meet consumer needs while rebuilding trust and strengthening its relationship with its operators.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old palliative care specialist has gone on trial in Berlin, Germany, accused of murdering 15 of his patients with lethal injections. Prosecutors allege the doctor acted as a "master of life and death," killing victims aged 25 to 94 between 2021 and 2024. In some cases, he allegedly set fire to his victims' homes to conceal the crimes, with prosecutors stating his motive appeared to be a pure "lust for murder."

          <p>This commentary posits that while ICE raids are brutal, the more profound issue is a U.S. economy that depends on low-wage, undocumented labor, trapping many immigrants in a cycle of poverty. The author argues that this "low wage/high welfare" model is fiscally unsustainable and inhumane. Instead of just protesting raids, the piece calls for a pragmatic immigration policy that secures the border while also creating legal pathways for the law-abiding immigrants who are already integral to American communities.</p>

          <p>Experts are highlighting a major "flood insurance gap" in the U.S., as only 4% of homeowners have flood insurance despite nearly every county experiencing a flood event in recent decades. With climate change fueling more intense rainfall, many Americans are financially vulnerable because standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. While federal flood insurance is available, its rising cost is a significant barrier for many, forcing them to risk devastating financial losses when disaster strikes.</p>
