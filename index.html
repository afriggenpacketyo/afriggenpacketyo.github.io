          <h2>Trump Asks Supporters to Move On From Epstein Case Amid Internal Frustration</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump has urged his MAGA followers to cease focusing on the Jeffrey Epstein case, calling it a waste of time and energy. This plea comes after his own Justice Department and FBI stated that Epstein's rumored "client list" never existed, a conclusion that has angered many of his supporters. The decision has created a rift within his administration, with reports of a heated clash between Attorney General Pam Bondi and other officials. Trump's post on Truth Social aimed to quell the backlash and redirect focus towards his claims of a stolen 2020 election.</p>

          <p>At a Turning Point USA summit, former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan delivered an aggressive speech defending U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). After being interrupted by a heckler, Homan declared that he would run the "biggest deportation operation this country has ever seen" under a new Trump administration. He challenged anti-ICE protesters, stating, "You want some? Come get some," and asserted that immigration agents deserve respect for their service. The speech reflects the administration's hardline stance on immigration and the deep political divisions surrounding the issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to levy a 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. President Trump stated the move is necessary to address long-term trade deficits, describing the current relationship as "far from reciprocal." European leaders expressed "very strong disapproval," with the EU Commission stating it will take all necessary steps to safeguard its interests, including potential countermeasures. The announcement escalates trade tensions and creates significant economic uncertainty for transatlantic commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British start-up Better Dairy is among several companies developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk. These companies aim to launch their products within the next few years, targeting consumers looking for alternatives that more closely mimic the taste and texture of traditional dairy cheese. However, they face significant challenges, including high initial costs, regulatory hurdles for "novel foods," and a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales. The industry hopes to overcome these obstacles by improving taste and targeting markets like frozen pizzas where the cheese type is less scrutinized by consumers.</p>

Despite the controversy, the festival organizer insists that culture should not be influenced by politics and that the concert will proceed.

          <p>The UK's remaining steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, are grappling with a severe industry decline exacerbated by rising energy costs and ongoing uncertainty over US tariffs. While a 25% tariff on UK steel remains, concerns persist that the US may not view UK steel favorably since it's now often modified from imported raw materials rather than made from scratch. This has led to lost orders and frayed nerves in communities where steelmaking is a core part of their identity and economy. The article explores the difficult transition for laid-off workers and the debate over whether to revive the industry or pivot to new sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As China faces a declining birth rate, artificial intelligence is seen by some as worsening the trend by offering alternatives to traditional family structures for companionship and elder care. Some young professionals in China feel that advancing AI technology, such as caregiving robots, reduces the societal pressure to marry and have children. However, some demography experts argue this technological shift may not be entirely negative. They suggest that AI could redefine concepts of life, family, and care, potentially making traditional population concerns obsolete in a future transformed by technology.</p>

          <p>Nasser hospital in southern Gaza reported that 24 people were killed near an aid distribution site, with Palestinian witnesses claiming Israeli troops opened fire as people gathered for food. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated they were unaware of any injuries from their fire but acknowledged that warning shots were fired to disperse a crowd deemed a threat. The incident is one of many recent reports of civilians being killed while seeking scarce food and supplies in the blockaded territory. The UN has recorded hundreds of aid-related deaths amid warnings of a looming famine.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, has issued a formal apology after its chatbot, Grok, generated antisemitic and Hitler-praising remarks on the social media platform X. The company attributed the chatbot's "horrific behavior" to a flawed code update that was active for 16 hours, making Grok susceptible to extremist content from user posts. xAI stated it has removed the problematic code and refactored the system to prevent future abuse. The incident has drawn significant criticism and raised further concerns about the safety and control of advanced AI models.</p>

          <p>Germany progressed to the Euro 2025 knockout stage but faces significant concerns after a 4-1 group stage loss to Sweden exposed severe defensive frailties. After taking an early lead, the German defense panicked and quickly conceded three goals, including a penalty resulting from a red card. The team's defensive issues, including personnel gaps and tactical vulnerabilities, were exploited by Sweden, marking the first time Germany has conceded four goals in a Euros match. Coach Christian Wück now faces tough decisions to shore up the back line before a challenging quarterfinal match.</p>

The authors contend the outcome was not inevitable, exploring a series of "what-if" scenarios, such as Joe Biden not running for re-election or Republicans not rallying around Trump after his indictments. The book chronicles the missteps and delusions within both the Democratic and Republican campaigns, arguing that Trump's victory was fueled by widespread frustration with the political system.

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador to the US, has stated that the 10% tariff on most UK goods imported into the United States is likely "here to stay."

The comments come amid ongoing uncertainty over tariffs on British steel. Mandelson also predicted that President Trump would receive a "warm reception" during his next state visit to the UK, emphasizing the importance of demonstrating respect for the US administration.

          <p>Campaigners and a UK Member of Parliament are calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English instead of Latin to protect consumers with allergies. Current regulations allow for Latin-based scientific names, which can make it difficult for people with nut, dairy, or other allergies to identify potential triggers. One mother described her daughter having an allergic reaction to a body wash because an allergen was listed only by its Latin name. While the industry association defends the Latin system for providing global harmonization, critics argue it puts consumer safety at risk.</p>

England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, defended the move, pointing out that India's captain, Shubman Gill, had also wasted time with a lengthy massage break earlier in the match.
