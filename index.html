          <p>Former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry has publicly defended L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer against allegations of circumventing the NBA's salary cap. The controversy stems from a report that Ballmer used a personal investment in a third-party company to facilitate a sponsorship deal for player Kawhi Leonard, effectively paying him off the books. Lasry, who has known Ballmer for a long time, expressed his disbelief in the claims, stating he considers Ballmer to be an honorable person who respects league rules. The NBA has launched an investigation into the matter following the report.</p>

          <p>The search for the gunman who assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has intensified after law enforcement released two individuals who were initially detained. The Utah Department of Public Safety confirmed that neither person has any ties to the shooting, shifting the investigation into a broader manhunt for the unidentified shooter. Kirk was killed by a single shot from a distance while speaking at an outdoor campus event. The assassination has drawn national attention and condemnation, prompting a large-scale response from local, state, and federal authorities to find the person responsible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attendees at the event where conservative commentator Charlie Kirk was assassinated have described a scene with surprisingly minimal security, creating a vulnerable environment for the attack. Witnesses noted a lack of stringent measures like bag checks, with some comparing the police presence unfavorably to that at university sporting events. Accounts from the scene depict the moment the shot was fired, followed by widespread panic and a stampede as the crowd fled in terror. These testimonies raise critical questions about the security protocols in place for such a high-profile and often controversial public figure.</p>

The average allocation to public equities rose to 31%, while private equity fell to 21%, marking a significant shift in strategy. This move reflects a pro-risk sentiment despite geopolitical concerns, with many firms looking to capitalize on market dislocations and the growth of artificial intelligence through public markets.

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has elicited widespread condemnation from American political figures of all affiliations, uniting them in denouncing political violence. President Donald Trump, a close ally of Kirk, mourned his death and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff, while former presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama also issued statements expressing their sorrow and calling for an end to such violence. The event has highlighted the nation's deep political divisions, even as leaders publicly called for civility and peace. Tributes and calls for justice came from governors, members of Congress, and other prominent figures.</p>

          <p>Ireland's public broadcaster, RTÉ, has announced it will not participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest if Israel is allowed to compete. The organization stated that taking part would be "unconscionable" due to the ongoing conflict and loss of life in Gaza. This move places pressure on the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the event and will make the final decision on Israel's inclusion. Ireland, a seven-time winner of the contest, is joining a growing chorus of voices calling for cultural and political actions related to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is under pressure to clarify how his partner, Laure Ferrari, funded the £885,000 purchase of his Clacton constituency home. The property was bought in her name without a mortgage, which has led to accusations that the arrangement was designed to avoid over £44,000 in second-home stamp duty. Farage has denied providing the funds, suggesting his partner's family is wealthy, but a BBC investigation found little evidence to support this claim. The situation has opened Farage to charges of hypocrisy, as he recently criticized another politician for alleged tax avoidance.</p>

The raid, which targeted alleged illegal employment, caused a diplomatic stir, with South Korean officials calling it a "stab in the back" after encouraging U.S. investment. After negotiations, the U.S. agreed to release the workers without restraints and ensure they can re-enter the country in the future. The incident highlights the clash between U.S. efforts to boost domestic manufacturing and its strict immigration enforcement, particularly for skilled technicians from allied nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of teenagers babysitting, once a common first job and rite of passage, is in decline as the role becomes increasingly professionalized and dominated by adults. This cultural shift is attributed to factors like heightened parental safety concerns, busier teen schedules with more structured activities, and the rise of apps that connect parents with experienced adult caregivers. Experts suggest this trend results in a loss of valuable experiences for both teens, who miss out on developing responsibility and caregiving skills, and for young children, who lose the unique mentorship of an older, relatable youth.</p>

          <p>A recent essay argues that the widespread, unauthorized use of AI in higher education is undermining the core principles of learning and that universities must take radical steps to combat it. The author suggests that half-measures have failed and calls for a comprehensive "de-teching" of campuses, including removing Wi-Fi in favor of Ethernet, banning laptops and smartphones, and conducting more in-person, proctored exams. This approach, though seemingly extreme, is presented as necessary to restore academic integrity and create an environment where students can learn to think critically without relying on chatbots to do the work for them.</p>

The case was brought by two couples who argued that the existing regulation was archaic, patriarchal, and violated their rights. The court agreed, finding that the law amounted to gender-based discrimination.

According to the criminal complaint, Brunner's blood alcohol content was well over the legal limit, and an open beer can was found in her vehicle. She has four prior convictions for operating while intoxicated.</p>

          <p>In an unusual move, Mansfield Town has included striker Lucas Akins in its official squad list for the season, despite the player currently serving a 14-month prison sentence. Akins was jailed in April for causing the death of a cyclist by careless driving. He is expected to be eligible for release after serving half his sentence, which could allow him to play for the League One club before the end of the year. The club has stated it will review his position upon his release from custody, but his inclusion on the list indicates his contract remains active.</p>

          <p>According to public health expert Ezekiel Emanuel, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership has created a paradox by correctly identifying chronic disease and nutrition as major issues while simultaneously undermining the institutions needed to address them. Emanuel criticizes Kennedy's anti-vaccine stance and the mass layoffs and budget cuts at the CDC, arguing these actions will harm public health in the long run. While Kennedy's focus on nutrition is seen as a positive, his actual policies have so far been superficial, failing to address the systemic issues in the American food system that drive chronic illness.</p>

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has been charged by the English Football Association with 74 alleged rule breaches concerning payments to agents between 2009 and 2022. The charges primarily relate to the period when the club was owned by Roman Abramovich. The club's new ownership group discovered and self-reported the potentially incomplete financial records to regulators after their purchase in 2022. Despite their cooperation, Chelsea could face severe sanctions, including a fine, a transfer embargo, or a points deduction, as a separate Premier League investigation into the matter also remains ongoing.</p>

          <p>Residents in Spain's Galicia region have won a landmark legal case against regional authorities over unchecked pollution from industrial pig farming. The court ruled that the contamination of local water sources with nitrates from farm waste violated the residents' fundamental human rights. For years, locals have contended with foul odors and unsafe drinking water that has decimated the local ecosystem. This ruling, the first of its kind in Europe, orders authorities to compensate the claimants and clean up the environment, setting a potential precedent for other communities fighting industrial agricultural pollution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. space agency, NASA, has banned Chinese citizens from accessing its facilities, materials, and networks, effectively barring them from working on its programs. The move, confirmed by NASA, is framed as a measure to ensure the security of its work amid an escalating technological and strategic rivalry with Beijing. This restriction adds to the decline in scientific collaboration between the two nations and reflects growing U.S. concerns about China's ambitious space program. The decision further solidifies the exclusion of Chinese astronauts and researchers from key international space efforts led by the United States.</p>

Proud cited the significant financial incentives as a primary motivator, stating that the prize money from a single race could surpass what he would earn from 13 world championship titles. The event, which has been condemned by anti-doping agencies and sports federations as dangerous and irresponsible, plans its inaugural competition for 2026.

          <p>University professors across the U.S. are facing a wave of antisemitism complaints and formal investigations for their pro-Palestinian advocacy, creating what many describe as a chilling effect on academic freedom. This trend has been fueled by the Trump administration's use of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to target universities over alleged antisemitism, often conflating criticism of Israel with anti-Jewish discrimination. As universities face pressure and potential loss of federal funding, some are launching lengthy investigations into faculty members, who bear significant personal and professional costs regardless of the outcome.</p>

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have used the increasingly precise data to observationally confirm a key theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. By analyzing the merger of two black holes, researchers verified Hawking's area theorem, which states that the surface area of the resulting black hole can never be smaller than the sum of the original two. This breakthrough, made possible by significant upgrades to gravitational wave detectors, provides powerful evidence for one of the fundamental rules governing black holes and marks a posthumous triumph for the celebrated physicist.</p>
