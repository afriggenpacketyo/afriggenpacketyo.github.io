          <p>A small 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The tremors were felt across parts of the New York City area and as far as Connecticut, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, this event was minor and not expected to cause significant issues. This follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude quake that shook the region in April 2024.</p>

          <p>In a detailed interview, convicted serial killer David Berkowitz reflects on the 1976-1977 murder spree that terrorized New York City, for which he is serving six life sentences. He describes his current life in prison, his turn to religion, and the "dark forces" he claims drove him to kill six people and wound seven others. The article provides extensive context from the era, including the fear that gripped the city and the police investigation that led to his capture. Berkowitz expresses remorse but maintains a detachment that offers little comfort to survivors and victims' families.</p>

The article recounts the brutal 1991 crime, the subsequent investigation, and the complex legal history involving four initial suspects whose convictions were later overturned due to new DNA evidence. Investigators and families still hold out hope that advancements in DNA technology, focusing on a small male DNA sample found at the scene, might one day identify the killer or killers and finally bring justice.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop Advanced Electronic Warfare Tech to Protect Friendly Forces</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a new electronic warfare capability using drone swarms to create a protective "storm eye" for friendly forces. By precisely coordinating signals, the drones can jam enemy communications while simultaneously creating a null zone where allied signals are unaffected. This targeted approach marks a significant advancement over traditional brute-force jamming, which disrupts all communications within range. The technology could provide a major strategic advantage for the People's Liberation Army in future conflicts.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford's availability for practice remains uncertain as he deals with a persistent back issue that has sidelined him during training camp. Coach Sean McVay stated that Stafford recently visited a specialist and is considered "week to week," with no definitive timeline for his return. His absence is a major concern for the team, which relies on the veteran quarterback to be a Super Bowl contender. In the meantime, backup quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett are taking first-team and second-team reps.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a long-time champion of open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more "careful" with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts with China's vigorous embrace of open-source AI, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced models. AI expert Andrew Ng suggests that China's competitive open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in the field. The divergence highlights a strategic crossroads in global AI development, balancing open collaboration with competitive and security concerns.</p>

          <p>World record holder in the 400m hurdles, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, demonstrated her versatility by winning the 400m flat at the U.S. track and field trials. She clocked a season's best of 48.90 seconds, securing her spot at the upcoming World Athletics Championships in Tokyo for the event. McLaughlin-Levrone chose to compete in the flat 400m instead of her signature hurdles event, a move that raised interest in the track community.

          <p>A group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca has reportedly reached a deal to purchase the WNBA's Connecticut Sun for a record $325 million. The deal, which is pending league approval, includes plans to relocate the team to Boston starting in the 2027 season. The sale price significantly exceeds the previous record expansion fee of $250 million. The Mohegan Tribe, which has owned the Sun since 2003, had announced it was seeking a buyer, and the move reflects the WNBA's rapid growth and increasing franchise valuations.</p>

          <p>The 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia in 1943 has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during World War II, but it perished just days from England. For decades, the accepted story was that the animal died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, new research by Australian university students and museum archivists, who analyzed the attendant's logbook, revealed the platypus likely died from heatstroke due to inadequately regulated water temperatures as the ship crossed the equator.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of major theme parks to boost its economy and drive local consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example of this trend, with over 4,400 amusement facilities now operating nationwide. According to the global theme park association IAAPA, the industry is a significant economic driver, with every yuan of revenue generating nearly four yuan in the local economy. This strategy is part of a broader effort to encourage domestic tourism and consumption as a pillar of economic growth.</p>

          <p>Kori Schake, a foreign policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, argues that President Trump's "America First" approach is dangerously weakening the nation's global standing. In an interview, she contends that Trump's belief that allies are a burden ignores how U.S. power relies on international cooperation. Schake warns that by imposing arbitrary tariffs and questioning security pacts, the administration is pushing allies like Japan and South Korea to hedge against the U.S. She believes conservatives must challenge this isolationist turn to prevent the collapse of a beneficial international order.</p>

He explains the formal protocols and "firewall" that allow him to report on NPR's internal affairs, such as the recent defunding by Congress, with journalistic independence. Folkenflik notes the current media landscape is defined by pressure from the Trump administration, deep public distrust, and rampant misinformation. He views his role as essential to living the network's values, even when it creates internal tension.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "From The Clinics To The Capitol," Professor Carol Mason argues that the anti-abortion movement has become a key facilitator for far-right and white nationalist ideologies in the U.S. Mason traces the evolution of the movement's rhetoric from opposing abortion to an "insurrectionary" mindset that disregards the rule of law, drawing parallels between clinic protests and the January 6 Capitol riot. She contends that shared themes, such as a belief in a global cabal and a desire to protect "Western Christian civilization," have created a bridge between anti-abortion activists and other extremist groups.</p>
