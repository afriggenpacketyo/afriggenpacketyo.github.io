          <p>Billy Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts due to a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, a condition causing issues with hearing, vision, and balance, as stated on his Instagram. Joel is undergoing physical therapy and has been advised by his doctor to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Normal pressure hydrocephalus involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to pressure and potential brain damage, particularly affecting walking, bladder control, and cognitive functions. He had previously postponed concerts due to surgery and physical therapy and apologizes to his fans for the cancellation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis reveals that the House Republican tax bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," disproportionately benefits wealthy Americans through tax cuts on business income, investments, and high-tax area homeowners, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Lower-income households would see a decrease in income due to reductions in social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which are used to offset the cost of the tax cuts. The bill preserves a lower top tax rate of 37% and a tax break for investments in "opportunity zones," while imposing stricter work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP beneficiaries. This bill now heads to the Senate for consideration. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit argues that President Trump's appointment of Todd Blanche as acting Librarian of Congress was unlawful, therefore Blanche cannot remove or replace Perlmutter.

Grigorovich's choreography departed from the dominant style of Soviet ballet, dramatic ballet, by emphasizing dancing and athletic spectacle.

While many new ETFs will be traditional asset allocation products, Nadig advises caution with new, complex strategies, noting that some, like private credit ETFs, have seen limited demand.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet reveals that contrast-enhanced mammography identifies three times as many invasive cancers as ultrasound in women with dense breast tissue, which often obscures tumors in standard mammograms. The study found that contrast-enhanced mammography detects smaller tumors than regular mammography, though MRI scans are slightly better at detecting more tumors overall. Contrast-enhanced mammography involves using an iodine-based dye to highlight tumors. The study suggests that contrast-enhanced mammography should become the standard of care for high-risk women with dense breasts, though its use for screening has not been approved by the FDA due to concerns over allergic reactions.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has criticized Israel for allowing only a "teaspoon of aid" into Gaza, warning that Palestinians are facing the "cruelest phase" of the war and are at risk of famine. Guterres noted that 80% of Gaza is either militarized or under evacuation orders, and that the full blockade since March 2 has only just eased, but that the resumed aid is insufficient to meet the desperate need. He also highlighted "atrocious levels of death and destruction" in the region.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Freedland discusses the growing hatred between Israelis and Palestinians, describing it as a “biblical rage” that is devouring reason and preventing both sides from seeing anything but their own perspective. He points to the moral indefensibility of Israel's actions in Gaza, including the use of hunger as a weapon, and the antisemitic nature of the deadly assault on the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC. He notes the difficulty people have in holding both facts at once, fearing that acknowledging one weakens the force of the other.</p>

The debate has led to a standstill between the city council and the mayor regarding plans for the intersection, with some businesses suing the city over safety concerns.

          <p>President Trump is pressuring Apple to manufacture iPhones in the United States, threatening tariffs of at least 25 percent on those made abroad. This ultimatum is part of a long-standing effort to get Apple to move its supply chain to the U.S., although Apple has shifted production to other countries like India and Vietnam. Experts say making iPhones in the U.S. would be expensive and difficult, potentially doubling prices to $2,000 or more. China offers advantages such as a large workforce and skilled engineers, while Apple has been moving some production to India to avoid local taxes.</p>
