          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 22:37:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, set to fully take effect after 24 hours of winding down operations. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested that while Iran had ceased strikes, there was no formal agreement, and the final decision on military operations would be made later. The conflict, which began on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, has resulted in significant casualties on both sides. Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while other officials engaged with Iran through various channels, with Qatar helping to broker the deal. Optimism remains cautious as details are clarified and confirmed by all parties.</p>

          <p>Singer Jessie J has undergone surgery for breast cancer after revealing her early diagnosis earlier in June.

She had scheduled the surgery after performing at Capital's Summertime Ball. Jessie J's post included pictures of her partner and son visiting her in the hospital, as well as a video of her singing in her hospital bed, and she has received widespread support from colleagues for sharing her experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments by Â£5 billion a year by 2030. The welfare reform bill includes proposals making it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The reasoned amendment cites concerns about pushing people into poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. The vote on the government's bill is scheduled for July 1, and the level of support among Labour MPs indicates a potential rebellion facing ministers.</p>

          <p>Florida is planning to build a migrant detention center in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," to hold an estimated 1,000 people. The facility will be located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport and is expected to cost $450 million a year to run. Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier argues the location acts as a natural deterrent for escapees, citing the presence of alligators and pythons. The proposal has been criticized by Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniela Levine Cava, who expressed concerns about the potentially devastating impacts on the Everglades ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the rescission of the 2001 Roadless Rule, a policy that protected 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, arguing that the move would enable better forest management and reduce fire risk. Environmental groups have denounced the decision, citing potential harm to wildlife habitats, water sources, and recreational opportunities. Opponents also dispute the claim that eliminating the rule will reduce fire risk, arguing that commercial logging can exacerbate climate change and increase the intensity of wildfires.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning or the chance to challenge their removal. The court lifted an injunction issued by a federal District Court judge in Massachusetts, with the three liberal justices dissenting. Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the decision as an abuse of the Court's discretion, noting instances where the government wrongfully deported individuals to dangerous countries. Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin praised the ruling as a victory for American safety and security.</p>

This follows a tumultuous day in the region, with Iran retaliating for U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Trump warned of an overwhelming American response to any Iranian attacks, but later suggested Iran's response was weak and that it was time for peace.</p>

          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar's production has strengthened China's dominant position in the global heavy rare earths supply chain, particularly for dysprosium and terbium, crucial in high-tech manufacturing. As China began implementing environmental controls, rare earth extraction shifted to Myanmar, with Chinese business involvement in the development of these mines. A report from Global Witness indicates that China has effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar, resulting in significant environmental and human rights costs.</p>

          <p>Street vendors in Los Angeles, particularly those undocumented, are facing heightened fears due to increased immigration raids. Many vendors are forced to choose between risking deportation to provide for their families and staying home safely. The raids have caused economic hardship, with some families struggling to pay bills and afford essential expenses like medicine and tuition. Organizations are stepping in to provide support, including "Know Your Rights" workshops and financial assistance to help vendors stay home and provide for their families. Despite the fear, there are also stories of unity and mutual aid within the community.</p>

          <p>A boat capsized on Lake Tahoe, resulting in eight fatalities after the body of the last missing person was recovered. The 27-foot Chris-Craft boat capsized due to a large swell near D.L. Bliss State Park. The Coast Guard initially reported six deaths, with two people rescued and two missing, later confirming the recovery of the remaining individuals. Sudden changes in weather conditions, including high winds and a storm system, contributed to the incident, prompting officials to emphasize the importance of preparedness and safety measures before boating.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing its plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the United States to study at Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs issued an injunction, citing concerns that the administration's actions violated Harvard's free speech rights. The administration had accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, allegations the university denies. The ruling prevents the administration from blocking the ability of international students to attend Harvard, where almost 6,800 international students are enrolled.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of UK veterans are taking legal action against 3M, alleging they were issued defective earplugs during their service, leading to hearing loss. The claim asserts that the Combat Arms Earplugs, supplied to the Ministry of Defence between 2003 and 2023, suffered from a design defect preventing a complete seal in the ear. The law firm representing the veterans points to evidence from US litigation indicating 3M knew about the defect. The legal action follows a $6 billion settlement made by 3M in the US regarding the same earplugs, though the company accepted no liability.</p>
