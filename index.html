          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The initial launch will involve approximately 10 vehicles, with the potential for rapid scaling to thousands if the launch proceeds without incidents. These robotaxis will be Model Y vehicles equipped with the latest version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, known as FSD Unsupervised. Musk emphasized the importance of starting small to ensure safety and confirm the technology's reliability before wider deployment, a service which he has been promising since 2016.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has issued temporary flight restrictions for Newark Liberty International Airport, capping hourly departures and arrivals due to technology outages, staffing shortages, and runway construction. Flights will be limited to 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, then 34 departures and 34 arrivals until October 25, aiming to reduce delays and improve passenger safety. United Airlines, the airport's largest operator, supports the restrictions. The FAA acknowledges a shortage of air traffic controllers, with only 24 currently overseeing Newark, significantly less than the 38 deemed necessary for smooth operations, exacerbating the existing staffing crisis nationwide.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to urge support for a budget package facing opposition from both conservative and moderate factions. Conservatives are demanding deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates are resisting changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). Trump emphasized the need for unity and warned against division, particularly over SALT, while Speaker Mike Johnson aims to reconcile the factions and pass the bill before the Memorial Day deadline. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will permit Covid-19 vaccine use for adults over 65 and those with medical conditions this fall but will require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. Agency leaders stated there was evidence to justify approval only for older people and those with medical conditions. The new rules mark a departure from the previous policy of offering annual Covid shots to everyone 6 months and older. Some experts worry the new criteria go too far, erecting barriers for people who will want the shots.</p>

Bass also urged the state legislature to increase film and TV production tax credits to enhance the state's competitiveness.

The system aims to create a network of satellites to detect, track, and intercept missiles, including those launched from space.

          <p>An article discusses the growing use of nicotine pouches among young people as an alternative to vaping, with some users becoming addicted. Health experts warn that these pouches, often referred to as "snus" by teenagers, are addictive and may have harmful side effects, while remaining largely unregulated in the UK. Some campaigners fear that the upcoming ban on disposable vapes could lead more young people to turn to these stronger nicotine pouches. Retailers claim they do not sell the pouches to under-18s, and manufacturers say they are intended as a harm reduction technique for smokers.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden's announcement of his prostate cancer diagnosis has revived questions about his health while in the White House, amid reports that his aides sought to conceal deteriorating conditions from the public before the 2024 election. The 82-year-old former president received the diagnosis on Friday after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms. Republicans argue that Biden, who ran for re-election as the oldest president in history at 81, was mentally and physically unfit for office. The cancer diagnosis has prompted renewed scrutiny of the former president's health and transparency during his term.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul issued a formal apology for the atrocities committed at the Thomas Indian School, a boarding school where Native American children were systematically stripped of their culture and subjected to abuse. The school, which operated from 1855 to 1957, was described by Hochul as a "place of nightmares" and "a site of sanctioned ethnic cleansing." Hochul met with Seneca Nation members who attended the school, with one recalling having his mouth washed out with soap for speaking his native language. While some applauded the apology, others expressed that it meant little to those who experienced the trauma inflicted by the state.</p>
