            <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company is assessing the effects of President Trump's tariffs, suggesting that its extensive network of third-party sellers might transfer these costs to consumers. This statement indicates that consumers may experience increased prices on goods sold through Amazon due to the imposed tariffs. The degree to which these costs are passed on will likely depend on various factors, including the specific goods and the competitive landscape within the e-commerce market. This could impact consumer spending habits and overall inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs have sparked concerns among consumers, businesses, and investors, despite a temporary 90-day pause on most new tariffs. The tariffs aim to pressure nations into favorable trade deals and encourage domestic manufacturing, but economists warn they could act as a tax on businesses and consumers, potentially leading to higher prices and economic slowdown. The long-term outlook remains uncertain, with some experts suggesting tariffs could increase the risk of a recession. The administration views tariffs as a means to revive manufacturing, but doubts persist about the feasibility of rebuilding domestic industries. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. and Russia have carried out a prisoner swap, releasing Ksenia Karelina, a dual Russian and American citizen, in exchange for Arthur Petrov, a dual Russian-German citizen. Karelina was imprisoned in Russia for donating to a Ukrainian aid charity, while Petrov was accused of exporting military-grade electronics in violation of U.S. sanctions. The exchange, negotiated by intelligence agencies, took place in Abu Dhabi and was described as less tense than previous swaps. This event marks the second such exchange since Donald Trump returned to the White House.</p>

Trump criticized the "ridiculous" amount of time it takes to wet his hair in the shower, stating that Americans should be free to choose their showerheads without federal meddling.
