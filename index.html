            <p>The president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, stated that he would not order the return of a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego García, who was wrongly deported to a Salvadoran mega-prison. Bukele stated that he does not have the power to return him to the United States. The comments came after the Trump administration claimed it is not legally obligated to secure Abrego García's return. The Justice Department argued that asking El Salvador to return Abrego García should be considered “foreign relations” and outside the scope of the courts.</p>

            <p>Critics are raising concerns that proposed GOP Medicaid cuts could severely impact treatment for fentanyl addiction. A report by Democrats on the Congressional Joint Economic Committee warned that treatment for over a million people receiving medical care for opioid addiction could be affected. Medicaid has become a leading source of insurance coverage for addiction treatment, with nearly 90% of medical treatment for opioid and fentanyl addiction at least partially funded through Medicaid. Concerns are growing that these cuts could derail the national recovery from the fentanyl-overdose epidemic.</p>

Palin sued the newspaper over a 2017 editorial about gun control that wrongly suggested she may have incited a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona. Palin lost her first trial in 2022, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a retrial. Opening statements are scheduled to begin on Tuesday. The Times maintains that Palin's lawsuit concerned a "passing reference to an event in an editorial" that was not about her.</p>

The Liberal party confirmed the incident and said that the Liberal leader, Mark Carney, had made it clear “this does not fit his commitment to serious and positive discourse”.</p>
