          <p>Texas Democrats have once again prevented a legislative quorum, halting a special session aimed at passing a Republican-led redistricting plan. The GOP proposal would create several new Republican-leaning congressional districts, which has prompted Democrats to flee the state despite threats of arrest and loss of pay. Tensions are escalating as the governor seeks to compel their return through legal action and by withholding paychecks, while the defiant Democrats are likely to remain absent until the session's end. The standoff highlights the intense national battle over redistricting and its impact on political power.</p>

          <p>Gold futures retreated from record highs following a White House announcement that it would issue an executive order to clarify its tariff policies on gold bullion. The move came after the Swiss Precious Metals Association expressed concern that new U.S. tariffs, reportedly as high as 39% on Swiss exports, were being applied to 1-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars. This uncertainty had driven prices up, but the promise of clarification from the White House helped ease market concerns about the international flow of the precious metal. The clarification is expected to apply to gold imports from all countries, not just Switzerland. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an extract from her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described her arrest in connection with an investigation into the Scottish National Party's finances as the "worst day of my life." She recounts her disbelief when police raided her home and arrested her then-husband, Peter Murrell, who was later charged with embezzlement. Sturgeon, who was later cleared of any wrongdoing, also writes candidly about personal struggles, including a miscarriage and public rumors about her sexuality. The memoir offers a personal look into the immense pressure she faced during the high-profile political and legal ordeal.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly gave a Soviet-era award to President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, intended for a senior CIA official whose son was killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The gesture, involving the Order of Lenin, is seen as a psychological tactic to highlight a sensitive and unusual situation where the son of a U.S. intelligence officer joined Russian forces. Sources indicate the CIA official's son had mental health challenges and was not recruited by Russia, which was unaware of his family background when his remains were repatriated. The incident occurred during Witkoff's visit to Moscow to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>With Chicago facing a severe budget shortfall, concerns are growing in New York City that a similar fiscal crisis could emerge if democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani wins the upcoming mayoral election. Mamdani is running on an ambitious platform that includes free bus fares, tuition-free CUNY, and government-run grocery stores, funded primarily by a "millionaire's tax." Critics, including incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, argue that these socialist policies are fiscally unsustainable and could drive wealthy residents out of the city. The situation in Chicago serves as a cautionary tale for New York's future financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to the latest CDC data, COVID-19 levels are rising across the United States, with wastewater surveillance indicating a "moderate" level of viral activity nationwide. The Western U.S. is currently experiencing the highest concentration of the virus, with states like California, Colorado, and Utah reporting high levels. While overall hospitalizations and deaths remain lower than in previous years, other metrics like emergency room visits for COVID-19 are also increasing. Health officials advise that vulnerable populations, including the elderly and immunocompromised, should remain cautious as the summer surge continues to grow in 45 states.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has formally directed the Pentagon to develop military options for potential use against Mexican drug cartels, which his administration has designated as foreign terrorist organizations. While officials state that any military action is not imminent, the directive authorizes the preparation of plans for operations against these groups. The move follows Secretary of State Marco Rubio's comments that the terrorist designation allows the U.S. to use all elements of national power, including the military and intelligence agencies. This escalation raises significant legal and diplomatic questions regarding U.S. military intervention in Mexico to combat cartel activities.</p>

          <p>A rapidly spreading wildfire, named the Canyon Fire, has forced the mandatory evacuation of thousands of residents in Southern California, near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Igniting on Thursday, the blaze exploded from 30 to nearly 5,000 acres by Friday morning, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions. While the fire is partially contained, authorities have issued evacuation warnings to an additional 14,000 people as high temperatures continue to challenge firefighting efforts.

The group, Democracy Defenders Fund, alleges that the Department of Defense may have broken laws by accepting the foreign gift and diverting nearly a billion dollars from a nuclear missile program to retrofit the aircraft. Critics argue the plane is redundant, as the Air Force already operates two Air Force One jets with replacements on the way.

          <p>The EU's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude oil is unlikely to derail ongoing free trade negotiations between the European Union and India. Experts suggest the move is largely symbolic and that a greater pressure on New Delhi comes from the United States, where President Trump has threatened steep tariffs on Indian goods. This potential U.S. trade friction may paradoxically increase India's desire to secure a reliable trade agreement with the EU.

          <p>The Bed Bath & Beyond brand is being revived, with the first new store, named Bed Bath & Beyond Home, opening in Nashville, Tennessee. The relaunch is being managed by The Brand House Collective, which acquired the license to operate physical stores after the original company went bankrupt and sold its intellectual property. To honor the brand's legacy, the new store will accept all old 20% off coupons, regardless of their expiration date. The company plans to open several more stores in the Nashville market before potentially converting dozens of its existing Kirkland's Home locations nationwide.</p>

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has launched a sharp, undiplomatic attack on UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his criticism of Israel's military operations in Gaza. Responding to Starmer's call for a ceasefire, Huckabee provocatively compared Israel's situation to Britain's fight against the Nazis, asking if the UK surrendered and dropped food on them. He invoked the controversial WWII bombing of Dresden, stating, "That wasn't food you dropped," and suggested the UK would be speaking German if Starmer had been prime minister then. The comments represent a severe diplomatic breach and reflect Huckabee's history of inflammatory pro-Israel rhetoric.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record high of over $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, many Americans are struggling with compounding interest charges. This article outlines several strategies to combat this debt, including transferring balances to a credit card with a 0% introductory APR to pause interest accumulation. Other effective methods include enrolling in a credit card issuer's hardship program for temporary relief, or using a lower-interest personal loan to consolidate multiple high-rate debts into a single, more manageable payment. These proactive steps can help break the cycle of growing debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain high but are expected to fall, a CD laddering strategy offers a timely way for savers to maximize returns while maintaining flexibility. This approach involves opening multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates, such as three months, six months, and one year. This allows savers to lock in today's favorable rates before they decline further, while ensuring that portions of their money become accessible at regular intervals. In an unpredictable economy, this strategy balances the benefit of high yields with the need for liquidity, preventing funds from being tied up for too long. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists believe they may have discovered the wreck of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer ship that exploded and sank during an attack on a North Carolina port in 1748. The remains were found among four shipwrecks at the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site. Wood sample analysis suggests the ship was built with materials from the Spanish Caribbean, and its location is near where a cannon from La Fortuna was recovered in 1985. The discovery, along with other colonial-era artifacts, offers a significant opportunity to understand the maritime history, trade, and military conflicts of one of North Carolina's earliest port towns.</p>

He sustained the injury during the final Test against India but bravely returned to bat with his arm in a sling in an attempt to secure a victory. While surgery would require a recovery time of three to four months, potentially clashing with the Ashes, a rehab-focused approach could see him return in about eight weeks. Woakes stated that taking the risk of re-injury through rehab might be necessary to ensure his availability for the critical series.</p>

The comet, which is traveling at 130,000 mph, will pass safely between the orbits of Mars and Earth and poses no threat. Hubble's observations have helped narrow down the size of its icy core to no more than 3.5 miles across.

The lower court had found officials willfully disregarded an order to halt the deportations, which were carried out without due process. However, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit Court, including two Trump appointees, ruled that the lower court's order raised "troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions" like foreign policy.
