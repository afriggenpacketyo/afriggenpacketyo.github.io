          <p>West Yorkshire Police are searching for a suspected metal thief, Jacob Ryan, who is believed to have been injured in a house explosion he caused in Bradford. The incident occurred at an empty property but also damaged two neighboring homes, resulting in minor injuries to a man, woman, and child. Another 27-year-old man, found seriously injured nearby, has been arrested on suspicion of theft, with police believing the two were attempting to steal metal from the unoccupied house when the explosion happened.</p>

          <p>A UK Cabinet minister has stated that figures like far-right activist Tommy Robinson are successfully connecting with a widespread "sense of disquiet and grievance" across the country. The comments followed a London march organized by Robinson, which drew up to 150,000 participants and led to a counter-protest. While emphasizing that the violent minority would be held accountable after 26 officers were injured, the minister described such events as "klaxon calls" for the government to address public concerns, particularly regarding immigration.</p>

          <h2>Finnish Researchers Develop Sustainable Method to Recover Silver from E-Waste</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 08:51:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Finland have discovered a new, environmentally friendly method to extract silver from electronic waste using common kitchen ingredients like vegetable oil and hydrogen peroxide. This sustainable technique avoids the harsh acids and toxic solutions typically used in metal recovery, offering a safer and more scalable alternative. The process is highly selective for silver, and its development could lead to small-scale recycling kits, supporting a circular economy and reducing the environmental impact of mining for precious metals.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived in Israel to address growing diplomatic tensions with Washington and other allies. The visit follows Israel's controversial airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, which also killed a Qatari security officer, and concerns over accelerated settlement expansion in the West Bank. Rubio aims to balance criticism of the strike with overall support for Israel, as several key allies like the UK and France prepare to formally recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has revealed that the European Ryder Cup team is using a novel training method to prepare for their upcoming defense in the United States: virtual reality headsets that simulate crowd abuse. Captain Luke Donald provided the equipment to help players desensitize themselves to the hostile environment expected at the Bethpage course in New York. McIlroy noted that players could customize the intensity of the simulated heckling, calling it an innovative attempt to mentally prepare for the pressure of playing on American soil.</p>

          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending three technology stocks—Broadcom, Zscaler, and Oracle—as strong long-term investments, largely driven by their potential in the artificial intelligence sector. Broadcom is favored due to accelerating AI-related demand and a new $10 billion customer, while cybersecurity firm Zscaler is recognized for strong demand for its Zero Trust solutions. Oracle's stock surged after it reported massive growth in its contracted cloud revenue, reinforcing optimism about its AI infrastructure capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who took her own life in April, has called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations of sexual abuse. In an interview with the BBC, Giuffre's brother stated that every individual, regardless of royal status, should be held accountable under the law. He expressed that Prince Andrew being stripped of titles and publicly shamed was insufficient, arguing that the allegations warrant a thorough criminal inquiry. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the claims and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed scrutiny to a state law allowing concealed-carry permit holders to have firearms on college campuses. The bill, passed shortly before the incident, added to Utah's already permissive gun legislation, which includes permitless carry. While the legal status of the shooter's weapon is unclear, the timing has highlighted the ongoing debate over campus safety and gun control, contrasting with Utah's typical focus on "school hardening" measures rather than restricting firearm access.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) campaign, spearheaded by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is reportedly increasing the burden on mothers by promoting stringent and sometimes scientifically unsupported dietary rules. The movement's condemnation of ingredients like seed oils and processed foods forces parents, particularly mothers, into time-consuming and expensive shopping habits to meet these standards. Critics argue that while the campaign aims to improve children's health, it creates additional stress and labor for mothers without providing adequate federal support to make these ideals achievable for all families.</p>

          <h2>Advice Column Addresses Moral Scrupulosity and the Pitfalls of Striving for Perfection</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This advice column addresses a reader's struggle with scrupulosity—a constant and paralyzing worry about being a morally perfect person. The author suggests that aiming for "The Most Possible Good" is an unrealistic standard for humans, who are inherently flawed and must navigate conflicting values. Drawing on rabbinic teachings, the column reframes "sinning" as "missing the mark" and advocates for self-compassion, which research shows can lead to greater personal accountability. The piece encourages embracing imperfection rather than striving for an angelic, and ultimately paralyzing, standard of moral optimization.</p>

To protect oneself, it is recommended not to answer the door for strangers, to verify any salesperson's credentials by contacting their company directly, and to always get a written contract before agreeing to any work.</p>

          <p>Following days of violent anti-corruption protests that led to the ousting of her predecessor and left at least 72 people dead, Nepal's interim Prime Minister, Sushila Karki, has vowed to end corruption. The former chief justice acknowledged that her appointment was driven by youth-led "Gen Z" demonstrators who organized online and demanded good governance and economic equality. Karki has promised that her interim government will not remain in power for more than six months and has set a date for new elections in March.</p>

          <p>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, representing families of Israelis held by Hamas, has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being the "one obstacle" to securing their release. The group claims that every time a potential deal approaches, Netanyahu sabotages it, citing the recent Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar as the latest example. Netanyahu has defended the strike, arguing that eliminating Hamas leadership is key to ending the war, but the families contend this is an excuse to prolong the conflict and cling to power.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by university scholars warns that the Colorado River's major reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are so depleted that another dry year could trigger a crisis. The researchers are urging the Trump administration to impose immediate and significant water use cutbacks across the seven states reliant on the river, rather than waiting for interstate agreements. They argue that current water consumption is unsustainable and that proactive federal action is necessary to prevent the need for more "draconian measures" in the near future if drought conditions persist.</p>

          <p>Oscar Eagle, who was sentenced to 25-years-to-life for a gang-related shooting as a teenager, has been exonerated and released from prison after more than two decades. His conviction was vacated based on ineffective legal counsel and questionable conduct by detectives from the LAPD's infamous C.R.A.S.H. unit during the Rampart scandal era. Eagle maintained his innocence, providing an alibi that he was at a hospital and physically unable to commit the crime due to a recent gunshot wound, evidence his original lawyer failed to present at trial.</p>
