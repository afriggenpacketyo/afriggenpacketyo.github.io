        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's National Health Service is experiencing significant challenges as resident doctors commence a five-day strike over a pay dispute. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that while disruption is unavoidable, efforts are being made to maintain essential services, urging patients to attend appointments unless cancelled. The British Medical Association (BMA) is demanding pay restoration to offset inflation since 2008, while the government has refused to negotiate on pay, leading to a stalemate. Previous walkouts have caused over a million appointment cancellations, and this strike continues to strain the healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's presidential trip to Scotland is being complicated by new details about his connection to Jeffrey Epstein. Reports from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal describe a birthday book for Epstein from 2003, allegedly containing contributions from Trump and other public figures like Bill Clinton. The controversy has intensified due to the Trump administration's decision not to release the full Epstein investigation files. Despite Trump's denials and a libel lawsuit against the Journal, the continuous emergence of evidence detailing their relationship keeps the issue in the public spotlight.</p>

          <p>German business leaders and politicians are warning that the country risks losing economic influence and opportunities in Africa as global competitors like China, India, and Turkey expand their presence. Despite Africa's growing markets and demand for infrastructure, German exports to the continent have stagnated over the past decade. Analysts point to a lack of a clear, long-term strategic vision from Berlin, which has hindered German companies from securing key contracts, especially for critical raw materials essential for green technologies. A strategic reorientation is being called for to leverage Germany's positive reputation and foster more robust, equal partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

Launched in 2018 and later shut down by the Department of Justice, the initiative faced widespread criticism for alleged racial bias against researchers of Chinese descent and a series of failed prosecutions. Over 1,000 researchers and academics have signed a letter opposing its revival, arguing that it harms America's ability to attract global talent and damages innovation, ultimately weakening national security rather than strengthening it.</p>

          <p>Mental health experts are drawing attention to the under-diagnosis of depression in older adults, a problem often compounded by social stigma and misattribution of symptoms to the normal aging process. While symptoms are similar across age groups, depression in the elderly can present with more physical complaints, leading to delayed recognition and chronic conditions. Treatment is also more complex due to potential interactions with medications for other physical ailments. Researchers note that older adults, especially those with suicidal thoughts or other health issues, are frequently excluded from clinical trials, slowing progress in understanding and treating the condition effectively.</p>

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering a refinance, current mortgage rates remain a significant factor in affordability. As of late July 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is around 6.79%, while a 15-year loan averages about 6.01%. Experts suggest that borrowers with strong credit profiles in the mid-to-high 700s are most likely to secure the best rates. To improve chances of a favorable loan, it is crucial to strengthen one's credit score, pay bills on time, and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the most advantageous terms and lowest fees for your financial situation.

          <p>Mhairi Black, the former deputy leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at Westminster, has announced she has left the party. Black, who became the UK's youngest MP in centuries when elected at age 20 in 2015, cited disagreements with the party's direction, particularly its stance on trans rights and Palestine. She stated there were 'too many times' she did not agree with party decisions and felt the SNP had 'capitulated' on important issues. First Minister John Swinney expressed regret over her decision but affirmed the party's commitment to LGBT rights and resolving the crisis in Gaza.</p>

They allege they were subjected to beatings and inhumane treatment, including being forced to eat with their hands. Their release was part of a prisoner exchange involving the U.S., Venezuela, and El Salvador, highlighting a controversial aspect of U.S. immigration policy.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its full-year financial forecast after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit. The company attributed the decline to a €1.3 billion hit from U.S. tariffs in the first half of the year and €700 million in restructuring costs. These challenges, combined with lower margins on its growing electric vehicle sales, have forced the company to lower its expected operating return on sales. The results highlight the significant pressure on European carmakers from global trade disputes, particularly President Trump's import tariffs, and intense competition from Chinese brands.

This article provides context on the global diplomatic landscape, noting that most nations worldwide already acknowledge the State of Palestine, a trend that began after the PLO's 1988 declaration of independence. While key Western powers like the U.S., Canada, and Germany have not offered formal recognition, preferring it as part of a final peace deal, momentum has been building.

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a move that enables her to serve in the position in an acting capacity. The decision came after a federal court in New Jersey declined to extend her interim appointment and instead named her deputy to the post, sparking a leadership dispute with the Justice Department. By pulling the nomination, the administration sidesteps a federal law that would have restricted her from serving as an acting officer. This procedural maneuver highlights a contentious struggle over a key federal prosecutor position.</p>

          <p>An intense heat dome that has been affecting the central U.S. is now moving eastward, bringing extreme temperatures to the East Coast. Over 100 million people are under heat alerts, with forecasters predicting temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average and feels-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in many areas. The phenomenon is caused by a persistent high-pressure system trapping hot air over a region. In the Midwest's Corn Belt, the heat has been exacerbated by 'corn sweat,' a process where cornfields release large amounts of water vapor, significantly increasing humidity and the heat index.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that despite declining poll numbers and internal rifts within the MAGA movement over issues like the Epstein files, Donald Trump's hold on power may not be weakening. The author contends that tyrants do not rely on public support, but rather on intimidating voters, suppressing protest, and controlling institutions. The article points to the Trump administration's efforts to access voter rolls, train poll watchers, and deport critical journalists as evidence of this strategy. It concludes that while Trump is not invincible, overcoming his power requires active, organized resistance rather than just waiting for his popularity to fade.</p>

As global warming makes the Northern Sea Route more navigable, China, a self-declared 'Near-Arctic State,' sees it as a vital new shipping pathway to enhance efficiency and counter U.S. geopolitical influence. Chinese scholars argue that these Arctic routes offer a strategic advantage over traditional passages. The U.S. investment is framed as a move to reassert American control over the 'frozen frontier' amidst growing international interest and competition.</p>

These communities, most prevalent in Florida and California, typically have Homeowners Associations (HOAs) that enforce rules and collect fees to maintain shared facilities. Homes within these communities often cost more but also tend to have higher appreciation rates, making them an attractive, albeit expensive, option for many buyers. (not investment advice)</p>
