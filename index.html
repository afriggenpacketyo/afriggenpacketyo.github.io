          <p>Several companies, including Abbott Laboratories, Apple, Chobani, and Honda, have announced plans to expand manufacturing in the United States, spurred in part by the Trump administration's tariffs. While some companies do not directly attribute their decisions to tariffs, the White House has promoted these moves as beneficial for domestic job creation. Economists remain skeptical that tariffs alone can drive such strategic shifts, citing factors like labor costs and political stability as more influential, but some economists note that tariffs can nurture emerging industries where consumers can easily substitute domestic products.

          <p>A 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck Istanbul, Turkey, causing widespread panic and minor injuries as people fled buildings. The quake, centered in the Sea of Marmara, triggered dozens of aftershocks and was felt in neighboring provinces. While there were no reports of collapsed buildings, some structures sustained damage, and many residents sought refuge in parks and open areas.

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, the owner of a paddleboard firm, received a 10-year and six-month prison sentence after four individuals died during a paddleboarding excursion on the Western Cleddau river in Wales in 2021.

          <p>The European Union has levied fines totaling €700 million on Apple and Meta for non-compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), aimed at curbing the power of big tech companies.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pro-natalism movement, gaining influence within the Trump administration, aims to increase the American birthrate and enforce right-wing social values, particularly concerning women's roles. Proposals include fertility awareness classes and "baby bonuses," while conspicuously lacking measures to support existing mothers, such as paid family leave or affordable childcare. Critics argue the movement's true agenda is to encourage primarily white births and push women out of the public sphere, reinforcing regressive gender roles. Some liberals have joined the pro-natalist chorus, focusing on affordability, but critics argue this concedes the movement's point about women's roles.</p>

          <p>South Korean society is deeply divided as it approaches the June election to replace President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached for declaring martial law. Polarization is exacerbated by historical factors, economic anxieties, and differing views on North Korea. Generational divides and reliance on social media contribute to the fragmentation, with little optimism for a narrowing of the political divide. This tense environment makes the future uncertain.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for a perceived lack of "moral courage" on transgender issues during Prime Minister's Questions. The debate was sparked by a UK Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" based on biological sex. Badenoch accused Starmer of being a "weather vane" and failing to clearly state his position, contrasting it with the Conservative Party's stance. The exchange highlighted the ongoing political divisions surrounding transgender rights in the UK.</p>
