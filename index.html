          <p>A shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado resulted in the death of one student and critical injuries to two others after a juvenile suspect opened fire. The suspect also sustained self-inflicted gunshot wounds and was hospitalized. The incident, which took place both inside and outside the school, prompted a massive law enforcement response that involved clearing the building room by room. The event has raised concerns among parents regarding safety protocols during non-structured school times like lunch, highlighting the challenges of preparing for such emergencies.</p>

The incident has triggered a manhunt for the suspect and has drawn widespread condemnation from political figures across the ideological spectrum.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In excerpts from her new book, former Vice President Kamala Harris describes former President Joe Biden's decision to run for re-election as reckless and overly reliant on personal ambition. She suggests the stakes were too high for the choice to be left to an individual's ego, though she admits she was poorly positioned to advise him against it. Harris also expresses frustration with Biden's inner circle, claiming they often failed to defend her and sometimes fueled negative narratives about her leadership. Despite these criticisms, she maintains that Biden was far more capable than Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region displayed a mixed performance after U.S. stocks reached record highs, driven by optimism over cooling inflation and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.

In the United States, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at new records, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell, partly due to a decline in Apple's stock price following its latest product announcement.

          <p>History teachers across the U.S. are implementing new strategies to educate students who have no living memory of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Through programs like one hosted by the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, educators connect with survivors and first responders to bring authentic, first-hand accounts into their classrooms. The curriculum focuses on conveying the national trauma, the subsequent global war on terror, and the period of national unity that followed the attacks. These efforts aim to ensure that the historical significance and complex legacy of 9/11 are not forgotten.</p>

          <p>According to eyewitnesses, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was engaged in a debate about gun control and mass shootings at the moment he was fatally shot at Utah Valley University. The single gunshot struck Kirk in the neck just as he was about to respond to a student's question on the topic, a tragic irony noted by those present. The outdoor event, part of Kirk's "Prove Me Wrong" tour, was attended by over 3,000 people but reportedly had minimal security measures, such as metal detectors. Attendees described the scene as initially confusing before turning to panic as the situation became clear.</p>

Unlike the slow, heavily regulated world of broadcast television, online influencers can quickly capitalize on trends and build loyal communities.

The goal is to prevent China from gaining dominant market share and to undercut the growth of American rivals. The adviser warned that the technological gap between the U.S. and China has narrowed significantly, necessitating urgent and coordinated action on export controls and supply chain security.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old woman has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging that one of its drivers abandoned her in an unsafe location, which directly led to her being sexually assaulted. According to the suit, the driver kicked her out of the car for vomiting, leaving her miles from her destination without her phone or keys. She was then approached by two individuals who, under the pretense of helping her, took her to an apartment where she was sexually assaulted at knifepoint. The lawsuit accuses Uber of a severe breach of its duty of care and of being dismissive when the incident was later reported.</p>

          <p>England cricket captain Harry Brook described the rain-disrupted T20 match against South Africa as a "shambles of a night." Multiple weather delays resulted in a heavily reduced game, with England ultimately chasing a revised target in just five overs and falling short. Brook argued that no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from such a chaotic contest. He also supported the team's decision to rest key bowler Jofra Archer, stating it would have been foolish to risk him in the slippery conditions with important matches, including the upcoming Ashes series, on the horizon.</p>

          <p>Shares of online real estate platform Opendoor soared by 30% in after-hours trading following a major leadership overhaul. The company appointed former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and named influential co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman of the board. This move comes after a period of intense investor pressure, led in part by Rabois, which resulted in the resignation of the previous CEO. The company's stock has seen a dramatic turnaround this year after nearly being delisted, fueled by a surge of interest from retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee is pressuring the government to accelerate reforms of the Lifetime ISA (LISA), arguing the savings product is flawed and a poor use of public funds. MPs found that the LISA's dual purpose for home buying and retirement can lead to unsuitable investment choices and that its rules unfairly penalize those on benefits. The committee also highlighted that the product is projected to cost taxpayers £3 billion over five years, despite evidence that most users would have bought their first home without it. They are calling for significant changes to be included in the upcoming November Budget.</p>

          <p>Researchers are examining the "dark DNA" of Australia's vibrant peacock spiders to unlock the secrets of their incredible diversity, which includes more than 100 known species. This so-called dark DNA consists of non-coding genetic material that is far more prevalent in these spiders than in humans and is believed to drive their rapid evolution. Each tiny species boasts unique colors and performs an elaborate, rhythmic mating dance. By mapping the DNA of every species and correlating it with their distinct behaviors, scientists hope to understand the fundamental processes that create such rich biodiversity in the natural world.</p>

          <p>Prominent security experts are expressing growing concern over the emergence of a potential "anti-Western alliance" centered around China and Russia, with increasing alignment from nations like North Korea and India. A recent military parade in Beijing attended by leaders Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un was cited as a worrisome public display of this deepening partnership. Analysts argue that while it is not a formal military treaty like NATO, this functional coalition is actively working to establish a new global order based on authoritarian power. This strategic shift suggests that Beijing no longer views reconciliation with Washington as a viable goal.</p>

          <p>In a bipartisan vote, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a measure to repeal the two Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMFs) that justified the wars in Iraq in 1991 and 2003. This move is part of a sustained effort by members of Congress to reassert their constitutional power over matters of war and peace. Proponents of the repeal argue that the decades-old authorizations are obsolete and create a risk of misuse by presidents seeking to launch military actions without new congressional approval. The measure, attached to the annual defense bill, now faces consideration in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Senator Maria Cantwell is raising alarms about the SCORE Act, a federal bill intended to regulate college sports, arguing it would solidify the financial dominance of the Big Ten and SEC conferences. In a letter to her Senate colleagues, she warned that the bill would create a "distorted system" at the expense of smaller schools, student-athletes, and Olympic sports. The proposed legislation, supported by the NCAA, would provide a limited antitrust exemption and prevent athletes from being classified as employees. Cantwell's analysis highlights a growing revenue gap that she believes threatens competitive balance and the future of college athletics.</p>

          <p>According to senior administration officials, President Donald Trump had a "heated" phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the recent airstrike in Qatar. Trump reportedly told Netanyahu that attacking Hamas leaders within the territory of a key U.S. ally and mediator was an unwise decision. Netanyahu is said to have defended his action by stating he had a very brief window of opportunity and chose to seize it. The strike has been widely condemned for jeopardizing the fragile ceasefire negotiations and has exposed a significant point of friction between the American and Israeli administrations.</p>
