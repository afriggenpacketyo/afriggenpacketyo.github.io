          <p>The European Union is navigating a period of intense economic strain as it contends with aggressive trade policies from both the United States and China. The bloc is currently deliberating its response to President Trump's announcement of a 30% tariff on all EU-made goods, with internal pressure mounting for retaliatory measures. French President Emmanuel Macron has advocated for using the EU's anti-coercion instrument if a deal isn't reached, while Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has signaled a more cautious approach. This challenging situation is compounded by upcoming high-stakes trade discussions with leaders in Asia, particularly in Beijing, highlighting the EU's precarious position between two global superpowers.</p>

          <p>This article details the harrowing story of Jayden Perkins, an 11-year-old Chicago boy who was tragically killed while heroically defending his mother from a violent ex-boyfriend. The horrific attack was witnessed by his five-year-old brother, Kameron, with whom Jayden shared a birthday and a deep bond, starkly illustrating the devastating and lasting trauma domestic violence inflicts upon children. Jayden is remembered by his grieving family as a hero who loved his younger brother dearly, teaching him to spell and sharing Halloween traditions with him. The piece serves as a powerful reminder of the hidden victims of domestic abuse and the profound loss experienced by those left behind, putting a human face on a widespread societal issue.</p>

          <h2>Singapore's Economy Grows in Q2, Averting Recession Amid Global Trade Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:56:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession thanks to strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. This growth was partly fueled by businesses front-loading exports ahead of a temporary tariff pause and a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Despite the positive figures, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year. The government has downgraded its full-year GDP forecast from 1-3% to 0-2%, reflecting ongoing volatility in international trade and the potential impact of U.S. tariff policies.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers used their first two picks in the Major League Baseball draft to select a pair of teammates from the University of Arkansas. With the 40th and 41st overall picks, the team chose left-handed pitcher Zach Root and outfielder Charles Davalan. Root, a junior transfer, posted a 3.62 ERA with 126 strikeouts, while Davalan, a sophomore, hit .346 with 14 home runs and demonstrated excellent plate discipline. Both players were instrumental in leading the Razorbacks to the College World Series. The selections represent a strategic move by the Dodgers to bolster their future prospects with talent from a top-tier collegiate program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's trade data for June revealed stronger-than-expected performance, with exports growing 5.8% year-over-year, beating analyst predictions. This surge is attributed to businesses rushing shipments to capitalize on a temporary tariff truce with the United States before a potential August deadline. In a significant development, imports rose by 1.1%, marking the first increase of the year and signaling a potential revival in sluggish domestic demand. The data reflects exporters' successful diversification into markets like Southeast Asia and the EU to offset declines in U.S.-bound trade, though the overall economic outlook remains tied to ongoing negotiations with Washington.

Authorities urged all search crews and volunteers to evacuate the river corridor immediately, deeming the situation dangerous and life-threatening. The pause complicates the massive ongoing effort to locate at least 161 people who remain missing across the flood-ravaged Hill Country, where difficult terrain and weather have already hampered search efforts.</p>

          <p>Kwon Ping Ho, the founder of the luxury Banyan Group hotel chain, observes that today's tourists have vastly different expectations compared to those traveling 30 years ago. He notes that younger, more seasoned travelers are jaded with traditional sightseeing and are instead seeking deeper, more authentic experiences that allow for interaction with local communities. This shift from checklist tourism to experiential travel is a significant trend, with Gen Z travelers being more willing to splurge on unique experiences than previous generations. Ho also highlights the rise of "rainbow tourism," where travelers from a diverse range of developing nations are exploring destinations all over the world, changing the traditional west-to-east flow of tourism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17 to 19, hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle. The invitation, personally extended by the monarch, is seen as a significant diplomatic move by the British government to maintain close ties with the U.S. president. Unlike his first state visit in 2019, this trip is not expected to include an address to Parliament, which will be in recess. The visit comes amid geopolitical tensions, including Trump's trade war with Canada, another nation where King Charles serves as head of state.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is marking a major scientific milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation. This unbroken sequence of handwritten data, which began on July 14, 1795, is the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland, providing an invaluable record of climate change. The tradition continues today with a human observer manually recording data, a practice now rare in an era of automated stations. The observatory's long history has contributed significantly to meteorology, including the development of the cup anemometer for measuring wind speed. The data clearly shows a warming climate, with current observer Shane Kelly noting that the distinct seasons of the past have blurred.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, a meeting that follows the president's announcement of a plan to facilitate weapons sales to Ukraine. The plan involves selling advanced U.S. weapons to European NATO allies, who could then transfer their existing military hardware to Kyiv more quickly. This strategy aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities against Russia's complex air assaults while also generating business for the U.S. The discussions come as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to take a stronger stance against Russia, including potential sanctions targeting countries that support Moscow's war economy, giving the president a "sledgehammer" of economic leverage.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that Europe's liberty is facing its greatest threat since World War Two, citing complex geopolitics and the rise of "imperialist policies." In a speech to the armed forces, he announced plans for a significant increase in France's defense spending, aiming to double the military budget to €64 billion by 2027, three years ahead of schedule. Macron referenced the threat from Russia and instability in global alliances as key reasons for the military buildup, stating, "To be free in this world, you must be feared. To be feared, you must be powerful." The proposed budget increase reflects a broader trend among European nations to bolster their defense capabilities.</p>

The shooting spree ended when Lexington police officers arrived at the church and fatally shot the suspect. Two other men were also wounded by the gunman at the church, with one reported in critical condition, while the injured trooper is stable.</p>

Despite underperforming relative to high preseason expectations and dealing with an injury-plagued pitching staff, the team holds the best record in the National League. The first half was marked by both brilliance, such as pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto's stellar performance, and inconsistency, including struggles from the bullpen and slumps from key veteran hitters. While the team has not been as dominant as anticipated, they enter the All-Star break in a strong position to contend for a second consecutive championship.</p>

Key tactical adjustments, such as moving Lauren James to a wider role and starting Ella Toone, have proven highly effective.

          <p>The UK is experiencing a "notably different" climate compared to just a few decades ago, with extreme weather events becoming the new normal, according to a new report from the Met Office. The assessment reveals that the country is breaking heat and rainfall records with increasing frequency due to global warming, leading to more very hot days and fewer extremely cold nights. The report highlights that 2024 was one of the warmest years on record, and this trend is continuing into 2025. This changing climate is also getting wetter, particularly in winter, increasing flood risks and having a significant impact on the natural world, affecting species and ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by some conservative figures abroad, is facing a growing challenge at home. While his nationalist, anti-immigration, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric has secured him multiple election victories, his power is now being threatened not by the liberal left, but by a challenger from the center-right, Peter Magyar. Magyar has gained significant traction by focusing on domestic issues like the poor state of hospitals, schools, and railways, and capitalizing on a government scandal. With a stagnating economy and growing public discontent, Orban's long-successful playbook of identifying external threats may be losing its effectiveness with Hungarian voters.</p>

          <p>A severe, multi-year drought in northern Mexico is escalating a long-running water dispute with Texas, centered on an 81-year-old treaty. Mexico is in arrears on its obligation to send water from the Rio Grande to the U.S., prompting threats of tariffs and sanctions from the Trump administration. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, where reservoirs are at critically low levels, argue they cannot give water they don't have. Conversely, Texan farmers, who are receiving insufficient irrigation water, accuse Mexico of hoarding the resource. The conflict highlights the inadequacy of the 1944 treaty in the face of modern climate change, population growth, and agricultural demands, threatening a critical bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending its decision to impose a 50% tariff on Brazil, framing it as part of a broader strategy to onshore production and address a national security emergency posed by trade deficits. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated the move is necessary for an overall strategy, even though the U.S. currently has a trade surplus with Brazil. The justification was questioned, as President Trump's letter to Brazil also referenced the criminal case against his political ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro. The administration also defended new tariffs on copper, citing the need to secure metals for American weapons production. (not investment advice)</p>

He referenced the park's strict curfew, performing until his microphone was cut off.
