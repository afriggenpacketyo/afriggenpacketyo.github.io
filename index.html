        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volvo Cars has announced a $1.9 billion cost-cutting initiative due to a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter, impacted by reduced wholesales, adverse currency effects, and industry turbulence. The company's operating profit fell to 1.9 billion krona from 4.7 billion krona in the same period last year, with EBIT margin narrowing to 2.3%. The cost-cutting plan involves investment reductions and potential redundancies across its global operations. Volvo Cars is also adjusting its U.S. product lineup to focus on growth and optimize its manufacturing footprint, while navigating challenges like increased tariffs and price competition in the electric vehicle market. The automaker has also retracted its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026, citing market headwinds. Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Electricity has been mostly restored to Spain nearly 18 hours after a major blackout affected the country and neighboring Portugal, impacting critical infrastructure such as airports and trains. Spain's national power company, Red Eléctrica, reported that 99% of power demand in Peninsular Spain was being met, and all substations were operational. The cause of the blackout, which stranded millions, remains under investigation, with officials stating there were no signs of foul play like a cyberattack. Portugal's electricity supplier, REN, also reported restoring most of its substations, though some areas remained without power. Optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>BP reported a 49% drop in first-quarter profit, with underlying replacement cost profit at $1.38 billion, falling short of analyst expectations due to weaker crude prices. This comes after the energy company announced a strategic reset to rebuild investor confidence, focusing on its core oil and gas business while reducing renewable spending. Despite the profit dip, BP announced a dividend of 8 cents per ordinary share and a $750 million share buyback. CEO Murray Auchincloss highlighted operational achievements, including record upstream operating efficiency and refinery performance. Net debt increased to $26.97 billion, reflecting previously warned lower upstream production. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have secured a victory in the Canadian election, fueled by a backlash against Donald Trump's rhetoric and trade threats. Carney, a political newcomer, successfully framed the election as a defense against Trump's attempts to undermine Canada's sovereignty. The Conservatives made gains but fell short, while divisions within Canada were highlighted by the election results, with the Liberals largely shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Carney has pledged to govern for all Canadians and address the economic challenges posed by Trump's policies. Optimism score is 60.</p>

The image brought attention to the lack of options for athletes who become pregnant or have young children. As a result, many major events, including the London Marathon, have implemented pregnancy deferral policies, with Power's advocacy playing a crucial role in driving these changes. This represents a positive shift toward greater inclusivity and support for female athletes. Optimism score is 90.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering extending the sugar tax to include milkshakes and lattes, aiming to further reduce sugar consumption and tackle obesity. The proposal includes reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before the levy applies from 5g to 4g per 100ml. While some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families, others welcome the move as a necessary step in addressing obesity. The consultation period will run until July 21, and the government estimates that most soft drinks are already exempt due to widespread reformulation by manufacturers. Optimism score is 65.</p>
