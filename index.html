          <p>A major study commissioned by the US Department of Health and Human Services in early 2022, revealing significant links between alcohol consumption and cancer, was reportedly buried by the Trump administration due to pressure from the alcohol industry. The study's authors claim that negative health effects of drinking alcohol start at low levels of consumption and increase sharply with more drinks per day. The suppression of this report raises concerns about public health and corporate influence, as it was intended to inform the federal government's dietary guidelines. Critics argue that the administration's actions prioritize industry interests over public knowledge, potentially leading to preventable illnesses and deaths. Optimism is low given the potential for increased health risks due to lack of information. </p>

          <p>Chris Brain, a former priest convicted of indecent assaults against women in a "cult-like" church group known as the Nine O'Clock Service (NOS), will face a retrial on remaining charges next year. Brain ran the influential NOS in Sheffield during the 1980s and 1990s, attracting hundreds of young people, but was found guilty last month on 17 counts of indecent assault. The Crown Prosecution Service seeks a retrial on four counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault where the jury couldn't reach a verdict. This development follows an apology from the Bishop of Sheffield for the abuse of power that occurred, which is a step in the right direction. </p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met in Beijing for their first talks in six years, marking Kim's fifth visit to China. The meeting occurred a day after Kim joined Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a Victory Day military parade in Tiananmen Square, commemorating the end of World War II. This gathering is viewed as a rare display of unity against the West and a calculated act of defiance against US-led pressure. Kim's visit underscores China's continued support for North Korea and its diplomatic outreach, despite international tensions. This meeting could potentially lead to shifts in regional dynamics. </p>

The discussions in Paris, involving the "Coalition of the Willing," are set to include a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump. Moscow views the potential deployment of Western forces as a threat to the European continent, while Zelenskyy seeks security guarantees to facilitate a U.S.-brokered peace deal. Trump defended his administration's actions against Russia, citing tariffs on Indian goods. </p>

          <p>The prevalence of students using AI to cheat is a growing concern, but research suggests that AI has changed the method rather than the amount of cheating. Studies indicate that cheating has been prevalent long before the advent of AI, with various factors influencing student behavior. As AI becomes more integrated into education, it is essential to unpack our understanding of cheating and how kids are using AI in school. There is a call for new skills in a world of AI, such as knowing when to strategically choose automation or evaluating trustworthiness of information from AI. </p>

          <p>California is losing jobs to other states due to its broken "California model," which once relied on investments in higher education and infrastructure. While the state still excels in innovation, it struggles to retain manufacturing jobs, which are moving to states with fewer regulations, cheaper energy, and a lower cost of living. The aerospace industry exemplifies this trend, with companies developing products in California but manufacturing them elsewhere. This pattern alarms state leaders, who seem more focused on green energy and Hollywood than on addressing the underlying issues affecting job growth and economic opportunity for middle- and working-class Californians. </p>

          <p>The presence of armed, camo-clad soldiers on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., is seen as a normalization of excessive federal force under President Trump. National Guard troops from Republican-led states have been deployed to supplement those from Washington, D.C., which are under the president’s direct command. This militarization of America's front yard, along with the presence of Department of Homeland Security agents, raises concerns about the federal government's takeover of the District of Columbia. Critics argue that these actions, along with threats to other cities, amount to the creation of a national police force under presidential control, eroding the traditional role of local law enforcement. </p>

Experts recommend creatine monohydrate supplements certified by a third-party and advise consulting a doctor before use, especially for individuals with kidney disease.
