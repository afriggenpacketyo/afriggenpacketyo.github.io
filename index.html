          <p>Severe flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to the deaths of at least 104 people, with dozens still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose to unprecedented heights, causing catastrophic damage, particularly in Kerr County where a summer camp for girls suffered numerous fatalities. A major disaster declaration has been signed, and extensive search and rescue operations are underway involving state and federal agencies. Meteorologists attribute the rapid flooding to a convergence of storms and remnant tropical moisture falling on drought-parched soil.</p>

The announcement has brought profound grief to the community, which is now also contending with scammers attempting to extort money from victims' families. In response to the tragedy, authorities have issued warnings about these fraudulent activities and are continuing extensive search operations. The camp's owner was also reported to have died while trying to rescue the children.</p>

          <p>Lord Norman Tebbit, a prominent and influential figure in Margaret Thatcher's government, has passed away at the age of 94. As a loyal Thatcher ally, he was known for his role in implementing laws to curb union power during his time as trade and employment secretary. Lord Tebbit was also admired for his courage and stoicism after he and his wife were severely injured in the 1984 IRA bombing in Brighton. Political figures from across the spectrum have paid tribute to his significant impact on British politics.</p>

          <p>According to international relations experts, ongoing US tariff pressure on Japan and South Korea could create an opportunity for China to strengthen its trilateral cooperation with the two nations. While analysts suggest that Tokyo and Seoul are unlikely to abandon their strategic alliance with Washington, the trade tensions may incentivize them to pursue more stable economic ties with Beijing. China, in turn, may offer further economic incentives to promote this closer relationship, capitalizing on the pragmatic approach of Japanese and Korean leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

The German Foreign Office described the incident as "entirely unacceptable," stating that it endangered German personnel and disrupted the naval operation aimed at protecting commercial shipping. This action represents a significant and dangerous escalation, prompting a formal diplomatic protest from Berlin.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined digital bank Monzo £21 million for significant failures in its systems to prevent financial crime. An investigation revealed that the bank's controls did not keep pace with its rapid customer growth, leading to serious breaches, including accepting customers who used implausible addresses like Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street. Monzo stated that the issues date back more than three years and have since been resolved. (not investment advice)</p>

The organization, which documented widespread voting fraud, said its shutdown was forced by the recent imprisonment of its co-chair, a move it described as an attempt to silence them completely. The closure marks a significant blow to civil society and transparency in Russia's increasingly controlled political and electoral system.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers claims to have developed a revolutionary communication system that allows military units to transmit vast amounts of data without emitting any active radio signals. This technology, described by one expert as a form of "telepathy," could make combat forces effectively invisible to electronic warfare, protecting them from interception, jamming, and targeted strikes. The breakthrough has the potential to fundamentally alter the dynamics of modern warfare by eliminating the risk of signal detection.</p>

          <p>A report has identified Byrnihat, a small town in northeastern India, as the world's most polluted city in 2024. Its severe air pollution, with PM2.5 levels over 25 times the WHO's safe limit, is attributed to a combination of factors. These include emissions from its 80 industrial factories, heavy vehicular traffic from a major national highway, open-air coal storage, and a unique bowl-shaped topography that traps pollutants, leading to a public health crisis.</p>

This article argues that the ruling effectively ends the era of light regulation for the internet, establishing a new legal framework that makes it easier for lawmakers to impose child-safety measures. This precedent is expected to empower further state and federal regulations targeting not just pornography but also social media and artificial intelligence platforms.</p>

          <p>Amid growing confusion, the UK's Transport Secretary has advised air travelers to assume the 100ml liquid limit for hand luggage remains in effect. The warning comes as some airports, including Birmingham and Edinburgh, have installed new CT scanners that permit larger liquid containers, while most other UK airports have not. This inconsistent rollout has created a patchwork of rules, and passengers are urged to check with their specific airport before traveling to avoid issues at security.</p>

This controversial policy includes detaining individuals with serious criminal convictions separately from post-9/11 war-on-terror prisoners.

Unlike trends in many other nations, some Chinese studies indicate that adolescents from more affluent and educated families face a higher risk of suicide. This suggests that the relentless pursuit of success in a highly competitive environment, now amplified by the age of AI, is a critical factor affecting the well-being of China's younger generation.</p>
