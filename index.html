          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been eliminated from the US Open after a decisive 6-1, 6-2 loss to Elena Rybakina in the third round. Raducanu, who won the tournament in 2021, struggled against the ninth seed's powerful serves and returns, failing to find her rhythm throughout the match. The defeat serves as a reality check for Raducanu, who had shown recent signs of progress but continues to have difficulty against top-10 opponents. The match highlighted Rybakina's dominance from the baseline and her ability to control the pace of play.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many Americans are seeking financial relief. This article outlines several debt relief options available, each with distinct qualification requirements based on factors like credit score, income, and level of financial hardship. Programs discussed include traditional debt consolidation loans, which typically require a credit score above 650, and debt forgiveness programs designed for those facing severe financial distress. Other options explored are debt management plans from credit counseling agencies and temporary forbearance programs offered by credit card issuers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend sees historic 'trophy' ranches, some held within families for over a century, being listed for sale, often due to disagreements among heirs or a lack of interest from the next generation. High-end ranch brokers report a surge in inventory as these legacy properties, highly sought after for their privacy and vast acreage, enter the market for the first time. This phenomenon is driven by the generational transfer of wealth and the complexities of managing such large assets among scattered family members. While some sellers hope for fellow ranchers to purchase the properties, many expect wealthy buyers from tech or finance to acquire these iconic Western landscapes.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose to a 2.9% annual rate in July, its highest point since February. This increase, which met economists' expectations, suggests that tariffs may be impacting the U.S. economy. Despite inflation running above the Fed's 2% target, markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in the upcoming month, with policymakers balancing inflation risks against signs of a weakening labor market. The report also indicated consumer spending remained strong, increasing by 0.5% during the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the main suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, is set to be released from a German prison by mid-September after completing a sentence for a separate sexual assault conviction. German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters stated that while Brückner remains the sole suspect in the McCann case, there is currently insufficient evidence to press charges against him for her disappearance. Authorities consider the 48-year-old dangerous and are seeking to place him under restrictions, such as an ankle tag, upon his release.

          <p>The Department of Transportation, under the Trump administration, has canceled $679 million in federal funding designated for twelve offshore wind power infrastructure projects across the United States. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the projects as 'wasteful,' stating the funds would be redirected to upgrade ports and other maritime infrastructure. The largest single project affected is the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind terminal in California, which lost approximately $427 million in support. This move is part of a broader administration campaign against renewable energy development, which has also included halting work on existing projects.</p>

          <p>This article contrasts California Governor Gavin Newsom's strategy of deploying California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers to target specific crimes in cities with President Trump's use of the National Guard. While both approaches aim to create a visible show of authority to deter crime, the piece argues they stem from different philosophies on public safety. Newsom's CHP 'strike teams' are presented as a data-driven supplement to understaffed local police, focusing on specific criminal activity. In contrast, Trump's deployment of troops is framed as a broader, more authoritarian approach to repression, highlighting a fundamental difference between law enforcement and military intervention on American streets.</p>

Analysts suggest this visit could be an effort by Kim to mend fences with China and rebalance his foreign policy.

          <p>As Tanzania prepares for its upcoming election, incumbent President Samia Suluhu Hassan is campaigning on a platform of national reconciliation and constitutional reform. However, the political landscape is marked by a fractured opposition, with key figures facing legal challenges or disqualification. The main opposition party, Chadema, was disqualified for boycotting an electoral 'code of conduct,' and its leader is jailed on treason charges. While some analysts note improvements in the electoral system since the controversial 2020 vote, international rights groups have accused authorities of cracking down on dissent and opposition ahead of the October election.</p>

          <p>Louisiana health officials have confirmed that two people have died after contracting Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacteria, from consuming raw oysters. The bacteria thrives in warm coastal waters and can cause severe illness, including necrotizing fasciitis, which is fatal in about one in five cases. This year, Louisiana has recorded 22 infections and four total deaths from the bacteria, with two fatalities linked to raw oyster consumption and two from wound exposure to seawater. The state is experiencing a higher-than-average number of cases, prompting warnings about the risks of eating raw seafood, especially between May and October.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are taking hardship withdrawals from their 401(k) retirement accounts to cover financial emergencies, with 4.8% of participants doing so last year. Financial planners warn that this should be a 'last resort,' as it is a very expensive way to access money. Withdrawals before age 59 ½ are subject to income tax and potentially a 10% penalty, and the withdrawn funds lose the crucial opportunity to grow through compound interest. Experts recommend building an emergency fund as the first line of defense, followed by alternatives like a 401(k) loan or a home equity loan before depleting retirement savings.

          <p>A new report reveals that more than 14,000 migrants, predominantly from Venezuela, have abandoned their journey to the U.S. and are now traveling south from Central America. This 'reverse flow' phenomenon is attributed to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has made it nearly impossible for asylum seekers to legally enter the United States. Migration through the dangerous Darién Gap has dropped 97% this year. These returning migrants face extreme vulnerability, often with depleted funds and few prospects, making them targets for criminal groups as they travel back through perilous regions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has utilized a rare executive maneuver known as a 'pocket rescission' to cancel $4.9 billion in foreign aid that was previously approved by Congress. By proposing the funding cuts late in the fiscal year, the administration ensures Congress does not have the required 45 days to act, causing the funds to expire. This is the first time a president has used this tool in nearly 50 years, effectively bypassing the legislative branch on spending decisions. The cuts target the State Department and USAID, aligning with the administration's broader policy of reducing foreign assistance.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris demonstrated impressive speed by topping the timesheets in both Friday practice sessions for the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. The British driver was closely followed by his teammate Oscar Piastri in the first session and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso in the second. The sessions were marked by several incidents, including heavy crashes for Aston Martin's Lance Stroll and Williams's Alex Albon, as Formula 1 returned from its summer break. The strong performance from McLaren suggests they could be competitive for the remainder of the race weekend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to use a 'pocket rescission' to block $4.9 billion in approved foreign aid has drawn sharp, bipartisan criticism from Capitol Hill. Senator Susan Collins, a leading Republican, called the move an 'unlawful' attempt to rescind funds without congressional approval, violating the Constitution's separation of powers. The maneuver, which withholds the funds until they expire at the end of the fiscal year, is seen by some as a threat to future bipartisan spending deals. Democrats warned that the action erodes trust and could increase the likelihood of a government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Shares in Chinese tech giant Alibaba climbed over 10% after the company reported better-than-expected profits for its fiscal first quarter. The strong performance was driven by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division, fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence services. The company reported that its AI-related product revenue has maintained triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the acceleration in the high-margin cloud business and continued recovery in its core e-commerce segment.</p>

The complaint states that Seraphin's comments are malicious lies and that Wilkins is not Israeli and has never been to Israel.

The new rule would apply even in cases of sexual assault and incest, with an exception only when the mother's life is directly endangered. This move would reverse a 2022 Biden administration policy that expanded abortion access for veterans following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The proposal has drawn thousands of public comments and strong opposition from abortion rights advocates and veterans' groups, who argue it is cruel and will endanger women's lives.</p>
