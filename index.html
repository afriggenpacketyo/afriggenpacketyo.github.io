          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML aimed to calm investor anxieties regarding its 2026 growth, simultaneously announcing an anticipated "significant" decline in China sales for the next year. The company, which recently became Europe's most valuable listed firm, reassured stakeholders that its 2026 total net sales would not fall below 2025 levels, promising further details in January. ASML maintained its forecast for an approximate 15% annual sales increase in 2024 with a 52% gross margin, benefiting from the AI boom and strong third-quarter orders. However, U.S. chip export restrictions to China and potential further tariffs pose ongoing challenges, impacting future demand from Chinese customers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended that veterinary practices be legally required to publish their prices, enabling pet owners to compare costs and find better deals. A CMA investigation found that vet prices have increased by 63% over seven years, nearly twice the rate of inflation, often leaving owners in the dark about potential expenses. The watchdog also highlighted that practices owned by large corporate groups charge significantly more than independent vets. These provisional findings propose solutions like mandating ownership disclosure, capping prescription fees, and prohibiting treatment-specific bonuses to address transparency and cost concerns in the £6.3 billion industry.</p>

Fisher, who boasts nearly 700,000 Instagram followers, expressed profound disappointment over the canceled appearances in Perth and Sydney, lamenting that he would spend his 52nd birthday in a detention hotel.

          <p>Team GB track cyclist Jack Carlin, a four-time Olympic medalist, has announced his retirement from the sport at 28, citing a loss of motivation after the Paris Olympic Games. Carlin, who earned team sprint silver and sprint bronze in both Paris and Tokyo, admitted he couldn't "ignite that spark again" following a severe crash in his final Olympic event. Despite earlier excitement for the Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Games, he concluded that he could no longer commit 100% to the rigorous demands of elite cycling. Carlin, who is Scotland's fourth most decorated Olympian, expressed contentment with his achievements and is now exploring a new identity beyond professional cycling.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, has resulted in at least 16 fatalities, with officials warning the death toll could increase. Fire services recovered the bodies, many burnt beyond recognition, which will require DNA testing for identification. The blaze, which began around midday, was extinguished after three hours, but an adjacent chemical warehouse continued to burn, exacerbating the danger. Most victims died from inhaling highly toxic gas, compounded by a locked roof door, highlighting persistent safety standard issues in Bangladesh's densely populated industrial areas. Police are investigating the factory and warehouse owners for potential illegal operations and lack of fire safety clearances.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's recent trip to Israel and Egypt was framed as a victory lap for his decisive role in brokering the Gaza ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. While Trump's pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was crucial for the agreement, this article clarifies that the deal is merely a ceasefire, not a peace agreement or the start of a peace process. Significant work remains on the framework's details, including the demilitarization and governance of Gaza, which currently lacks the necessary political will from all parties. The ceasefire remains fragile, with early violations and ongoing tensions, including Hamas's reassertion of power and Israel's demands for the return of all hostage bodies.</p>

          <p>Royal Mail has been issued a substantial £21 million fine by Ofcom, the UK's communications watchdog, for consistently missing its first and second-class mail delivery targets. The company delivered only 77% of first-class mail and 92.5% of second-class mail on time in 2024/25, falling short of its 93% and 98.5% targets. This marks the third fine in recent years for delivery delays, prompting Ofcom to demand a credible improvement plan, warning that further penalties are likely without significant changes. Royal Mail acknowledged the decision, attributing recent service adjustments, including reduced second-class deliveries in some areas, to efforts to improve overall quality.</p>

          <p>Far-right U.S. influencer Candace Owens lost her High Court appeal against Australia's decision to deny her a visa for a speaking tour, citing concerns she could "incite discord." Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke rejected her application in October 2024 due to her history of downplaying the Holocaust and making Islamophobic comments. The High Court unanimously upheld Burke's decision, affirming that the Migration Act's provisions, while burdening political communication, serve a legitimate purpose in protecting the community from visitors who would "stir up or encourage dissension or strife." Burke stated that allowing Owens entry was not in Australia's national interest.</p>

While core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy, showed a slight improvement, experts caution against concluding that deflationary pressure is fading, citing renewed trade tensions and an uncertain growth outlook.

          <p>Fesia Davenport, Los Angeles County’s chief executive officer, received a $2 million settlement this summer for "reputational harm, embarrassment, and physical, emotional and mental distress" caused by Measure G. This voter-approved measure will make her appointed position obsolete by 2028, transitioning it to an elected role. Davenport, a long-time county employee, argued the measure irrevocably impacted her professional career, economic outlook, and future plans. The settlement prevents her from suing the county over issues related to Measure G. This article highlights the personal and professional fallout for a high-ranking official from a significant structural change in local governance.</p>

          <h2>Scholars Suggest U.S.-China Trade Tensions Could Strengthen Beijing's Resolve</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scholars suggest that escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, marked by recent sanctions and tariff threats, could paradoxically strengthen Beijing's resolve. According to experts, external pressure often fosters unity and transforms into motivation for China. The latest flashpoint is the shipping sector, with both nations imposing port fees and China sanctioning a South Korean shipping giant for alleged collaboration with U.S. efforts. This environment sets a tone for the upcoming Communist Party plenum, where China is expected to emphasize a long-term, steady economic strategy, resisting U.S. pressure and maintaining its planned course.

          <p>Donald Trump publicly lambasted Time magazine's latest cover photo, calling it "the Worst of All Time," despite the accompanying article praising his role in the Gaza ceasefire. Trump complained on Truth Social that the image, taken from a low angle with sunlight behind him, "disappeared" his hair and created a "floating crown" effect. The former president, known for his obsession with Time covers, expressed bewilderment at the editorial choice. Guardian Australia's picture editor suggested the photo aimed for a sense of grandeur and contemplation, but acknowledged the aesthetics were unflattering, while Russian officials also criticized the image.</p>

          <p>A TV advertisement by Red Tractor, the UK's largest certifier of farm products, has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for exaggerating its environmental benefits. The ASA ruled that Red Tractor lacked sufficient evidence to substantiate claims that its farms ensured a "high degree of environmental protection." Environmental group River Action, which filed the complaint, accused the scheme of "greenwashing" and urged supermarkets to reconsider its use. Red Tractor, however, called the decision "fundamentally flawed," arguing its primary focus is food safety and animal welfare, not environmental standards, which it leaves to the Environment Agency.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice announced the largest cryptocurrency forfeiture in history, seizing approximately $15 billion in Bitcoin linked to a vast "pig butchering" fraud operation based in Cambodia. Chen Zhi, the founder of Prince Holding Group, was indicted on wire fraud and money laundering charges, though he remains at large. Prosecutors allege Zhi's conglomerate secretly grew into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations, operating forced-labor scam compounds where victims were coerced into cryptocurrency investment schemes. The Treasury Department also sanctioned Prince Group and over 100 associated individuals and entities, citing their roles in illicit activities and human suffering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The State Department, under the Trump administration, revoked the visas of six individuals from various countries for making incendiary social media comments celebrating the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The department stated it has "no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans" and continues to identify visa holders who praised Kirk's death. This action is part of a broader crackdown following Kirk's shooting death on a Utah college campus, which has also seen the Pentagon and Secret Service sideline personnel for negative posts. The government's legal authority to revoke visas based on speech remains an unsettled question, according to legal experts.</p>

          <p>The Labour government is facing increasing demands from the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats to publish evidence submitted in the recently collapsed case against two individuals accused of spying for China. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) clarified it would not obstruct the release of the evidence, contradicting earlier government suggestions that it would be "inappropriate." The case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, charged under the Official Secrets Act, fell apart because crucial evidence from the government on whether China was deemed a national security threat could not be obtained. This has led to accusations of the government being too lenient on Beijing.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials have declared a state of emergency in response to ongoing federal immigration raids, citing widespread fear and financial impact on residents. The proclamation, passed by a 4-1 vote, empowers the county to mobilize resources, seek state and federal aid, and expedite contracts to support immigrant communities. Supervisors stated that the raids have disrupted local economies, decreased workplace attendance, and strained essential services like schools and hospitals. This declaration aims to provide relief, including rent assistance and legal aid, for tenants affected by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions, which have intensified since June.</p>

          <p>The Manhattan District Attorney's office is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in the retrial order for Pedro Hernandez, convicted of murdering Etan Patz. A federal appeals court mandated a retrial or release for Hernandez, citing a judicial error during his second trial regarding jury instructions on involuntary confessions. Hernandez, who has mental health issues and a low IQ, confessed after extensive police questioning, with the confessions being central to his conviction due to a lack of physical evidence. Prosecutors are requesting 90 days to decide on a new trial, while defense attorneys argue for a shorter period.</p>

Senate Bill 243 mandates AI companies incorporate guardrails against self-harm content and require chatbots to alert minors they are not human every three hours, prohibiting sexually explicit content for underage users. Assembly Bill 316 removes a civil legal defense for AI developers, holding them accountable for harm caused by their products. Additionally, AB 621 increases penalties for creating nonconsensual "deepfake" AI pornography, and AB 56 will require warning labels on social media platforms for minors.</p>
