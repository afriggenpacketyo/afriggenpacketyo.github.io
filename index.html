          <p>This article details how Chinese officials are rushing to comply with President Xi Jinpingâ€™s austerity measures, ensuring modest offices and proper meal receipts, as inspectors conduct checks. The campaign, initiated in 2012, aims to curb overspending among Communist Party and government bodies, improve the partyâ€™s image, combat corruption, and reduce wasteful expenditures. Analysts suggest the campaign also ensures resources are wisely allocated to compete with the United States and identifies loyal cadres for promotion. Despite strict media control and the absence of an independent watchdog, questions persist about the campaign's effectiveness in enforcing detailed rules on a large scale.</p>

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond discussed the department's plans following the House settlement agreement, which allows schools to directly pay athletes starting July 1. UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing, the maximum allowed, while maintaining Olympic sports programs and staffing levels. The school will also preserve scholarship limits to provide more revenue sharing money to each player. The revenue-sharing arrangement will prioritize football and men's basketball players, with payments increasing annually as part of the 10-year settlement.</p>
