          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling eligible students to use taxpayer money for private school tuition. The legislation allows most private school attendees to receive $10,000 annually, students with disabilities up to $30,000, and home-schooled students $2,000. While Abbott and supporters hail the bill as a victory for parental choice, Texas Democrats argue it will drain funds from already underfunded public schools, primarily benefiting wealthier families. The article emphasizes the heated debate surrounding the bill, reflecting deep divisions over education funding and access in Texas.</p>

Simion, who is aligned with Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement, secured between 30-33% of the vote, while the governing coalition's candidate, Crin Antonescu, and Bucharest mayor, Nicusor Dan, are tied for second place. The original election was annulled due to concerns over Russian interference, and Simion's campaign is fueled by discontent over high inflation and conspiracy theories related to the canceled vote.

          <p>PBS CEO Paula Kerger stated that the organization is facing unprecedented challenges after President Trump issued an executive order aimed at cutting federal funding to PBS and NPR. Kerger highlighted the potential devastating impact on local stations, particularly in small communities where federal funding constitutes a significant portion of their budget, sometimes up to 50%. The article details how the administration is pursuing multiple avenues to undermine public broadcasting, including challenging corporate sponsorships and potentially rescinding already appropriated funds.

          <p>Alexander Dobrindt, the incoming German interior minister, has expressed skepticism about banning the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, despite its classification as "extremist" by the spy agency. Dobrindt cited the high legal hurdles required to ban a party, stating that the AfD's activities may not meet the constitutional court's requirements for demonstrating aggressive and combative opposition to democracy. The article also includes comments from SPD leader Lars Klingbeil, who believes that governing effectively is a better strategy for diminishing the AfD's influence, and AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, who accused the outgoing interior minister of using the spy agency as a "secret justice system."</p>

          <p>This New York Times article argues that President Trump's expansion of executive power is rooted in a tradition of right-wing thought that favors monarchical and dictatorial rule, drawing from theorists like Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss. The article contends that these thinkers critique liberalism's aversion to conflict and advocate for a sovereign decider, often the executive branch, to make decisive actions for the nation's good. It cites Trump's use of emergency declarations and influence from figures like Russell Vought as evidence of this radical approach to governance, warning of the potential transformation of the presidency into a dictatorial office that disregards the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the upcoming fight between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford, questioning whether it will be more exciting than Canelo's recent bout with William Scull, which was criticized for being dull. While Crawford is considered a top boxer, he will be moving up two weight divisions to fight Canelo, leading to concerns about the physical mismatch. The article draws parallels to Canelo's fight with Amir Khan, where the weight difference ultimately proved decisive, and suggests that Crawford may adopt a defensive style to avoid a similar fate. The author notes that many believe Crawford is only taking the fight for the money, and the bout is designed to be more of a spectacle than a truly competitive contest.</p>
