          <p>The leader of the Unite union has stated that the Labour party is failing to defend working people, prompting a vote to potentially sever its historic relationship and funding. This conflict escalated after the union suspended Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's membership over her handling of bin strikes in Birmingham. The dispute places Labour's traditional union backing in jeopardy, with Unite's general secretary questioning if the £1.2 million in annual affiliation fees could be better spent elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its war on Ukraine, launching a massive overnight assault involving nearly 600 drones and dozens of missiles, resulting in civilian deaths in the city of Chernivtsi. Simultaneously, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, underscoring the deepening military and political alliance between the two nations. This diplomatic engagement occurs as Ukraine pleads for more international support to counter Russia's daily production of terror weapons.</p>

          <p>The England women's football team, the Lionesses, has embraced a new mantra of being 'proper English' to drive their performance at the Euro 2025 tournament. The phrase, signifying fight, tenacity, and being hard to beat, was reinforced after a disappointing opening loss to France. Players say the slogan helped them refocus on their roots and team connection, leading to a convincing 4-0 victory over the Netherlands and reviving their campaign to defend the title.</p>

The piece contends that this approach to domination masks the real human suffering and potential for death within the camp, which has already flooded and seen one prisoner hospitalized.</p>

          <p>This article explains President Trump's unconventional trade policy approach of sending letters to foreign leaders announcing his intent to impose significant tariffs. The letters, which follow a 90-day "pause" on global tariffs, outline new rates for various countries but leave room for negotiation. The piece provides context on this radical strategy and lists the threatened tariff rates for major U.S. trading partners, creating significant uncertainty in global markets.

          <p>An initial investigation into the deadly Air India crash in Ahmedabad has found that fuel to the plane's engines was abruptly cut off just seconds after takeoff. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why they cut the fuel, with the other denying he had done so. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau details how the fuel control switches moved to the "cut-off" position, leading to a total loss of power and the subsequent crash that killed 260 people.</p>

          <p>As Donald Trump's administration builds ties with far-right parties in Europe, France's National Rally is taking a wary and cautious approach. Analysts suggest the party is balancing ideological alignment with the potential negative impacts of U.S. policies, such as tariffs, and the strong antipathy many French voters feel towards Trump. The party, aiming for the presidency in 2027, is pursuing a strategy of moderation to appeal to a broader electorate, creating distance from Trump's more controversial aspects.</p>
