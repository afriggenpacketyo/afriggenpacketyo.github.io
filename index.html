          <p>A new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow, titled "Mark Twain," delves into the life of the celebrated American author. An excerpt from the book details Twain's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, a trip he undertook to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Twain observed the changes to the river towns and landscape he once knew intimately as a steamboat pilot. This return to the pilot house evoked powerful feelings of nostalgia and freedom, reinforcing how his youth remained the magical touchstone of his life and work.</p>

          <p>At least 48 people have died, including 15 children, following catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country, an event officials are calling a mass casualty incident. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, inundating areas including a children's summer camp, from which over two dozen campers are still reported missing. Hundreds of people have been rescued, with some found clinging to trees, as state and federal authorities mount a massive search and rescue operation. Officials noted the rainfall far exceeded forecasts, catching many communities unprepared for the sudden and severe flooding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent rule changes within the Chinese Communist Party suggest that President Xi Jinping could be delegating more power to his deputies. The new regulations focus on standardizing the policy coordination and review process for top-level party organs, such as central commissions and leading groups. According to state media, these bodies are now directed to concentrate on major strategic planning and oversight. One analyst suggests this move might also be a subtle indication of Xi's long-term succession planning, aiming to institutionalize power structures beyond his direct control.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time and charged with the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, whose remains were found in a shallow grave in September 2023. The new indictment reveals that a combination of tranquilizer drugs, which Barry was known to use for sedating deer, was found in her bone marrow. The case, which first saw charges dismissed in 2022, is filled with bizarre clues, including a "chipmunk alibi" and a spy pen that recorded conversations with Suzanne's secret lover. Morphew has consistently maintained his innocence throughout the lengthy investigation.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, a hydrology expert explains the unique geographical factors that make the region, known as Flash Flood Alley, so dangerous. The area's steep hills and less absorbent soil cause rainwater to run off quickly, rapidly swelling shallow creeks and rivers like the Guadalupe. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the Balcones Escarpment, a geologic fault line that can intensify downpours when warm Gulf air is forced upward. The article highlights that Texas leads the nation in flood-related deaths, emphasizing the need for improved forecasting and public awareness of the severe risks.</p>

          <p>A new analysis suggests that President Donald Trump is strategically employing the "Madman Theory," using his perceived unpredictability as a key asset in foreign policy to coerce concessions from both allies and adversaries. This approach has yielded some results, such as compelling NATO allies to significantly increase defense spending, but its effectiveness against hostile nations like Iran and Russia remains questionable. Critics worry this doctrine, characterized by inconsistent statements and actions, could undermine trust in U.S. commitments and ultimately backfire by making American policy paradoxically more predictable based on a pattern of impulsive behavior.</p>

While some users praise it as an excellent tool for long-term saving, others criticize its significant drawbacks, including a penalty for early withdrawal that can cost savers their own money. A key point of contention is the £450,000 property value cap, which has not been updated since 2017 and increasingly penalizes buyers in high-priced areas.

The timeline documents the rapid escalation from routine weather advisories to a mass casualty event with ongoing search and rescue operations.</p>

          <p>Recent cuts to public health and scientific research funding by the Trump administration are impacting the United States' ability to combat HIV. According to a former CDC official, while treatment for current patients remains a focus, significant reductions in funding for prevention research are deeply concerning. Progress on a potential HIV vaccine and cure appears to have been halted, and access to new preventative drugs could be limited. Experts worry these cuts will reverse the recent trend of declining new infections and jeopardize the national goal of eliminating the HIV epidemic by 2030.</p>

With his departure, the Republican majority is now 219-212, giving Speaker Mike Johnson even less room for defections on contentious legislation. Green, who chaired the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business aimed at helping the U.S. compete against China. His seat in the solidly Republican 7th District will remain vacant until a special election is held.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent executive order aimed at curbing the use of Chinese-made drones in the U.S. highlights an ongoing effort to challenge Beijing's dominance in the industry. However, analysts and industry insiders suggest that China's preeminent position in the global drone market makes its products difficult to remove from supply chains. With few non-Chinese alternatives available, a ban could significantly raise costs for commercial drone operators in the U.S. This move is seen by some as a negotiation tactic, reflecting the broader economic tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>An email from the Social Security Administration (SSA) claiming that President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most seniors is being heavily criticized as misleading. Critics, including former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers, point out the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction that phases out for higher earners. They argue the communication from the typically apolitical agency sounds like a partisan political statement and a lie, designed to overstate the benefits of the controversial legislation.

During the conflict, which killed over 900 people in Iran, Khamenei had only appeared in pre-recorded video messages.

          <p>A new study reveals that exposure to high heat and wildfire smoke during pregnancy can negatively impact fetal development. Researchers found that exposure to heat stress, particularly in the month before conception and during the first trimester, was linked to babies being smaller in the womb. The effect was nearly doubled for mothers living in hotter, more climate-vulnerable neighborhoods. Wildfire smoke exposure was also associated with smaller babies, with the combination of both heat and smoke appearing to have a more significant negative effect, highlighting growing climate risks for pregnant people.</p>

The announcement follows a public feud between Musk and President Donald Trump, primarily over a massive new spending bill.
