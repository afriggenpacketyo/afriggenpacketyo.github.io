          <p>China's Generation Z is driving a significant economic boom in the doll fashion market, with young consumers like Clementine Cai investing substantial amounts, sometimes over 3,000 yuan, solely on doll attire. This trend, fueled by the aesthetic appeal and enjoyment of dressing up ball-jointed dolls for photography, has translated into remarkable sales figures. Major e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall reported a more than 117% year-on-year surge in doll clothing sales in 2024, with monthly sales exceeding 10 million yuan (approximately US$1.4 billion) by May. This burgeoning industry underscores the considerable economic influence of youth culture and niche hobbies in the Chinese economy, showcasing a unique consumer behavior that is transforming a niche interest into a powerful market force.</p>

          <p>Ukraine marked 34 years of independence amidst continued conflict, with Russia alleging Ukrainian drone attacks on a nuclear power plant and fuel terminal, though radiation levels remained normal. U.S. Vice President JD Vance indicated that Russia has shown flexibility in peace talks with President Trump, aiming to halt the fighting, despite Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stating no immediate Putin-Zelenskyy meeting is planned. Concurrently, Canada pledged CA$2 billion in military aid and Norway offered $695 million for air defense systems, while Pope Leo XIV prayed for peace. The ongoing war of attrition sees both sides claiming territorial gains and conducting prisoner exchanges, underscoring the complex military and diplomatic landscape surrounding the conflict's future.</p>

          <p>New Justice Department filings allege that Smartmatic executives, previously indicted for bribery and money-laundering in Venezuela and the Philippines, transferred funds from a 2018 Los Angeles County voting machine contract into illicit slush funds. While prosecutors haven't confirmed if LA County money was directly used for bribes, they seek to establish a pattern of misconduct. Separately, Fox News, facing a defamation suit from Smartmatic, alleges LA County's registrar may have received unreported gifts from the company, raising further questions about the contract's integrity. Smartmatic denies corporate wrongdoing, stating the allegations are misrepresentations, while LA County maintains its contract was competitively bid and stands by its work with the company.</p>

          <p>SpaceX postponed its tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight from the Texas Gulf Coast due to a ground systems issue during fueling, following three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures. The flight aimed to test numerous upgrades and stress the vehicle to gather data, with plans for the Super Heavy booster to splash down in the Gulf and the Starship upper stage in the Indian Ocean after deploying satellites and attempting an in-space engine restart. This mega-rocket is crucial for Elon Musk's Mars colonization goals and NASA's Artemis moon landing mission, which relies on multiple successful Starship flights for in-orbit refueling. The ongoing technical challenges cast doubt on the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 lunar mission.</p>

This indication, driven by concerns over a dramatic deceleration in hiring, has spurred investor optimism across global markets. Major indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng are expected to open higher, reflecting this positive sentiment. This follows a strong close on Wall Street, where the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all saw significant increases, with attention now turning to Nvidia's upcoming earnings report.

          <p>A contingent of National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C., fewer than 50, will begin carrying their service weapons starting Sunday night, as directed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This marks an escalation in President Trump's federal intervention into D.C. policing, despite local data indicating a decline in violent crime in recent years. While the troops have primarily protected landmarks and assisted with crowd control without prior reports of threats, their new armed status reflects a shift in their role under the established Rules for the Use of Force, allowing weapons only as a last resort against imminent threats. Local officials have criticized the deployment as unnecessary, emphasizing declining crime rates and the performative nature of the president's rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency due to its infant mortality rate rising to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the national average and the highest in over a decade. This crisis disproportionately affects Black infants, who are more than twice as likely to die. The declaration aims to expedite interventions like expanding prenatal services, regionalizing obstetric care, and strengthening community health programs. Experts emphasize that structural inequities, poverty, and lack of continuous healthcare for mothers are key drivers, while federal funding cuts to programs like PRAMS further complicate efforts to address this critical issue.</p>

The turning point came in a five-run seventh inning, where Dalton Rushing broke a 2-2 tie with a three-run home run, quickly followed by Freddie Freeman's second long ball of the day.

Luckey asserts these "smart weapons" promote peace through deterrence and save American lives by reducing the need for manned missions, despite international concerns and UN calls to ban such "killer robots." His company, which has secured billions in government contracts, aims to revolutionize defense procurement by delivering working products rather than relying on traditional contractor models.</p>

The video, along with an airplane sketch and math formula, was seized from Omar al-Bayoumi, an alleged Saudi intelligence operative with ties to two hijackers, but remained unexamined for years. Retired FBI agents and former CIA analysts express anger and surprise over this intelligence failure, arguing the evidence could have significantly aided investigations and prevented the attacks.

City staff now recommend reimplementing the fee and raising it to $6.60 per month, which could effectively close the funding gap. However, Mayor Paulette Guajardo and Councilman Gil Hernandez oppose the fee, suggesting alternative funding like bond programs or adjusting the general fund reserve, arguing against adding to residents' already increasing utility bills, which already face proposed increases for water, wastewater, and stormwater services.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs of the season against the Athletics, establishing a new single-season record for catchers in major league history. This achievement surpasses Salvador Perez's 2021 record and also marks Raleigh's ninth multi-home run game, setting a record for switch-hitters. The first-time All-Star, who recently signed a six-year, $105 million contract, has launched 40 homers while playing catcher this year, placing him among elite Hall of Famers like Johnny Bench and Mike Piazza. Raleigh's consistent power hitting positions him to potentially become the first American League catcher to lead the major leagues outright in home runs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy National Guard troops to Baltimore to "clean up" crime, escalating a political clash with Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who had invited Trump for a "safety walk." Trump's remarks, made on social media, also included a threat to reconsider federal funding for the Francis Scott Key Bridge replacement. This move is part of Trump's broader strategy to deploy federalized troops to Democratic-led cities, drawing fierce condemnation from Democrats who call it an "abuse of power" and "tone deaf." Moore and other Democratic leaders argue that crime rates are declining and that such deployments are unnecessary and politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in California's Napa County and central Oregon have expanded significantly overnight, prompting hundreds of evacuations and warnings as firefighters battle the blazes amidst hot, dry weather. California's Pickett Fire grew to over 10 square miles with 11% containment, threatening 500 structures and necessitating over 1,230 firefighters. In Oregon, the Flat Fire reached almost 34 square miles with no containment, threatening nearly 4,000 homes and affecting 10,000 people under evacuation notices. Both regions face challenging conditions, including extreme heat and dropping humidity, which complicate containment efforts, though crews are making progress in establishing fire lines. Climate change is noted as a factor contributing to more intense heatwaves and destructive wildfires.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was wrongfully deported to an El Salvadoran prison and later returned to the U.S., is expected to be detained again by immigration officials on Monday, according to his attorney. Despite being electronically monitored after his release from criminal custody, Abrego Garcia has been instructed to report to an ICE detention center in Baltimore. His lawyers believe this move, coupled with a new plan to deport him to Uganda after he rejected a plea deal for Costa Rica, is a tactic to coerce a guilty plea or a precursor to another illegal deportation to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia had a brief reunion with his family, but his future remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A proposed cannabis excise tax cut in California, aimed at supporting the struggling legal weed industry, has sparked a significant standoff with child care advocates. The industry-backed bill seeks to revert the tax from 19% to 15% for six years, reducing state revenue by $180 million annually. This cut would specifically impact $81 million earmarked for subsidized child care slots for approximately 8,000 low-income children, leading advocates to accuse lawmakers of prioritizing cannabis over children. The conflict highlights the inherent instability of funding crucial social services with "sin taxes," especially as the state faces declining finances and federal cuts, leaving the source of backfill funds unclear.</p>
