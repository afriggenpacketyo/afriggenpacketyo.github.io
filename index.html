          <h2>Trump's Claim of 'Clean Coal' Challenged by Experts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-18 17:15:40 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump's assertion that the US can produce "clean coal" is disputed by energy experts who highlight coal's inherent environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.  Despite advancements in coal cleaning technology, these technologies are not widely used and cannot eliminate coal's contribution to climate change and health problems. The ongoing decrease in coal usage in the US, replaced by natural gas and renewables, indicates a shift away from this energy source.</p>
