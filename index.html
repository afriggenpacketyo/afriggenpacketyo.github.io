          <p>In the final fight of their historic trilogy, Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano by a majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The bout, described as a tactical "chess match," saw Taylor retain her undisputed light-welterweight title with two judges scoring 97-93 in her favor. Following the victory, the 39-year-old Taylor acknowledged the significance of the rivalry in women's boxing history but remained noncommittal about her future in the sport, suggesting she will take time to decide her next steps.</p>

          <p>The owner of a luxury penthouse on Park Lane has been in an eight-year legal battle with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed and his family. The dispute, which originated from an issue over a lift installation, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched renovations, and the "malicious" use of a noisy lift. The ongoing conflict highlights Al Fayed's famously combative business approach, which appears to persist even after his death, and is set against the backdrop of a building where Al Fayed faced allegations of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. After falling behind 8-2, the Dodgers' bats came alive, tagging Giants ace Logan Webb for six runs, but they ultimately failed to complete the comeback. The loss marks the team's longest losing streak since 2017 and reduces their division lead to four games as they struggle to find consistency.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians in Gaza into a secured camp in Rafah amounts to a plan for a crime against humanity. The author contends that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians, dating back to the 1948 Nakba, due to a lack of enforcement and the interests of powerful nations. Despite the failings of international institutions, the author finds hope in the resilience and "sumoud" (steadfastness) of the Palestinian people, who continue to hold on to their land and identity.</p>

          <p>Numerous independent gift and toy shops across the UK have been left devastated after being suddenly informed by British soft toy company Jellycat that it will no longer supply them. Retailers, some of whom have stocked the brand for over two decades, received a form email stating the decision was final and part of a "brand elevation strategy." The move comes after the brand's popularity surged on social media, leading many small business owners to feel they are being cast aside in favor of larger retailers.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle the historic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge in Prague is facing strong opposition from architects, heritage experts, and the public. The authority argues that a new, wider bridge is necessary to handle projected increases in rail traffic, but opponents, backed by UNESCO, claim the iconic structure can be repaired and preserved. The debate pits the needs of modern transportation against the preservation of a key landmark in the city's historic skyline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off 1,353 employees, including 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service staff, as part of a sweeping reorganization by the Trump administration.

Critics, including Democratic senators and foreign service associations, have condemned the layoffs, arguing they will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security.</p>
