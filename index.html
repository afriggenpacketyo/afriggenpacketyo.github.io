        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has described the two-child benefit cap as having a "devastating impact" and indicated that the government may soon lift it. The policy, introduced by the Conservatives, restricts payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017 for households on universal or child tax credit. Phillipson, leading a child poverty task force, stressed the urgency of addressing rising child poverty rates linked to the cap. Campaigners and other politicians advocate for its abolition, citing its potential to lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.</p>

          <p>An NHS investigation revealed that a heart surgeon, Karen Booth, was responsible for failures that contributed to the deaths of seven patients and significant harm to another, yet she continues to work for the NHS. Concerns about Booth's performance, including clinical errors and operating beyond her skill level, were raised by colleagues in 2018 but an official investigation only began in 2021. The hospital plans to allow her to resume surgical duties, despite strong opposition from affected families and internal reports criticizing poor governance and a reluctance to address safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Two regional jets operated by Endeavor Air, a Delta Air Lines subsidiary, experienced a low-speed collision on a LaGuardia Airport taxiway. The incident occurred when a departing aircraft's wing contacted the fuselage of an arriving plane. One flight attendant sustained minor injuries and was transported to a hospital as a precaution, with no other passengers harmed. Passengers were deplaned and bused back to the terminal, receiving accommodations and rebookings. Authorities, including the FAA and NTSB, are investigating the incident, which did not impact overall airport operations.</p>

The Alhashemi family, after years of repeated asylum denials in other European countries, can now build a stable life, with plans for the parents to work and their children to attend school. This development marks a significant turning point, bringing relief and a tangible sense of optimism, further amplified by the recent birth of a new baby girl named Sally.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda made landfall in Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, bringing powerful winds and heavy rainfall. The storm, the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, was located southwest of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph. Forecasters anticipated hurricane-force winds, 2 to 4 inches of rain causing flash flooding, and dangerous coastal storm surges with damaging waves. Bermuda's Minister of National Security urged residents to take the threat seriously, emphasizing it was not a minor squall.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has rejected a U.S. proposal to locally manufacture half the chips it currently supplies to the U.S., with its top trade negotiator stating the "50-50" split was not even discussed during recent trade talks. The U.S. Commerce Secretary had pitched the idea to reduce American reliance on Taiwan for semiconductors, citing that 95% of U.S. demand is met by Taiwanese production. Taiwanese politicians condemned the proposal as exploitative, arguing it would "hollow out the foundations of Taiwan's technology sector" and undermine its "Silicon Shield" defense against China.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has become the first individual to achieve a net worth exceeding $500 billion, driven by the recovery of Tesla stock and soaring valuations of his other ventures, including xAI and SpaceX. This milestone solidifies his position as the world's richest person, significantly ahead of rivals. His wealth is closely tied to his substantial stake in Tesla, whose shares have risen sharply this year as investors welcomed Musk's renewed focus on his companies rather than political activities. The company's board has also outlined a potential pay package worth over $1 trillion if ambitious targets are met. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Idaho state judge has blocked the release of graphic photos from the crime scene where Bryan Kohberger killed four University of Idaho students in 2022. The ruling prioritizes the victims' families' "extreme emotional distress" over the public's interest, ordering the city to black out portions showing bodies or immediate blood. While other investigation records, including videos of distraught friends, can be released, the judge emphasized that disseminating "incredibly disturbing" images across the internet would be an unwarranted invasion of privacy, especially since the criminal case is closed.</p>

          <p>French asset manager Amundi, managing €2.3 trillion, has largely reduced its exposure to China's September equity rally, reallocating funds to dividend stocks due to lingering doubts about China's economic outlook and valuation concerns. The firm trimmed positions in "overvalued" Chinese stocks while selectively increasing onshore equity exposure over Hong Kong-listed shares. Amundi's deputy CIO stated that the macro environment would be less supportive for equity markets, though the firm remains open to rebuilding China exposure if conditions improve.

          <p>Donald Trump has signed an executive order promising to use all lawful measures, including U.S. military action, to defend Qatar's security and territorial integrity against external attack. The order, which follows an Israeli strike targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar, cites "close cooperation" and "shared interest" between the two nations. While Qatar welcomed the pledge, the true legal weight of such an executive order without Senate approval remains a question. This move highlights ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the U.S.'s role as a security guarantor.</p>

          <p>On the first day of the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration froze approximately $26 billion in funds for projects in Democratic-leaning states. This includes $18 billion for transit projects in New York and nearly $8 billion for green energy initiatives across 16 states. Democratic leaders condemned the move as partisan blackmail, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stating Trump was "using the American people as pawns."

          <p>Brendan Carr, the pro-Trump chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has agreed to testify before the Senate commerce committee following controversy surrounding the temporary suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show.

His remarks drew criticism from across the aisle, including Senator Ted Cruz, who called some of Carr's phrasing "dangerous as hell."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal government shutdown debate is fueled by Republican claims that Democrats seek to provide "free healthcare to illegal aliens," a charge Democrats deny. The core of the dispute lies in a Democratic proposal to reverse recent changes that narrowed Medicaid eligibility, which currently affects immigrants with legal status or government protection. Republicans argue that some lawfully present immigrants were "illegally" allowed in, while Democrats contend their proposal simply restores pre-2025 rules for those legally present. The impasse impacts healthcare access for millions and highlights deep partisan divisions over immigration and social services.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has blocked the federal government from diverting or withdrawing $34 million in anti-terrorism funding for New York City's transportation system. The ruling stated that New York would likely prove the Trump administration improperly cut funds to punish the state for not cooperating with its deportation program. Citing past terror attacks, the judge emphasized the grant program's purpose to protect transit systems based on terrorism risk. NYC officials had warned that cutting these resources would put lives at risk in "the No. 1 terrorist target in the world."</p>
