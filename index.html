          <p>President Donald Trump has issued more than 135 executive orders in his first 100 days of his second term, surpassing his previous record and that of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Experts suggest this indicates a shift in power from the legislative branch to the executive branch, allowing Trump to implement his agenda more swiftly. These orders focus on dismantling hurdles he faced during his first term, including easing restrictions on firing federal employees. However, these orders are susceptible to reversal by subsequent presidents, placing strain on the judicial branch due to numerous legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly conducting operations to locate unaccompanied immigrant children, potentially leading to their deportation or criminal prosecution, as well as the prosecution of their sponsors. These operations, framed as "welfare checks," are raising concerns about "backdoor family separation" and the criminalization of children and their sponsors. Legal services for unaccompanied minors have been reduced, and sensitive data is being shared with ICE. This shift marks a concerning trend towards treating vulnerable children as enforcement targets, causing trauma and fear within immigrant communities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that home equity loan interest rates will remain relatively stable in the near term, primarily due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to further rate cuts. While rates have decreased compared to last year, the Fed's indication of no rush to move suggests rates will hold steady. However, there is a possibility of further rate drops later in the year, depending on market conditions and potential Fed moves. Currently, HELOCs may offer a better deal due to lower rates, but borrowers should be mindful of their variable interest rates and repayment strategies.</p>

          <p>Experts are weighing in on whether gold prices will hit $4,000 per ounce in 2025, amidst ongoing economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability. Many experts anticipate that gold prices will continue to rise, driven by factors like bank failures, potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, and the current trade war. While reaching $4,000 may be challenging, the appetite for stable, yield-generating assets is growing, making gold an attractive option for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Settling a debt, which involves paying less than the full amount owed, can have a mixed impact on your credit score. In the short term, it may not improve your score and could even cause a temporary dip, as settled accounts are often marked as such on your credit report. However, in the long run, settling a debt can help you regain control over your finances and improve your credit health by freeing up room in your budget to stay current on other obligations. Other debt relief options, such as debt management and debt consolidation, may be more credit-score friendly.</p>
