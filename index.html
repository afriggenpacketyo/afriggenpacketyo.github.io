          <p>Emerging markets are gaining traction as the next potential bull market, fueled by a weakening U.S. dollar, rising U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. Bank of America and JPMorgan have expressed bullish sentiments, with JPMorgan upgrading emerging market equities due to thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. Recent selloffs in U.S. Treasuries, equities, and the greenback, exacerbated by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, have further bolstered confidence in emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, indicating a potential shift in investment focus. (not investment advice)</p>

Anderson, who commanded the candidate assessment division, reportedly overrode negative psychological reports for 80 candidates. The NYPD is investigating the matter amid a decline in the number of uniformed officers. Anderson is known for his innovative community policing strategies and efforts to recruit more officers of color.</p>

          <p>A meeting intended to ease tensions between the US and South Africa took a turn when President Trump confronted his counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa, with claims that white farmers in his nation were being killed and persecuted. Trump presented widely discredited claims of a 'white genocide' and played a video alleging white farmers' burial sites. Ramaphosa refuted the claims, stating that the video's sentiments did not represent government policy. The meeting highlighted ongoing tensions between the two nations and Trump's focus on claims of white victimhood.</p>

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats call 'the nuclear option'. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend it's illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California was granted the ability to enact stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government under the Clean Air Act. The vote could impact cities and states around the country, as 16 additional states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>
