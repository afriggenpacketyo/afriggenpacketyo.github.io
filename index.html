          <p>The article addresses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the current arrangements are set to expire, sparked by a question from activist investor David Webb about the future of contract law and land leases. The author, reflecting on past anxieties regarding the 1997 handover, urges calm and emphasizes the need to avoid unnecessary alarm. They recount their own early concerns about the validity of property mortgages tied to the New Territories' lease, advocating for proactive discussion rather than passive acceptance of the deadline.

          <p>Poland began voting in a high-stakes presidential election that will significantly influence the country's political direction and its positions on critical issues like abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, and relations with the European Union. The leading candidates are Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, the pro-EU Warsaw Mayor supported by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Coalition, and Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian backed by the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. The election outcome will likely determine the extent of policy gridlock between the president and the government, with potential impacts on the coalition's agenda and Poland's alignment with European norms.</p>

          <p>A new internal study suggests that the German military, the Bundeswehr, does not have 'systemic' extremism within its ranks, with only a small percentage of soldiers exhibiting right-wing extremist attitudes. However, the study did reveal that some soldiers hold chauvinistic and xenophobic views. Despite these findings, some researchers remain skeptical, pointing to past incidents involving far-right networks and plots within the military, and question the effectiveness of current safeguards. The debate continues on whether the Bundeswehr is doing enough to prevent extremist attitudes, especially amid a broader societal normalization of right-wing sentiments.</p>

The article cites examples such as the Clinton Foundation and Hunter Biden's activities, arguing that both parties have engaged in similar behavior. Michel proposes measures to curb such practices, including preventing former politicians from becoming foreign lobbyists and restricting family members of high-ranking officials from engaging in foreign deals.

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans through the Belt and Road Initiative. This approach involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for financing construction, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Projects like Nairobi's mega-highway and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are adopting this model. During Kenyan President William Ruto's visit to China, he sought PPP funding to extend the Standard Gauge Railway, with Chinese firms contributing 40% of the cost and gaining exclusive rights to operate the railway for at least 25 years.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a presidential election runoff after the initial election in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities in campaign financing and organization. The previous election saw far-right, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round. The annulled vote was allegedly influenced by an 'aggressive Russian hybrid attack' involving the activation of social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messages. Georgescu was subsequently banned from participating in the rerun election in May.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed delaying the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and imposing a monthly fee on current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" due to budget deficits. The changes aim to address a $12 billion budget shortfall attributed to President Donald Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. The governor stated that no one would be expelled from Medi-Cal, but corrective measures are necessary to balance fiscal responsibility and preserve key investments. The plan requires legislative approval and is projected to save California $5.4 billion by the 2028-29 fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Germany is planning to significantly increase its defense spending to become the 'strongest conventional army in Europe,' prompting other EU countries to follow suit. The German Foreign Minister said that the government had accepted the president's demand to invest 5% of GDP in defense. France and Poland are also expanding their military capabilities, with a focus on modern equipment and increased troop numbers. While these rearmament programs will strengthen European militaries, they are unlikely to significantly alter the global ranking of military strength in the near term.</p>

          <p>China has announced anti-dumping duties on imports of POM copolymers, an engineering plastic, from the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Taiwan. The duties, ranging up to 74.9%, follow an investigation launched in May 2024 after the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods. The highest rates apply to U.S. imports, while lower rates are imposed on shipments from the EU, Japan, and Taiwan. This move comes amid hopes of easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with recent agreements to reduce reciprocal tariffs.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, are causing concern among those who rely on it. A Congressional Budget Office analysis estimates that the cuts could leave millions without health insurance.
