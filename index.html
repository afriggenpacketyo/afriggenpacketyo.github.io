          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Russia from May 7th for four days to attend the Victory Day ceremony in Moscow, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. During the visit, Xi is expected to engage in "strategic communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin on bilateral ties and major international and regional issues. The two leaders are also expected to sign several bilateral accords, further strengthening the relationship between Russia and China amidst Western sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine invasion. Russia and China have been strengthening their ties in recent years, with Beijing opposing Western sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine that started in February 2022.</p>

          <p>Government data released in Japan indicates that the estimated child population has decreased for the 44th consecutive year, reaching a new record low of 13.66 million as of April 1. This decline reflects the ongoing struggle to reverse the country's declining birth rate despite various government initiatives aimed at supporting child-rearing households. The ratio of children to the overall population has also fallen to a record low of 11.1 percent, highlighting the severity of the demographic challenge facing Japan. The government has implemented initiatives such as providing more financial assistance to child-rearing households, expanding daycare services and allowing flexible workstyles for parents, but the initiatives have not stopped the decades-long decline.</p>

          <p>The death of Kendy Howard, found in her bathtub with a gunshot wound, is being investigated after inconsistencies at the scene raised suspicions. First responders noted the unusual circumstance of a nude woman shooting herself in a bathtub, along with other details such as broken glass, wet towels, and a running clothes dryer. The dryer was running with only six minutes left on the cycle, and investigators determined that the cycle was started within a minute of the 911 call. These findings led investigators to theorize that Kendy's husband, Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, may have staged the scene after killing her.</p>

          <p>China and Japan are trading accusations over airspace violations near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. Japan claims a Chinese helicopter flew within its airspace for approximately 15 minutes, prompting the scrambling of fighter jets. In response, China alleges that a Japanese civilian aircraft illegally entered the airspace of the islands, leading to the deployment of a Chinese helicopter to "expel" the aircraft. Both countries have lodged protests, with Japan urging China to prevent similar acts from recurring and China expressing strong dissatisfaction with Japan's violation of its sovereignty.</p>

Harriet Salarno started Crime Victims United, an organization that has changed hundreds of laws, allowing victims to give impact statements at sentencing and ensuring children are accompanied by a support person when testifying.

Others, such as supporters of Reza Pahlavi, advocate for regime change through foreign intervention. Historian Arash Azizi warns against military invasion and emphasizes that change must come from within Iran.

While acknowledging concerns about ultra-processed foods and their nutritional value, the author argues that the criticism often ignores the social, political, and economic factors that influence parents' choices. She highlights the pressure on mothers to engage in "intensive mothering" and the moral judgment associated with choosing convenience over cooking from scratch. The author calls for a more supportive society that facilitates good food choices for parents and children, rather than simply condemning pureed fruit.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is no longer a wild notion after Reform UK's recent success in local elections, posing a serious challenge to the traditional two-party system. The article suggests that the disillusionment felt by some voters in the UK is finding a voice in Farage, with Reform already ahead of the Conservatives in the polls. While the government focuses on demonstrating progress, Labour is aware that Reform could be its main rival at the next election. The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, faces the challenge of becoming a leader that voters recognize and warm to.</p>

This structure contrasts with Trump's first term, where advisers and appointments often served to reassure doubters and temper his impulses. The choice of JD Vance revealed that Trump’s second term would offer no concessions, contain no skeptics, and that the ferocity and recklessness of this presidency are by design.</p>
