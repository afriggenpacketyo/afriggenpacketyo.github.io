          <p>Thieves executed a daring heist at a Champs Sporting Goods store in Jensen Beach, Florida, by cutting a hole through the concrete roof. They made off with an estimated 400 to 500 pairs of Nike and New Balance sneakers, valued between $40,000 and $50,000. The Martin County Sheriff's Office described the incident as reminiscent of 'Mission Impossible,' noting the use of electric tools and the organized nature of the criminals. The repair costs for the roof are estimated at $10,000, and authorities are actively investigating this unusual burglary.</p>

          <p>The International Chess Federation (FIDE) has launched an investigation into Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik for making cheating allegations against elite players, including the late U.S. grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky. FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich stated that public debate has often crossed acceptable boundaries, harming reputations and well-being. Naroditsky, a popular YouTube and Twitch streamer, had expressed the immense stress caused by Kramnik's accusations in his final stream. Kramnik, a former world champion, has doubled down on his unsubstantiated claims, facing backlash from the chess community and accusations of falsely blaming him for Naroditsky's death.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown has reached its 23rd day, with both major parties seemingly content to prolong the impasse, unlike historical shutdowns. President Trump appears unconcerned, while Democrats see little incentive to legitimize his actions by reopening the government. The issue has taken a backseat in news coverage due to other major events and public fatigue. This article highlights how the administration has selectively mitigated the shutdown's impact, directing pain towards federal workers, while both parties perceive political upside in extending the closure, leading to a unique and prolonged stalemate.</p>

          <h2>Emma Stone Reveals She Used a Different Stage Name Early in Her Acting Career</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 18:25:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oscar-winning actress Emma Stone disclosed on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' that she briefly used the stage name 'Riley Stone' for about six months early in her career. This change was due to Screen Actors Guild rules, which permit only one person per name. Stone found it difficult to adjust, often not realizing she was being addressed on set, particularly during a guest appearance on 'Malcolm in the Middle.' She eventually changed it to Emma, a name inspired by Baby Spice and close to her birth name, Emily, which she prefers to be called.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court for veterans claims unanimously rejected the Trump administration's attempt to delay rulings on disability benefits for veterans, despite the ongoing government shutdown. The 9-0 decision, led by a Trump-appointed chief judge, stated that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs failed to demonstrate that such a sweeping request was appropriate. Veterans groups criticized the move as using the shutdown to deny veterans their rightful day in court, with some having waited decades for their claims. This ruling underscores a growing trend of federal judges pushing back against the administration's actions, ensuring veterans' cases proceed without indefinite delays.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles issued a tentative ruling ordering the government to ensure immigrant detainees at a downtown processing center have access to legal counsel. This preliminary injunction would extend a previous temporary restraining order, requiring seven-day-a-week legal visitation. Attorneys for the detainees argued that individuals swept up in immigration raids are held in inhumane conditions, making access to counsel crucial. Despite government claims of compliance, the judge expressed concern over past violations. This decision marks a significant step in upholding Fifth Amendment rights for detainees, though broader challenges against racial profiling in arrests continue.</p>

          <p>Money Singh, an immigrant from Punjab, India, transformed his life from driving a cab for $6 an hour to building businesses that now generate over $2 million annually. After initially struggling with depression and dropping out of college, Singh spent over a decade in the taxi industry before diversifying. In 2019, he opened Dandies Barbershop & Beard Stylist, inspired by his mother's salon business, which generated $1.07 million in sales last year. Despite facing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and incurring significant debt, Singh persevered, drawing on his childhood resilience.

          <p>China's tightening of rare earth export controls is viewed as a direct response to the Trump administration's escalating restrictions on Chinese companies and exports. The article argues that the U.S. should not be surprised by Beijing's actions, as Washington provided the blueprint and rationale for such measures. Recent U.S. actions, including blacklisting Chinese institutions, imposing tariffs, and extending export controls to subsidiaries, have significantly intensified trade tensions. This opinion piece suggests that China's move is a calculated blowback, reflecting a tit-for-tat dynamic in the ongoing economic rivalry between the two nations.</p>

Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Jack Reed and Representative Adam Smith, expressed deep concern, arguing the memo raises serious questions about transparency and impedes congressional oversight.
