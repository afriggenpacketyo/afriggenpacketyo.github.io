          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested outside an immigration detention facility after a visit by three Democratic members of Congress, leading to conflicting accounts and potential assault charges against the lawmakers. The incident occurred after the legislators inspected Delaney Hall, a facility with a controversial history of code violations and federal scrutiny. Baraka, who is running for governor, claims he was invited onto the property before being asked to leave and subsequently arrested, while officials assert he was trespassing. The arrest has become a political flashpoint, drawing criticism from other gubernatorial candidates and sparking protests in New York City, with the Trump administration releasing body camera footage from the chaotic scene to Fox News.</p>

          <p>Willie Eugene Sims, 69, has been charged with the 1977 murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, nearly five decades after her death. Ralston, a young mother, was found strangled in her car after telling friends she would be back in 10 minutes, marking the beginning of a long cold case. The break came when an upgraded F.B.I. fingerprint database matched Sims' thumbprint on a cigarette carton found in the victim's car. Further investigation revealed Sims' past conviction for assault to commit murder and robbery, and his DNA matched evidence found on Ralston's body, bringing closure to her family after years of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club has opened its new Riverside Stand, an eight-tier hospitality section featuring Michelin star menus and a rooftop swimming pool, aiming to provide the 'best stand in the world'. The stand, part of Craven Cottage, prioritizes a high-end experience similar to a five-star hotel or cruise ship, focusing on views of the River Thames rather than the pitch. The rooftop pool offers an experience separate from the football match itself. The stand will operate as a private members' club on non-matchdays, targeting local residents in the wealthy west London area, combining heritage with modern luxury.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China have resumed high-stakes trade negotiations in Geneva, aiming to de-escalate tensions that have disrupted the global economy. The meetings follow increased tariffs imposed by both countries, impacting trade and raising fears of an economic downturn. While expectations for immediate tariff reductions are low, the fact that negotiations are taking place has raised hopes for a potential easing of tensions. Both sides face economic pressures from the trade war, but significant hurdles remain, including disagreements over trade practices and fentanyl exports, with economists closely watching for signs of progress.</p>

          <p>China's calculated export controls on rare earth elements, crucial for military and commercial products, are raising concerns in the US defense industry. The restrictions, implemented in response to increased US tariffs, affect key materials used in jet engines, radar, and electronic systems. China dominates the global supply of rare earths, accounting for 90% of production capacity, giving them significant leverage in the trade war. The US defense industry is now facing uncertainty as it grapples with securing these essential materials for military equipment, which could impact the production and maintenance of critical weapons systems.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met in Switzerland to discuss de-escalating trade tensions, but there was no immediate indication of progress. Discussions likely focused on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal, as both countries recognize the unsustainability of high tariffs. President Trump has suggested lowering tariffs, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first, amid concerns over the impact on global trade.</p>

Economists suggest Powell's cautious approach, given threats to both growth and inflation from Trump's tariffs, is warranted, but history indicates the Fed often acts too slowly. Trump is urging rate cuts, while the Fed remains confident in a 'solid' economy, creating a challenging environment for monetary policy decisions, and experts believe the Fed's focus on labor market data may lead to delayed action.</p>
