          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scammers who falsely claim that artificial intelligence can predict questions on the national college entrance examination, known as the gaokao. The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have launched a joint campaign to investigate and eliminate ‚Äúillegal and harmful information‚Äù related to the exams. Scammers are selling mock papers online at inflated prices, falsely claiming they use AI to predict actual questions. Some social media accounts and private tutors also allege access to ‚Äútop secret‚Äù information from teachers involved in setting the exam papers. Optimism is limited as this shows how important it is for governments to regulate new technology in this new era. Optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Melissa Andreatta's debut as head coach for Scotland's women's national football team ended in defeat and relegation to Nations League B. Andreatta acknowledged that her first game provided a baseline understanding of the team's current state, but was unsure if it was higher or lower than expected. Austria secured a deserved victory at Hampden Park, leaving Scotland struggling to mount a significant challenge until late in the game. While changes brought some fight, it proved insufficient, underscoring the time needed for a full transition under the new coach. Despite the initial setback, there is hope that Andreatta can guide the team to future success. Optimism score is 45.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a ¬£2bn upgrade. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. Originally conceived in 1990 and started in 2002, the project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while also planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While some criticize the cost and delays, others view the upgrade as a significant investment in the region's future, generating jobs and opportunities. Optimism score is 65.</p>

At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out within 30 minutes of opening, reflecting high demand.
