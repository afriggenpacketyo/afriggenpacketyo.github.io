          <h2>Gallup Poll Reveals Record Low in U.S. Alcohol Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a significant drop driven by growing concerns about the health risks associated with even moderate drinking. This shift reflects an evolving scientific consensus that any alcohol intake can have negative effects, including increased risks of cancer, depression, and anxiety. Younger demographics, aged 18 to 34, are particularly influenced by this messaging, with a higher percentage believing moderate drinking is harmful. The trend also highlights a societal move towards greater acceptance of sobriety, with popular challenges like Dry January and the rise of mocktails contributing to this cultural change.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group headed by Bill Chisholm, marking the second-largest sale price for a U.S. sports franchise at a reported $6.1 billion. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and co-founder of private equity firm STG Partners, will become the Celtics' governor, acquiring at least 51% ownership initially, with plans to increase this stake by 2028. This significant transaction reflects the escalating valuations in professional sports and ensures a new leadership era for the storied basketball team. The outgoing owner, Wyc Grousbeck, is expected to transition out of his role over the next few years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Virginia Tech study, involving 182 volunteer dog-and-handler teams, has successfully demonstrated that trained pet dogs can effectively detect the elusive egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly. These destructive pests, which promote mold growth and threaten plants, are difficult for humans to locate due to their camouflage. Dogs, leveraging their superior sense of smell, achieved over 80% accuracy in indoor tests and more than 60% in outdoor, real-world conditions, outperforming most human searches. Researchers hope this breakthrough will lead to wider training of dogs to combat this and other invasive species, offering a fun and fulfilling activity for dog owners while protecting local environments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a significant warning about the efficacy and safety of mousse-form sunscreen products, including those from popular brands like Supergoop! and Vacation Inc. The agency states these products may not provide adequate UV protection and are "misbranded" due to packaging that resembles whipped cream, raising concerns about accidental ingestion. The FDA has sent warning letters to five companies, emphasizing that these products are classified as drugs but lack the necessary approval. This regulatory action highlights a critical public health concern regarding product safety and misleading consumer packaging, prompting some manufacturers to temporarily withdraw their products.</p>

          <p>China's Xiluodu Dam, the world's fourth-largest hydropower station, has transitioned away from using Western industrial control chips in favor of domestically produced alternatives. This significant decision stems from escalating security concerns regarding vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure systems, a worry highlighted by historical cyberattacks such as the Stuxnet virus. The move reflects China's strategic imperative to enhance technological self-reliance and national security within its vital energy sector. This shift impacts major Western suppliers like Siemens and Schneider, signaling a broader trend of technological decoupling and a push for indigenous innovation in sensitive industrial applications.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin approaches, the family of David Barnes, an American serving a 21.5-year sentence in Russia, holds onto hope for a prisoner exchange. Barnes was convicted by a Russian judge on charges of child abuse in Texas, allegations that U.S. prosecutors previously found to be unsubstantiated. His family maintains his innocence and is urging U.S. officials, including Trump and Senator Marco Rubio, to designate him as wrongfully detained to expedite his release. This poignant human interest story underscores the high stakes of international diplomacy and the profound impact on individuals caught in geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai, a vocal critic of the Chinese state, is facing the final stages of his national security trial, accused of colluding with foreign forces. The 77-year-old, who could face life imprisonment, has garnered international attention, with calls for his release from figures like UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Critics contend that Lai's case highlights how Hong Kong's legal system is being used to silence political dissent and opposition.

Almost 90 U.S. B-29 bombers dropped napalm, killing at least 260 people and destroying nearly 75% of the city. Survivors recount harrowing experiences of the "fire and rain" and the enduring scars.

The growths, or papillomas, typically disappear as the rabbits' immune systems fight the virus, posing no harm unless they obstruct eating or vision. This condition is believed to have inspired the mythical "jackalope" and has contributed to scientific understanding of virus-cancer links. The public is advised not to touch infected animals.</p>

          <p>Low-income Americans like Angela Harmon in Dallas face increasing difficulty affording air conditioning as energy costs rise, forcing them to seek alternative ways to stay cool. The federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which assists over six million Americans, is threatened by President Trump's budget proposal to eliminate it, shifting responsibility to states. Experts like Andrew Dessler of Texas A&M University link rising electricity costs to climate change, noting significant wholesale price increases in various regions. Concerns are also raised about policies that favor fossil fuels over cheaper solar power, potentially exacerbating the financial burden on vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>David Ellison, head of Skydance Media, has outlined his vision to rebuild Paramount after an $8 billion takeover, emphasizing a Hollywood-centric approach focused on major investments, technology, and leveraging popular franchises like "Top Gun," "Star Trek," and "Yellowstone." Ellison aims to nearly double the studio's annual film output to 15-20 movies, prioritizing filmmaker-driven originals and family films. He also expressed a desire to move the company away from political divisions to reach a broader audience. The new ownership structure, with the Ellison family holding 50%, aims for long-term growth rather than short-term earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from Imperial College London are warning that UK cities face a growing threat from "firewaves"—multiple urban wildfires triggered by extended hot, dry weather, exacerbated by climate change. Recent heath fires in London and Edinburgh highlight this increasing vulnerability, once considered primarily rural. Research indicates that after ten consecutive days of dry conditions, vegetation becomes highly flammable, significantly raising the risk of simultaneous blazes that could overwhelm emergency services. The researchers propose adopting the term "firewave" to signal extreme fire danger in cities, urging proactive measures and improved public safety strategies to adapt to these new climate realities.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, is recovering after a record-breaking glacier outburst flood from Suicide Basin, near the Mendenhall Glacier, caused the Mendenhall River to crest at an unprecedented 16.65 feet. While the immediate flood threat has subsided and temporary "Hesco" barriers largely protected hundreds of homes from widespread damage, the event highlights a persistent climate-related challenge. These annual floods, resulting from the retreating glacier forming a water-filled basin, are projected to continue for decades. The community is now assessing damage, with some recreational areas remaining closed, underscoring the ongoing need for long-term mitigation strategies against glacial melt.</p>

This action further dismantles a signature Biden initiative designed to curb anti-competitive practices in sectors ranging from agriculture to pharmaceuticals and labor. The Justice Department, under Trump, welcomed the revocation, advocating for an "America first antitrust" approach that prioritizes free markets over what it termed Biden's "overly prescriptive and burdensome" methods. Critics argue that such moves have already cost Americans billions in higher fees and lost compensation, reversing efforts to address corporate abuses and market power concentration.

Trump justified the high tariffs by linking them to the legal situation of his ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is under house arrest.
