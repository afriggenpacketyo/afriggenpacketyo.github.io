          <p>A 15-year-old boy has admitted to the manslaughter of Harvey Willgoose, also 15, at All Saints Catholic High School in Sheffield. The defendant pleaded guilty to manslaughter and possessing a blade on school premises, but denied the charge of murder. The tragic incident occurred after Willgoose was stabbed in the chest at the school, leading to his death. A murder trial has been scheduled for June 30, and the defendant remains in youth detention custody as the legal proceedings continue to unfold.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for deploying North Korean troops to fight alongside Russian forces in the Kursk region of Ukraine. Kim praised the heroism of his soldiers and ordered a monument to be built for those slain in Russia. Putin vowed that Russia would always honor the Korean heroes who sacrificed their lives for Russia's freedom, placing them on par with Russian soldiers.

          <p>Airstrikes in Yemen have resulted in the deaths of at least 68 people at a migrant detention center in Saada Governorate, according to Yemen's Civil Defense. The US military's Central Command reported that its campaign since March 15 has struck over 800 targets, resulting in the deaths of numerous Houthi fighters and leaders. The Houthis began their attacks in October 2023 in response to the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, prompting the US to intensify its airstrike campaign against Houthi forces in Yemen. Central Command states that these strikes have degraded the pace and effectiveness of Houthi attacks.</p>

This recommendation is likely to place further strain on public finances, and the government may reject the recommendations, which could lead to a new wave of strikes. The government will need to balance the books, and the government could be forced into tax rises or other spending cuts.

          <p>The Children's Commissioner for England is urging the government to ban AI apps that create explicit images of children, citing the disproportionate targeting of girls and young women. These apps allow "nudification" of photos and creation of deepfake images, causing children to fear being targeted by strangers, classmates, or friends. The commissioner's report calls for legal obligations on developers to address risks to children and a systemic process to remove such images from the internet. The government has stated that creating or distributing such material is illegal, and platforms must remove this content or face fines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trump Coins, a venture launched by President Donald Trump, attributes the rising value of gold to Trump's "return to the spotlight," but experts disagree. Some assert that the surge in gold prices reflects financial uncertainty inspired by Trump's economic policies, including widespread tariffs. The value of gold often rises in times of economic turmoil, particularly during trade wars or anticipated inflation, making it a safe-haven asset. Experts also suggest that Trump's policies have shaken confidence in the U.S. dollar and Treasury bonds, making gold more attractive to investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The library, known for its alleged paranormal activity, maintains 24-hour "ghost cams" and has a history of reported ghostly encounters. While some commenters suggest wind as the cause, others attribute it to the library's long-standing resident specter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term has adopted a made-for-TV approach, utilizing stagecraft skills honed from his reality TV past. From signing executive orders at a sports arena to turning the White House South Lawn into a Tesla showroom, Trump's events are choreographed for television. Experts note his reliance on branding, stereotypes, and narratives reminiscent of reality TV, creating a presidency that often feels like a scripted show. This approach aims to control the narrative and connect emotionally with supporters, though some view it as a campaign approach to being a world leader.</p>

          <p>In a broken mental health system, a small jail cell has become an institution of last resort for individuals in crisis, as illustrated by Lake County, Montana. The lack of mental health services and inpatient beds forces counties to jail patients they are not equipped to handle, with some individuals held for months while awaiting care. Officials acknowledge the problem and are attempting to address it, but progress is slow, and local services are lacking. This issue reflects a nationwide failure to provide adequate mental health services, particularly crisis care.</p>

          <p>A large brood of periodical cicadas, Brood XIV, is set to emerge across the eastern United States in the spring of 2025. These cicadas, known for their loud buzzing, emerge every 17 years and are expected to swarm parts of Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller quantities appearing in other East Coast states. The emergence is linked to soil temperature, with cicadas exiting the soil when it reaches 64 degrees. The cicadas' life cycle involves spending years underground as larvae before emerging to mate and lay eggs, after which the adults die within a few weeks.</p>

          <p>Financial stress and uncertainty can significantly damage mental health, and some research suggests that how people think about their financial circumstances matters as much as their actual reserves. Experiencing a financial setback as temporary may allow people to remain calm, while others might see it as a disaster, triggering intense stress. Experts suggest taking steps to channel energy in a productive direction, such as grieving job loss, constructing a new identity, picking up a side hustle, embracing uncertainty, and prioritizing self-care. These strategies can help people become more flexible and nimble at handling financial uncertainty.</p>

          <p>President Trump faces the challenge of uniting Republicans to pass his budget bill, which aims to extend tax cuts, raise the debt ceiling, and boost defense and border security spending. Differences within the party over spending cuts and Medicaid create obstacles, and Republicans are aiming to craft a legislative package that would extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act while authorizing additional cuts. The process is further complicated by time pressures and the need to increase the debt limit, testing the GOP's ability to overcome internal divides under tight margins in both chambers.</p>

          <p>A review of DOGE's activities during Trump's first 100 days reveals that it has not delivered on its promised savings, efficiency, or transparency in meaningful ways. Despite claims of significant savings, there is little evidence to support these claims, and many of DOGE's initiatives have been reversed or delayed after legal setbacks and public backlash. DOGE has reshaped the federal government in significant ways and is amassing unprecedented power over government data. The organization's work has largely been conducted in secret, with most information about its actions coming from court filings.</p>
