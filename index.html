          <p>President Trump indicated an escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict, urging civilians to evacuate Tehran, while leaders of the G7 affirmed support for Israel and called for de-escalation in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza. Trump stated his early departure from the G7 summit was due to more significant matters than a ceasefire. Israel claimed to have eliminated a top Iranian military commander, further intensifying the conflict. The G7 condemned Iran for regional instability and reiterated that Iran should never possess nuclear weapons, contrasting with China's call for de-escalation and peacemaking efforts.

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are making strides in developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapies, potentially replacing chemotherapy for some patients. ADCs are designed to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in ADC development, with some ADCs already showing the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. However, challenges remain, including preventing the premature release of toxic payloads and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins to target. The article discusses the progress and hurdles in developing ADCs, which could account for a significant portion of the cancer market in the coming years.</p>

          <p>A study by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) reveals that 26% of immigrants in Germany have considered leaving, with 3% already planning to emigrate, due to high taxes, discrimination, and political climate. The study highlights that better-educated and economically successful immigrants are more likely to consider leaving, posing a risk to Germany's skilled labor force. Family reasons, better career opportunities, and higher earnings are cited as primary reasons for emigration. Experts emphasize the need for Germany to retain immigrants to maintain its labor force potential and balance demographic trends.</p>
