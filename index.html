          <p>In Sean 'Diddy' Combs' ongoing trial, a witness identified as 'Jane' testified about alleged instances of coercion and pressure during sexual encounters involving Combs and others. 'Jane' described feeling compelled to participate in sexual acts and recounted an incident where Combs allegedly pressured her to engage with a male escort. She also testified to feeling jealous of other women involved with Combs and expressed the emotional toll of compromising her boundaries. The defense challenged her testimony by highlighting affectionate texts between her and Combs, but she maintained that she did not consent to certain acts. </p>

          <p>According to Israeli officials, Israel launched strikes against Iran, targeting the country's nuclear program and resulting in the deaths of nuclear scientists and military leaders. Iran responded with an aerial attack involving approximately 100 drones, all of which were reportedly intercepted before reaching their targets. A U.S. official stated that the U.S. had advance notice of the strikes but did not provide assistance or have any involvement in the operation. The strikes have heightened tensions in the region, raising concerns about further escalation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's effort to secure a retrial in the E. Jean Carroll defamation and sexual abuse case was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This decision leaves the Supreme Court as Trump's final recourse to challenge the jury's verdict that found him liable for $5 million in damages to Carroll. Carroll's legal team praised the court's decision, affirming that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation. The appeals court upheld the district court's decision to allow testimony from other women with similar claims against Trump, summarizing Carroll's testimony about the alleged sexual assault.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily reversed a judge's ruling that would have returned control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. This action followed a district judge's decision that President Trump's federalization of the guard to suppress protests in Los Angeles was unlawful. The appeals court scheduled an emergency hearing for June 17 to further consider the matter.

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley announced that the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes reauthorization and expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). The proposed reauthorization would allow individuals in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders" exposed to nuclear radiation, to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste. The proposal also allows for claims to be used for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers who worked in the mines from 1971-1990 to be eligible for benefits under the bill. The Senate still needs to navigate the bill through procedural rules.</p>
