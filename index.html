          <p>A planned visit by a U.S. trade delegation to New Delhi has been called off, signaling escalating trade tensions between the two nations. The postponement comes as India faces a cumulative 50% tariff rate from the U.S., partly as a penalty for purchasing Russian crude oil. India has criticized the tariffs as unfair, highlighting that the U.S. and EU also continue to trade with Russia. New talks have not yet been rescheduled, leaving Indian exporters in a state of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method for creating highly detailed 3D images of brains and other organs. The technique makes tissues transparent while preserving their original structure and enhancing the visibility of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells. This process involves preparing the tissue into an "ionic glassy" state, which maintains its morphology and allows for vivid imaging. The method also enables long-term storage of the prepared tissues at low temperatures without degradation.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting in Alaska, President Donald Trump has reportedly expressed support for a proposal from Vladimir Putin where Russia would take full control of Ukraine's Donbas region. In exchange, Russia would agree to freeze the front lines in other occupied areas like Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This marks a significant shift from seeking a ceasefire to pursuing a direct peace agreement, a move Trump claims is the best way to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has consistently rejected ceding territory, is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Padres' performance was marred by significant errors, including three runners caught stealing in the first two innings and a costly dropped fly ball that led to two runs. Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, who capitalized on San Diego's sloppy play and numerous walks to build an early lead. The win also clinched the season's head-to-head series for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>Doctors across the U.S. are reporting a significant rise in emergency room visits for tick bites this summer, with May reaching the highest rate since 2019. Health experts attribute the increase to environmental changes, such as warmer temperatures and higher humidity, which expand tick habitats and lengthen their active seasons. This trend raises public health concerns due to the risk of tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease, which affects nearly half a million people annually. Officials are urging the public to use insect repellent, wear protective clothing, and perform thorough checks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>A proposed Chinese aircraft design for a hypersonic drone carrier revives NASA's 'scissor wing' concept, featuring a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees. This innovative design aims to optimize performance across different speeds, from subsonic to hypersonic. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, pivots to 45 degrees at transonic speeds to reduce drag, and aligns parallel to the body at Mach 5, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient 'waverider'. This adaptability could overcome traditional aerodynamic compromises in aircraft design.</p>

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological triggers that can lead individuals to risk their careers and families for an affair. These factors include a lifetime of conforming to being 'good' without developing a true sense of self, the burnout from perfectionism, and having poor boundaries developed from a parentified childhood. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can lead to seeking reprieve elsewhere. A recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can also act as a catalyst for re-evaluating life and lowering marital boundaries.</p>

          <p>The accessories chain Claire's, a nostalgic staple for many who grew up in the 90s and 2000s, has appointed administrators in the UK and Ireland after struggling with declining sales. The brand, known for its affordable jewelry, ear-piercing services, and glittery products, is facing intense competition from online fast-fashion giants like Shein and Temu. Retail experts suggest Claire's has been slow to adapt to trends popularized on social media platforms like TikTok. As today's youth culture accelerates, the brand finds itself caught between ultra-cheap online retailers and more premium brands.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston was carted off the field after suffering a concussion during a preseason game against the Rams. The injury occurred early in the game when Johnston took a helmet-to-chin hit while attempting to catch a deep pass. Coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed the diagnosis and stated Johnston was taken to a hospital as a precaution but was communicative. The incident highlights the risks of playing starters in preseason games, though Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert also made his career preseason debut, playing briefly before being replaced.</p>

          <p>People over 50 are sharing aspects of their high school experiences from past decades that would be considered shocking and unacceptable today. Recollections include teachers openly mocking students, corporal punishment being a common disciplinary tool, and designated smoking areas on school property for students. Other now-problematic norms mentioned were the open secret of teachers dating students, mandatory home economics for girls, and a general lack of seriousness in addressing bullying. These anecdotes highlight the dramatic shift in educational standards, student safety protocols, and social awareness over the past few decades.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite an ongoing heatwave, parts of the UK are showing signs of an early autumn, with trees shedding leaves and berries ripening ahead of schedule. Experts explain this phenomenon is not a true seasonal shift but a stress response from nature due to the prolonged hot and dry conditions. The extreme weather, on track to be one of the warmest summers on record, is causing trees to enter survival mode by dropping leaves and branches. Conservationists warn this "false autumn" could disrupt wildlife, as early-ripening food sources may not be available for birds and other animals later in the year.</p>

          <p>A homeless man in Washington D.C., Bill Theodie, discovered that President Trump had posted a photo of him at his tent encampment on social media just days before the site was cleared. Trump used the image to announce a crackdown on homelessness, stating such "slums" would be removed immediately. Four days later, city officials, fast-tracking their usual process after the president's announcement, used a bulldozer to dismantle the encampment where Mr. Theodie had lived for years. He and other residents were forced to relocate with little notice, highlighting the human impact of the new policy.</p>

          <p>The body of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has been held in a Kenyan mortuary for 11 years due to a bitter family dispute following his death in 2013. An inquest concluded this week but failed to determine a cause of death, citing the body's decomposition after it was exhumed nearly a year after his initial burial. The case has pitted his two sons against his second wife and their two daughters, with the sons alleging he was poisoned for his inheritance. The magistrate ordered the body released for reburial, but the family remains divided on where he should be laid to rest.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, during a COVID-19 lockdown in their first year of secondary school. The letters reveal their younger selves' anxieties about the pandemic, with questions about face masks and hopes for a return to normalcy. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill motivation during a disrupted school transition, provided a moment of reflection for the students as they prepared for their exams. The letters captured their personal hopes, dreams, and humorous concerns from a unique and challenging period.</p>

          <p>During his summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning children affected by the war in Ukraine. While officials initially suggested it raised concerns about child abductions, the released text is more philosophical, speaking of childhood innocence and urging Putin to "restore their melodic laughter." Ukraine's president expressed gratitude for the gesture, which comes as Putin faces an international war crime indictment for the alleged forced transfer of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a Chilean town once known as Colonia Dignidad, is grappling with its dark past as a secretive German sect and a torture center for the Pinochet dictatorship. While some residents have transformed it into a tourist destination, the Chilean government plans to expropriate part of the land to create a memorial for the regime's victims. The plan has divided the community, with some former residents who suffered abuse supporting the memorial, while others fear losing their homes and businesses. The move aims to ensure the atrocities committed there are not forgotten.</p>
