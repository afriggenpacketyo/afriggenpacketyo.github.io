          <p>U.S. steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs announced it is investigating the potential for mining rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This move aligns with a broader national strategy to reduce American dependence on China for these critical minerals, which are essential for manufacturing electric vehicles, semiconductors, and advanced weapons systems. Following the announcement and a statement from CEO Lourenco Goncalves, the company's shares surged significantly as investors speculate on potential government support similar to deals made with other domestic producers.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the requirements for filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, often referred to as liquidation bankruptcy. The primary obstacle for applicants is the "means test," which compares an individual's household income to their state's median income. Those with incomes below the median typically qualify easily, while higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. The process also involves credit counseling and a review of recent financial activities to prevent system abuse, with Chapter 13 bankruptcy or debt settlement offered as alternatives for those who are denied.</p>

          <p>Following a weekend of renewed violence that threatened a U.S.-brokered peace deal, senior American officials, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, have returned to Israel to help stabilize the ceasefire. The clashes began after an attack on Israeli soldiers, leading to retaliatory Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that killed 45 people, according to local health officials. Despite the significant threat to the agreement, both Israel and Hamas have recommitted to the peace process, and humanitarian aid deliveries into Gaza have reportedly resumed after a brief suspension. Vice President JD Vance is also scheduled to visit the region.</p>

          <p>A new report from the National Transportation Safety Board has detailed the final moments before the plane crash that killed country music songwriter Brett James, his wife, and his stepdaughter. The report indicates that James' last radio transmission stated his intention to perform a 360-degree turn to land at Macon County Airport in North Carolina. Surveillance video showed the aircraft flying over the runway before entering a descending left turn that tightened into a spiral, ultimately impacting the ground. The investigation found no initial signs of engine failure, and the aircraft is undergoing further examination.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock price rose nearly 3% following a report from Counterpoint research indicating robust early sales for the new iPhone 17 series in the United States and China. Within the first ten days of availability, sales of the latest model have reportedly outpaced the previous iPhone 16 series by 14%. The base model iPhone 17 is highlighted as particularly compelling for consumers due to its upgraded features at the same price point as last year's model. In response to the strong demand, Loop Capital upgraded Apple's stock from hold to buy and significantly raised its price target.</p>

          <p>A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), originating from its US-East-1 region in Virginia, caused significant disruptions for numerous major websites and online services globally. The issue was attributed to DNS problems with DynamoDB, a core database service, affecting companies like Disney+, Reddit, and United Airlines, as well as Amazon's own internal warehouse and delivery systems. While AWS reported that the initial DNS issue was mitigated and services were recovering, it later noted ongoing API errors and connectivity problems. The event highlights the global economy's heavy reliance on a small number of major cloud infrastructure providers.</p>

His victory is seen as a message from the Turkish Cypriot community rejecting external interference and reaffirming its secular identity.

          <p>This article analyzes the brief, 40-day tenure of manager Ange Postecoglou at Nottingham Forest, which ended with his dismissal following a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea. The appointment is described as an obvious mismatch from the start, as Postecoglou's high-pressing, attacking style of football was fundamentally unsuited to Forest's counter-attacking squad. The piece questions the judgment of both the club's owner, Evangelos Marinakis, for making the hire and Postecoglou for accepting the job. The author suggests that this short and predictable failure has likely damaged Postecoglou's reputation and his prospects for future management positions in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>In response to recent market volatility, Invesco senior portfolio manager John Burrello recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds that utilize options-based strategies. He argues that these funds offer a more reliable form of downside protection because their performance is not directly correlated with traditional asset classes like stocks. This approach can also provide an income stream that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is increasingly important as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates. Burrello advises investors to look for ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and to be wary of funds with unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S. poses a significant risk to the global film industry, with potentially devastating effects on Britain's sector.

Industry experts and politicians warn that such a tariff could cripple British filmmaking capabilities, which often rely on American investment.

While some analysts describe his approach as "FOMO diplomacy" driven by personal preference, his government maintains that a strong international presence is crucial for affirming Indonesia's role as a major democratic, Muslim-majority nation.</p>

          <p>Jose Rodolfo Villareal-Hernandez, a Mexican cartel leader known as "El Gato," is facing a new federal indictment that could make him eligible for the death penalty. The charges stem from the 2013 murder of Juan Jesus Guerrero Chapa in a Southlake, Texas, shopping center. Prosecutors allege Villareal-Hernandez orchestrated the murder-for-hire plot as revenge against a rival cartel he held responsible for his father's death. After years as one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, he was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the U.S. earlier this year to face justice.</p>

          <p>The Louvre museum remained closed on Monday as authorities investigate a daring daytime robbery of priceless treasures from the Apollon Gallery. Thieves stole eight pieces of the French crown jewels, including the historic Pearl and Diamond Tiara commissioned by Napoleon III and several sets of sapphire and emerald jewelry. In their escape, the robbers apparently dropped one item, the Crown of Empress Eugenie, which was recovered outside the museum. Officials believe the heist was the work of "professionals" who used a crane to access an upper window and escaped on motorcycles within minutes, all while tourists were inside the building.</p>

          <p>The Central Committee of China's Communist Party is meeting to formulate its next five-year plan, facing the critical challenge of balancing industrial policy with the need to stimulate domestic consumption. For decades, China's economy has relied on exports and infrastructure, but with those sectors slowing, boosting consumer spending has become urgent. However, analysts believe Beijing will prioritize government spending on developing high-tech industries, like advanced semiconductors, to achieve technological sovereignty and counter geopolitical pressure from the U.S. This focus on industrial strength may leave fewer resources available to address the gloomy mood among Chinese consumers and households.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew's decision to stop using his royal titles has not quelled the public and political scrutiny surrounding his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There are ongoing calls for his titles, such as the Duke of York, to be formally and permanently removed through an act of Parliament. The Metropolitan Police are also investigating claims that the prince sought personal information about Virginia Giuffre, who has accused him of sexual assault. With the recent posthumous publication of Giuffre's memoir repeating her allegations, which the prince denies, royal sources anticipate more difficult days ahead for the Royal Family.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the U.S. should mandate Medicaid coverage for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic to address the nation's obesity crisis, which affects over 40% of American adults. While the high cost of these medications is a major barrier for state budgets, the author contends that the long-term benefits outweigh the initial expense. The piece points out that these drugs not only lead to significant weight loss but also reduce risks for related conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The author suggests that costs will be partially offset by lower healthcare spending and will decrease over time due to market competition.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of the 14 government shutdowns that have occurred since 1980, when a new legal interpretation required agencies to cease operations during funding gaps. The current impasse is the latest in a series of increasingly frequent funding fights over the last decade. The piece details past shutdowns under presidents Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, Obama, and Trump, highlighting the political disputes that caused them, from budget cuts and foreign policy to battles over the Affordable Care Act and border wall funding. The longest shutdown, lasting 34 days, occurred in late 2018 and caused an estimated $3 billion in permanent economic losses.</p>

          <p>While a short government shutdown is unlikely to severely impact air travel, a prolonged one could lead to significant disruptions. Most FAA and TSA employees, including air traffic controllers and airport screeners, are deemed essential and must work without pay. However, past shutdowns have shown that if the impasse continues for weeks, employee absenteeism can rise, leading to longer security lines and potential flight delays. The U.S. Travel Association warns that a shutdown could cost the travel economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, worsening an existing shortage.</p>

The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.46%, while a 15-year mortgage averages 5.81%. To secure the best possible rates, experts advise potential borrowers to strengthen their credit profiles, aiming for scores in the mid-to-high 700s, and to shop around with different lenders. The article also notes that while rates are higher than a few years ago, they are expected to stabilize or decrease if the Federal Reserve continues to hold or cut its benchmark rate.

The bank's subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, is suing the managers of several funds known as the "Cantor Group," alleging a "sweeping betrayal of trust." The lawsuit claims the borrowers secretly subordinated the bank's loans, stripping them of their first-priority claim on collateral, while the properties securing the loans were transferred or foreclosed upon.

          <p>After peaking near 7% earlier in the year, average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen to the mid-6% range, but their future direction depends heavily on inflation and labor market data. Experts suggest that if inflation remains controlled and the job market continues to show signs of weakness, rates could fall further, potentially dipping below 6%. However, if the economy shows unexpected strength, rates could remain elevated. The Mortgage Bankers Association and Fannie Mae both forecast that rates will likely end the year around their current level of 6.5%, though these projections are subject to change based on upcoming economic reports.
