          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border, resulting in at least 250 deaths and 500 injuries, with numbers expected to rise as rescue efforts continue in remote regions. The shallow quake, hitting 17 miles east-northeast of Jalalabad, destroyed numerous villages and caused extensive damage across Kunar and Nangahar provinces. This marks another significant seismic event for Afghanistan, following a deadly 6.3 magnitude quake in October 2023 that killed thousands. Authorities are deploying medical teams from various provinces to assist the affected areas.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to introduce tighter regulations for migrants granted asylum in the UK who wish to bring their families, including stricter English language requirements and proof of sufficient funds. These reforms aim to overhaul a "broken" asylum system and end the reliance on hotels for housing migrants, a policy that has faced public protests. Cooper also highlighted increased efforts by the National Crime Agency against people smugglers and announced a pilot scheme for deporting some Channel migrants to France. The government emphasizes the need for a controlled asylum system despite its proud record of offering sanctuary.</p>

The 27-year-old Belarusian, who won her first US Open title last year, stated she is driven by the desire to win new titles rather than dwelling on past successes. Sabalenka aims to become the first player since Serena Williams in 2014 to successfully defend the women's singles title at Flushing Meadows. She will face Marketa Vondrousova in the next round, continuing her strong performance without dropping a set in the tournament.</p>

The company reported a 78% increase in net income, largely due to investment gains, despite intense competition in China's instant commerce sector. Alibaba's strategic investments in artificial intelligence, including developing a new AI chip and offering AI services via its cloud division, are proving successful, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth. Investors have responded positively, pushing the stock up 40% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Preliminary Census Bureau data indicates that over 1.2 million immigrants, both legal and undocumented, have exited the US labor force from January to July under the Trump administration. This decline, coinciding with a drop in the overall immigrant population, is attributed to stepped-up immigration policies and fears of deportation, impacting key sectors like farming, construction, and healthcare. Experts note that immigrants typically contribute significantly to US job growth, and this reduction has led to labor shortages and wasted crops. The situation creates anxiety for immigrants fearing deportation and economic disruption.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's state-owned rail operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time rail fares starting September 1, leading to significant savings for many passengers. This policy, championed by the Scottish Greens, aims to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars. For instance, a ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow will be nearly 50% cheaper, and Perth to Dundee trips will be a third less. First Minister John Swinney announced the move, stating it will put more money in people's pockets and reduce CO2 emissions.

          <p>The Guatemalan government has stated it proposed to the US Department of Homeland Security that unaccompanied Guatemalan minors be returned home, aiming to prevent them from remaining in shelters and facilitate family reunification. This announcement came after a US federal judge temporarily halted the children's removal, citing concerns over their rights. Guatemala claims all actions prioritize human rights and due process, with plans to integrate the children into social programs. However, attorneys representing the children dispute the government's assertions, alleging violations of federal laws by attempting to deport minors without allowing them to pursue asylum claims.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal Vietnam has significantly expanded its military footprint across 21 features in the contested Spratly Islands, with infrastructure like munitions storage taking shape. This ongoing land reclamation effort positions Vietnam to surpass China in such activities, solidifying its claims in the archipelago also claimed by China, Malaysia, Philippines, and Brunei. Maritime analysts suggest these actions underscore Vietnam's resolve to offset China's strategic advantages. Observers caution that Beijing might respond by upgrading its own defense posture, potentially escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has extensively redecorated the Oval Office in seven months, adding significant gold detailing to the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, which he calls "Trump touches." This "goldening" has divided opinions, with supporters seeing it as a symbol of a new golden age, while critics deem it "vulgar." The president reportedly paid for these personal additions, which also include more presidential paintings and memorabilia. While presidents traditionally personalize the office, Trump's aesthetic choices are notably distinct, setting a unique precedent for White House decor.</p>

          <p>An aid flotilla, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, has departed from Barcelona en route to Gaza, aiming to deliver humanitarian aid and "end the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people." Comprising at least 20 vessels, the Global Sumud Flotilla carries food, water, and medicine, with more ships expected to join from other ports. This marks Thunberg's second attempt to reach Gaza after being deported by Israel in June. The flotilla, expected to arrive in mid-September, seeks to break the maritime blockade imposed on Gaza since 2007, amidst confirmed famine in the region.</p>
