          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated he has no intention of speaking with Elon Musk and threatened consequences if Musk funds Democratic candidates. Trump claimed he provided Musk with "breaks" during his first administration and saved Musk's life in that period. Trump also mentioned he hasn't discussed investigating Musk's business dealings or immigration record. This exchange highlights the escalating tensions between the two figures, particularly as Musk becomes more politically active. Optimism is low as the conflict suggests potential repercussions for Musk's businesses. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk removed several posts on X that were critical of Donald Trump, including one suggesting Trump was implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Trump dismissed Musk's allegations as "old news" and expressed disappointment, threatening to cut federal contracts to Musk's companies. The incident underscores the volatile relationship between Musk and Trump, and the potential impact of social media on political discourse. </p>
