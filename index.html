          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aimed at saving taxpayers billions, has instead incurred significant costs due to firings, re-hirings, and lost productivity. While Musk promised substantial savings, the actual savings are projected to be far less than initially pledged. The Partnership for Public Service estimates that these personnel-related expenses will cost over $135 billion this fiscal year, with additional revenue losses expected at the IRS due to employee departures. This underscores the complexities and unforeseen consequences of large-scale government restructuring.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Venezuelan man, Cristian, who was deported to El Salvador, ruling that his removal violated a previous court settlement. Judge Stephanie Gallagher cited a similar case and ordered the government to request Cristian's release from El Salvador so he can pursue his asylum application in the U.S. The Trump administration argued that Cristian's designation as an 'alien enemy' justified his removal, but the judge deemed the deportation a 'breach of contract'.</p>

          <p>Employees at Barnard College received unsolicited text messages from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) with a link to a voluntary survey asking if they are Jewish or Israeli and whether they have experienced harassment or antisemitism. The survey, part of an EEOC investigation into Barnard's employment practices, sparked anxiety among recipients, with some expressing concern about the creation of a list of Jewish faculty and staff. Barnard College has confirmed the EEOC investigation and stated that it complied with a lawful request to provide employee contact information.</p>
