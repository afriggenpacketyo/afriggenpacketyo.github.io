          <p>A White House commission led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has released its first report on the drivers of childhood chronic disease, titled "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA). The report identifies poor diet, chemical exposure, lack of physical activity, and "overmedicalization" as key factors, aligning with Kennedy's long-standing views. Critics, including current and former federal health officials, argue the report misrepresents facts and omits well-documented causes, such as maternal health and preterm birth, and that scientific research and federal data had been selectively misrepresented. The report's recommendations, including criticism of ultra-processed foods and the vaccine schedule, have drawn both support and concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Cessna Citation jet crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego early Thursday morning, resulting in multiple fatalities among those on board and the destruction of several homes. The crash occurred in Murphy Canyon near the Tierrasanta neighborhood, igniting fires that engulfed multiple homes and vehicles. Approximately 100 residents were evacuated, and authorities described the scene as a "gigantic debris field" with jet fuel running down the streets. The plane had departed from Colonel James Jabara Airport in Wichita, Kansas, and was attempting to land at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport when the crash occurred. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the accident.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from firing half of the Department of Education's workforce and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration. The judge criticized the administration's actions as an attempt to abolish the department outright, rather than a legitimate reorganization to improve efficiency. The ruling came in response to a challenge from state attorneys general, schools, and nonprofits, who argued that the president cannot unilaterally shut down a federal department created by Congress. The judge agreed, stating that the changes imposed by the administration would make it impossible for the Department to carry out its mandated functions.</p>

          <p>Most teachers and doctors in England have been granted a 4% pay increase following government acceptance of recommendations from pay review bodies. While education unions have welcomed the decision, they have also warned of potential cuts to school budgets without additional funding to cover the costs. Health unions, however, have reacted with anger after NHS staff other than doctors were offered a smaller rise of 3.6%. The British Medical Association plans to ballot resident doctors over possible strike action, calling the rise "woefully inadequate." The government intends to fund the rises through a combination of existing budgets and improved productivity.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, forecasting 13 to 19 named storms between June 1 and November 30.

The forecast cites the neutral condition of the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle and warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures as contributing factors. NOAA emphasizes the importance of preparedness for communities in storm-prone areas, with the possibility of an updated forecast later in the season.</p>

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant decline after House Republicans passed a tax bill that eliminates key clean energy credits. The legislation terminates tax credits for residential solar installers, impacting companies like Sunrun, whose stock plummeted. Analysts described the bill as a "worse than feared" scenario for clean energy, as it undermines the Inflation Reduction Act. The bill also ends investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities, affecting utility-scale solar projects. While manufacturing tax credits remain largely untouched, the overall impact is expected to be negative for the solar industry, though the Senate may introduce changes to the legislation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has ordered its last batch of "blanks" for pennies, signaling an end to the production of the one-cent coin. This decision comes as the cost of minting pennies has risen to 3.69 cents apiece, prompting the government to seek ways to reduce unnecessary spending. The move is expected to save taxpayers $85 million annually and will eventually lead to businesses rounding prices to the nearest nickel. While pennies will remain legal tender, the shift is anticipated to streamline transactions and reduce waste, aligning with President Trump's call to eliminate wasteful spending.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Cuts to Disaster Response Agencies Raise Concerns Ahead of Hurricane Season</h2>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to downsize the government are raising concerns among state and city officials about the ability to respond to natural disasters. With the Atlantic hurricane season approaching, states are bracing for potential impacts from cuts at FEMA and NOAA, including fewer meteorologists and experienced managers. Governors and mayors are also anticipating less financial aid from the federal government, shifting the burden of response and recovery to state and local entities. The cuts have led to uncertainty and a lack of clear guidance for states as they prepare for what could be a challenging disaster season.</p>

          <p>The coming Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be busier than usual, with NOAA forecasting between six and ten hurricanes, just as cuts to American research are raising fears about the ability to track and prepare for these often deadly storms. Warmer sea temperatures, made more likely by climate change, and generally favorable atmospheric conditions, are behind the forecast. Several scientists have told the BBC that widespread firings by President Donald Trump's administration of government researchers could endanger efforts to monitor hurricanes and predict where they might hit.</p>

          <p>PBS's American Masters series censored a 90-second segment from a documentary about Art Spiegelman, the author of Maus, due to his reference to Donald Trump's "smug and ugly mug." The decision came after the network faced accusations of being a "radical left-wing echo chamber" and amid plans to claw back federal funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The filmmakers argue that the censored material was central to the film's theme of free speech and Spiegelman's warnings about incipient fascism.

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decline was driven by fewer people coming to work and study in the UK, as well as a decrease in the number of dependents accompanying visa holders. The ONS also noted that many people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased have now left the country. The government highlighted a significant increase in returns of failed asylum seekers and foreign national offenders, as well as a reduction in the asylum backlog and hotel use.</p>

Despite the setback, North Korea launched multiple cruise missiles from its eastern coast on the same day.

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's close alliance with Donald Trump has seemingly backfired, leaving Israel increasingly isolated in the region. Despite Netanyahu's enthusiastic support for Trump, the president has snubbed Israel in recent weeks by pursuing nuclear negotiations with Iran and excluding the country from regional deals. This shift in U.S. policy has undermined Netanyahu's image as a geopolitical genius and exposed the limitations of his reliance on Trump. The Israeli leader's bet on Trump has threatened his legacy, as he faces criticism for his handling of the Gaza conflict and his diminished influence on the international stage.</p>

          <p>President Trump's missile defense project, dubbed the "Golden Dome for America," aims to protect the U.S. from foreign missile threats through a multilayered system involving space-based sensors and interceptors. The initiative, estimated to cost hundreds of billions of dollars, has been criticized by China as potentially increasing the risk of militarizing space and fueling an arms race. While supporters describe it as a revolutionary concept, the plan currently lacks funding and is still in the conceptual stage. The project draws inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome, which has proven effective in intercepting shorter-range rockets.</p>
