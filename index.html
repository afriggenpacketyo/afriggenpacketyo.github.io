          <h2>Religious Divisions Emerge in American Politics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 06:09:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend reveals a growing divide within American religion, as young, conservative individuals, particularly men, are converting to Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. These converts, often disillusioned with modernity and seeking community, are bringing their political ideologies into traditionally cultural and community-focused religious institutions. This influx is creating tension between cradle Catholics/Orthodox and converts, potentially leading to further polarization within American religion and impacting civil society as houses of worship become more politically divided. The converts' challenges to established hierarchies also raise concerns about authority and the spread of misinformation online.</p>

          <p>Conservative commentators are increasingly fixated on the idea that Barack and Michelle Obama's marriage is failing, despite a lack of evidence. This obsession seems rooted in sexism and an inability to accept that the Obamas are living happy lives. Michelle Obama has suggested that the scrutiny stems from societal difficulty in accepting a woman's choice to prioritize herself. The focus on their marriage distracts from legitimate criticisms of Barack Obama's policies, such as his drone strike policies.</p>

          <p>Erin Baker, an expert in energy transition, discusses the importance of both incremental advances and breakthroughs in clean energy technology. She emphasizes that breakthroughs often involve the convergence of existing technologies and policies, rather than entirely new inventions. Baker highlights the moral motivation driving clean energy innovation and the need for flexibility and adaptability in the face of uncertainty. She suggests streamlining grid interconnection processes and investing in transmission infrastructure as key strategies for promoting clean energy adoption.</p>

He will allocate more time to Tesla after criticism that his political involvement has negatively impacted the company. Trump's tariffs on China have also weighed heavily on Tesla, which depends on many parts made in China. Temporary government employees are normally limited to working 130 days a year, which is set to expire late next month.</p>

This development comes as BP has shifted its strategy back towards oil investments to regain investor confidence.

BP had previously scaled back its emissions targets to keep investing in oil and gas to meet global demand.</p>
