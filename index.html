          <h2>Iran Reserves Options After U.S. Strikes Nuclear Sites; Launches Attacks on Israel</h2>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister stated that Tehran retains all options to defend itself following what it considers an "outrageous" U.S. attack on its nuclear enrichment facilities. Simultaneously, Iran launched another series of missile and drone strikes targeting Israeli military sites, prompting Israel to initiate its own missile offensives within western Iran. These exchanges follow Israel's earlier surprise attack on Iran, escalating tensions in the region after the U.S. directly attacked Iran for the first time. Iran accuses the U.S. and Israel of undermining diplomatic efforts, while President Trump claims the U.S. strikes have "completely obliterated" Iran's key enrichment facilities, although this claim remains unverified by international agencies. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iranian dissident groups have renewed calls for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic and its leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Reza Pahlavi, son of the former Shah, asserted that the strikes are a consequence of the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons at the expense of the Iranian people. Maryam Rajavi, of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, stated that Khamenei must step down and is responsible for the costly and deadly nuclear program. Rajavi called for a free, democratic, and non-nuclear Iran with separation of religion and state.</p>

          <p>The second China-Central Asia Summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, highlighted Beijing's strengthening economic and political ties with countries in the region, including Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Agreements worth nearly $25 billion were signed between China and its regional partners, and China National Nuclear Corporation will lead a project to build another nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. The European Union is also seeking to expand ties with Central Asia for raw materials, while Russia maintains strong security ties through the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO).

          <p>The article analyzes the implications of the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites on the trajectory of the conflict between Israel and Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu lauded President Trump's decision, suggesting it could lead to the neutralization of Iran's nuclear threat. However, Iran has claimed to have already moved its nuclear material, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei previously warned of retaliation against any U.S. military intervention. The article posits that whether the conflict escalates further depends on how Iran and its allies choose to respond to the U.S. action.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched a series of missiles at Israel, resulting in at least 21 injuries. Iranian missiles impacted several locations across Israel, including Haifa, Tel Aviv, Be'er Yaakov, and Nes Ziona. Searches are underway for individuals possibly trapped in collapsed buildings in Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces reported that approximately 30 missiles were launched, and there was a possible issue with the interceptor system in Haifa, while Iran has reportedly fired over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel since the start of Israel's "Operation Rising Lion," resulting in hundreds of deaths in Iran according to a Washington-based human rights group.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted in 2001 for the murder of her husband Bob, has had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison, due to the emergence of new evidence. Working with the Loyola Project for the Innocent, re-examination of blood evidence from the couple's bedroom revealed inconsistencies and previously untested samples. Despite maintaining her innocence, Dorotik was found guilty based on blood spatter evidence and a bloody syringe found in her home. The San Diego County District Attorney's Office ultimately recommended her conviction be overturned, and while initially planning to retry her, eventually dropped the charges due to insufficient evidence.</p>

China's financial authorities granted Hong Kong residents a new daily remittance quota for the yuan, which HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue Wai-man said would boost the city's status as a financial center.

          <p>Two Chinese studies suggest that the spleen could become a hub for treating diabetes through advances in cell transplantation. Researchers at Nanjing University found that "shielding" islet cells could improve their survival after being transplanted into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. The spleen, engineered with nanoparticles, could be a more promising long-term survival site for transplanted cells than the liver. Professor Dong Lei suggests that the spleen could become an ideal organ for islet transplantation pending systematic clinical studies, which could impact the millions affected by diabetes worldwide.</p>

The U.S. reportedly targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with potential use of GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, and international agencies report no increase in radiation levels after the attack.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on nuclear sites in Iran, U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called for Iran to "return to the negotiating table." In a statement, Starmer emphasized the importance of regional stability and described Iran's nuclear program as a significant threat to international security. He stated that the U.S. took action to alleviate that threat, and reiterated that Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. The U.K. government was informed of the U.S. strikes in advance but had no direct involvement.</p>

          <p>Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, criticized Iran's UN representative, calling him a "wolf disguised as a diplomat," during a Security Council session hours before the U.S. struck nuclear sites in Iran. Following the U.S. strikes, Iran's Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani requested an emergency Security Council meeting to condemn the U.S. actions. Danon accused Iran of financing terrorism and highlighted the council's hypocrisy, while UN Secretary-General Guterres expressed grave alarm over the U.S. use of force and called for de-escalation, as an Iranian missile attack struck cities in Israel.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created a two-kilowatt fiber laser capable of operating without heating or cooling systems in extreme climates, ranging from Arctic temperatures to the Sahara Desert. This portable device, designed for defense and industrial use, contrasts with similar lasers that require large cooling units. The team, led by Chen Jinbao, achieved this by stabilizing laser performance across 100-degree temperature swings through innovative design choices, including 940-nanometer pump lasers and strategic placement of heat-sensitive components. The laser's core features a dual-clad optical resonator, amplifying photons into a lethal beam.</p>

          <p>President Trump, who previously pledged to be a peacemaker, authorized a military strike on Iran, targeting three nuclear sites, marking a departure from his earlier promises to avoid war. The decision contradicts his 2024 campaign pledges to "prevent World War Three" and end "chaos in the Middle East." While Trump has consistently opposed Iran's nuclear ambitions, this action represents a shift from his previous stance of seeking peace through diplomacy. This action raises questions about the future of U.S. foreign policy in the region.</p>
