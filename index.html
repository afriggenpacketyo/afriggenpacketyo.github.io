          <p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully launched the Crew-11 mission, carrying an international team of four astronauts to the International Space Station. The crew, comprising members from NASA, Japan's JAXA, and Russia's Roscosmos, will spend six months in orbit conducting scientific research. This mission is notable as it marks the first spaceflight for commander Zena Cardman, whose original flight was rescheduled due to issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The launch continues SpaceX's role as NASA's primary partner for transporting astronauts, a partnership that began in 2020.</p>

          <p>A crew of four astronauts, whose mission was previously delayed by ongoing problems with Boeing's Starliner, has successfully launched to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX capsule. The flight provides a ride for astronauts who were sidelined, including commander Zena Cardman, to make room for the return of the Starliner test pilots on a different SpaceX craft. This launch highlights the current reliability of SpaceX for crewed missions in contrast to the technical challenges and delays grounding the Starliner program. The crew is scheduled for at least a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.</p>

          <p>150 years after his death, Danish author Hans Christian Andersen remains a globally celebrated figure whose fairy tales continue to captivate audiences. Rising from a difficult childhood, his stories like "The Ugly Duckling" and "The Little Mermaid" explore timeless themes of social injustice, longing, and personal transformation. While often seen as children's stories, his work contains subtle social criticism and profound messages that resonate with both young and old readers. Andersen's legacy is cemented by countless adaptations, including famous Disney films, and the prestigious children's literature award that bears his name.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed new details about the double homicide at Devil's Den State Park in Arkansas, stating that Cristen Amanda Brink was fatally stabbed after attempting to save her husband, Clinton David Brink. After the initial attack on her husband, she reportedly led their two young children to safety before returning to intervene. A 28-year-old former schoolteacher has been arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder in the case, which police believe was a random act. The suspect's DNA was matched to evidence at the scene, and he has reportedly made an admission to the killings.</p>

This figure represents a dramatic decrease from the peak of the crisis during the previous administration, which saw over 249,000 apprehensions in December 2023. The Trump administration attributes the sharp decline to its enforcement policies, including the deployment of troops and the replacement of the CBP One app with a self-deportation tool. For the third consecutive month, there were zero migrant releases into the U.S., signaling a significant shift in border management.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer temperatures rise, portable neck cooling fans have gained popularity as a way to beat the heat, but their actual effectiveness is debated. These devices work by blowing air across the neck and face, which can enhance the body's natural cooling process of sweat evaporation. However, experts note that in high humidity, this process is less effective, and the fans primarily create a sensation of being cooler rather than significantly lowering core body temperature. While users report feeling more comfortable, physiologists caution that this could lead to a false sense of security, potentially causing overexertion in dangerous heat.</p>

The policy, driven by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, aims to increase representation from working-class families within Whitehall. A student's background will be determined by their parents' occupation when they were 14. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, a primary entry point into the civil service, in an effort to make the institution more reflective of the country it serves.</p>

Furthermore, a country can only be considered safe if it provides adequate protection for its entire population, including minority groups.

This article outlines five important rules, including keeping total annual fees below 1% and not committing funds to a deferred annuity unless you can wait at least a decade for returns. It also advises using annuities to first cover essential living expenses and limiting the total allocation of your retirement portfolio to annuities to no more than 25%. These guidelines can help prospective buyers make informed decisions and avoid common financial pitfalls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has intensified his public criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, whom he called a "stubborn MORON" in a social media post. Following the Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady and the release of a weak jobs report, Trump urged the central bank's board to seize control and cut rates if Powell refuses. This represents a significant escalation in his attacks on the Fed's traditional independence from political interference. Trump's comments aim to shift blame for any economic slowdown onto the central bank as his administration prepares to implement a new wave of tariffs.</p>

          <p>The English Football League (EFL) is reportedly growing increasingly concerned about the financial stability of the Sheffield Wednesday football club and its ability to fulfill fixtures for the upcoming season. The club is facing a severe crisis under its current ownership, including multiple failures to pay player and staff wages, rising debts, and an embargo on paying transfer fees. Several first-team players have already exited their contracts due to late payments, leaving the squad severely depleted just before the Championship season is set to begin. The club has also recently parted with its manager and closed a stand at its stadium due to safety issues.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of administering poison after eight children and one adult at a summer camp in Leicestershire, UK, became ill. All nine individuals were taken to the hospital as a precaution and have since been discharged. The incident occurred at the Stathern Lodge camp, and the man was later detained at a nearby pub. Residents described chaotic scenes as emergency services, including numerous ambulances and police, established a triage center at a local village hall to assess the children. The police force has referred itself to a watchdog over its handling of the initial report.</p>

          <p>A coalition in Sudan led by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has announced the formation of a rival "Transitional Peace Government," a move that threatens to formalize the country's division. The new administration, based in the RSF-controlled Darfur region, claims jurisdiction over all of Sudan, directly challenging the internationally recognized government in Khartoum. The African Union and the United Nations have condemned the move, warning it will complicate peace efforts and could lead to the country's fragmentation. The war, which began in April 2023, has already created the world's largest displacement crisis.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, which is forecast to hit the country on Monday with strong winds and heavy rain. It is the sixth named storm of the season and is expected to bring disruptive winds, with gusts potentially reaching 60 to 70 mph in many areas and up to 85 mph in exposed coastal regions of Scotland. Because trees are in full leaf at this time of year, there is a greater risk of them being toppled, leading to potential travel disruption and power outages. While named storms in August are not rare, they can have a greater impact than winter storms.</p>

          <p>The top U.S. professional rugby competition, Major League Rugby, is facing a significant crisis after a recent merger and a team withdrawal reduced the league to nine teams. Now, reports indicate that two more teams, the Utah Warriors and Miami Sharks, are seeking new funding to remain viable, potentially shrinking the league to just seven entrants. The league's commissioner stated that MLR could continue with a strong core of seven teams, but the financial instability raises concerns about the sport's professional future in North America. This comes as World Rugby aims to invest in the U.S. ahead of upcoming World Cups.</p>

          <p>Federal data reveals that vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year has decreased, while the rate of vaccine exemptions has risen to a record high of 3.6%. Coverage for essential vaccines like MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and polio has fallen slightly to around 92.5%, which is below the 95% threshold recommended for herd immunity. This decline in vaccination rates is concerning to public health experts, as it coincides with the highest number of measles cases recorded in the U.S. in over three decades, increasing the risk of further preventable disease outbreaks.</p>

          <p>A year after mass protests led to the resignation and flight of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh is still grappling with political division and human rights concerns. An interim government led by economist Muhammad Yunus has been established, but it has been criticized by rights groups for not delivering on systemic reforms and for targeting political opponents. While some political freedoms have returned and Islamist parties have gained visibility, the country remains polarized. The interim government has banned Hasina's Awami League party pending a tribunal, further deepening the political schism as the nation looks toward future elections.</p>

The company now anticipates full-year revenue between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion. Despite the lowered outlook and a 41% year-over-year drop in second-quarter sales, the company's results beat Wall Street expectations, largely due to successful cost-cutting measures, including recent layoffs. The shipment to the U.K. is not canceled but has been moved to the first quarter of 2026 to align with the country's fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

Human rights groups have criticized the militarized aid system, calling it a "bloodbath," while Israel maintains its troops only fire warning shots.

          <p>The rise of tobacco-free nicotine products like vapes and pouches such as Zyn has complicated the public health conversation around the drug. While these alternatives are widely considered less harmful than combustible cigarettes, which kill due to burning tobacco, the long-term health effects of nicotine alone are still not well understood. Researchers point to potential cardiovascular risks and other concerns, but the most definitive problem is nicotine's highly addictive nature. This creates a dilemma for public health, balancing the harm reduction benefits for smokers against the risk of creating a new generation of users addicted to a drug with unknown long-term consequences.</p>
