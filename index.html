          <p>Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff condemned the leaking of an initial intelligence assessment regarding the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, labeling it as treasonous. The assessment, produced by U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency, suggested that the strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months and did not completely destroy it. Witkoff assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, stating that no one is shooting at each other and that resuming Iran's nuclear enrichment program within months is not conceivable. He emphasized the importance of investigating the leak, regardless of the information's nature or origin.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born more recently in the Milky Way spin faster than older stars, offering new insights into the galaxy's evolution. Researchers analyzed thousands of stars using data from Europe’s Gaia space telescope, finding that younger stars spin up to 10 times faster than their older counterparts. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study, published in The Astrophysical Journal, provides the first direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study how the galaxy has changed.</p>

          <h2>Intel Assessment Claims Iran Nuclear Program Set Back Months by Strikes</h2>

          <p>A classified intelligence assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by months, not years as initially claimed. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, found that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, potentially delaying the program's resumption. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes, but officials cautioned that the assessment was preliminary and subject to change. The White House has disputed the findings, while others insist the strikes were devastating, leading to conflicting narratives about the operation's success.</p>

          <p>Former college football coach Steve Spurrier expressed skepticism about the hype surrounding Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning, despite Manning's highly touted potential. Spurrier questioned why coach Steve Sarkisian chose to start Quinn Ewers over Manning in previous seasons, considering Ewers was a seventh-round NFL Draft pick. Manning, who appeared in 10 games last season, is set to be the starting quarterback this year, with high expectations for the Longhorns' performance in the SEC. Spurrier's comments add intrigue to Manning's upcoming season and the team's prospects.</p>

          <p>ICE is holding a record 59,000 immigrant detainees, with nearly half lacking a criminal record, indicating a widening scope of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. Internal data shows that ICE's detention level is at over 140% capacity, surpassing previous peaks. The increased detention level is driven by arrests in the U.S. interior, reversing limits placed by previous administrations. Concerns are growing about deteriorating conditions in ICE detention amid the rapid expansion in the detainee population, raising questions about due process.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's Venice wedding party venue was moved from the city center to a more isolated location due to protests. Residents and pressure groups rallied against the event, arguing that it would transform the city into a private amusement park for the rich. The wedding party, expected to cost between €40 to €48 million, will now be held in the Arsenale, a safer venue surrounded by water. Protesters plan to continue demonstrations on Venice's canals and streets, aiming to disrupt the event.</p>

The church plans to use the donation for scholarships and entrepreneurship programs, while Target defends its partnership as a way to make a meaningful impact in communities.

          <p>Childhood vaccinations have prevented an estimated 154 million deaths over the past 50 years, showcasing the remarkable potential of immunization. However, a recent study in The Lancet reveals that efforts to boost vaccination rates have stalled or reversed in many places since 2010. Factors such as conflict, supply chain issues, and vaccine misinformation have contributed to this decline, with the COVID-19 pandemic further disrupting vaccination efforts. Despite these challenges, countries like India have shown success in reducing the number of zero-dose children through targeted immunization programs.</p>

Lab-grown meat, officially known as cultivated meat, is biologically real meat grown from cow cells, offering a potential solution to the rising demand for meat and its associated greenhouse gas emissions. However, critics argue that the environmental benefits have been oversold, with some studies suggesting that the energy-intensive production process may not be as climate-friendly as initially claimed.

Scandals that once disqualified candidates now seem to be just another factor in voters' cost-benefit analysis. The article examines the shift in how the public views sex scandals, the cognitive load of processing multiple scandals, and the impact of partisan polarization. While scandals can still hurt a flawed politician, voters are often willing to overlook them if they believe the candidate is more electable or if they strongly oppose their rival's views.</p>

          <p>Seven-time French champions Lyon have been relegated to Ligue 2 due to financial issues, a decision the club plans to appeal. Lyon raised around £45m through player sales and released high earners to improve their finances. Despite these efforts, the DNCG, the organization responsible for monitoring the accounts of French football clubs, deemed their finances insufficient. The club asserts they have sufficient financial resources for the upcoming season, but the relegation stands unless their appeal is successful, marking a significant setback for the club.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has authorized a $30m grant to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an organization accused of “politicizing” food distribution in Gaza. The GHF, backed by the US and Israel, claims to deliver millions of meals without Hamas interference, but its rollout has been chaotic. Critics cite Israeli forces killing hundreds near distribution centers, resignations due to the mission being “politicized,” and close ties with the Israeli government. The grant application was reportedly rushed through the State Department despite ethical concerns.</p>
