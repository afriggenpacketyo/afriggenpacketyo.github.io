            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has allowed the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez to proceed, despite objections from the District Attorney's office. The brothers, convicted of the 1989 killings of their parents, are seeking a reduced sentence that could make them eligible for parole, leveraging a California law for inmates under 26 at the time of their crimes. District Attorney Nathan Hochman argued against resentencing, claiming the brothers haven't fully taken responsibility, but the judge emphasized consistency in legal proceedings. The hearing will determine if the brothers, who have spent over three decades in prison, will be resentenced to a term that allows for potential parole. Optimism Score: 50</p>

            <p>Former President Donald Trump stated that he underwent a cognitive test as part of his recent physical examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Trump asserted that he "aced" the test, which was part of a broader set of medical evaluations, the results of which his doctors would release in the coming days. This disclosure comes amidst ongoing scrutiny of Trump's health, especially given his age as the oldest president to seek a second term. The White House previously defended the decision not to include a cognitive test in President Biden's 2024 physical. Optimism Score: 75</p>

            <p>Economists are expressing concerns that President Trump's recent tariff increases could lead to a recession in the United States, citing market turmoil and rising costs for businesses. Goldman Sachs has increased its recession probability estimate to 45%, while JPMorgan projects inflation to reach 4.4% by year-end. Despite strong employment figures, surveys indicate growing unease among consumers and businesses regarding the economic outlook. The tariffs, economists warn, could disrupt global supply chains and reduce corporate investment, potentially leading to job losses and economic contraction.

Edison is taking precautionary measures, including additional field inspections and revisions to its maintenance manual, to prevent similar incidents. The company reported a momentary surge of electrical current on its lines near the fire's origin, prompting further investigation into induction, a phenomenon where a nearby active line induces current in an unconnected line.

            <p>A federal judge has accused the Trump administration of failing to comply with an order to provide information about a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis stated that the administration has made no meaningful effort to answer basic questions about the man's location and steps taken to facilitate his return. The Justice Department cited the need for review and vetting before sharing information, which the judge deemed insufficient. The case involves Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported despite a court order forbidding his removal to El Salvador. Optimism Score: 25</p>

            <p>Following the announcement that Colossal Biosciences successfully created dire wolf puppies, the Trump administration is reconsidering the Endangered Species List. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum expressed enthusiasm for “de-extinction” technology and its potential to strengthen biodiversity protection efforts. Burgum wants to celebrate the removal of animals from the list with genetic engineering technology, adding that "the status quo is focused on regulation more than innovation." The administration aims to improve recovery efforts and envisions a future where the list is no longer needed. Optimism Score: 65</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's record tariffs on Beijing could test China's ability to withstand Western economic pressure in a Taiwan Strait crisis. The tariffs, reaching 145%, could embolden Beijing if it weathers the economic strain. However, a decision on Taiwan remains complex, involving political and military considerations. The United States maintains a stance against unilateral changes to Taiwan's status and supports the island's defense. (not investment advice) Optimism Score: 45</p>
