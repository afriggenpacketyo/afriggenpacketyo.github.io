          <p>U.S. Treasury yields showed little movement as the federal government officially shut down after lawmakers failed to agree on a funding bill. Investors are currently in a wait-and-see mode, monitoring the shutdown's duration and potential economic impact. The stoppage will delay the release of key economic data, such as the nonfarm payrolls report, creating uncertainty for the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions. If the shutdown becomes prolonged, it could negatively affect the perceived credit quality of U.S. debt, potentially leading to higher yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions in the South China Sea have been highlighted by recent statements from Chinese officials regarding the disputed Scarborough Shoal. A Chinese coastguard officer described protecting the island as a "sacred duty and glorious mission," vowing to defend the country's territorial sovereignty. This declaration was accompanied by a call from China's Ministry of Natural Resources to strengthen enforcement against illegal activities in the area. The Philippines has strongly condemned China's stance, calling the move "illegitimate and unlawful" and reaffirming the shoal as an integral part of its own territory.</p>

          <p>Residential electricity rates across the United States have risen significantly, outpacing inflation and creating financial strain for many households. The article identifies several contributing factors, including increased demand, volatile fuel prices, and delays in grid infrastructure development. While these high prices disproportionately affect lower-income families, the report also notes that a broader shift toward electrification, particularly in vehicles, could lead to a decrease in overall household energy spending by 2050. Policy suggestions to mitigate the impact include bolstering energy assistance programs and deploying more renewable generation and battery storage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York Yankees player Mark Teixeira, who is now running for Congress in Texas, has publicly blamed the Democratic Party for the U.S. government shutdown. In a social media post, Teixeira stated that Democrats are "destroying our country" and that his campaign is motivated by the need to support President Trump. His comments came as the Senate failed to pass a government funding bill, leading to a shutdown.

          <p>The U.S. oil and gas sector is undergoing significant job cuts, with thousands of positions eliminated in response to falling crude prices, rising tariffs, and a wave of industry consolidation.

Some industry executives have criticized the Trump administration's policies, arguing that the push for lower oil prices combined with tariffs on materials like steel has squeezed profits and forced layoffs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Snapchat is set to change its long-standing policy of free, unlimited storage for users' saved photos and videos. The company announced it will begin charging for its "Memories" feature for users who have more than five gigabytes of saved content. This transition to a paid storage model has been met with criticism from some users who have accumulated large archives over the years. Snap defended the move, stating it is necessary to fund continued investment and improvement of the feature for its community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's new policy imposing a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications is a detrimental move that will stifle American innovation and economic growth. The authors, both immigrant university professors, assert that highly skilled immigrants are a vital source of entrepreneurship and are responsible for a significant portion of U.S. innovation. Instead of restricting access, they advocate for expanding the H-1B program and distributing these workers more broadly across the country to stimulate local economies and maintain a competitive edge, particularly in fields like AI.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced his intention to change how international law is interpreted in British courts, specifically concerning asylum and deportation cases. The goal is to prevent foreign criminals and unsuccessful asylum seekers from using Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights—which prohibits torture and degrading treatment—to block their removal. Starmer argued that current interpretations are being used to claim that conditions like different healthcare or prison standards constitute such treatment. The proposal signals a tougher stance on immigration and has sparked debate among human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has convicted Jose Echeverria and Dallas Pineda of first-degree murder for the 2015 killings of 19-year-old Gabriella Calzada and 17-year-old Brianna Gallegos. Although investigators obtained jailhouse confessions from both men shortly after the crime, the case languished in the court system for nearly a decade due to a series of legal and procedural delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial revealed the brutal nature of the murders, where the victims were shot and bludgeoned in a park, bringing a long-awaited resolution for their families.</p>

          <p>Erroll Southers, a controversial figure on the Los Angeles Police Commission, will retain his seat for a full five-year term due to a procedural default by the City Council. The council did not hold a confirmation vote within the legally required 45-day period after Mayor Karen Bass nominated him for a new term. Southers has faced significant criticism from activists for his perceived deference to the police chief and for his past academic work on counterterrorism strategies developed in Israel. This failure to vote allows his appointment to proceed without council approval.</p>

          <p>Residents of Altadena, California, are expressing growing concern and frustration over the removal of numerous trees in the aftermath of the devastating Eaton fire. Many of the trees, including mature eucalyptus and deodar cedars, appeared to be showing signs of recovery but were cut down by county workers and private developers. Community members and local arborists fear the town is losing its vital tree canopy too quickly, which could increase heat and remove windbreaks that previously protected homes. The lack of notification for some removals has further fueled residents' sense of loss and responsibility.</p>

          <p>In this commentary, the author argues that the Trump administration's approach to immigration enforcement has devolved into a performance of cruelty, far removed from the professional conduct of the past. The piece contrasts the current environment, marked by dehumanizing rhetoric and aggressive actions by ICE and Border Patrol, with previous eras of enforcement. The author contends that this overt meanness is a deliberate policy from the top down, creating a "Cruelty Olympics" among officials and ultimately backfiring by generating public sympathy for immigrants.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing a sharp decline in new apartment construction, with the number of units being built expected to hit a decade-low, despite extremely high demand for housing. Developers report that it has become nearly impossible to build profitably, as major investors are increasingly reluctant to fund projects in the city. This investor hesitation is attributed to a combination of factors, including regulatory uncertainty, new real estate transfer taxes, rising material costs, and labor shortages, all of which are exacerbating the region's severe housing crisis.</p>

          <p>California voters will decide on Proposition 50, a controversial measure to redraw the state's congressional district maps to favor the Democratic Party for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections. The proposition would temporarily suspend the state's 15-year-old independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission. Supporters, including Governor Gavin Newsom, frame it as a necessary response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas. Opponents, including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, argue it's a partisan power grab that undermines California's commitment to good governance and fair elections.</p>
