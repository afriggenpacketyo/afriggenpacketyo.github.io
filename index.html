          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman underscores the challenges the party faces in its rapid ascent. Yusuf, a self-made millionaire, played a crucial role in the party's success, providing financial support and organizational expertise. His heritage also helped temper criticism of the party as racist, broadening its appeal. However, his departure highlights the difficulty of hiring and retaining staff to build a sustainable, election-winning machine. Yusuf's abrasive management style led to internal conflicts, emphasizing the need for Reform UK to foster a more stable and cohesive team.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China is causing producer prices to remain deflationary, leading to a potential "China shock" as cheap exports flood global markets. This influx of low-cost goods could provide relief for inflation-hit economies, offering consumers lower prices. While some countries worry about local industries being squeezed, economists suggest that the lower costs could prompt central banks to consider rate cuts. Nomura predicts that several Asian central banks may decouple from the Federal Reserve and implement further easing measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by softened inflation and slower growth amid global uncertainty. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra emphasized that the Indian economy presents strength and stability, despite holding the full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The central bank revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year, indicating potential for undershooting the target. Given the significant rate cut, the RBI will shift its monetary policy stance to "neutral" to balance growth and inflation effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

The report analyzed over 800 million job ads and company financial reports, revealing that AI is creating jobs and increasing wages in AI-exposed occupations. It found that productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI since 2022. The report also indicates that AI can enrich automatable jobs, allowing employees to focus on more complex tasks, and may even benefit countries with declining working-age populations.</p>

          <p>Thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales are collapsing annually due to lost, damaged, or missing evidence, according to a BBC investigation. Over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offences. The data suggests a rising trend in cases collapsing due to unavailable evidence, with police forces facing challenges in evidence storage and management. Former officers attribute the issue to resourcing problems and the overwhelming amount of evidence they handle. A criminologist points to the loss of the dedicated Forensic Science Service in 2012 as a contributing factor.</p>

          <p>Sweden's economy and households are feeling the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, according to the country's finance minister. The finance minister, Elisabeth Svantesson, noted that market volatility caused by trade uncertainty is affecting Swedish savers, who heavily invest in funds and stock markets. The Swedish economy shrank 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, and the finance ministry has revised its growth forecasts downwards. She said that the unpredictability of tariffs is hurting Sweden, an export-dependent country. The uncertainty has also shaken household confidence, with some Swedish fund savers becoming nervous.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, restricting foreign nationals from 19 countries, is part of a broader pattern of draconian immigration policies implemented during his second term. The administration has taken steps to dismantle legal immigration, including suspending the asylum system, ending temporary legal residency for thousands, and restricting student visas. Experts note that the new ban is more targeted and less chaotic than Trump's initial travel ban in 2017, but it still separates families and affects those seeking refuge. The administration has also arrested people at immigration check-ins and detained scholars and travelers without reason.</p>

Koizumi emphasized that emergency rice imports are one of the options to ease distribution shortages. The phrase "no sacred cows" echoes his father's reform-oriented approach as former Prime Minister.
