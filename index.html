        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's policy requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement to receive certain FEMA grants is unconstitutional. The decision came in a lawsuit filed by 20 states, which argued that critical emergency preparedness funding was being unlawfully withheld to pressure them into assisting immigration agents. U.S. District Judge William Smith found the policy to be "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," stating that the potential loss of disaster funds would cause irreparable harm. This ruling marks a significant setback for the administration's efforts to penalize so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with ICE.</p>

          <p>A former Riverside County sheriff’s deputy, Oscar Rodriguez, has been sentenced to one year in jail and ten years of probation for the 2014 voluntary manslaughter of his girlfriend's ex-partner. Rodriguez, who was on duty at the time, ambushed and shot Luis Morin outside his home, a fact that emerged during a civil lawsuit filed by the victim's family. The district attorney’s office had recommended a 10-year sentence and objected to the judge's decision, stating it minimized the gravity of the crime. The county previously settled a civil suit with Morin's family for $6.95 million.</p>

          <p>A shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, opened fire from a rooftop on a Dallas ICE field office, killing one detainee and critically injuring two others before taking his own life. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack, as shell casings found near the suspect were engraved with anti-ICE messages. The attack has drawn condemnation from officials, with the DHS Secretary blaming heated political rhetoric for the violence and calling for it to be toned down. This event is one of several recent security threats against ICE facilities in Texas, including a bomb threat at the same location a month prior.</p>

          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has unveiled the 12 brown bear contenders for its annual Fat Bear Week competition, where the public votes online for the bear that has most successfully bulked up for winter hibernation. The event, which began in 2014, highlights the importance of weight gain for the bears' survival, as they can add up to 700 pounds before entering their dens. Fans can observe the bears on livestreams as they feast on salmon along the Brooks River. The competition is a popular way for the public to engage with the park's wildlife and learn about the bears' life cycle.</p>

          <h2>Off-Label Cancer Drug Shows Promise in Improving Speech for Some Children with Autism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 19:50:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying leucovorin, a generic drug derived from folic acid and typically used to treat chemotherapy side effects, as a potential treatment for autism. The drug is believed to help bypass a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain in some children, which may contribute to neurological issues like speech delays. While several small, randomized trials have shown positive effects on speech, larger studies are needed for FDA approval, a process complicated by the drug's low cost, which offers little financial incentive for pharmaceutical investment.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has transferred eight former federal death row inmates to the high-security "supermax" prison in Florence, Colorado. These inmates were among 37 whose death sentences were commuted by the previous Biden administration, a move that drew criticism. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the transfers aim to ensure their conditions of confinement are consistent with the severity of their crimes, which include murder and gang-related killings. This action is part of a broader effort by the current administration to take a tougher stance on violent crime and penalize offenders whose sentences were previously reduced.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa has caused widespread destruction in Hong Kong and southern China with hurricane-force winds and a massive storm surge. Before reaching the mainland, the typhoon triggered a dam breach in Taiwan, resulting in the deaths of 14 people. Described as the "King of Storms," Ragasa brought record-breaking wind gusts of around 150 mph, leading to the evacuation of hundreds of thousands from low-lying coastal areas in China. The storm caused significant flooding in Hong Kong, trapping residents and turning streets into rivers, marking it as one of the most powerful storms globally this year.</p>

          <p>The family of a victim from the January midair collision over Washington, D.C., has filed the first wrongful death lawsuit against the FAA, the U.S. Army, and American Airlines. The lawsuit, initiated by the widow of Casey Crafton, accuses the entities of negligence, citing over 30 documented near-misses in the area prior to the crash that killed 67 people. Attorneys for the families argue the crash was preventable and that the airlines failed to adequately train pilots for the congested airspace. The NTSB's ongoing investigation has already highlighted multiple contributing factors, including faulty helicopter equipment and overworked air traffic controllers.</p>

Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a plan for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms.

In an interview, Burnham, who is not currently an MP, did not rule out a future leadership bid, stating that his previous runs for the position indicate his ambitions. His comments come at a time of pressure on Starmer's leadership and ahead of the party's autumn conference. Burnham also criticized the current leadership's approach as creating a "climate of fear" and called for wholesale change to counter the threat from the Reform party.</p>

The official emphasized the strength of the relationship, stating that India is the "indo" in the Indo-Pacific strategy. Plans are reportedly underway for a Quad leaders' summit in New Delhi, which could see a meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi either later this year or early next.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama has described Donald Trump's recent claims linking paracetamol (Tylenol) to autism as "violence against the truth" that could endanger public health. Speaking in London, Obama warned that such continuously disproved statements could cause harm if pregnant women become too fearful to take necessary pain relief. He argued that this is part of a broader struggle between a progressive, democratic vision and a populist desire to return to a more conservative, hierarchical society. Obama's intervention is one of several he has made recently amid an increasingly divided and volatile U.S. political landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump's continued attacks on ABC and Jimmy Kimmel have put him at odds with several prominent conservatives who are defending the comedian's free speech rights. Figures like Senator Ted Cruz and commentator Ben Shapiro have voiced concerns over government overreach after the FCC chair suggested regulatory action against stations airing Kimmel's show. While they disagree with Kimmel's politics, they argue that using federal power to silence dissent is a dangerous precedent that could be turned against conservative voices in the future. Kimmel, upon his return, thanked these unlikely allies for supporting his right to expression.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent address to the UN General Assembly showcased a foreign policy approach that oscillates between bombast and nihilism, according to an analysis in The Atlantic. In his speech, Trump described a world in chaos while portraying America as a "golden age," a narrative supporting his "America First" ideology. This worldview was highlighted by his unpredictable shifts on issues like the Ukraine war, where he veered from scolding President Zelensky to blaming Russia for the conflict. The article suggests this inconsistency reflects less a coherent strategy and more an abandonment of traditional diplomacy, where other nations must either follow his lead or fend for themselves.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, a key challenge will be addressing the country's persistent problem of weak domestic consumption. Many Chinese citizens are reducing their spending and increasing savings amid economic uncertainty, stagnant wage growth, and a downturn in the property market. This shift in consumer behavior, from luxury goods to frugal living, poses a significant hurdle to Beijing's goal of fostering a consumption-led economy. The new five-year plan will be closely watched to see what new policies and initiatives are introduced to stimulate spending and restore consumer confidence for the coming years.</p>

The first is the underrepresentation of the Global South, which needs a greater voice to correct historical injustices. Second is the erosion of authority, as unilateral actions and sanctions undermine international law and the UN Charter. Finally, there is a lack of effectiveness in tackling urgent issues like climate change and the digital divide, highlighting the need for reformed and more efficient global mechanisms.</p>

          <p>An experimental, one-time gene therapy treatment has shown promising preliminary results, reducing the progression of Huntington's disease by 75% over three years in a small trial. The therapy, called AMT-130, uses a harmless virus to deliver genetic instructions to the brain that turn off the toxic protein responsible for brain cell damage. While the findings are yet to be peer-reviewed, researchers are optimistic, noting that the treatment could be the first to slow the disease's course rather than just manage symptoms. The therapy is still years from potential FDA approval, with larger studies needed to confirm its safety and efficacy.</p>
