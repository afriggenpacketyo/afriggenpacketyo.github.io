          <p>A violent incident in Kentucky left three people dead, including the suspect, and several others wounded. The event began when a state trooper was shot during a traffic stop, after which the suspect carjacked a vehicle and fled to a Baptist church in Lexington. At the church, the gunman killed two individuals, identified as Beverly Gum, 72, and Christina Combs, 32, and wounded two others before being fatally shot by police. Authorities believe the shooter may have had a connection to the victims at the church.</p>

          <p>Emergency search operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th floods in Kerr County, Texas, have been suspended due to a new flood threat. Heavy rains over the weekend are causing the Guadalupe and San Saba rivers to rise again, prompting new evacuation orders and rescue operations in several counties. The original flooding event left at least 129 people dead statewide, with 166 still unaccounted for. Officials warned of a "dangerous and life-threatening situation" as the ground is already saturated, making flash floods highly probable.</p>

          <p>A volatile wildfire in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire has expanded to 5,000 acres, also damaging a water treatment facility and causing a dangerous chlorine gas leak that has hampered firefighting efforts. This event occurs as smoke from Canadian wildfires blankets the U.S. Upper Midwest, causing poor air quality in several states. The fires in Arizona, believed to be started by lightning, have prompted evacuations and closures in the national park.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the San Francisco Giants 5-2 in an 11-inning game, concluding the first half of the season with a significant series victory. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a standout performance, pitching seven scoreless innings and solidifying his All-Star status. However, the team's bullpen struggles continued as closer Tanner Scott gave up a two-run homer in the ninth, blowing the initial lead. The Dodgers' offense ultimately rallied in the 11th inning, securing the win and maintaining their lead in the National League West.</p>

This timing effectively prevents the possibility of Trump addressing Parliament, an honor given to past presidents like Obama and Macron but one that would have been controversial for Trump. The visit is seen as a political win for the White House but also a point of contention, with some MPs having formally opposed the idea of a parliamentary speech due to the president's past rhetoric.</p>

This defense came despite the fact that the U.S. currently holds a trade surplus, not a deficit, with Brazil. The administration is also applying this strategy to copper imports, citing the metal's importance for military hardware. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured the FIFA Club World Cup title with a decisive 3-0 victory over the formidable Paris Saint-Germain. Attacking midfielder Cole Palmer was the star of the match, scoring two nearly identical, clinical goals in the first half to stun the European champions. Palmer then provided a masterful assist for João Pedro to score the third goal just before halftime, effectively sealing the win. The victory was a tactical triumph for manager Enzo Maresca, whose team executed a perfect plan to counter PSG's strengths and exploit their weaknesses, capping a successful tournament for the London club.</p>

The allegations, first made public by a provincial police boss, include claims of interference in investigations into political killings and receiving financial support from a corrupt businessman.

          <p>In an address to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer advised investors to separate their political feelings about President Donald Trump from their financial decisions. He argued that despite personal objections one might have to the president, the stock market has shown remarkable resiliency, driven by individual investors. Cramer posits that a combination of a pro-capitalist agency environment, the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence, and pro-business policies are creating a positive environment for stocks. He suggests that even if one dislikes the president, the current conditions are creating a bull market that investors should not ignore. (not investment advice)</p>

His comments followed the release of his committee's final report, which detailed "inexcusable" security failures by the Secret Service.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. In a social media post, Trump urged critics to "let Pam Bondi do her job" after a recently released memo from the Justice Department failed to reveal a "client list" as many had hoped. The memo stated there was no such list, which frustrated commentators like Laura Loomer and media personality Megyn Kelly, who had pointed to Bondi's previous statements suggesting major revelations were forthcoming. The situation has highlighted a reported division between the Justice Department and the FBI.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," which serves as a raw, improvisatory return to his R&B roots. The 21-track project follows a tumultuous period for the artist, including a tour cancellation and the birth of his first child. The album's sound is described as murky and unpolished, featuring spacey grooves and even unfinished voice memos, reflecting a messy life with endearing frankness. Collaborating with producers like Mk.gee and Dijon, Bieber embraces an idiosyncratic, modern pop vibe that stands apart from the more polished work of his male pop star peers.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the recent Air India crash in Ahmedabad is examining the medical records of the pilot, Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, following claims he suffered from depression. An initial report suggested the crash was caused by the fuel flow to the engines being cut off, focusing on pilot actions rather than a technical fault. Aviation experts and colleagues noted that the 56-year-old pilot had taken time off and was considering retirement to care for his elderly father. While all pilots passed recent medical exams, the inquiry is exploring all factors, including the potential for human error linked to personal distress.</p>

While the hospital did not comment on the individual case, the death highlights a concerning rise in measles, which public health officials attribute to falling uptake of the MMR vaccine.
