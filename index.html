          <h2>Trump Affirms 'Obliteration' as Accurate Description of Damage to Iranian Nuclear Facilities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the term "obliteration" accurately describes the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear sites following recent U.S. strikes, despite ongoing assessments to determine the full extent of the damage. General Dan Caine, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed "severe damage and destruction" at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, while Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stated that precision munitions struck intended targets effectively. The UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi adopted a cautious stance, noting that a full damage assessment is still pending, and an Iranian source reported that highly enriched uranium at Fordo was moved prior to the strikes. The mission, Operation Midnight Hammer, involved B-2 stealth bombers and Tomahawk missiles targeting key nuclear facilities. Optimism for this type of news depends on whether you believe the author's tone to be a positive one, or one of lament. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a surge following the U.S.'s involvement in the conflict between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions and market volatility. Experts warn of possible triple-digit oil prices as investors closely monitor Iran's response to the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, with threats of blocking the Strait of Hormuz adding to market jitters. The Strait, a critical artery for global oil trade, sees about 20 million barrels of oil and oil products passing through it daily, constituting almost one-fifth of global oil shipments. Industry analysts suggest that a prolonged closure or disruption of key Gulf energy infrastructure could propel crude prices above $100 per barrel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, former President Donald Trump addressed the issue of regime change in Iran, questioning why there wouldn't be a regime change if the current Iranian regime is unable to "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." Trump deemed the bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites "a spectacular military success," claiming that Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been "completely and totally obliterated." The comments came after Trump decided to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday in an operation he deemed “a spectacular military success.”</p>
