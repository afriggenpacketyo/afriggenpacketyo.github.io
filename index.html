          <p>Japan's health ministry plans to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, to combat the country's declining birthrate, according to the article. The proposal involves fully covering normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes them as they are not considered medical conditions. While the government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen per birth, rising delivery costs often exceed this amount. The move aims to set a unified national price, though obstetricians worry about financial strain due to reduced revenue. </p>

          <p>Five months after its liberation, Syria faces internal strife and external pressures, as explained in the article. Sectarian clashes have escalated into street battles, and regional leaders denounce the new government. Despite President Trump lifting sanctions, President Ahmed al-Sharaa struggles to unify the country, dependent on undisciplined jihadist legions. Israel's incursions and Turkey's influence further destabilize the region, fueling perceptions of foreign interference and hardening attitudes among minorities like the Druze and Kurds, who seek greater autonomy. Sharaa's dependence on Sunni militias and a centralized government hinder progress, raising concerns about potential human rights abuses and strained relations with the U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <p>A new initiative called NeoTest is targeting neonatal sepsis, a common and preventable cause of infant death in developing countries, as the article explains. The project aims to develop a rapid and affordable diagnostic test to improve antibiotic targeting and reduce the high mortality rate associated with this condition. The team behind NeoTest, including global health experts and economists, plans to use an advance market commitment to incentivize manufacturers to produce a better sepsis test. The project is notable for seeking funding primarily from middle-income countries that would directly benefit from the test, highlighting the growing capacity of the Global South to address its own health challenges.</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock argues that Republican-proposed Medicaid work requirements would negatively impact hardworking Americans by kicking them off their healthcare coverage, as the article explains. Warnock cites reports from Arkansas and Georgia indicating that such requirements, framed as incentivizing work, create bureaucratic hurdles that prevent eligible individuals from accessing care. He contends that providing healthcare coverage actually encourages work and strengthens the economy, rather than hindering it. Warnock criticizes the Republican proposal, which could put millions at risk of losing Medicaid coverage, and contrasts it with the view that healthcare should be a foundation for enabling people to work.</p>

The case centered on text messages between Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, and Pfizer’s chief executive, Dr. Albert Bourla. The court said the commission did not provide enough explanation in refusing the request, raising questions about transparency and accountability. The ruling is a victory for transparency and accountability in the European Union, sending a message that ephemeral communications like text messages were not beyond the reach of public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>India has blocked X accounts belonging to state media from China and Turkey, citing concerns about disinformation, as reported in the article. The move comes amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, with both countries presenting conflicting narratives of recent military clashes. India claims that foreign media outlets are spreading misinformation about the situation, while China and Turkey are allies of Pakistan.

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia before heading to Qatar on Wednesday, the White House said, one day after Washington announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on the war-ravaged country, according to the article. Trump "encouraged President al-Sharaa to do a great job for the Syrian people," the readout said, and included a list of actions that the U.S. president urged al-Sharaa to take. These include signing onto the Abraham Accords with Israel, telling all foreign terrorists to leave Syria, deport Palestinian terrorists, helping the U.S. to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group and assuming responsibility for the latter's detention centers in northeast Syria.</p>

          <p>China's moderate relaxation of export controls on some rare earth minerals as part of a trade truce with the US reflects China's goodwill in striving to de-escalate tensions even as it remains firmly in control of those critical metals, according to analysts, as stated in the article. Beijing agreed to pause or remove all non-tariff countermeasures imposed since April 2 , alongside the lowering of most tariffs imposed by the two countries, for 90 days, from today. Following China’s curbs on April 4, prices of some “medium and heavy” rare earth elements surged by more than 200 per cent in the overseas market.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attacks on the courts follow a pattern seen in backsliding democracies around the world, according to this Atlantic article. Trump is following a playbook that authoritarians around the world have used to assert their power over the judiciary’s by adopting policies that are popular but very likely illegal. The pattern I have seen as I’ve studied democratic backsliding globally is what I call “court-baiting.” To undermine public support for the judiciary, political leaders adopt policies that are popular but very likely illegal. Many courts then rule against the executive, and the executive uses their unpopular decision to condemn the judiciary writ large.</p>

"Sound of Falling" is set on a farm in a small village in northeastern Germany and follows the lives of four generations of women living on the farm, interweaving their stories by jumping back and forth among the different timelines until the lines between them blur, and what starts as portraits of four generations becomes a sweeping depiction of a century. Schilinski says that the female gaze was very important to her and her co-writer, Louise Peter, because it's so rare in films.</p>
