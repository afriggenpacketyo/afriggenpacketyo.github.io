        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several UK councils are continuing their legal efforts to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, even after a Court of Appeal ruling overturned an injunction in Epping. The court found the initial injunction "seriously flawed," citing the risk of encouraging lawlessness through protests. Despite this, councils like West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne intend to press on with their cases, arguing the hotels are unsuitable and strain local services. The government maintains its commitment to phase out hotel use for asylum seekers by the end of the current Parliament.</p>

          <p>A massive overnight Russian assault on Ukraine involved over 500 drones and dozens of missiles, resulting in at least one death and 24 injuries in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted most projectiles, but strikes damaged homes and infrastructure across seven locations, leaving thousands without power. In response, President Zelenskyy called for tougher international sanctions against Moscow. Concurrently, Ukrainian forces reported successful strikes on two Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Samara.</p>

This case is part of a wider investigation into Upton's unregulated service, prompting calls for stricter government regulation of the funeral industry to protect grieving families from such distressing experiences.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's Senegalese forward, Nicolas Jackson, is set to move to Bayern Munich on an initial loan deal valued at £13 million. The agreement includes a £56.2 million option for the German champions to make the transfer permanent, and a sell-on clause has also been included. The 24-year-old striker's opportunities at Chelsea became limited following the arrival of new summer signings. Jackson has already agreed to a pre-contract with Bayern and has been permitted to travel to Germany to finalize the move.</p>

          <p>A Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has delivered a significant legal blow to President Donald Trump's trade policies, upholding a lower court's ruling that he cannot unilaterally alter the nation's tariff schedules. The decision challenges the president's authority to single-handedly reshape American trade law, a cornerstone of his economic agenda. This ruling sets the stage for a potential major confrontation over executive power and trade policy at the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A global regulatory push, including the UK's Online Safety Act, is spurring a wave of AI-driven technologies designed to protect children online. These laws compel tech companies to prevent exposure to harmful content, leading to the adoption of age-verification systems by platforms like Pornhub, Spotify, and X. Companies like Yoti are developing AI that estimates age from facial features, while phone makers are launching child-safe smartphones with built-in content filters, though these developments also raise privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>This article provides a tactical analysis of why Manchester United has struggled under manager Ruben Amorim, despite significant spending on new players. It details his rigid 5-2-3 positional system, which aims to create numerical overloads but is often nullified by opponents using man-to-man marking. The system relies on specific "up-back-through" passing patterns that lack individual creativity, making United's attacks predictable. Defensively, the team's two-man midfield is frequently outnumbered, contributing to disappointing results like the recent loss to Grimsby Town.</p>
