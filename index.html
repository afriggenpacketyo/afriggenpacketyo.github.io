          <h2>Gut Bacteria's Role in Rising Colon Cancer Rates Among Young Adults Examined</h2>

          <p>Researchers are investigating the potential role of gut bacteria, specifically colibactin produced by certain E. coli strains, in the increasing rates of colon cancer among young adults. A recent study linked this DNA-damaging toxin to colon cancer in younger patients, suggesting exposure may occur in childhood. While not the sole cause, colibactin is considered one factor among many contributing to the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer. Optimism score: 50</p>
