          <p>The immediate flood threat in Juneau, Alaska, has passed after newly installed barriers successfully held back record-breaking floodwaters from the Mendenhall River. An "outburst flood" from the glacier-dammed Suicide Basin caused the river to crest at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, prompting some evacuations. While some areas experienced minor flooding, officials reported that the temporary Hesco barriers prevented a potentially catastrophic event and widespread damage to homes, unlike in previous years. Crews are now assessing the limited damage as the city begins its recovery.</p>

While the community honored the victims with memorial services, only 50 of the more than 2,000 destroyed homes have been rebuilt. A recent state-funded study highlights a severe mental health crisis, with nearly half of Lahaina residents showing symptoms of depression. For many, the long road to rebuilding their homes and lives is fraught with ongoing trauma and grief.</p>

          <p>A Breeze Airways flight from Virginia to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Grand Junction, Colorado, due to a severely unruly passenger. The man reportedly yelled racist slurs and waved a skateboard, leading to a physical altercation that caused minor injuries to a flight attendant and another passenger. According to authorities, the passenger was placed in restraints twice but managed to break free both times. He was taken into custody by police upon landing at the direction of the FBI.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a plan to deploy National Guard troops along the National Mall in Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to address what the president has called "out of control" crime. The plan involves activating 800 Guard members, who will work in shifts to provide a visible presence and logistical support to law enforcement. This extraordinary deployment in a major tourist area is part of a broader federal intervention that includes temporary oversight of the city's police department, a move that has drawn concern from local officials.</p>

          <p>President Trump has revoked a 2021 executive order signed by President Biden that was designed to promote competition across the U.S. economy. The original order aimed to combat corporate concentration and anti-competitive practices in sectors like labor and healthcare. The Justice Department supported the reversal, stating it will now pursue an "America first antitrust" approach focused on free markets rather than what it termed the "burdensome" regulations of the previous administration. This move dismantles a key initiative that was intended to lower costs for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticized Vice President JD Vance for encouraging Republican-led states to engage in aggressive redistricting, with one calling it "congressional-level shoplifting." The comments came as Texas Democrats continued to protest a GOP-led effort to pass a new congressional map that would likely give Republicans five additional seats. The national conflict over gerrymandering has escalated, with AWOL Texas Democrats holding press conferences to decry the move as an unconstitutional power grab, while the GOP maintains it is rebalancing an unfair system.</p>

          <p>The landmark national security trial of Jimmy Lai, a prominent pro-democracy media tycoon and British citizen, is now in its final stage with closing arguments set to begin. Lai, 77, is accused of colluding with foreign forces under a controversial law imposed by Beijing and faces a potential life sentence if convicted. His case is widely seen by critics as a key indicator of the erosion of legal autonomy and freedom of speech in Hong Kong, turning its justice system into a tool for silencing political opposition. International leaders have called for his release.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times column posits that California Governor Gavin Newsom's political future could be a deciding factor in how UCLA responds to pressure from the Trump administration. With the president targeting the university by freezing federal grants and demanding a large payout, the column argues that Newsom, as a key figure on the UC Board of Regents, cannot afford the political fallout of capitulating. Unlike private universities such as Harvard, the public UC system's response is seen as a crucial test of resistance against what the author calls an attack on academic freedom and democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its decision to withhold billions of dollars in foreign aid that had been appropriated by Congress. The court's 2-1 decision was made on procedural grounds, stating that the humanitarian non-profits who brought the lawsuit were not eligible to challenge the administration's action. This ruling is a significant blow to global humanitarian efforts, as the withheld funds were designated for programs such as HIV/AIDS prevention and other critical global health initiatives.

          <p>According to a new report from its independent inspector general, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is facing "severe" staffing shortages at all of its hospitals, with the number of shortfalls increasing by 50% this fiscal year. The report found that 94% of VA facilities have a severe shortage of doctors, and psychology was the most frequently reported clinical shortage. This comes as the department is undergoing a reduction of 30,000 workers, a move that critics fear is exacerbating the crisis and decreasing veterans' access to care.</p>

          <p>A decade after being ranked last in the NFL in value, the Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, second only to the Dallas Cowboys, according to Sportico. This dramatic rise is attributed to the team's return to Los Angeles and owner Stan Kroenke's development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium and surrounding entertainment district. The valuation reflects the franchise's success in monetizing its new venue and building strong fan and corporate support, solidifying its position as a premier sports entity.

During the announcement, he also complained that he himself had never received the honor and joked about giving himself one next year, continuing his second term's trend of asserting control over national institutions.</p>

          <p>A wild, multi-hour police pursuit in Los Angeles ended with two suspects making a rare and successful escape. The chase, which began with a carjacking and shooting, involved the suspects stealing two additional vehicles, including a large semi-truck. They ultimately abandoned their final stolen vehicle, a pickup truck, under a freeway overpass in Boyle Heights, where they appear to have been picked up by accomplices. Despite a massive law enforcement response and live television coverage, the suspects remain at large, having used aggressive and reckless tactics to evade capture.</p>
