          <p>A Mexican Navy sailing ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in two crew member deaths and at least 22 injuries. The ship, carrying 277 people on a goodwill tour, reportedly lost power before drifting into the bridge's underside, causing significant damage to its masts and rigging. New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed the fatalities and indicated the ship had experienced mechanical issues. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct a full investigation into the incident, which occurred as the ship was departing from Pier 17 in Manhattan for Iceland. </p>

          <p>Israel has announced it will allow a "basic amount of food" into Gaza to prevent a famine crisis after blockading the territory for 10 weeks, following recommendations from the IDF. This decision coincides with the launch of Operation Gideon's Chariot, involving extensive ground operations and airstrikes, including near the Indonesian Hospital. Hamas has expressed willingness to release all Israeli hostages in exchange for a comprehensive ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the entry of humanitarian aid, but Israel has rejected these terms, seeking only a temporary truce. Aid agencies have warned about the risk of famine among Gaza's 2.1 million population. </p>

          <p>Exit polls indicate that Portugal's ruling Democratic Alliance (AD) is likely to secure the most votes in Sunday's election, although it is anticipated to fall short of achieving a full majority. The AD is projected to garner between 29% and 34% of the vote, necessitating negotiations with smaller parties to form a coalition government. This election, the third in as many years, was triggered by the collapse of the previous minority government after a failed confidence vote. Key issues dominating the campaign include housing and immigration, reflecting Portugal's ongoing political instability and economic challenges. </p>

          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, believing he died in the blast. Bartkus, who expressed opposition to bringing people into the world against their will, used a large vehicle-borne improvised explosive device. The FBI is working to confirm his death and stated that Bartkus was not on their radar. The attack, which injured four others, is being investigated as an act of terrorism. All embryos stored at the fertility clinic were saved. </p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Trump administration's policy of granting refugee status to white South Africans, stating that people should be "celebrating" the move. The administration claims white South Africans, particularly Afrikaners, face oppression, citing a law that allows the government to seize privately held land. Rubio stated there is evidence of murders and forced removals of properties based on race. He added that the people who have moved to the US have done so for a reason, and "there may be more coming soon". </p>

Republicans also joined in the criticism, with Senator Rand Paul noting the appearance of a conflict of interest, and former Vice President Mike Pence pointing out Qatar's history of supporting terrorism. Trump defended the gift as being for the U.S. and not for him personally, but critics argue it is a personal benefit that could compromise national security. </p>

          <p>Israel has retrieved thousands of items belonging to its most famous spy, Eli Cohen, after a covert operation in Syria, marking 60 years since his execution. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared some of the 2,500 items with Cohenâ€™s widow, including documents, recordings, and photos collected by Syrian intelligence after his capture. Cohen, who infiltrated the Syrian political echelon in the early 1960s, provided top-secret intelligence that significantly aided Israel's victory in the 1967 Middle East War. Netanyahu stated that Israel continues to work on locating Cohenâ€™s body. </p>
