          <h2>Poll Reveals Voters' Concerns Over Trump's Use of Power</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 13:52:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent New York Times/Siena College poll indicates that voters are increasingly concerned about President Trump's aggressive expansion of executive power and express doubts regarding his agenda. Many voters perceive the early months of Trump's administration as "chaotic" and "scary," questioning his understanding of their daily struggles. While his approval rating stands at 42%, this is historically low for a president at this stage, reflecting a decline in confidence regarding his handling of key issues like the economy and immigration. This shift in public sentiment poses challenges for Trump as he approaches his 100th day in office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Craig Moffett, a top-ranked analyst, casts doubt on Apple's plans to move iPhone assembly to India, citing concerns about cost reduction and supply chain challenges. While the move might alleviate some tariff-related issues, Moffett argues that the reliance on Chinese-made components and potential resistance in India would hinder its effectiveness. He also notes that carriers are unwilling to absorb tariff costs, potentially leading to decreased consumer demand and slower upgrade rates. Moffett also suggests that backlash against Apple in China over U.S. tariffs could negatively impact iPhone sales. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit claims that ICE agents refused to provide the father with information about his family's location and limited his contact with them. The Department of Homeland Security defended its decision, stating that the parents chose to take the child with them, though the father ostensibly remains in the United States.</p>

          <p>Just Stop Oil's "last day of action" in London sparked anger and frustration among drivers and the public. Protesters blocked roads, leading to confrontations and arrests. The group claims success in influencing government policy and halting fossil fuel projects. However, their tactics have drawn criticism, including from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who has called for protesters to face the full force of the law. The Metropolitan Police have been approached for comment on the incidents.</p>
