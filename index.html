          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions. The Jacksonville Jaguars then traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, planning to utilize him as a two-way player. Unlike the 2024 draft, this year's class was considered less talent-laden, with more emphasis on offensive and defensive lines, as only one quarterback was selected in the first 12 picks. The draft was held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, marking the first time the event has been hosted there.</p>

Crimo did not attend the sentencing hearing, failing to confront his actions, according to the State's Attorney.

          <p>Supported housing, which aids vulnerable and disabled individuals in living independently, is facing a crisis due to funding cuts and rising costs. An open letter signed by over 170 organizations claims that one in three providers in England had to shut down services last year, leading to a shortfall of approximately 325,000 places. The organizations are calling for increased funding to prevent further closures and to support the vital role supported housing plays in reducing pressure on public services. The government maintains its commitment to building more homes.</p>

During his first term, Trump had expressed interest in "taking a look" at the matter, despite the Obama administration's rejection of Russia's annexation. This potential shift marks a significant departure from the Crimea Declaration issued by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2018, which pledged nonrecognition until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored.</p>
