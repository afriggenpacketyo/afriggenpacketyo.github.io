        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has filed RICO racketeering charges against 27 members and associates of the Tren de Aragua migrant group in New York, accusing them of human smuggling, sex trafficking, and murder as part of "Operation Take Back America." The charges involve members of Tren de Aragua and a splinter gang known as "Anti-Tren." Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the organization has destroyed American families with brutal violence, engaged in human trafficking, and spread deadly drugs through communities, while NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch noted the gang has shown zero regard for the safety of New Yorkers. The case received significant support from Joint Task Force Vulcan, initially created to eradicate MS-13.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court appears inclined to require a Maryland school board to allow parents to opt their children out of instruction featuring storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. The case centers on whether schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom. The conservative justices expressed concern that the school board's policy infringes on parents' rights to direct the religious upbringing of their children, questioning why opt-outs are not feasible given that they are permitted for other sensitive topics. The outcome could set a precedent for parental rights in education regarding LGBTQ+ issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla reported disappointing first-quarter earnings, with automotive revenue dropping 20% and net income plummeting 71%. The company cited production line updates and lower average selling prices as reasons for the decline. CEO Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's White House, overseeing federal government downsizing, has raised concerns about the impact of tariffs on electric vehicle production costs. Tesla refrained from promising growth this year and said it will revisit its 2025 guidance in the Q2 update. The stock initially saw a boost after President Trump said he has no plans to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists are investigating a 6th or 7th-century medieval cemetery near Cardiff Airport, where nearly all the skeletons found are women, buried in unusual positions with artifacts. The bones show signs of heavy manual labor, yet also luxury items like imported glass shards from the Levant, suggesting wealth. One woman was found tossed in a ditch, contrasting with the careful burials of others, and analysis suggests the individuals came from various parts of Wales and possibly southwest England. The team is also analyzing the teeth to understand their diet, which seemed to consist of lots of carbs, but not a lot of meat, and no fish.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering two of her children, has been found guilty of conspiring with her brother to kill her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in Arizona. Prosecutors argued that Daybell sought to eliminate her estranged husband for his $1 million life insurance policy and to be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. The prosecution presented evidence of text messages indicating Daybell's "twisted" religious beliefs as justification for the murder. Daybell is currently serving life in prison without parole for the murders of her two children and faces another trial in Maricopa County for allegedly conspiring to kill her niece's ex-husband.</p>

The lawmakers criticized the White House's crackdown on alleged antisemitism and accused the Trump administration of sending the students to a Republican-led state to limit their constitutional rights. They raised concerns about the students' medical care and the government's justification for their detention, citing a 1952 law related to adverse foreign policy consequences.

          <p>President Trump clarified that he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing Powell's monetary policy and calling him a "major loser."

Powell has warned that Trump's tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, creating a "challenging scenario" for the central bank.</p>
