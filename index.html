          <p>A 22-year-old suspect has been arrested in connection with the murders of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple, both 70, were found shot to death in their fortified Encino home during a welfare check. Authorities believe the suspect was burglarizing the residence when the victims returned home, leading to a fatal struggle. The incident is being treated as a random act of violence rather than a targeted attack, and the suspect is not believed to be involved in other burglaries in the area.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Prosecutor-General has formally requested the Supreme Federal Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting to orchestrate a coup following his 2022 election loss. The 517-page filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to violently overthrow the democratic order. This follows the January 8, 2023, storming of government buildings by his supporters, which occurred after Bolsonaro spread unfounded voter fraud claims. If convicted, the former president could face up to 40 years in prison for the charges.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:44:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has revealed a secret £400 million scheme that relocated 4,500 Afghans to the UK after a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked the personal data of nearly 19,000 applicants. The breach, which occurred in 2022, exposed individuals to potential harm from the Taliban, but its existence and the subsequent relocation efforts were concealed by a super-injunction. A High Court judge lifted the gagging order, bringing the "serious departmental error" to light. The Defence Secretary has issued a sincere apology to those affected by the leak.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the "Genius Act," bipartisan legislation that aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents argue that regulation would provide consumer protection and enable stablecoins to be used for faster, lower-cost payments, essentially creating "digital dollars." The bill is part of a broader Republican-led effort to support the cryptocurrency industry. If passed, it would allow banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins under clear legal guidelines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, halving the military force deployed there last month. The troops were federalized by President Trump to counter protests against large-scale immigration sweeps, a move made against the wishes of California's governor and LA's mayor. The deployment sparked a national debate over the use of military forces on U.S. soil and was described by local officials as a "campaign of domestic terror." Approximately 2,000 Guard members and 700 Marines will remain in the city.</p>

His original conviction was based on shaky witness testimony, and investigators ignored his alibi and evidence that would have made the crime unlikely.

          <p>In a notable split from President Trump, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has called for the Justice Department to release all of its files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Johnson stated, "We should put everything out there and let the people decide," advocating for full transparency. His stance contrasts with that of President Trump, who recently urged his supporters to move on from the issue. The call from the Speaker adds pressure on Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has been criticized for the administration's decision not to release more information.</p>

          <p>President Trump's stance on the war in Ukraine appears to be evolving, as he has reportedly given Russia a 50-day ultimatum to agree to a peace deal or face severe tariffs. This tougher approach follows reports that he asked Ukrainian President Zelenskyy if Kyiv's forces could strike Moscow, though he later told journalists that Ukraine "shouldn't" do so. The White House has pushed back on the reporting, claiming the question was taken out of context. Meanwhile, the EU has so far failed to agree on an 18th round of sanctions against Russia, with Slovakia holding up the package.</p>

          <p>The official X account for the "Sesame Street" character Elmo was compromised by a hacker who posted "disgusting" antisemitic and racist content. A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind the show, condemned the abhorrent messages and confirmed the account has since been secured. The posts, which included slurs and references to President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, were quickly removed. The incident adds to growing concerns about the proliferation of hate speech on the social media platform X since its acquisition by Elon Musk.</p>

Authorities also revealed details from a letter Boelter wrote, in which he made bizarre claims about being a military operative and being asked by the governor to kill other senators.

          <p>A package of three cryptocurrency regulation bills, supported by President Trump, failed to pass a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives, stalling their progress. The vote was a surprising setback for the crypto industry, with thirteen Republicans joining Democrats to block the legislation from moving forward. Among the stalled bills was the GENIUS Act, which aimed to regulate stablecoins and had previously passed the Senate with bipartisan support. The failure occurred during what House Republicans had promoted as "Crypto Week," highlighting a rare instance of GOP lawmakers defying Trump's direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has struck down a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have prevented medical debt from appearing on Americans' credit reports. The policy, introduced by the Biden administration, was intended to prevent healthcare expenses from negatively impacting consumers' ability to secure loans or housing. The judge ruled that the CFPB had exceeded its authority. Consumer advocates criticized the decision as a setback for millions of Americans burdened by medical debt, while a credit industry association praised it for protecting the integrity of the financial system.</p>

Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the company estimates the project will generate $75 billion in economic value nationwide.

          <p>This article from The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is dismantling the federal government's ability to respond to natural disasters, with FEMA's recent struggles in Texas serving as a key example. It points to leadership issues, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem previously calling for FEMA's elimination, and a pattern of delayed or denied aid to states with Democratic leaders. The analysis contends that a functional disaster response requires investment in climate research, infrastructure, and forecasting, all areas the administration is reportedly cutting. The piece concludes that these political decisions are creating more vulnerable communities.</p>
