          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced a third round of negotiations in Oman concerning Tehran's nuclear activities, aiming to establish a new agreement that could prevent potential conflicts in the Middle East. President Trump, who previously abandoned a nuclear deal with Iran, expressed optimism about reaching a new accord. The talks seek to reshape regional and global security by mitigating the risk of a U.S.-backed Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, potentially easing American sanctions and attracting foreign investors to Iran.</p>

          <p>Despite the worsening effects of climate change, several positive trends indicate progress in slowing it down. The worst-case warming scenarios are becoming less likely as global CO2 emissions growth slows, and clean energy sources like wind and solar are surpassing coal in electricity production. Battery storage is expanding rapidly, enhancing grid resilience, and the clean-energy economy is decoupling emissions from economic growth. Climate innovation is accelerating, exemplified by the XPrize for Carbon Removal, demonstrating that climate change is a solvable challenge.</p>

Pro-Israel groups are accused of supporting these measures, which critics argue undermine free speech and academic freedom.

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, known for her accusations against Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew, has died at the age of 41, and is remembered by her family as a "fierce warrior in the fight against sexual assault and sex trafficking". Giuffre alleged she was sexually abused by Epstein and his associates, including Prince Andrew, claims the Prince denies. Her allegations brought significant attention to the issue of sexual abuse and her pursuit of justice led to an out-of-court settlement with Prince Andrew in 2022. Her family confirmed her death by suicide.</p>
