          <p>President Trump responded to Maryland Governor Wes Moore's invitation to visit Baltimore by demanding the city address its crime issues first, labeling it a "crime disaster." Trump also suggested he might reconsider federal funding for the Francis Scott Key Bridge replacement. Governor Moore dismissed Trump's rhetoric as "performative," highlighting a 20% decrease in homicides statewide since his inauguration and emphasizing that the city needs federal law enforcement resources, not National Guard troops. This article highlights the ongoing political dispute over federal intervention in local crime matters.</p>

          <p>A military official confirmed that some National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. would begin carrying service weapons, escalating President Trump's law enforcement crackdown. This directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth marks a change from previous guidance where troops were unarmed. While the National Guard's role has primarily been to protect landmarks and assist with crowd control, the arming of personnel underscores the administration's intensified approach to perceived crime issues in the capital. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, maintain that the initiative is unnecessary, citing declining violent crime rates in the city.</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency due to the state's infant mortality rate rising to its highest in over a decade, with 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, nearly double the national average. Leading causes include congenital malformations, premature birth, and SIDS, with Black infants disproportionately affected. The declaration aims to accelerate efforts like expanding prenatal services and strengthening community health programs, but experts stress that systemic issues like poverty and healthcare access must also be addressed. This article underscores the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to improve maternal and infant health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of defense company Anduril, argues that AI-powered autonomous weapons represent the future of warfare, asserting that the U.S. military relies on outdated technology.

He contends that "smart weapons" are morally superior to "dumb weapons" that cannot distinguish targets, despite international concerns about "killer robots."
