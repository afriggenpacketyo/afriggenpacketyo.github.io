          <h2>Scientific Study Confirms 'Selective Hearing' as a Genuine Neurological Function</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 11:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists and audiologists have affirmed that "selective hearing" is a real neurological process, not a conscious choice to ignore someone. Known as auditory selective attention, it is the brain's innate ability to filter and prioritize specific sounds, like a single voice in a crowded room, while tuning out background noise. This cognitive function involves the auditory and prefrontal cortices working together to manage focus. While generally normal, a noticeable decline in this ability could indicate underlying hearing loss, as the brain works harder to process sounds, leading to listening fatigue and potential cognitive strain over time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Conservative party has announced a plan to remove all net-zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea, aiming to maximize fossil fuel extraction. This policy marks a significant shift from the UK's legally binding 2050 net-zero target and contrasts with the Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses. Proponents argue it is necessary for economic reasons, while opponents and environmental groups criticize the move as reckless, warning it will accelerate climate change without lowering consumer energy bills. The decision reflects a broader debate on balancing economic interests with environmental responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Numerous beaches across the United States have issued swimming advisories for Labor Day weekend due to high levels of fecal bacteria in the water. Destinations from Florida to Maine are affected, with health officials warning that the contamination can cause illnesses like rashes and nausea. A recent report from Environment America found that over 60% of tested US beaches had at least one day of potentially unsafe fecal contamination levels last year. The primary sources of this pollution are identified as polluted runoff, failing sewer systems, and industrial livestock operations, raising public health and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the former immunizations chief at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has resigned in protest of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services. Daskalakis expressed grave concerns that the firewall between science and political ideology has collapsed, citing changes to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations as evidence of a shift that prioritizes ideology over public health. He and other former officials fear this new direction will undermine the CDC's effectiveness and jeopardize the nation's ability to respond to future public health emergencies, potentially leading to a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore stated he is focused on improving his communities rather than engaging in a political fight with President Donald Trump, who has been critical of Baltimore's crime rates. Moore defended his state's progress in reducing violence while acknowledging more work is needed, criticizing the president's rhetoric as arrogant and unhelpful. He described Trump's threat to send the National Guard as "performative," arguing that federal support should instead come through increased funding for local law enforcement, not military intervention.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned reports of the Trump administration's plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential deployment an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his administration has received no official communication about the plan and argued that such a move would be an unconstitutional use of military power for domestic law enforcement. He suggested President Trump's motives are political rather than a genuine effort to combat crime, potentially aimed at disrupting future elections. The governor asserted that while he would welcome more federal law enforcement agents like the FBI or ATF, deploying troops would be an attack on American citizens.</p>

          <p>At 80 years old, John Fogerty is re-recording his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a new album, "Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)."

Encouraged by his wife Julie, he recently regained the rights to his catalog and has recorded the new album with his sons, who are part of his touring band.

This partnership is seen as a significant strategic move to strengthen NATO's northern flank, creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates.

          <p>In a humorous commentary, comedian Jim Gaffigan reflects on the perils of amateur gardening, specifically his struggle with an overabundant cucumber harvest. He recounts his annual cycle of springtime optimism, which leads him to employ techniques like "succession planting" to ensure a steady supply. However, this strategy inevitably results in a deluge of cucumbers that overwhelms his family's capacity to eat them fresh, in salads, or even as pickles. Gaffigan humorously concludes that his gardening enthusiasm consistently outpaces his planning, leaving him with a comical and relatable problem of having far too much of a good thing.</p>

          <p>In his new book, Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the complex nature of chronic pain, arguing that its source often lies within the brain rather than just the site of an injury. The article highlights the case of a musician with a rare condition causing debilitating, full-body pain, which was successfully treated through an experimental deep brain stimulation procedure. This innovative treatment mapped the unique neural signature of his pain, allowing a device to predict and interrupt the pain signals before they were consciously felt. This research suggests that pain is a malleable brain process that can be targeted and treated directly.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White is taking on the role of Bruce Springsteen in the upcoming film "Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of Springsteen's iconic 1982 album, "Nebraska." In an interview, White shared his initial apprehension about playing the beloved musician, citing the intimate connection fans have with Springsteen's work. He found a point of connection with the artist's feelings of fraudulence and isolation during that period, drawing parallels to his character in "The Bear." With Springsteen's direct involvement and approval, White felt empowered to bring his own interpretation to the role while honoring the musician's story.</p>

          <p>The US Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion, the fifth-largest prize in the game's history, after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing. The last time the jackpot was won was on May 31, allowing the prize to grow over successive drawings. The next chance to win will be on Monday, with the winner facing a choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. Despite the staggering odds of 1 in 292.2 million, the massive prize continues to attract widespread participation across the country.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is entering a new, more dangerous era of strategic instability due to the proliferation and advancement of ballistic missile technology. The author contends that, much like during the Cold War, a multipolar arms race is creating a scenario where adversaries can hold entire populations hostage under the threat of nuclear annihilation. The piece suggests that while the fundamental logic of war remains, its nature has been radically altered, making the possibility of a global conflict, whether intentional or accidental, increasingly plausible. It calls for a reversal of this trajectory to avoid a return to perpetual conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent moves to influence the Federal Reserve, including an attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the central bank's long-standing political independence. Experts warn that politicizing the Fed could undermine the stability of the American financial system, which relies on the institution's credibility to make unpopular but necessary monetary policy decisions. If Trump succeeds in placing a majority of loyalists on the Board of Governors, it could give him control over interest rates, bank regulation, and the integrity of the U.S. dollar, potentially leading to economic instability.

During the interview, Maxwell hinted at Jeffrey Epstein's associates being in Donald Trump's cabinet, but Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche did not press her for names. Critics and former prosecutors suggest that many questions were surface-level and failed to challenge Maxwell's frequent claims of a poor memory. Furthermore, attorneys for Epstein's survivors report that they have not been contacted by the DOJ, fueling concerns that the push for transparency is more performative than substantive.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibit in Santa Cruz, California, is shedding light on the origins of surfing in the mainland United States, tracing it back to three teenage Hawaiian princes in 1885. Princes David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui were studying at a nearby military school when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the royal sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their exhibition of "surfboard swimming" was documented in a local newspaper and inspired locals to take up the practice. This historical event predates the more widely known popularization of surfing by Duke Kahanamoku in the 20th century.</p>

          <p>Analysts in mainland China are expressing concern over the prospect of joint weapons production between the United States and Taiwan, warning it could destabilize the region. The discussion was amplified after US Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated he expects such cooperation to move forward following a visit to Taipei. For decades, the US has supplied Taiwan with arms through sales, but a shift to co-production on the island would represent a significant deepening of military ties. This move is seen by both the US and Taiwan as having strategic advantages, but it is likely to be viewed by Beijing as a major provocation.</p>

Environment Minister Susan Close noted that the containers are used for mere seconds but can persist for centuries.
