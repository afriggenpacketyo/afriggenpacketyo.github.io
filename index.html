          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings experienced a nearly 19% surge in its Hong Kong-listed shares following better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results. The company's cloud-computing unit was a significant driver, showing accelerated sales fueled by robust artificial intelligence demand, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit year-over-year growth. While Alibaba increased investments in China's highly competitive instant commerce space, impacting core e-commerce adjusted earnings, overall revenue still rose 2% and net income saw a substantial 78% increase, boosted by equity investment gains and the disposal of a Turkish e-commerce firm. This strategic balancing act between AI innovation and market growth has been well-received by investors, leading to a notable rally in the company's stock this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Preliminary Census Bureau data, analyzed by the Pew Research Center, indicates that over 1.2 million immigrants, including both undocumented and legal residents, have exited the U.S. labor force from January through July. This decline coincides with the first overall decrease in the immigrant population after reaching a record high in 2023, and follows President Trump's intensified immigration enforcement policies. Experts highlight immigrants' crucial role, comprising nearly 20% of the U.S. workforce and higher percentages in sectors like farming and construction, raising concerns about job growth and potential impacts on industries like healthcare. The exact reasons for the departures, whether voluntary or due to fear of deportation, remain unclear, but the trend is seen as a significant economic shift.</p>

The gathering, attended by over 20 foreign leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saw China position itself as a global peacemaker amidst ongoing international tensions. Xi highlighted China's $84 billion investment in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education, aiming to foster high-quality development and cooperation. The summit's discussions, including a meeting between Xi and Modi, focused on improving regional stability and economic ties, with analysts suggesting improved India-China relations could bolster Beijing's influence.</p>

          <p>China is expected to showcase a wide array of advanced drone systems and autonomous technologies at its upcoming military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of victory in World War II. Analysts suggest the display will underscore the People's Liberation Army's rapid advancements in integrating AI-enabled, multi-domain operations across air, land, and sea. While new models are anticipated, experts believe these systems will likely be presented in static displays for security reasons rather than in motion. Officials have pledged to unveil 'new-domain forces and new-quality combat capabilities,' emphasizing the PLA's growing strength in safeguarding national interests and contributing to global peace.</p>

          <p>Young people in Wales, aged 16-21, will soon benefit from a new pilot scheme offering £1 single bus tickets and £3 day passes across the country, with the initiative extending to 5-15 year-olds in November. This program, supported by £15 million from the Welsh government, aims to make public transport more accessible and affordable, encouraging young individuals to use buses for education, employment, and leisure. Transport Minister Ken Skates expressed hopes that the scheme would help set positive public transport behaviors for the future. While similar initiatives exist in Scotland, a recent survey indicated lower satisfaction with value for money for young people's transport in Wales compared to other UK nations, making this scheme a crucial step.</p>

          <p>The ongoing immigration debate in the UK and US demonstrates a pattern of continuously shifting goalposts, where no policy or reduction in numbers ever seems sufficient to appease opponents. This article argues that political rhetoric, particularly from right-wing figures like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump, perpetuates a sense of crisis, leading to escalating crackdowns that impact both documented and undocumented immigrants. Examples include militarized borders and expanded enforcement powers, creating a climate of fear and uncertainty. The piece suggests that the core question is not 'how many is too many,' but 'how few is few enough,' a scenario that is impossible to achieve, ensuring the issue remains politically exploitable.</p>

          <p>Vashi Dominguez, a luxury jewellery retailer, is implicated in the UK's largest diamond scam, with his business collapsing in 2023 and leaving investors owed £170 million. BBC Panorama investigations reveal that staff were directed to pose as customers to create a false impression of high activity for investors, and official accounts drastically misrepresented sales figures, claiming over £100 million in 2021 when internal documents showed only £5 million. The company's promised £157 million diamond stock was later valued at a mere £100,000, leaving investors, including prominent figures, with significant losses. Despite the scale of the fraud, both the Metropolitan Police and Serious Fraud Office have decided not to investigate, while Dominguez has reportedly fled to Dubai.</p>

          <p>BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares dropped nearly 8% after the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer reported a significant 30% slump in its second-quarter net profit compared to the previous year. This sharp decline occurred amidst an aggressive price war within China's domestic EV industry, which BYD cited as having an 'adverse periodic impact' on the sector's development. Despite an expansion in overseas sales contributing to a 14% year-over-year revenue growth, the intense competition has severely eroded profitability. Chinese authorities have expressed concern over the discount wars, warning carmakers against fueling further price cuts, as BYD and other domestic brands continue to expand globally to offset domestic pressures.

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to 50.5, surpassing economist estimates and indicating the fastest expansion since March. This improvement was partly driven by a recovery in new export orders, suggesting resilience in external demand despite tariffs. However, the gains in overall output and new orders were more muted for domestic demand, and employment in the manufacturing sector remained bleak for a fifth consecutive month. While overall business confidence improved, experts caution that the durability of this upturn depends on sustained export stability and a pickup in domestic demand, amidst ongoing price wars and efforts to curb excess capacity.

MLS has a precedent of issuing multi-game suspensions for spitting on opponents or officials, suggesting potential disciplinary action for Suárez. Despite Miami's loss and Suárez's frustration, Seattle secured its ninth major honor since joining MLS in 2009, with defensive midfielder Obed Vargas playing a key role in shutting down Miami's star-studded attack.

In contrast, China's RatingDog manufacturing PMI surprisingly rose to 50.5, indicating growth, though this contradicted an official survey showing contraction.

While the Justice Department claimed the flights were for family reunifications requested by Guatemala, advocates disputed this, arguing the children could face abuse or persecution. The order, lasting 14 days, mandates the children's return to Health and Human Services custody, halting an 'extraordinary' government action.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to announce tighter rules for migrants granted asylum in the UK who wish to bring their families, citing a need to align with European policies. The new criteria will include stricter English language standards and requirements for sufficient funds. Additionally, Cooper plans to introduce new legislation to reform the asylum appeals system. These measures are part of a government overhaul aimed at ending the use of hotels for migrants and tackling people smugglers, despite opposition parties criticizing the government's handling of border control. The first deportations to France under a new returns deal are expected in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>The Guatemalan government claims it proposed the return of unaccompanied migrant children from the U.S. to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in July, aiming to reunify them with families and integrate them into social programs. This statement followed a federal judge's decision to temporarily halt the children's removal from the U.S. The government asserted that all actions prioritize human rights and due process, though attorneys representing the children dispute this, alleging the U.S. administration attempted to deport minors without allowing them to pursue asylum claims, violating federal laws. This discrepancy highlights ongoing tensions and differing narratives surrounding the handling of vulnerable migrant children.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is significantly expanding its military footprint in the disputed Spratly Islands, with satellite images showing artificial land expansion on all 21 Vietnamese-occupied features, potentially surpassing China's reclamation efforts. This move signals Vietnam's resolve to solidify its claims in the contested archipelago, which is also claimed by China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei. Infrastructure like munitions storage is developing on these newly dredged reefs. While analysts believe Vietnam's actions may not drastically alter the strategic equation, they could prompt Beijing to enhance its own defense posture in the South China Sea, intensifying regional tensions and military competition over the vital waterways.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extensively re-decorated the Oval Office, applying what he calls 'Trump touches' that have led to an 'extreme goldening' of the room's decor. Over seven months, gold trimming has been added across the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, including painted cherubim and an increase in gold trophies and vases. A White House spokesperson stated the gold was personally paid for by Trump. This aesthetic shift, reportedly inspired by Versailles and executed with the help of his personal 'gold guy,' has drawn mixed reactions, with some calling it a symbol of a 'golden age' and others criticizing it as 'vulgar' or 'gaudy.' The changes reflect a long tradition of presidents personalizing the office, but Trump's approach is seen as particularly distinctive.</p>

This journey marks Thunberg's second attempt to reach Gaza after a previous incident in June where her ship was stopped and she was deported by Israeli forces.

This strategy combines America's technological lead with its position as the world's largest consumer market, transforming financial power into a tool for economic warfare.
