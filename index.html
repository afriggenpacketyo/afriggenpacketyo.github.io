          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers lost Game 3 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, 116-104, despite a historic 38-point performance from LeBron James, who became the oldest player to score that many points in a playoff game. Luka Doncic struggled with an illness, impacting the Lakers' performance and leading to turnovers that cost them the game. Coach JJ Redick emphasized the team's lack of margin for error, and turnovers and poor rim protection were significant factors in the loss. The Lakers now face a crucial Game 4 to avoid falling further behind in the series. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, national unity is being questioned as some residents express a desire for separation, driven by frustration with Liberal rule and comparisons to the United States. While an independence referendum remains unlikely, the sentiment highlights a growing sense of 'western alienation,' with concerns about environmental policies impacting the oil and gas industry. Premier Danielle Smith has pursued independent trade talks with the US, and analysts suggest the regional divide will pose a challenge to the next prime minister. The election could determine the future of Canada's unity.</p>

          <p>An FBI agents arrested a Milwaukee judge on Friday on charges of obstructing immigration agents, saying she steered an undocumented immigrant through a side door in her courtroom while the agents waited to arrest him in a public hallway. The decision to charge a sitting state court judge is a major escalation in the Trump administration’s battle with local authorities over deportations. The administration has demanded, under threat of investigation or prosecution, that local officials not impede federal efforts to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and the arrest sent a message that the administration intends to take a harder line with those that do.</p>
