          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a misconduct complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, accusing him of making improper comments about President Donald Trump. The complaint alleges that Boasberg questioned whether the Trump administration would obey court rulings, potentially triggering a "constitutional crisis." This action escalates a conflict related to the administration's deportation of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador, a policy Boasberg had previously tried to halt. The DOJ is seeking an investigation and possible disciplinary action against the judge.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building has left four people, including an NYPD officer, dead before the gunman took his own life. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a history of mental health issues, used a high-powered rifle in the attack. The slain officer, Didarul Islam, was a four-year veteran of the force and father of two with a pregnant wife. The motive for the attack remains under investigation, but authorities believe the shooter acted alone and there is no further threat to the public.</p>

          <p>India has become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., overtaking China for the first time, according to research from Canalys. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year. This shift is largely attributed to major manufacturers like Apple diversifying their supply chains away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. The move reflects a broader trend of global companies increasing their manufacturing capacity in India to serve the American market.</p>

          <p>Singapore Airlines experienced a more than 8% drop in its share price after announcing a 59% decline in net profit for the first quarter. The company attributed the significant fall in earnings to lower interest income and, notably, losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India. The Vistara-Air India merger has made Air India's financial performance a drag on SIA's bottom line, a situation analysts believe may persist.

Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010, is a deeply polarizing figure credited by some for stabilizing the country but accused by others of human rights abuses.

          <p>Following intense international pressure, Israel has begun allowing more humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza to address a deepening hunger crisis. However, the United Nations and other aid agencies warn that the current volume is only a fraction of what is needed to prevent mass starvation among the territory's two million displaced people. The UN's agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, reports that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished. Desperation is so high that residents are swarming aid convoys in what charities term "self-distribution," highlighting the severity of the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <h2>New Guidance Allows Federal Employees to Discuss and Promote Religious Beliefs at Work</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued guidance affirming that federal employees have the right to religious expression in the workplace, including discussing their faith and attempting to persuade colleagues of their views. The memo from the Office of Personnel Management states that employees can engage in such conversations, display religious items, and invite coworkers to services, provided the expression is not harassing. While the policy states employees should stop if asked, critics like the Freedom From Religion Foundation have called it unconstitutional, arguing it encourages proselytizing and could lead to coercion.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a peace plan and humanitarian aid for Gaza. The meeting follows discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders from France and Germany, indicating a coordinated European effort to address the crisis. This diplomatic push comes amid growing domestic pressure on the UK government to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, with over half of Labour's backbench MPs signing a letter in support. Downing Street has stated that recognition is a matter of "when, not if."</p>

          <p>School districts across the U.S. are expressing concern over the future of student mental health services due to the abrupt discontinuation of federal grants by the Trump administration. The Department of Education suspended millions in funding, citing issues with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives by grant recipients. This has left many districts, particularly in rural areas, at risk of losing counselors and social workers hired with the grants. Sixteen states are suing the administration over the cuts, arguing they will harm students who rely on these in-school services.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen has spoken out after a video of his violent arrest by Border Patrol and Florida Highway Patrol drew widespread criticism.

The incident occurred during a traffic stop where two of his coworkers were undocumented. The video also captured an officer suggesting "we're gonna end up shooting some of them," highlighting concerns from advocates about the expansion of state law enforcement's role in immigration crackdowns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement between the United States and the European Union has sparked debate over which party benefits more, with some economists describing the deal as "asymmetric and unbalanced." Under the pact, the U.S. will impose a 15% tariff on most EU imports, while American goods will face no tariffs in the EU, a reversal of previous rates. The EU also pledged to significantly increase purchases of U.S. energy and make substantial investments. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American industry, some analysts predict it will negatively impact the EU's GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with President Donald Trump in Scotland, though unconventional, has provided the British government with invaluable direct access to the U.S. leader. The trip, which included a helicopter tour of Trump's golf course, allowed for extended one-on-one conversations on critical topics like the war in Gaza. While navigating the president's free-wheeling style presents challenges, Downing Street views the engagement as crucial for strengthening the UK-US relationship. The discussions on Gaza are seen as particularly important ahead of an emergency UK cabinet meeting on the crisis.</p>

Sources cited insubordination as the reason for the firings, which highlight ongoing disputes over the department's approach to merger enforcement.</p>
