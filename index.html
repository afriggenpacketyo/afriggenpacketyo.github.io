            <p>This BBC article delves into the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man deported from the US and accused of MS-13 membership. Despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return, the White House maintains he's a gang member, a claim Garcia denies. The article explores the evidence, including police observations of his clothing and alleged ties to a New York clique, juxtaposed with his lawyers' claims that he has no criminal record and fears persecution from a rival gang. The piece highlights the legal and political battle surrounding his deportation and the conflicting narratives about his character and affiliations.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation. Bin, a former gang member convicted of shooting at a rival's home, became a minister in prison and demonstrated good behavior. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation, reflecting the governor's opposition to the Trump administration's immigration policies. The governor also posthumously pardoned Sgt.

Governments sell bonds to raise money, paying interest in return. The article discusses how this affects ordinary Americans through potential increases in mortgage, credit card, and car loan rates. It also explores how the bond market's reaction to tariffs influenced President Trump's decision to pause higher tariffs, and how the current situation compares to the UK's mini-Budget crisis.

            <p>A bin strike in Birmingham, England, has exacerbated the divide between wealthy and impoverished areas, with waste piling up in densely populated, inner-city neighborhoods. Wealthier areas have experienced fewer issues. The strike has led to increased rat infestations and public health concerns. Some residents believe there is a two-tiered waste collection system, with poorer areas receiving less frequent service. The council has pledged to improve the situation once the strike ends.</p>

            <p>The ACLU warns that immigration authorities are moving to deport Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act despite the Supreme Court's ruling requiring due process. The ACLU has requested an emergency injunction, arguing that the government's notice does not comply with the Supreme Court's order. A federal judge expressed concern that migrants were asked to sign forms without information about their right to contest deportation. The Justice Department maintains that the notice complies with the Supreme Court's guidance.</p>
