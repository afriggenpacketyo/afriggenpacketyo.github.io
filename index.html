          <p>General Syed Asim Munir, Pakistan's army chief, has adopted a more assertive stance on the Kashmir issue following a deadly terrorist attack, signaling a shift from his traditionally behind-the-scenes role. His remarks, emphasizing Pakistan's resolve to respond forcefully to any Indian military action, reflect a need to project strength amidst domestic political and economic challenges, and a belief that the conflict with India is fundamentally religious. While the United States and the United Nations urge de-escalation, General Munir's rhetoric, including framing Kashmir as Pakistan's "jugular vein," suggests a hard-line approach, making long-term peace seem unlikely. This article analyzes General Munir's stance and its implications for regional stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated legal action against Colorado and Denver, alleging that their "sanctuary laws" impede federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit claims these policies violate the Supremacy Clause and have allowed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) to gain a foothold in Aurora, a Denver suburb. While local officials downplay the extent of the gang's control, the DOJ argues that the state's non-cooperation hinders deportation efforts. This action reflects the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to pressure Democratic-led cities and states to align with its stringent immigration policies.</p>
