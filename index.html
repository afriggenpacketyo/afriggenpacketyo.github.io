          <p>The BBC has confirmed it will broadcast a previously recorded series of MasterChef, despite recent findings of serious misconduct against presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode. The decision was made after consulting with the contestants, with the corporation stating the focus should remain on the amateur chefs' life-changing journey. However, the move has drawn criticism from some of the women who made claims against Wallace, who feel it disrespects those who spoke out. The BBC maintains the program is bigger than any individual and will return stronger.</p>

          <h2>NTSB Finds Overweight Cargo and External Moose Antlers Contributed to Fatal Alaska Plane Crash</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 07:12:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded its investigation into the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., husband of former Rep. Mary Peltola. The report identifies the probable cause as a combination of the aircraft being overweight with moose meat and drag caused by a set of antlers affixed to the wing strut. These factors, along with turbulent conditions, likely caused the plane to have insufficient power to clear the terrain. The report noted that carrying antlers externally requires FAA approval, which was not documented for this aircraft.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is moving to designate Apple and Google as having "strategic market status," a move that would grant the regulator power to enforce changes. The investigation focused on the companies' control over mobile operating systems, app stores, and browsers, citing concerns about unfair commission fees and anti-competitive practices that favor their own services. Both tech giants have opposed the proposals, arguing the changes would undermine user privacy and security. This action aligns with similar regulatory pressure the companies are facing from the European Union.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid organizations, including Oxfam and Save the Children, has released a joint statement describing the situation in Gaza as "mass starvation." The groups accuse the Israeli government of implementing a siege with restrictions and delays on aid that result in chaos and death for Palestinians. The statement highlights record rates of acute malnutrition, particularly among children, with some telling their parents they wish to go to heaven where there is food. The organizations warn that even aid workers are now struggling to feed their own families.</p>

          <p>A German chancellery minister has dismissed reports of a major split within the country's ruling coalition regarding its policy on Israel and the war in Gaza. The issue arose after Germany declined to sign a joint declaration with 28 other Western nations condemning the "inhumane killing" of Palestinian civilians. Senior figures from the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, publicly urged the government to join the condemnation, highlighting a clear difference in approach. Government officials defended the decision, stating that private diplomatic channels are more effective and that their unique historical responsibility shapes their stance.</p>

          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rates overturned by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled their original trials were unfair, a decision that represents a major vindication for traders who argued they were scapegoats for normal commercial practices amid public anger over the 2008 financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial, and the ruling may pave the way for other convicted traders to appeal. The case also brought to light suppressed evidence implicating government pressure in rate-setting during the crisis.</p>

This trend is introducing new competition for large institutional rental companies, particularly in Sun Belt markets where these investors are heavily concentrated and for-sale inventory is rising. These individual landlords, who enter the rental market out of necessity rather than by design, are increasing the supply of available rental homes.

          <p>This political analysis explores the concept of a "democratic pendulum," questioning how a future Democratic administration might utilize the expanded presidential powers asserted by the Trump administration. The article posits that while a Democratic president could reverse many of Trump's policies and appointments, the nature of these powers is more destructive than creative. Firing federal employees or dismantling agencies is easier than rebuilding them, creating a "ratchet of destruction" that favors a conservative agenda of shrinking government. The potential outcome is an unstable era of retaliatory politics, with policies swinging wildly between administrations and a long-term erosion of institutional expertise.</p>

          <p>Janita Phillips, a 65-year-old woman who killed her infant son in Connecticut in 1986, has been sentenced to five years of probation, avoiding prison time. Phillips was charged with murder in 2021 after new DNA evidence linked her to the cold case, and she later pleaded guilty to a lesser manslaughter charge. The lenient sentence was attributed to a psychological assessment concluding she was under "extreme emotional distress" at the time, being homeless and financially stressed. Phillips, who went on to raise three other children with her husband, expressed deep regret for her actions during the hearing.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced a new data-sharing agreement with food delivery companies like Deliveroo, Just Eat, and Uber Eats to crack down on illegal working. The firms will be given the locations of hotels housing asylum seekers to help them identify suspicious account activity, such as a delivery rider spending excessive time near one of the hotels. This measure aims to prevent asylum seekers, who are generally not permitted to work, from using shared accounts to earn money. The Home Office stated the initiative will help close loopholes and enhance enforcement against illegal employment.</p>

Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa spoke of the "humiliation" of seeing men wait for hours for a simple meal, calling the situation "morally unacceptable and unjustifiable." The visit followed an Israeli strike that hit a Catholic church compound, killing three people. The patriarchs emphasized that Gaza's small Christian community is suffering alongside all other Palestinians and noted that the aid they brought has not yet been allowed to enter due to logistical issues.</p>

Peter Reynolds, 80, and his wife Barbie, 76, were arrested in February for unknown reasons and have been held in harsh conditions, including a maximum-security prison. Their son reports that his father is suffering from serious convulsions and his mother is numb from malnutrition, with the UN warning their detention is "inhumane." The Taliban's foreign minister stated that efforts are underway for their release, but the family remains frustrated by the lack of progress.</p>

The U.S. and Canada, two of each other's largest trading partners, have been in a standoff since the Trump administration implemented a sweeping tariff program.

Despite this fundraising bonanza, the market for exits, such as acquisitions and IPOs, tells a different story. Total exit value was only $36 billion, characterized by frequent, lower-value acquisitions of smaller companies rather than high-value public listings. This trend suggests that while investors are pouring unprecedented amounts of capital into AI, the pathways to realizing returns on those investments remain comparatively limited for now.

The Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act would direct the SEC to create a test to qualify individuals based on financial knowledge, rather than the current wealth and income thresholds. Proponents argue that knowledge, not wealth, is a better measure of an investor's ability to weigh risks. However, some financial advisors express caution, noting that such investments are unsuitable for the vast majority of people. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article details China's decades-long strategy to achieve a near-monopoly on the refining of rare earth elements, which are critical for everything from smartphones to defense systems. Initially, the U.S. led the market, but China leveraged state support, improved technology, and tolerated severe environmental damage to undercut global competition. After a chaotic period of unregulated mining, Beijing consolidated the industry into six state-controlled giants, giving it immense power over global supply and pricing. This dominance has become a powerful tool in its trade disputes, forcing other nations, including the U.S., to scramble to rebuild their own refining capabilities.</p>

In his first interview on the matter, Woldbye stated his phone was in silent mode but insisted that the airport's crisis management procedures functioned correctly without him. A review found that a known fault at a National Grid substation caused the fire, and Heathrow is now considering legal action. The incident contributed to a 37% drop in pre-tax profit for the airport.</p>

The complaint, which alleges Geffen initiated their relationship with a payment for sex, also details claims of forced drug use on Geffen's superyacht.

Concerns are now being raised that the utility has little incentive to control settlement costs, as the fund would reimburse them.
