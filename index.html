          <p>Sovereignty secured a win at the 151st Kentucky Derby, outperforming 18 other horses on a wet track at Churchill Downs, with Journalism finishing in second place. Sovereignty's team, consisting of owner Godolphin, jockey Junior Alvarado, and trainer William Mott, will share a substantial portion of the $5 million prize. Journalism encountered difficulties early in the race, but Sovereignty, after finishing second in the Florida Derby and winning the Fountain of Youth Stakes, demonstrated strength and stamina, securing the win in 2:02.31 for the 1 1/4 mile race. Mott secured his first Derby win in 2019 under similar weather conditions, marking another victory on a sloppy track.</p>

          <p>Lady Gaga performed a free concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, drawing massive crowds and boosting the city's economic activity. The event, anticipated to be the pop star's largest show to date, is part of Rio's strategy to stimulate the local economy during the low season, with officials expecting an injection of approximately $100 million. Security measures were heightened with the deployment of thousands of military personnel, police officers, and firefighters, along with drones and surveillance technology. Lady Gaga's return to Brazil after over a decade was highly anticipated, as she had to cancel her appearance at the Rock in Rio festival in 2017 due to health concerns.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the reinstatement of over 1,000 Voice of America (VoA) employees, reversing an earlier ruling that temporarily stayed Donald Trump's executive order, which aimed to dismantle the US taxpayer-funded news service. The court's decision favors the executive branch on employment matters, effectively pausing the lower court's order to return employees to their previous status. Judge Nina Pillard dissented, warning that the decision could silence VoA indefinitely. The ruling also maintains the freeze on congressionally approved funds for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks, affecting their staffing and content.</p>

          <p>A Florida homeowner discovered 98 iguana eggs in her backyard, prompting a call to Humane Iguana Control, revealing a record number of eggs from three interconnected iguana nests. Michael Ronquillo, owner of the control service, emphasized that iguanas pose health risks, cause property damage, and can compromise infrastructure by burrowing. He advised homeowners to flag potential burrows and contact professionals instead of attempting removal themselves, as iguanas are invasive, not native to Florida, and can be dangerous to handle. Iguanas arrived in Florida through the pet trade and cargo ships, thriving due to the warm climate and lack of natural predators.</p>

          <p>Europe commemorates Victory in Europe Day with a sense of unease, particularly regarding Donald Trump's impact on transatlantic relations and European security. Many view Trump as a threat to shared values and security visions, especially given his perceived deference to Vladimir Putin and verbal threats towards allies. The war in Ukraine has amplified these concerns, with Europeans fearing Trump's stance could embolden Putin's expansionist ambitions. Germany, traditionally reliant on the US for security, is now increasing its defense spending due to a loss of trust in American reliability, signaling a significant shift in European attitudes towards defense and international alliances.</p>

          <p>The Reform Party achieved significant gains in recent local council elections in England, securing a leading share of votes and seats, particularly in areas that heavily supported Brexit in 2016. The party's success highlights the continued relevance of Brexit as a dividing line in British politics, with Reform appealing strongly to those who feel the decision to leave the EU was correct. The party performed well in working-class wards and areas with fewer university graduates, indicating a concentration of support among those who feel left behind by globalization. This outcome poses a challenge for both the Conservative and Labour parties, requiring them to better address the concerns of this segment of the population to regain broader appeal.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to fund private school tuition for qualifying students. The legislation provides $10,000 per year for most private school students, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Supporters, including President Trump, hail it as a victory for parental choice, while Democrats argue it will drain resources from already underfunded public schools.

          <p>Israel announced the mobilization of thousands of reserve soldiers to reinforce its military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, indicating a potential shift in tactics. The call-up raises fears of an expanded offensive in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been restricted for over two months. This decision has sparked anxiety among hostages' families, who fear the increased fighting could endanger their loved ones. Despite over a year of conflict, Israel has yet to fully achieve its goals of destroying Hamas and freeing all captives, leading to growing dissent against the government's handling of the war.</p>

The legislation addresses concerns raised after the 2021 Surfside condo collapse, which prompted stricter requirements for inspections and reserve funding.
