          <p>Donald Trump asserted that China has violated its trade agreement with the US shortly after a deal was reached, causing concerns about the continuation of the trade war and its impact on the global economy. Trump expressed his disappointment on Truth Social, following comments from the treasury secretary about stalled trade talks. This announcement caused US stock markets to decline, highlighting the instability created by the trade war, which has involved tariffs and retaliatory measures between the two countries. A recent court ruling blocking some of Trump's tariffs was paused by an appeals court, adding to the uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge, Hannah Dugan, is claiming judicial immunity and calling her indictment by the DOJ an "ugly innovation" after being accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities. Her legal team argues that the federal government overstepped its authority and violated the Constitution's Tenth Amendment and the principle of separation of powers. Dugan is accused of falsely telling ICE agents they needed a judicial warrant and directing them to the chief judge’s office, allegedly assisting Eduardo Flores-Ruiz. Despite her efforts, Flores-Ruiz was arrested, and Dugan could face up to six years in prison if convicted on federal charges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America" after a court ruling against his tariffs. The ruling, paused by an appellate court, put Trump at odds with some conservative lawyers, leading him to express disappointment with the Federalist Society, which he had previously relied on for judicial nominations. Trump claimed he realized the organization was under Leo's influence and gave him bad advice on judicial picks. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the Federal Courts, considering it his most important legacy.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, experts suggest consumers take action to manage their finances. Recommendations include paying down credit card debt, as average credit card APRs remain high, and considering balance transfer credit cards or personal loans. Locking in high-yield savings rates on online savings accounts and money market accounts is also advised before rates potentially decrease. Improving one's credit score can lead to lower interest rates on loans, but national average credit scores have recently declined. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In today's economy, with high home prices and rising equity, homeowners may consider borrowing against their equity using a home equity loan or HELOC. While interest rates on these products have declined, it's essential to borrow an amount that can be comfortably repaid. The decision depends on individual financial circumstances and economic predictions. It's crucial to calculate monthly payment costs and consider potential changes in market conditions and interest rates before borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ban on single-use vapes in the UK, aimed at curbing youth vaping and reducing electronic waste, may not significantly reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes to teenagers, according to Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). Hazel Cheeseman, Ash's chief executive, suggests that new reusable vapes are very similar to disposables, making the ban's impact on appeal limited. She argues that teenagers are drawn to vapes due to their bright colors, low cost, and accessibility, factors that will remain despite the ban. The government's Tobacco and Vapes Bill may offer stronger measures to reduce the appeal of vaping to young people.</p>
