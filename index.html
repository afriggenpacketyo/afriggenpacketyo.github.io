          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has begun deliberations in the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of plotting a coup to unlawfully retain power after his 2022 election defeat. The charges stem from the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings by his supporters, with prosecutors alleging he was part of an "armed criminal association." If convicted, Bolsonaro could face a prison sentence of over 40 years in what is the first trial of a former Brazilian president on such charges, a situation that has drawn both international attention and claims of political persecution from his allies.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have signed an open letter defending Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and the central bank's institutional independence. The letter responds to President Trump's unprecedented attempt to remove Cook from her position based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, which the signatories argue is a politically motivated move to influence monetary policy. They emphasize that insulating the Federal Reserve from day-to-day politics is a crucial safeguard for the U.S. financial system and long-term economic strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report supported by the United Nations reveals a phenomenon of "reverse flow" migration, with over 14,000 migrants turning back from their journey to the United States. This reversal is largely attributed to the Trump administration's stringent border enforcement policies, which have caused northward migration to plummet by 97% this year. Many of these migrants, primarily from Venezuela, now face dire circumstances, including exploitation and lack of resources, as humanitarian aid in the region has also diminished, leaving them stranded without support.</p>

Thomas, who also won gold on two relay teams in Paris, stated that she must prioritize her long-term health and that it is important to be human and take care of oneself. Despite securing a spot on the U.S. team by a narrow margin last month, she has decided to focus on recovery with plans to compete again in 2026.</p>

          <p>Graham Linehan, co-creator of the comedy series "Father Ted," was arrested at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of inciting violence through posts made on the social media platform X. Upon his arrival from the U.S., Linehan was taken into custody and later transported to a hospital due to health concerns. His bail conditions reportedly prohibit him from using X, and the arrest has sparked a debate on free speech, with critics like the Shadow Home Secretary calling the police action "totally disproportionate."</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has publicly stated his disappointment with the decision to split Kraft Heinz into two separate companies, a move that largely undoes the 2015 merger he helped orchestrate. Berkshire Hathaway, which is Kraft Heinz's largest shareholder with a 27.5% stake, has not sold any shares since the merger, though Buffett admitted in 2019 that his firm had overpaid. Following his comments, shares of the food conglomerate fell over 5% as the company continues to struggle with shifting consumer preferences and the legacy of its formation.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields jumped significantly as a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs were illegally imposed. This decision has sparked market concerns that the government may be forced to refund billions of dollars in collected tariff revenue, which could strain the U.S. fiscal situation and necessitate increased Treasury issuance to cover the shortfall. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4.27%, reflecting investor anxiety over the potential economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim O'Neill, a former Silicon Valley investor with no scientific background, has been installed as the acting director of the CDC following a period of intense turmoil. The previous director was ousted after clashing with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine policy agenda, prompting the protest resignations of three senior scientific leaders. O'Neill's appointment has raised concerns among public health experts as a new advisory committee prepares for a pivotal meeting to review several long-standing childhood vaccine recommendations.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial has indicated that azelastine, an over-the-counter antihistamine nasal spray used for seasonal allergies, may be effective in preventing Covid-19 infections. The study found that participants using the spray three times a day had a significantly lower infection rate (2.2%) compared to a placebo group (6.7%). Researchers theorize the spray may inhibit the virus's ability to replicate in the nasal passages, but caution that larger studies are needed before it can be widely recommended as a preventative measure.</p>
