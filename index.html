Manoj utilizes AI in her app to detect suspicious messages and has been teaching cybersecurity classes at senior community centers.

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a "lethal kinetic strike" on a boat suspected of trafficking illicit drugs, resulting in the deaths of three individuals described as "male narcoterrorists." The president released a video of the strike on social media, stating the event occurred within the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, which includes the Caribbean and South America. This marks at least the third such strike in recent weeks as part of the administration's efforts to combat the flow of illegal narcotics into the United States.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme Court, marking its second attempt to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals. The Justice Department is seeking to overturn a lower court's ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the protections. The administration argues that allowing these individuals to remain in the country is contrary to the national interest. This move is part of a broader administration strategy to tighten immigration policies and reduce the number of migrants with temporary legal status.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the United States, many Chinese export companies are now focusing on the burgeoning economies of Southeast Asia. A major trade fair in Nanning, China, is serving as a key testing ground for these firms to connect with buyers from the region. Companies, like an electric scooter manufacturer from Jiangxi, see immense potential in Southeast Asia's large population and growing consumer base. This strategic shift reflects a broader realignment in global trade dynamics as Chinese businesses seek new avenues for growth and expansion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a House resolution honoring the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey issued a statement condemning his views while also upholding his right to free speech. While she voted in favor of the bipartisan measure, Sherrill characterized Kirk as a proponent of Christian nationalism who sought to "roll back the rights of women and Black people." The resolution to honor Kirk's "life and legacy" passed with broad support but divided Democrats, with 58 voting against it.

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for Virginia's eastern district, has resigned from his position amid significant pressure from the Trump administration. Sources indicate the pressure was aimed at compelling Siebert to file criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a frequent political adversary of the president. Despite a months-long investigation into alleged mortgage fraud, prosecutors had not found sufficient evidence to secure an indictment, leading to concerns that the push for charges was politically motivated retribution. Siebert's departure leaves a key prosecutorial office without confirmed leadership.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has strongly criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr for urging ABC to "take action" against late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz compared Carr's comments, which preceded ABC's decision to suspend Kimmel's show indefinitely, to a "mafioso" shakedown, calling the move "dangerous as hell." While expressing personal dislike for Kimmel's comedy, Cruz warned that empowering the government to silence speech it dislikes sets a dangerous precedent that could eventually be used against conservatives. The controversy stems from Kimmel's monologue remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has thrown out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing improper and political language in the complaint. Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and resembled a "podium for a passionate oration at a political rally" rather than a professional legal document. The judge did not rule on the case's legal merits but gave Trump's lawyers 28 days to refile a shorter, more professional complaint. The New York Times welcomed the ruling, stating the original lawsuit was a political document intended to stifle independent reporting.</p>

          <p>Michael Eisner, who served as CEO of Disney for over two decades, has publicly defended Jimmy Kimmel following the host's indefinite suspension by the Disney-owned ABC network. In a social media post, Eisner condemned the move as an example of "out-of-control intimidation" and a failure of corporate leadership to stand up against bullies. He directly linked the suspension to the "aggressive yet hollow threatening" from the Chairman of the FCC, who had called for action against Kimmel over his remarks about Charlie Kirk's assassination. Eisner questioned who will defend the First Amendment if corporate leaders do not, and praised Kimmel as talented and funny.</p>

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the policy is designed to incentivize companies to "train Americans" and hire recent U.S. university graduates instead of foreign talent. The move has drawn criticism from the tech sector and immigration experts, who argue it will deter top global talent and question the executive branch's legal authority to impose such a high fee without congressional action.

          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and FCC Chair Brendan Carr to revoke broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over the media industry. Broadcast networks such as ABC, CBS, and NBC require licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to use public airwaves, obligating them to operate in the "public interest." While this authority has historically been used to address issues like obscenity or children's programming, the current administration is leveraging it to challenge news coverage and commentary it deems politically biased. Revoking a license is a complex process that would likely face significant legal challenges based on First Amendment protections.</p>

          <h2>UCLA Implements New Campus Protest Rules Amid Federal Pressure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a year of campus demonstrations and intense pressure from the Trump administration, UCLA has released new, formalized rules governing protests. The guidelines ban unauthorized overnight encampments and demonstrations in certain areas like Royce Quad, aligning with some federal demands, but also expand free speech zones in other parts of campus. The university maintains the rules are "content neutral" and not a direct reaction to the administration, which has threatened to pull research funding over past pro-Palestinian protests. The new policies come as universities nationwide reevaluate safety and free speech, particularly following the recent killing of a conservative activist on another campus.</p>

          <p>Nearly 200 people have completed a 14-day, 160-mile march for democracy, arriving in Washington, D.C., after starting their journey in Philadelphia. The "We Are America" march was organized to build a movement to hold U.S. leaders accountable in response to actions by the Trump administration. Participants, ranging from children to the elderly, walked through multiple states, receiving support and lodging from local communities along the route. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by supporters and members of Congress, to whom they presented a version of the U.S. Constitution created by children to symbolize their mission.</p>

          <p>"Pupusas and Punchlines," a weekly comedy show held at a Salvadoran restaurant in Los Angeles, is providing a vital platform for Latinx and other underrepresented comedians. Created by producer Justin Alexio, the event combines food and culture, allowing performers to connect with an appreciative audience over shared experiences. In a competitive L.A. scene where comics of color often struggle for bookings, the show has become a sold-out success, fostering a sense of community for both performers and attendees. Comedians feel they can address topics like immigration and first-generation life that might not resonate in more mainstream comedy clubs.</p>

          <p>Estonia has formally requested Article 4 consultations with its NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes. The Estonian government condemned the incursion as a "brazen" and "extremely dangerous provocation," summoning Russia's chargé d'affaires to lodge a formal protest. NATO allies, including Italy, Finland, and Sweden, scrambled jets to intercept and escort the Russian aircraft, which had their transponders off and no flight plans filed. This incident marks the second time in a week a NATO member has invoked Article 4, following a similar request by Poland over Russian drone activity.</p>

The operation is focused around the cities of Pokrovsk and Dobropillia, a key area for Russia's strategic objectives. Ukraine's top commander reported advances of up to seven kilometers through Russian defenses, disrupting a planned Russian offensive and resulting in the capture of more Russian prisoners. While Russia claimed the capture of two new villages elsewhere, it did not comment on the Ukrainian drive near the logistics hub of Pokrovsk.</p>

The result was hailed as a "fairytale" and a "tectonic" shift in the sport, as New Zealand had not lost a knockout game in the World Cup since 1991.

          <p>During a chaotic and sharply divided meeting, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) narrowly voted against recommending a prescription requirement for COVID-19 vaccines. The tie-breaking vote was cast by the chair, Martin Kulldorff. However, the panel, now composed of appointees by vocal vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., did vote to recommend that individuals engage in "shared clinical decision making" with a doctor before getting the shot. The meeting was marked by confusion and tense exchanges, further complicating the U.S. vaccine landscape and raising concerns among public health experts about the committee's direction and expertise.</p>

          <p>Recent decisions by the CDC's new Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) are raising concerns that the U.S. may be heading toward a two-tiered system for vaccine access. The panel's vote to remove the combined MMRV vaccine from the federally funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which serves low-income families, is a key example. While privately insured families may still have access to such options, the poorest children will be directly impacted by the committee's more restrictive recommendations. This analysis suggests that if more changes are made to the standard childhood immunization schedule, it could recreate the vaccine inequities that the successful VFC program was originally designed to eliminate.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a $2.6 billion expansion of its downtown Convention Center, moving forward despite significant warnings from its own policy advisors about the financial risks. The project is expected to draw an average of $89 million annually from the city's general fund for 30 years, potentially impacting essential services like police and fire departments. Proponents, including Mayor Karen Bass, argue the expansion is a necessary investment that will create jobs and boost tourism, especially ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games. However, critics, including the City Controller, warn the project is unaffordable and won't provide a positive return to the city budget until the late 2050s. (not investment advice)</p>

The party argues this move would increase police visibility, build public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. They suggest the initiative could be funded by abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, a move they claim would save over £100 million. The "police desk promise" is a central announcement at the party's annual conference as they aim to appeal to voters concerned about community policing.</p>
