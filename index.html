        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from over 30 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. The ruling, which extends a previous order protecting various cities, deemed the administration's executive actions an unconstitutional "coercive threat" that overstepped federal authority. These jurisdictions limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, and billions of dollars in funding were at risk, prompting the legal challenge from cities like Boston and Los Angeles. The administration had previously appealed the initial order and continues to ratify its stance on pressuring these communities to comply with federal immigration mandates, but the court has upheld the cities' autonomy for now.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 2-1 defeat against the San Diego Padres, consequently losing their sole lead in the National League West and falling into a tie for first place. This outcome followed a week where the team squandered momentum gained from a previous sweep. Despite a strong seven-inning performance from pitcher Blake Snell and a rookie home run in the third inning, the Dodgers' offense largely faltered, managing only one run and failing to capitalize on crucial late-game opportunities, including leaving Shohei Ohtani on deck in the eighth. This disappointing loss, following a split series with the Rockies, marks a significant setback for the team's momentum this season.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez, 57, was denied parole for the first time, ensuring he remains incarcerated alongside his younger brother Erik, whose parole was also rejected a day prior. Despite commendations for his model behavior in prison, including program work and positive relationships, the parole board cited persistent anti-social personality traits like deception, minimization, and rule-breaking, notably illegal cellphone use. The board also emphasized his poor threat perception regarding his father and the brutal nature of the 1989 murders of his parents. Lyle will be eligible for parole again in three years, with a potential administrative review sooner.</p>

          <p>The United States is closely monitoring China's five-strong icebreaker and research vessel fleet operating in the Arctic Ocean, raising significant concerns about Beijing's intensifying strategic interest in the region. The vessels recently crossed the Bering Strait and approached within 290 nautical miles of the Alaskan coast, right on the edge of a disputed "extended continental shelf" area claimed by the United States. This activity has prompted a quick response from the US Coast Guard, highlighting growing geopolitical tensions and competition for influence in the strategically important Arctic. China's increased presence underscores its ambitions in polar research, resource access, and potential military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has pledged mass deportations of asylum seekers who arrive in the UK via small boats, asserting that this radical action is necessary to address a "massive crisis" threatening national security and potentially leading to public disorder.

While facing legal challenges and criticism from Labour and Conservatives as "pie in the sky," the proposal reflects growing public frustration over record-high small boat crossings and increasing asylum applications.</p>

Charles Munger Jr., a prominent GOP donor and champion of independent redistricting, contributed $10 million to oppose the measure, while powerful labor groups and Democratic-aligned PACs are providing significant funding to support it. This state-level effort by California Democrats seeks to counter Republican gains in states like Texas, creating an unusual mid-decade redistricting battle. The outcome could significantly impact the balance of power in the upcoming midterm elections, with both sides mobilizing substantial financial resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Malaysia has implemented a ban on exports of unprocessed rare earth metals, a strategic move aimed at keeping these globally prized raw materials onshore for investment in downstream industries and technology transfers. This policy change positions Malaysia to significantly capitalize on the United States' urgent search for non-Chinese sources of these critical minerals, which are essential in a range of electronic hardware. Analysts suggest Malaysia's existing processing capacity gives it a crucial head start in integrating into global supply chains. The ban signals Malaysia's intent to exercise its geoeconomic agency, prioritize its own development needs, and could attract substantial foreign investment in its rare earths sector.</p>

          <p>A new European study published in Science Advances highlights that air pollution from all stages of oil and gas activity disproportionately affects Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian Americans. The pollution causes an estimated 91,000 premature deaths annually, alongside thousands of preterm births and childhood asthma cases nationwide, with the greatest harm stemming from fossil fuel combustion. California, particularly Los Angeles County, ranks among the most affected states.

          <p>The Justice Department released over 300 pages of transcripts from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell regarding Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell, currently appealing her conviction, provided insights into her relationship with Epstein, denied witnessing inappropriate behavior by figures like Donald Trump or Bill Clinton, and expressed skepticism about Epstein's suicide. The release follows mounting pressure for transparency regarding the Epstein case's fallout and comes as the DOJ also provided thousands of files to the House Oversight Committee, with necessary redactions for victim protection. Maxwell's attorney thanked the administration for the release, maintaining her innocence.</p>

          <p>An explosion and fire at Smitty’s Supply, an automotive supply company in Roseland, Louisiana, sent large flames and a tower of thick black smoke billowing into the air, prompting nearby residents and an elementary school to evacuate.

          <p>The FBI conducted a search at the Bethesda, Maryland home and Washington D.C. office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton, confirming the activity is related to a classified documents investigation. President Trump stated he learned of the raid from TV, publicly calling Bolton a "lowlife" and "unpatriotic" while implying he would be briefed by the Justice Department. FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media about "no one being above the law." Bolton had previously published a memoir critical of Trump, leading to a Justice Department inquiry into potential classified information disclosure, which was later closed by the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>Polling data suggests a widening political divide among young people in Britain, with young women increasingly identifying as left-wing and young men leaning more to the right. A 2025 survey found 20% of young women identified as left-wing compared to 13% of young men, with women favoring Labour and Greens, and men showing more support for Reform UK. Researchers attribute this growing gap to factors like higher rates of higher education for women and the pervasive influence of social media. Some experts suggest young men may be reacting to perceived societal attempts to "feminize" them, potentially drawing them to support populist, radical right parties.</p>

          <p>The release of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview transcripts provided limited relief for Donald Trump, as Maxwell's statements downplayed his close association with Jeffrey Epstein and denied witnessing any inappropriate behavior by him. While Trump's administration published the redacted transcripts under pressure, they did not fully quell "Maga" supporters' demands for more information on a supposed "deep state" conspiracy. The article notes the transcripts also focused heavily on Bill Clinton, and Maxwell's testimony suggested a sense of aggrieved entitlement and skepticism about Epstein's death. This event underscores the ongoing political fallout and deep divisions surrounding the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to be armed, significantly escalating the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This directive reverses an earlier decision to keep troops unarmed, raising concerns about militarization. President Trump, who assumed control of the city's police force, claims the mission has brought "total safety" and is considering expanding it to Chicago, despite the Chicago mayor's strong opposition. Local D.C. officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have questioned the necessity of federal intervention, citing decreasing crime rates and expressing concerns about potential tensions with residents.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as part of its crime crackdown, with U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro pledging to pursue charges vigorously. However, criminal justice experts caution that arrest numbers alone are poor indicators of actual public safety, as they don't always lead to criminal charges or convictions. They note that "flooding the zone" with officers, as seen with over 2,000 federal agents, can increase arrests for minor infractions and heighten the risk of police uses of force. Many questions remain about the nature of the arrests, the agencies involved, and their true impact on crime rates.</p>

This is California's worst heatwave of the year, exacerbating exceptionally high fire risks across the American West, which has already seen a decade-high number of ignitions.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly sent to El Salvador earlier this year, to Uganda. This development follows Uganda's recent agreement to accept deportees who are not its citizens, becoming a "third country" for US removals. Abrego Garcia, an El Salvador native, fears persecution by local gangs in his home country, a claim previously upheld by an immigration judge preventing his deportation there. Despite his recent release from pre-trial detention, Immigration and Customs Enforcement could seek his removal to Uganda, a practice increasingly used by the administration that raises significant human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>A Colorado judge rejected a plea agreement for Jon Hallford, a funeral home owner who admitted to abusing 191 corpses, after emotional testimony from victims' families demanding a harsher sentence. Hallford and his wife allegedly ran a fraudulent scheme, taking money for cremations while leaving bodies to decay for years and providing families with concrete resembling ashes. The judge's "extreme action" to reject the 20-year concurrent sentence means Hallford could withdraw his guilty plea and face a trial or a potentially longer sentence. This decision, swayed by victims' experiences, highlights Colorado's historically weak oversight of funeral homes and the profound distress caused by such deception.</p>

          <p>President Trump's federal initiative to clear homeless encampments in Washington D.C. mirrors a controversial, more aggressive crackdown implemented in San Francisco following a landmark Supreme Court ruling on illegal lodging. While San Francisco's policy has reduced visible encampments, the overall number of homeless individuals continues to rise, indicating displacement rather than resolution. Critics argue criminalizing homelessness is punitive and fails to address underlying issues like mental health, addiction, and acute housing shortages. The D.C. approach, like San Francisco's, faces questions about its effectiveness in truly solving the crisis versus merely displacing vulnerable populations, raising concerns about human rights.</p>

This surge reflects a broader market shift, with momentum returning to crypto assets and institutional interest in stablecoins, particularly those powered by the Ethereum blockchain, growing due to regulatory tailwinds and new legislative initiatives.
