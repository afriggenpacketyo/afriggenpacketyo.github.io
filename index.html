        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Army Black Hawk helicopter crash near Reagan National Airport, resulting in the death of the entire crew, has been attributed to a combination of factors. The crew requested and received permission to use "visual separation," a common aviation practice where pilots navigate around other aircraft independently. Aviation experts have warned about the risks associated with mishandling visual separation, and this incident highlights the potential for deadly consequences when it is not executed correctly. The crash occurred shortly after the crew was alerted to a nearby passenger jet by air traffic control, underscoring the importance of precise communication and adherence to safety protocols in busy airspace.</p>

The 27-year-old student, originally from China and residing in Japan, was found near the 8th station on the Fujinomiya trail, over 3,000 meters above sea level. He had returned to retrieve items, including a mobile phone, which he had lost after being rescued by helicopter earlier in the week.

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with President Zelensky has offered a glimmer of hope for Ukrainians, who are concerned about a peace plan that seems favorable to Russia. Trump questioned why Putin would continue to attack Ukraine while the U.S. is trying to broker peace. This comes after a massive Russian missile attack on Kyiv that killed 12 people and injured almost 90, prompting Trump to rebuke Putin. The United States has been pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that would force Kyiv to abandon its aspirations of joining NATO and recognize Crimea as Russian.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and fire at the Shahid Rajaei port in southern Iran has resulted in at least 25 deaths and around 800 injuries. The incident, purportedly linked to a shipment of ammonium perchlorate used in missile propellant, occurred amidst ongoing negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's nuclear program. While Iranian officials have denied that the explosion was the result of an attack, the incident has raised concerns about potential sabotage. The port, located on the Strait of Hormuz, has been a target in the past, including a 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's ongoing conflict with the US media, which he deems an "enemy of the people," has escalated into a legal battle that jeopardizes press freedoms. The dispute centers on a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, leading to a $10 billion lawsuit by Trump alleging election interference. Concerns are growing that Paramount, CBS's parent company, may settle the lawsuit to secure regulatory approval for a sale to Skydance, potentially compromising the news program's independence. The resignation of a 60 Minutes executive producer highlights the pressure on news organizations to appease Trump, raising fears about the erosion of journalistic integrity.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent actions and policies reveal a governing philosophy centered on the ruthless pursuit of absolute power, departing from traditional conservative principles. His declaration of war against "enemies within" the Department of Justice and his executive orders, such as the Alien Enemies Act, demonstrate a disregard for the law and a desire for unrestrained authority. The abduction and incarceration of migrants without due process, coupled with his admiration for authoritarian figures like Nayib Bukele, underscore a despotic approach to governance. This shift towards authoritarianism has sparked legal challenges and raised concerns about the erosion of constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Environmental groups are raising concerns about President Trump's decision to reverse fishing regulations in the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine national monument. The move, heavily advocated for by American Samoan tuna lobbyists, allows commercial fishing within 50 to 200 nautical miles of the monument's boundaries. Experts warn of potential environmental consequences, including the rise in illegal fishing and bycatch, as well as the negative impact on fragile ecosystems and marine animals like sharks and sea turtles. The proclamation could undo years of conservation efforts and negatively impact American fishers in the long run.</p>

The Liberal Democrats are also expected to perform well in certain areas due to Reform's impact on the Conservative vote.

The excavation has involved local communities and griots, fostering a collaborative effort to understand and preserve African history from an African perspective. This project highlights the importance of oral traditions and the role of archaeology in uncovering and validating historical narratives.</p>

          <h2>Museums Partnering with Art Galleries to Shape Art History</h2>

          <p>Museums, traditionally the arbiters of art history, are increasingly collaborating with major commercial art galleries to support their exhibitions. This trend raises questions about the influence of commercial interests on curatorial decisions and the selection of artists featured in museum shows. A recent analysis examined over 350 solo exhibitions by contemporary artists in New York's biggest art museums over the last six years to assess the scale of these partnerships. The increasing involvement of commercial galleries in museum exhibitions is reshaping the art world and potentially influencing the narratives presented to the public.</p>

          <p>The MAGA aesthetic, characterized by starkly gendered and often extreme looks, reflects the political philosophy and policy goals of the Trump administration. These looks, often seen in Trump's inner circle and on Fox News, serve as a form of distraction, drawing attention away from the administration's policies. The pairing of extreme looks with extreme policies creates a reversion to a different time in the United States, both aesthetically and politically. The use of reality TV-style tactics and over-the-top aesthetics further contributes to the administration's efforts to control the narrative and shape public perception.</p>

          <p>The Green Party is urging the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to withdraw its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it "ill-considered and impractical." The guidance, issued after a UK Supreme Court ruling on the definition of "woman" under the Equality Act, suggests that trans women should not be permitted in women's facilities in places like hospitals and shops. Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argues the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination and was not developed with input from trans people.

          <p>China is implementing more generous tax refunds for international visitors in an effort to boost tourism revenue and counter the impact of trade tensions. The new policies, effective immediately, lower the minimum purchase amount for tax refunds from 500 yuan to 200 yuan and increase the cash refund limit from 10,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan. These measures aim to reduce shopping costs for overseas tourists and promote economic, trade, and cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world.

          <p>A troubling trend is emerging across the United States: the return of psychiatric imprisonment, rebranded as "modern mental health care." From Governor Hochul's push to expand involuntary commitment in New York to RFK Jr.'s proposal for "wellness farms," policymakers are reviving confinement logics under the guise of care. These proposals reflect a deep investment in carceral control over marginalized communities, undermining autonomy and reinforcing systems of confinement. Experts advocate for a shift towards collective care, including housing-first initiatives, peer-led crisis response teams, and voluntary, community-based mental health services.</p>

The project has been marked by widespread staff cuts, access to sensitive data, and controversial actions that have faced resistance from both Republicans and the courts. Critics warn that Musk's approach of treating government like the private sector is disastrous and that Doge may ultimately cost more than it saves.</p>
