            <p>Wells Fargo analysts report that Amazon is pausing some data center lease commitments, particularly international ones, mirroring similar actions by Microsoft, signaling a potential slowdown in tech companies' spending plans due to economic concerns and proposed tariffs. Despite this, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated earlier this month that the company is not planning to cut down on data center construction. The analysts emphasize that Amazon is reeling in some new projects but not canceling signed deals, with tech stocks facing pressure due to potential cost increases from proposed tariffs.

            <p>West Bromwich Albion has sacked head coach Tony Mowbray after just three months into his second spell, following a 3-1 defeat by Derby County which effectively ended the team's chances of reaching the Championship play-offs. Mowbray's assistant Mark Venus has also departed, and James Morrison has been appointed as interim manager, supported by Damia Abella and Boaz Myhill. During Mowbray's brief tenure, the club secured only five wins in 18 games, leaving them six points adrift of the play-off positions with only two games remaining.</p>

            <p>Two German teenagers, Charlotte Pohl and Maria Lepère, were detained and deported from Honolulu despite holding valid ESTA authorizations, due to suspicions about their travel plans. Customs and Border Protection agents questioned the teens about their accommodation bookings, finding it suspicious that they hadn't fully booked their five-week stay. The teens allege they were handcuffed, subjected to body scans and strip searches, and held in a freezing cell before being deported to Tokyo. Germany has updated its travel advisory to the U.S. following a decrease in German visitors and turbulent experiences in the country.</p>

            <p>Experts offer varied opinions on the likelihood of mortgage rates dropping below 6% soon, with some believing it's possible this year as inflation cools and the Federal Reserve considers rate cuts, while others are less optimistic due to economic uncertainties. Factors influencing the potential drop include further declines in inflation, Federal Reserve rate cuts, and the performance of the 10-year Treasury bond market. Despite differing predictions, experts advise that if current rates align with one's budget and long-term goals, it may not be wise to wait indefinitely for a better rate. (not investment advice)</p>

The survey indicates that the initial boost in economic optimism following Trump's reelection has waned, with more Americans now expressing pessimism about the economy and the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, disapproval has significantly increased among Democrats, independents, and blue-collar workers.</p>
