          <p>An explosion in Palm Springs, California, near a fertility clinic and a medical center, is under investigation by the FBI, ATF, and local authorities. The incident occurred on Saturday morning, causing damage to nearby buildings, including the American Reproductive Centers, which reported that one person died and several were injured, although authorities have not confirmed the death toll. The clinic assured that all reproductive materials remained secure. The U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California stated the FBI is investigating whether the explosion was an intentional act, while residents have been asked to avoid the area as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will speak with Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy on Monday to discuss a cease-fire in Ukraine, following a Russian drone attack that killed nine civilians. These calls come after prisoner swap agreements were made between Ukraine and Russia, but a cease-fire was not reached. Trump expressed optimism about ending the war, while Zelenskyy condemned the drone attack and called for stronger sanctions against Russia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, emphasizing the need for an immediate cease-fire, as diplomatic efforts continue alongside gatherings for Pope Leo XIV's inaugural Mass.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Transit executives and the union representing its train drivers resumed negotiations on Saturday, a day earlier than planned, as the state's transit strike entered its second day, stranding thousands of commuters. The two sides had been engaged in negotiations for months and, according to Mr. Kolluri, who has been leading the agencyâ€™s bargaining team, had been 95 percent of the way to a deal, but reached an impasse on the issue of pay. The union is pushing for pay on par with other commuter railroads, but the agency claims it cannot afford the increases. Despite contingency plans, officials are preparing for potential continued disruptions and asking residents to work from home if possible.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and Russia's delegations met officially for the first time in three years in Istanbul, but failed to reach a ceasefire deal, agreeing only to exchange prisoners of war.

After the negotiations, the Ukrainian delegation announced that each country had agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners.

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria took senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. The announcement lacked specifics, leading to internal discussions to determine the extent and speed of the rollback. The Syrian transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief, blaming them for economic struggles. Relief may come in the form of waivers under the "Caesar Act." The move follows pressure from Turkey and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Syria's new government.</p>

          <p>Arizona Democrats are facing significant challenges as they head into the 2026 elections, including concerns about Governor Katie Hobbs's re-election chances and internal party turmoil. Hobbs, considered one of the nation's most vulnerable Democratic governors, faces a potentially formidable Republican opponent in a state that recently flipped to President Trump. The state party is also grappling with an acrimonious feud between the new chairman and Democratic senators. These issues pose a distraction as Hobbs prepares for a tough re-election campaign.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have engaged in a new round of talks to end the war in Gaza, after Israel's military launched a major new offensive. At least 300 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on the enclave since Thursday, including at least 50 people in bombardments overnight, rescuers in the territory say. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised a major military escalation that would occupy and control swathes of Gaza, force the Palestinian population to the south of the territory and "destroy" Hamas.</p>

This expansion is part of a broader plan to diversify the UAE's economy and increase its influence over global supply chains. While the U.S. has maintained close security ties, the UAE's growing commercial partnership with China is also a key factor in its strategy.</p>

          <p>Combat sport clubs have been used to boost recruitment for a white nationalist hate group, according to a report released by the legal advocacy organization Southern Poverty Law Center. The report tracks the efforts of the Patriot Front and their focus on recruiting new members through Active Clubs. These clubs are smaller, looser networks of white supremacist groups, where members train in mixed martial arts. Patriot Front is using these groups to expand their reach while maintaining a low profile, the report said, to evade researchers and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Germany has expressed concern over Israel's intensified operation in Gaza, as Hamas confirms new ceasefire talks are underway. UN agencies have warned that Israel's total aid blockade on the territory has created critical shortages of food, clean water, fuel and medicines, with warnings of famine on the rise. The intensified campaign was what brought Hamas back to the negotiating table, according to Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz. Previous negotiations to end the war had often failed, as Hamas remains adamant that any deal must involve a permanent end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.</p>
