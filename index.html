          <p>Peter Coker Jr., a defendant in the $100 million New Jersey deli fraud case, was attacked by inmates in a Thai prison while awaiting extradition. His attorney cited the inhumane conditions and Coker Jr.'s severe cirrhosis from alcohol abuse during his sentencing for securities fraud. Coker Jr. expressed remorse for his role in the scheme, which involved artificially inflating the share price of Hometown International, a company owning a small, money-losing deli. His father, Peter Coker Sr., received a six-month jail sentence and was ordered to pay a $500,000 fine and restitution for his part in the fraud, which involved making worthless companies appear attractive for mergers.

Eliminating Muhammad Sinwar could potentially influence future cease-fire negotiations, although Hamas is unlikely to show immediate flexibility following the assassination attempt, which comes amidst ongoing conflict and stalled hostage negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering accepting a $400 million luxury Boeing 747-8 plane as a gift from the Qatari royal family, raising concerns about potential corruption and conflicts of interest. The gift would be used as a temporary Air Force One and later donated to his presidential foundation. Critics argue the gift violates the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act and the Constitution's emoluments clauses, which aim to prevent foreign influence. The article questions Qatar's motives for such a lavish gift, suggesting it could be an attempt to curry favor with the president given Trump's history of conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.4%, the lowest annual increase in five years, according to analysts.

The COLA is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W has increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's recent imposition of large tariffs on global goods coincided with a slowdown in inflation, raising questions about the expected economic impact. While tariffs typically increase consumer prices, the article suggests that US companies may have stocked up on foreign goods earlier in the year, allowing them to maintain low prices by using existing inventories. However, experts predict that prices will eventually rise as companies exhaust these pre-tariff inventories. The article also notes that Trump's partial retreat from tariffs on China has reduced the risk of a severe economic crisis.</p>

          <p>Three key House committees are meeting to advance President Trump's budget package, which includes contentious proposals on defense, energy, and tax priorities. The committees will debate changes to Medicaid and food stamps to fund tax cuts, but divisions remain among Republicans on issues like Medicaid overhaul and a tax deduction expiring in December. The Energy and Commerce Committee's plan includes work requirements for Medicaid recipients and a ban on Medicaid covering gender transition services for children, while the Ways and Means Committee proposes extending tax cuts and raising the debt limit.</p>
