          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 08:56:47 EDT</div>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has avoided committing to ending the current freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds, which is set to expire in April 2028. During Prime Minister's Questions, he repeatedly stated he was bound only by Labour's manifesto, which pledged not to raise the rates of major taxes but made no promise on thresholds. This freeze, introduced by the Conservatives, has resulted in millions paying higher tax rates as their wages rise, a phenomenon known as fiscal drag. Extending the policy could generate an estimated £7 billion in annual revenue for the government.</p>

          <p>Freddie, a 5-year-old Customs and Border Protection beagle, is returning to work at Dulles International Airport two weeks after being intentionally kicked by a traveler. The man, an Egyptian national, was arrested and pleaded guilty to assaulting a police animal, paying the dog's $840 veterinarian bill. Freddie, a rescue dog trained to detect prohibited agricultural items, has successfully identified thousands of pounds of illegal plant and meat products during his service. His handler noted that beagles are used for their powerful sense of smell and their less-threatening appearance in busy airports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines several IRS tax relief programs designed to help small business owners manage back taxes without having to cease operations. These options are critical as many entrepreneurs face economic pressures that can lead to falling behind on tax payments. The programs include business installment agreements to spread payments over time, and an Offer in Compromise (OIC) to settle debt for less than the full amount in cases of severe financial hardship. Other options are Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status to temporarily pause collections and penalty abatement to reduce or remove certain penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ten years after China's "709 crackdown," which saw the arrest and interrogation of over 300 human rights lawyers, the legal profession faces intensified government control. Lawyers who were targeted, like Chen Jiangang who fled to the US, describe a suffocating atmosphere with little room for defense work. Those who were convicted and have since been released remain under constant surveillance and face severe restrictions on their daily lives and ability to work. Despite the risks, international organizations and some lawyers within China continue to resist and call for accountability.</p>

          <p>Sir Brian Langstaff, chair of the infected blood inquiry, has criticized the UK government for causing further harm to victims through delays in the compensation scheme. In a new report, he highlighted "obvious injustices" and noted that only 460 of the estimated 30,000 victims have received full payments from the £11.8 billion fund. The inquiry found that thousands were infected with HIV and hepatitis in the 1970s and 80s due to contaminated NHS blood products.

          <p>The price of copper for U.S. buyers has surged following President Trump's announcement of a 50% tariff on imports, creating a significant price gap with global markets.

Analysts warn this could lead to higher consumer prices for goods like cars and appliances, and potentially slow down infrastructure projects.

The National Weather Service Employees Organisation warns that many offices are operating below typical staffing levels, which could jeopardize public safety in future weather catastrophes.

The proposals aim to prevent a "total system collapse" by shortening processes, suggesting non-jury trials for offenses like fraud and creating a new court division for less serious crimes.

His dissent led to his isolation at the Tule Lake camp, where he renounced his U.S. citizenship.

          <p>Torrential rains caused deadly flash flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico, killing at least three people, including a 4-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy. The flooding, exacerbated by burn scars from last year's wildfires, caused the Rio Ruidoso to rise a record-breaking 20 feet, sweeping a house off its foundation. Emergency crews conducted over 50 swift-water rescues to save stranded residents. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has requested an emergency declaration for federal assistance to aid in the response and recovery efforts for the devastated community.</p>

          <p>A recent dip in mortgage rates to a three-month low prompted a significant 9.4% jump in total mortgage application volume last week. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.77%, encouraging both homebuyers and homeowners to act. Applications for home purchases and refinancing both increased by 9%, with purchase applications also running 25% higher than the same week last year. The Mortgage Bankers Association noted that growing housing inventory and moderating price growth are also helping to fuel homebuyer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia has launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine to date, firing 728 drones and 13 missiles at cities across the country, with the western city of Lutsk being a primary target. The attack came as U.S. President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of Vladimir Putin, calling his words "meaningless" and acknowledging the high human cost of the war. This rhetoric marks a shift, occurring shortly after the U.S. reversed a temporary suspension of military aid to Kyiv. The Kremlin responded to Trump's comments by stating it was "pretty calm" about his harsh language.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the recent rightward political shift in Latin America, attributing it to several interconnected factors. The rise of autocratic right-wing figures is fueled by the radicalization of politics, extreme polarization on social media, and the judicialization of political disputes, or "lawfare." Persistent economic inequality and the delegitimization of democratic institutions have created an opening for "anti-politician" leaders. The author argues that in the face of these trends, progressive forces must build a new development model based on solidarity, inclusion, and regional integration to counter the rising threat of fascism.</p>

          <p>Newly disclosed revenue-sharing contracts at Florida State University (FSU) contain clauses that could allow the school to cancel a player's deal if they suffer a serious injury. This provision has been labeled "oppressive" and "unconscionable" by a legal expert, as it appears to shift the financial risk of football's inherent dangers onto the student-athletes. Critics, including former NFL player Chris Kluwe, argue this exemplifies how universities continue to exploit players, particularly in a high-injury sport like football. FSU stated it is committed to an elite experience for its athletes and that each situation would be unique.</p>

          <p>Undocumented construction workers in the U.S. report that some employers are exploiting the climate of fear created by the Trump administration's immigration crackdown to cut pay and increase hours. Workers, like a tile setter in Arizona, claim contractors have slashed their rates, knowing the laborers are unlikely to complain for fear of deportation. Advocacy groups state this is a widespread issue, as the threat of ICE raids emboldens unscrupulous employers and silences workers. This exploitation occurs even as the construction industry faces a significant labor shortage and lobbies for more lenient immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Washington's sudden decision to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is creating significant uncertainty for China, the world's largest consumer and refiner of the metal. The move caused U.S. copper futures to rally while prices in London and Shanghai fell, creating a price gap that could encourage arbitrage trading. However, analysts caution that the tariff is likely to be implemented before most new shipments can reach the U.S., potentially weakening physical demand and creating downward price pressure on global markets. The exact timeline and potential exemptions for the tariff remain unclear.</p>
