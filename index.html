          <p>Rangers Football Club is in turmoil following a 1-0 Europa League defeat to Genk, marking their fourth loss in seven games under manager Russell Martin. Former players and pundits describe the team's performance as underwhelming and lacking belief, with calls for significant change. Martin's post-match comments, perceived as subdued and defensive, further fueled speculation about his future. The article highlights a reckless red card, scant creativity, and poor defending as contributing factors to the team's struggles, leaving fans disillusioned and demanding accountability.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on two charges: making false statements and obstruction of justice. The indictment stems from his September 2020 testimony to Congress regarding the authorization of classified information leaks to the media. Comey, a frequent target of President Trump's criticism, maintains his innocence and expressed confidence in the judicial system. This development comes after Trump publicly urged the Attorney General to investigate his political adversaries, including Comey.</p>

          <p>China employs a proactive, long-term economic planning strategy through its National Development and Reform Commission, with five-year plans guiding growth and reforms. This approach involves extensive consultation with academics and industry leaders, beginning work on the next plan as soon as one is approved. In stark contrast, the United States relies on market forces and faces significant challenges in economic guidance due to political polarization. The article highlights China's consistent focus on boosting prosperity and overhauling state-owned enterprises through its structured planning process.</p>

          <p>An independent report reveals that Los Angeles County's response to deadly wildfires in January was significantly hindered by a lack of resources and outdated emergency alert policies. The McChrystal Group's review identified critical staffing shortages, unreliable communication systems, and a convoluted evacuation notification process. Despite heroic efforts by first responders, evacuation orders were delayed, contributing to the loss of over 30 lives and thousands of homes. The article emphasizes the urgent need for clearer policies, improved training, and integrated communication tools to enhance public safety.</p>

          <p>Tensions in the South China Sea were downplayed as Manila warmly bid farewell to Beijing's envoy, Huang Xilian. Philippine President Marcos and Ambassador Huang agreed that maritime disputes should not define the broader relationship between the two nations. Both sides expressed hope for continued deepening of trade, people-to-people interactions, and cultural exchanges. The article notes that these remarks echo language used during Marcos's visit to China in January 2023, underscoring a shared desire to keep the relationship on track despite ongoing differences.</p>

          <p>UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is reportedly irritated by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's perceived challenge to the party's direction, comparing him to former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss. This internal friction comes as Starmer prepares to address a conference on how centre-left parties can counter the rise of Reform UK and similar insurgencies. The article highlights a persistent critique of the government's lack of clear definition, into which Burnham has stepped, suggesting a need for a more decisive and patriotic renewal in politics.</p>

          <p>British energy giant BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since April, leading to a quiet exit from the takeover spotlight.

Earlier in the year, BP was subject to intense speculation regarding potential acquisitions by rivals like Shell and Exxon Mobil.

          <p>Reform UK's newest MP, Danny Kruger, has denied plans for a 'pensioner deportation programme' under his party, despite proposals to scrap indefinite leave to remain status. Kruger clarified that long-term residents should apply for British citizenship, while new migrants would need visas tied to work and English proficiency. He insisted these changes are necessary due to the 'scale and speed' of immigration from Muslim countries, which he claims hinders cultural integration.

The artists reported the statue was damaged during removal and criticized the lack of 24-hour notice. The article highlights the ongoing debate about free speech and political satire in public spaces, with the NPS remaining silent on the denial's reasons.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning about a dramatic 460% surge in drug-resistant NDM-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (NDM-CRE) bacterial infections in the U.S. This 'superbug' can break down powerful antibiotics, making infections extremely difficult to treat and potentially increasing related deaths. While the exact cause is unknown, antibiotic use during the Covid-19 pandemic is a suspected factor. The article urges judicious antibiotic use and emphasizes hand hygiene to protect against this growing public health threat, especially for high-risk individuals in healthcare settings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is seen as a crucial test of President Trump's broader strategy for political retribution and his use of the justice system. The article suggests that while the charges against Comey are presented as accountability, Trump's public demands for prosecution raise concerns about weaponizing the Department of Justice. It argues this move is not just backward-looking but also a forward-looking plot to undermine the rule of law, influence future elections, and protect against accountability for his own actions. The implications extend beyond Comey, threatening fundamental democratic rights.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a presidential memorandum aimed at combating what he calls a radical left-wing 'domestic terror network,' fueling fears of a broad crackdown on political opponents. Trump suggested billionaire philanthropists like George Soros and Reid Hoffman could be targets, accusing 'wealthy people' of funding 'lunatics.' Critics, including the ACLU, denounce the move as a dangerous attempt to stigmatize activists and non-profits, warning that existing laws could be misused to target ideological opponents.

          <p>A California Senate Bill, inspired by an 8-month-old baby being woken up, aims to regulate excessively loud commercials on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video. The bill, introduced by Senator Tom Umberg, seeks to extend federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act protections, which currently only apply to traditional TV broadcasters, to streaming platforms. Given California's market influence, the legislation could effectively set a national standard if signed into law. The article highlights widespread consumer frustration with loud streaming ads and the entertainment industry's opposition, which cites practical challenges in controlling diverse ad sources.</p>
