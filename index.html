        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cautioned that if the Supreme Court rules against President Trump's tariff plan, the government would be compelled to issue enormous refunds, potentially totaling between $750 billion and $1 trillion. The administration is seeking an expedited ruling from the court to overturn a federal appeals court decision that found most of the tariffs illegal. While expressing confidence in a favorable Supreme Court outcome, officials are also preparing contingency plans, suggesting other legal authorities could be used to implement tariffs if the current ones are struck down. The uncertainty surrounding the ruling creates significant potential disruption for the U.S. Treasury and the businesses that have paid the duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Drew Barrymore revealed that her daughter demonstrated remarkable quick thinking during a serious e-bike accident in France. After suffering a severe injury that ripped her elbow open while mountain biking, the daughter used her own bra to create a makeshift tourniquet, an action that likely prevented a more severe outcome. Barrymore shared the story on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," expressing her amazement at her daughter's presence of mind during the frightening ordeal. The incident, which required days of emergency room visits, ultimately ended with the daughter making a full recovery, highlighting her resilience in a critical situation.</p>

          <p>California's Republican party members have found a unifying cause in their opposition to Proposition 50, a special election ballot measure championed by Governor Gavin Newsom to redraw the state's congressional districts. At their recent convention, party leaders and gubernatorial candidates emphasized that defeating this measure is their top priority, framing it as a power grab by Democrats. If passed, the proposition could result in the loss of up to five Republican seats in the U.S. House, potentially shifting control of Congress. The issue has energized the state's minority party, which is focusing its messaging on preventing Democrats from gaining more authority in Sacramento.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation at the University of Oxford, the concept of globalisation is far from dead; instead, it is alive and well, particularly in Asia. He asserts that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin suggests that globalisation is becoming more fragmented and regional, with its center of gravity shifting towards Asia as the U.S. partially withdraws. He also notes that while the benefits of interconnectedness are growing, so are the associated risks, such as pandemics, which are also a manifestation of a globalized world.

The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid showing disruptions related to his attendance. Trump, who watched the match from a luxury suite with administration officials, stayed for the award ceremony after Carlos Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner, marking a notable intersection of politics and sports.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his sixth Grand Slam title by defeating his rival Jannik Sinner in a compelling four-set final at the US Open. The Spanish player's dominant performance, particularly his strong serving, allowed him to reclaim the championship he first won in 2022 and regain the world number one ranking from Sinner. The match, which was delayed due to heightened security for President Trump's attendance, marked the third major final between the two players in 2025. At just 22 years old, Alcaraz is now the second-youngest man in the Open era to achieve six Grand Slam victories, underscoring his position at the top of men's tennis.</p>

          <p>The death of Charles Adair, a 50-year-old inmate at a Kansas detention center, has been officially ruled a homicide by authorities. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be complications from "mechanical asphyxia," which occurred after a struggle with sheriff's deputies who were attempting to return him to his cell. Adair was arrested on misdemeanor warrants and died one day later after becoming unresponsive while being restrained. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation has completed its inquiry and turned the findings over to the Wyandotte County prosecutor's office, which will now decide whether to file criminal charges against the staff involved.</p>

          <p>A California state bill aimed at establishing secure, overnight parking programs for homeless community college students is unlikely to pass before the legislative session ends. The proposed law, AB 90, sought to address the growing issue of students living in their vehicles by providing safe lots and access to facilities like bathrooms and showers. Despite data showing one in four community college students in the state has experienced homelessness, the bill stalled in committee due to significant financial concerns. Opponents, including the Los Angeles Community College District, cited estimated statewide implementation costs of up to $50 million and argued for focusing on connecting students with direct housing services instead.</p>

The striking event occurs when the Moon passes directly into the Earth's shadow, or umbra, causing it to take on a dramatic reddish-orange hue. This color is the result of sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere and scattering onto the lunar surface. The spectacle was visible in its totality across numerous countries, providing a visually stunning display for astronomers and casual sky-gazers alike.

Many local leaders and residents oppose the intervention, arguing it is an unnecessary and inflammatory action. Instead of calling for a military presence, church leaders like Rev.

          <p>The Formula 1 title fight between McLaren teammates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri remained amicable despite a potentially contentious situation at the Italian Grand Prix. A strategic pit stop decision, compounded by a slow stop for Norris, resulted in Piastri taking the lead against the team's intentions. McLaren promptly ordered the drivers to swap positions back, a request Piastri followed despite initial confusion. Team principal Andrea Stella defended the decision as consistent with McLaren's core principles of fairness, ensuring the driver who earned the position on track was not disadvantaged by a team error. The incident highlighted the team's unique culture and the drivers' mutual respect.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, firing over 800 drones and missiles across the country and striking the main government building in Kyiv for the first time. The attack killed at least four people, including a baby, and caused widespread damage. Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko confirmed the cabinet building's roof and upper floors were damaged. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the barrage as a deliberate crime intended to prolong the war, urging international partners to provide more air defense systems and increase pressure on Russia to halt the attacks.</p>

          <p>Kansas Senator Roger Marshall, a former OB-GYN, defended HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as a "disrupter" to the CDC, stating his goal is to increase transparency and restore public trust. In a television interview, Marshall argued that not every person needs every vaccine and that parents and doctors should be empowered to make individualized decisions. He expressed specific doubts about the necessity of the Hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. Marshall attributed current vaccine hesitancy to the CDC's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic rather than the actions of Secretary Kennedy, reflecting a broader Republican push for less centralized public health mandates.</p>

          <p>Major UK trade unions are warning the government against watering down its proposed Employment Rights Bill, a significant piece of legislation expected to become law soon. Union leaders, including Unison's general secretary, have voiced concerns that recent cabinet reshuffles, including the departure of Angela Rayner, signal a wavering commitment to the bill's full implementation. The legislation aims to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts and enhance protections against unfair dismissal. Business groups like the Federation of Small Businesses, however, see the political changes as an opportunity to amend the bill, which they argue is overwhelming for small employers.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached for the release and repatriation of approximately 300 South Korean nationals who were detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. The raid, which was the largest worksite enforcement action of President Trump's second term, had caused diplomatic strain between the two allied nations. South Korean officials expressed that the raid was lamentable, especially given recent efforts to boost economic cooperation and investment. Following negotiations between the two governments, the detained workers will be returned to South Korea on a chartered flight once administrative procedures are completed.</p>

          <p>International postal traffic to the United States has plummeted by more than 80% following the Trump administration's suspension of the "de minimis" trade exemption rule in late August. According to the Universal Postal Union, the change, which eliminated tariff exemptions for packages valued under $800, brought the flow of mail to a near standstill. The administration has defended the move as necessary to combat the import of counterfeit goods and illicit substances like fentanyl. In response to the disruption, at least 88 national postal operators have suspended some or all of their services to the U.S. until a solution is found. (not investment advice)</p>
