        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen discusses the Democratic party's strategy for the upcoming government funding deadline, advocating for a firm stance on restoring healthcare funding even if it risks a shutdown. He argues that the political fallout from such an event would be the responsibility of the Trump administration and congressional Republicans. The article also explores the senator's alarm over President Trump's response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, which he views as a dangerous weaponization of a tragedy that threatens civil liberties. Van Hollen believes Democrats must be more forceful in both opposing the administration and presenting their own positive vision for the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republican leaders have introduced a short-term spending bill designed to keep the government funded through November 21, thereby avoiding an immediate shutdown. This legislation maintains current funding levels while also allocating an additional $88 million for security enhancements for lawmakers, federal judges, and executive branch officials. The push for increased security funding is a direct response to the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The bill is expected to face significant opposition from Democrats, who are insisting that any extension must include renewed subsidies for the Affordable Care Act.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a detailed explanation of the "6-month rule" associated with reverse mortgages, which dictates a critical timeline for heirs after a borrower dies or permanently moves out of their home. Following such an event, lenders issue a "Due and Payable" notice, granting the family six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to satisfy the debt. The rule emphasizes the necessity of proactive estate planning for homeowners with reverse mortgages, as their heirs must be prepared to act decisively within this window to avoid potential foreclosure on the family property.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC Fed Survey reveals that a significant majority of economists, fund managers, and financial strategists believe President Trump's actions are a deliberate effort to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. Respondents overwhelmingly predict this political pressure will lead to negative economic consequences, including higher inflation, weaker growth, and increased unemployment in the near future. While the survey shows a strong consensus that the Fed will cut interest rates this week, there is substantial disagreement among the experts as to whether that is the correct policy decision for the nation's economy.

The visit's agenda includes traditional royal ceremonies at Windsor Castle and key diplomatic meetings, where topics such as trade deals and sanctions against Russia are expected to be discussed. U.S. officials have announced that the visit will feature the signing of over $10 billion in new energy and technology agreements.

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the U.K. is occurring at a politically sensitive time for both leaders, marked by internal divisions in Britain and recent controversy. The visit's timing is particularly awkward following Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision to fire his U.S. ambassador, Peter Mandelson, over newly revealed ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This development has brought renewed scrutiny to President Trump's own past association with Epstein. The trip also coincides with rising political polarization in the U.K., highlighted by recent far-right demonstrations, creating a complex diplomatic backdrop for the meetings between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the lifting of travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens that were imposed in 2021, signaling a warming of relations between Washington and Budapest. The previous restrictions, which limited the validity of travel authorizations under the Visa Waiver Program, were enacted due to security concerns over Hungary's policy of granting citizenship to individuals born abroad. Following steps taken by Hungary to address these vulnerabilities, the U.S. is restoring the standard two-year validity period for travel authorizations.

          <p>A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge has rejected the petition for a new trial filed by Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life sentences for the 1989 murder of their parents. The brothers' legal team argued that new evidence, including a letter from Erik detailing sexual abuse by their father and similar allegations from another individual, should warrant a retrial. However, the judge ruled that this additional evidence would not have altered the original trial's outcome, as the jury was already aware of the abuse allegations but still convicted them of planned, execution-style killings.

The court's decision stated there was no evidence presented of a broader desire to terrorize the public or inspire widespread fear, characterizing the crime as a heinous but targeted killing of a single individual.

While the commercial terms of a deal have reportedly been in place for months, the administration's hardline stance on a potential shutdown of the app's U.S. operations ultimately pushed the negotiations forward.

          <p>This article recounts Europe's dramatic and unexpected victory at the 1995 Ryder Cup held at Oak Hill in the United States, one of only four times Europe has won on American soil. Captain Bernard Gallacher's team was considered an underdog, facing a strong U.S. squad and dealing with internal selection controversies and injuries. Trailing 9-7 heading into the final day's singles matches, Europe mounted a stunning comeback. The victory was sealed in a tense final match where Irish rookie Philip Walton secured the winning point, leading to iconic celebrations and cementing the 1995 event as a classic in Ryder Cup history.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has commenced a long-anticipated major ground offensive in Gaza City, which it describes as the last significant stronghold of Hamas. The operation began with intense overnight airstrikes as troops advanced into the city's outskirts, forcing thousands more Palestinian civilians to flee south along a single designated coastal road. The assault has drawn sharp international condemnation, with critics warning of a deepening humanitarian catastrophe for the hundreds of thousands of people who remain in the city. Israeli officials maintain the operation is necessary to dismantle Hamas's military infrastructure and create conditions for the release of hostages.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz gave an emotional speech at the reopening of a historic synagogue in Munich, where he spoke about the resurgence of Jewish life in Germany while also addressing the current rise in antisemitism. Visibly moved, Merz condemned the Holocaust and expressed his personal shame over the fact that Jewish institutions in Germany still require police protection today. He highlighted a "new wave of antisemitism" on social media and in public spaces, partly attributing it to ideologies from the home countries of some recent immigrants. The speech comes as Germany's Central Council of Jews marks its 75th anniversary amid growing concerns for the community's safety.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the career of Robert Redford, who passed away at 89, arguing that his immense fame and classic good looks often overshadowed his subtle and masterful acting talent. While an icon of the New Hollywood era, his skill was in making the work look easy, often becoming most apparent in contrast with his dynamic co-stars or expansive settings. The article highlights his role as Bob Woodward in "All the President's Men" as a prime example of his process-driven, convincing performance. Redford's craft was not about grand gestures but about creating a genuine inner core for his characters that made them feel real and relatable.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and publisher Penguin Random House, alleging a coordinated campaign to damage his reputation ahead of the 2024 election. The suit claims that a series of articles and a book published by the defendants contained falsehoods and amounted to industrial-scale libel against a political opponent. A spokesperson for The New York Times called the lawsuit meritless and an attempt to stifle independent reporting, stating the organization will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. This legal action follows a similar $10 billion lawsuit Trump filed against The Wall Street Journal in July.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average mortgage rates recently dropping to their lowest point since October 2024, many homeowners are considering whether now is the right time to refinance. Experts suggest homeowners should evaluate their current interest rate, with those above 7% potentially benefiting most from refinancing in the current climate. Another key consideration is the immediate financial need; refinancing can lower monthly payments or allow homeowners to consolidate high-interest debt using their home's equity. While rates may continue to fall, financial advisors warn against trying to perfectly time the market, as the cost of waiting could outweigh the potential for future savings.

          <p>Public health experts are expressing alarm over plans by U.S. health officials to revisit recommendations for several vaccines, including those for COVID-19, measles, and hepatitis B. Critics fear the administration, led by HHS Secretary Robert F.

Experts argue this is a long-standing anti-vaccine tactic and that publicly available data does not support these claims.

          <p>Authorities have arrested a 71-year-old man, George Zinn, for allegedly obstructing justice by falsely confessing to the murder of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Immediately after the shooting at Utah Valley University, Zinn reportedly screamed, "I shot him – now shoot me," leading to his temporary detention and causing initial confusion. Police state that Zinn later admitted he was not the shooter and had made the false claim to draw attention away from the real killer and become a "martyr." Zinn also faces charges related to child abuse material allegedly found on his phone during the investigation.</p>

This development follows years of national security concerns and a law requiring its China-based parent company, ByteDance, to divest.

          <p>An independent commission of inquiry, established by the United Nations Human Rights Council, has concluded there are "reasonable grounds" to believe that Israeli authorities and security forces are committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

The commission also pointed to statements from Israeli officials as direct evidence of genocidal intent. Israel's Foreign Minister categorically rejected the report, calling it "fake" and based on falsehoods from Hamas, which he stated is the party that attempted genocide.</p>
