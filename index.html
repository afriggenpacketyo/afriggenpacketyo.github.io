          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth experienced a notable increase following CEO Barbara Humpton's confirmation of ongoing discussions with the Trump administration regarding the rare earth supply chain. These talks are part of a broader federal effort to bolster the domestic rare earth supply chain and lessen U.S. reliance on China for critical minerals. The administration has previously invested in other rare earth and lithium miners, underscoring its commitment to this strategic industry. Humpton highlighted that developing this marketplace will require many participants, as USA Rare Earth advances its mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma, contributing to national security and economic independence.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are seeing substantial returns from gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with holdings valued at US$21 billion, as the precious metal experiences a significant rally. Major financial institutions like Julius Baer, Lombard Odier, and JPMorgan Private Bank forecast continued price appreciation, with some predicting gold could reach US$4,000-$4,150 an ounce in the coming year. This upward trend is driven by gold's perceived value as a portfolio diversifier and a hedge against political and economic uncertainties, alongside robust central bank demand and worries about government debt. The article highlights how gold's strong performance contrasts with a declining US dollar, making it an attractive asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has approached nine prominent U.S. universities, including MIT and UPenn, urging them to sign a "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education" to secure preferred access to federal funding. This agreement outlines specific demands such as freezing tuition for five years, eliminating the use of sex and gender in admissions, and capping international student numbers. It also requires schools to address institutional units seen as antagonistic towards conservative viewpoints. While not mandatory, signing the compact would grant priority for federal grants and engagement, indicating a significant push by the Trump administration to align higher education with its policy objectives and exert influence over academic practices nationwide.</p>

          <p>An inquest into Paloma Shemirani's death, who eschewed chemotherapy for alternative treatments, has underscored the complex challenge of protecting children from parents holding extreme conspiracy theories. The coroner found Paloma was "highly influenced" by her mother's medical disinformation, raising critical questions about the line between child protection and parental rights. This article highlights the growing prevalence of anti-medicine conspiracy theories, exacerbated by social media, which medical professionals warn can have life-threatening consequences, such as a recent child death from measles due to vaccine skepticism. Legal intervention remains difficult due to high thresholds, prompting debate on potential law changes and social media's responsibility in combating misinformation.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates a prevailing sense of pessimism among U.S. adults concerning the national economy and job market, a sentiment that has remained negative for several years. The primary driver of this outlook is rising prices, which most Americans report experiencing and expect to continue. Over half of those surveyed view the job market unfavorably, and a majority anticipate challenges in securing desired employment. Additionally, the article highlights significant public apprehension regarding Artificial Intelligence, with many believing AI will have a net-negative effect on job availability across various sectors in the coming decade, underscoring broad concerns about future economic stability.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's leadership at the Pentagon is described as chaotic and unorthodox, marked by unusual fixations and a focus on visual moments rather than deep policy. A recent gathering of top military officers saw President Trump suggesting military deployment to U.S. cities, followed by Hegseth's vague remarks on military lethality. This article, based on a New York magazine piece, portrays Hegseth as lacking the experience of predecessors, surrounded by a personal entourage, and prone to impulse control issues, including past allegations of sexual assault and financial mismanagement.

Approximately 42% of Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X report having no disposable income after covering essential expenses, a significant increase since 1997. The report warns that this figure could exceed half of Americans by 2033 due to escalating costs of housing and healthcare. This article emphasizes that simply advising people to "save more" ignores the financial realities faced by many, leading to a "financial vortex" that puts retirement security out of reach for a growing segment of the population.

          <p>The Trump administration has secured a significant deal with Pfizer, compelling the pharmaceutical giant to lower the prices of its drugs in the United States to match those charged in other developed countries. This article details President Trump's long-standing obsession with reducing drug costs, a goal that previously eluded his administration. Pfizer also agreed to participate in TrumpRx, a new website offering discounted drugs directly to consumers, though the immediate financial relief for patients remains unclear. The deal, spurred by the administration's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs not manufactured in the U.S., marks a collapse of the industry's united front against Trump's "America First" pricing policies.

          <p>Police have named Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British man of Syrian descent, as the perpetrator of a deadly attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Manchester, which resulted in two fatalities and three injuries. The incident, classified as a "terrorist incident," unfolded on Yom Kippur when a vehicle was driven into worshippers, followed by a knife assault. Security personnel and Rabbi Daniel Walker are being hailed as heroes for their swift actions in preventing the attacker from gaining entry to the synagogue. Three suspects have since been apprehended in connection with the event, which Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer unequivocally condemned as an antisemitic act, vowing enhanced security for the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has openly embraced the current government shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity" to enact significant, potentially permanent reductions across federal agencies and programs deemed aligned with Democratic priorities. The article details Trump's plans to consult with OMB Director Russ Vought, known for his role in Project 2025, to identify targets for these cuts. This aggressive stance follows the administration's recent actions, including freezing $18 billion for major infrastructure projects in New York City and canceling $8 billion in climate-related initiatives in predominantly Democratic states. Critics contend these moves are politically motivated and represent an overreach of executive authority, aiming to punish opponents rather than address fiscal responsibility during the ongoing budgetary impasse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>College rankings, now an ingrained feature of the higher education landscape, originated as a controversial and "shocking experiment," as this article thoroughly explains. Early attempts, such as Edwin Embree's 1934 informal list and Kendric Babcock's 1911 study, were met with intense backlash and even suppression due to the contentious nature of categorizing institutional quality. The article traces the evolution of these lists from mere curiosities to a powerful "map of the American meritocracy" by the 1980s, fueled by growing consumer demand and institutional anxieties. It highlights how rankings, initially influenced by societal prejudices, have profoundly shaped public perception and continue to influence university strategies and operations today.</p>

Scholars are actively working to destigmatize Lucumí, which is often misunderstood and demonized as "witchcraft" due to anti-Black beliefs and its resistance to white supremacy. It explains how early rituals, adapted from forced Catholic gatherings, became spaces for reconnection and reimagination, underscoring the religion's core values of protection, healing, and community survival.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly called for his followers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions, alleging the platform promotes a "transgender woke agenda." This directive follows conservative criticism of Netflix's animated series "Dead End: Paranormal Park," which includes a transgender character, and alleged controversial remarks by its creator. Despite Musk's considerable social media influence, analysts interviewed in the article largely dismiss the likelihood of a significant impact on Netflix's subscriber figures or stock valuation. They point to the company's vast global subscriber base and strong ad revenue, suggesting any dip would be fleeting. Past boycotts, such as the one targeting Bud Light, are cited as examples, but this situation is anticipated to have a much smaller score.</p>
