          <p>After a three-day delay, the UN reports that 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected inside the Gaza Strip, marking the first significant influx after an 11-week blockade. The aid, including flour, baby food, and medical equipment, was distributed to bakeries and hot meal kitchens to address acute hunger levels. Humanitarian organizations continue to warn of severe food shortages affecting the 2.1 million residents, with reports of starvation-related deaths among children and the elderly. Despite the aid delivery, the UN emphasizes that the quantity is insufficient to meet the vast needs in Gaza, especially given the Israeli military's control of access routes.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Original Sin: President Bidenâ€™s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again," details concerns among President Biden's aides regarding his cognitive abilities, dating back to his 2020 campaign. The book recounts instances where Biden struggled with memory and communication, leading aides to "white-knuckle" through debate performances and shield him from tough interviews. The book also claims that the Biden family went to great lengths to downplay his son Beau's cancer diagnosis. A Biden spokesperson disputes the book's narrative, asserting that it fails to demonstrate any failure in Biden's job performance or a cover-up.</p>

          <p>Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit challenging a state law that regulates air pollution monitoring, arguing that it infringes on their rights to free speech and petition the government. The law imposes stringent requirements on community groups alleging environmental violations, including the use of federally-approved equipment and restrictions on data sharing. Critics argue the law effectively silences community groups and hinders their ability to take action against polluters in the industrial corridor known as Cancer Alley. The Louisiana Attorney General has vowed to defend the law, asserting it ensures accurate air quality information for the public.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation to shift control of the U.S. Marshals Service from the executive branch to the federal judiciary, aiming to safeguard judges from political interference and ensure robust security protections. This move comes amid concerns that the Trump administration's criticism of judges could compromise the Marshals' ability to provide impartial protection. The bill proposes creating a special board, including the Chief Justice of the United States, to oversee the Marshals, modeled after the structure of the U.S. Capitol Police.</p>

          <p>North Korea's attempt to launch its second navy destroyer in a month failed due to a "serious accident," prompting leader Kim Jong-un to denounce it as a criminal act caused by negligence. The ship lost balance during the launch, sustaining damage to its hull. Kim Jong-un has vowed to punish those responsible and ordered the destroyer to be restored by a Workersâ€™ Party meeting in June, framing the matter as a political issue related to the country's prestige. This article notes that South Korean analysts believe the ship was of the same class as one launched in April and built with Russian technology.</p>
