          <p>The U.S. Senate has started debating a major Republican legislative package that includes significant tax cuts and increased spending on immigration enforcement. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the bill is projected to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The CBO analysis also found that the legislation would result in 11.8 million more Americans losing their health insurance coverage by 2034. The bill's passage remains uncertain as it faces unified Democratic opposition and dissent from some fiscally conservative Republicans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Senator Thom Tillis's announcement that he will not seek re-election, former President Donald Trump celebrated the news and issued a warning to other Republicans. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, voted against advancing Trump's signature budget bill, citing its negative financial impact on his state. In response, Trump cautioned "cost-cutting Republicans" on his social media platform, reminding them of the need to be re-elected and suggesting that economic growth would offset any new debt. The interaction highlights the growing pressure on GOP lawmakers to align with the former president's legislative priorities.</p>

          <p>In the week following U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, descriptions of the attack's effectiveness have varied significantly among U.S. officials. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the sites were "obliterated," initial intelligence assessments from the Defense Intelligence Agency suggested the strikes only set back Iran's program by a few months. Officials later provided more nuanced details, acknowledging the difficulty in assessing damage to the deeply buried Fordo facility. The shifting narratives have sparked questions about the true extent of the damage and the ultimate goals of the military operation.</p>

          <p>Iran's deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, has stated that the United States must guarantee it will not conduct further military strikes before any diplomatic talks can resume. He indicated that while the Trump administration has signaled a desire for new negotiations through mediators, its position on ruling out future attacks during dialogue remains unclear. The demand follows a recent U.S. bombing raid on three Iranian nuclear sites. Takht-Ravanchi also insisted that Iran will not abandon its right to enrich uranium for what it maintains are peaceful purposes, calling a zero-enrichment demand "the law of the jungle."</p>

          <p>Brigham Young University quarterback Jake Retzlaff reportedly plans to enter the transfer portal after facing a seven-game suspension for an honor code violation. The suspension follows a civil lawsuit filed in May in which a woman accused Retzlaff of sexual assault. While Retzlaff denies the assault allegation, he acknowledged in a court filing that he had a consensual sexual encounter with his accuser. Engaging in premarital sex violates BYU's strict honor code, which applies to all students, and appears to be the basis for the university's disciplinary action against the quarterback.</p>

The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, faced significant bipartisan opposition from lawmakers concerned about the privatization of federal lands.

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek re-election, stating that independent, bipartisan thinkers have become an "endangered species" in Washington. His decision came a day after he voted against advancing President Trump's major budget bill, citing that its deep cuts to Medicaid would be "devastating" for his state. Trump had heavily criticized Tillis for his opposition and threatened to support a primary challenger against him. Tillis's retirement underscores the deep divisions within the Republican party and the political consequences for those who defy the former president's agenda.</p>

Her return is a significant boost for the Lionesses just days before their Euro 2025 opening match against France. James, who was a breakout star at the last World Cup, is considered a pivotal player for England's title defense. While she may not be ready for a full 90-minute match, her versatility and creative talent give manager Sarina Wiegman a powerful option as the team prepares for the highly anticipated tournament.</p>

          <p>This article provides an expert analysis on the complexities of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), using the recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as a case study. The author argues that initial, hastily leaked reports suggesting minimal damage were likely inaccurate, as a proper BDA takes significant time and integrates multiple intelligence sources. Considering the advanced precision munitions, sophisticated aircraft, and cumulative effects of a prior 12-day Israeli campaign, the author suggests the damage to Iran's nuclear program was likely severe and lasting. This contradicts the early, pessimistic media narratives that followed the strikes.</p>
