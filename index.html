          <p>ICE is implementing a nationwide initiative to arrest illegal immigrants leaving asylum hearings, targeting those in the U.S. for less than two years, with the goal of expediting deportations. This strategy aims to have immigration cases dropped so migrants can be placed in expedited removal proceedings, bypassing immigration judges. While DHS claims this enforces existing laws, critics argue it will deter migrants from attending hearings and targets those following legal processes. Some legal experts believe judges may cooperate, while others foresee challenges and potential court challenges to the new policy. The initiative is seen by some as a means to quickly boost apprehension numbers. Optimism score is a subjective measure of the potential impact of this policy.</p>

          <p>The NHS is calling for 200,000 new blood donors to address critically low supplies, particularly for O negative blood, which can be used for a majority of patients. The health service has faced challenges in maintaining blood stocks, even issuing an "amber alert" last year due to shortages impacting patient treatment. Officials emphasize the need to avoid a "red alert," which would severely compromise patient safety and potentially delay operations. There is a particular need for more black donors to help treat sickle cell disease, and the NHS is working to make donating more accessible. A successful recruitment drive would greatly stabilize blood supplies for patients in need.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new proclamation restricts entry to the U.S. for nationals from 12 countries, citing national security concerns and inadequate information sharing from those nations. The policy bans entry for all nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with limited exceptions. Additionally, stricter visa checks and restrictions will apply to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures as stimulus measures struggle to boost domestic consumption. The consumer price index decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, while factory-gate prices dropped by 3.3%, the steepest decline since July 2023. A price war in the automotive industry and falling property prices contribute to the downward pressure, prompting policymakers to urge companies to halt the price wars.

Ministers maintain the pay rise is the second above-inflation increase for NHS staff in the last 10 months.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) unexpected rate cut last week is expected to make the rupee more vulnerable to depreciation by pressuring foreign exchange forward premiums. The rupee has underperformed its Asian peers amid weak capital flows, and a narrowing interest rate differential with the U.S. Federal Reserve could exacerbate the issue. A drop in forward premiums makes the rupee less attractive for carry trades and may lead to increased hedging activity by importers. This could leave the rupee open to sharper depreciation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced their sharpest decline in over five years, dropping by 34.5% in May, as the effects of prohibitive tariffs took hold. Overall exports rose 4.8%, but the decline in U.S.-bound shipments significantly impacted growth, while imports from the U.S. also decreased. The drop in exports to the U.S. was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa. China's exports of rare earths also declined, reflecting tightened export controls amid trade negotiations with the Trump administration.</p>

The launches were preventative, and the Polish and allied warplanes returned to normal activity after the threat of Russian strikes diminished.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing an expansion of the ban on destructive bottom trawling across English waters, aiming to protect marine life and the seabed. The proposal would extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. The announcement coincides with a UN Ocean Conference in France and follows warnings about the destructive impact of bottom trawling. A 12-week consultation will seek views from the marine and fishing industry, with environmental groups supporting the extended ban.</p>
