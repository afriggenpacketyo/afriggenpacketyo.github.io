          <p>Former Harvard President Lawrence Summers asserts that President Trump is attempting to exert undue influence over universities, particularly Harvard, through financial pressure and demands regarding diversity policies and anti-Semitism. Summers describes Trump's tactics as "extortion," suggesting the president's goal is to undermine academic freedom and force universities into submission. He acknowledges Harvard's existing issues with anti-Semitism and political imbalance but argues that Trump's approach is not a genuine effort at reform. Summers also expresses concerns about the broader economic implications of Trump's policies, urging a more stable and predictable course.</p>

          <p>The White House clarified that President Trump's announcement regarding "Victory Day for World War I" on November 11 will be an additional proclamation and not a renaming of Veterans Day. The clarification came after Trump's initial social media post suggesting a full replacement, and also stating his intent to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II".

          <p>A new book reveals that Joe Biden's staff discussed the possibility of him taking a cognitive test before the 2024 election, but ultimately decided against it due to concerns it would raise further questions about his mental acuity. The book details that the discussion occurred in February 2024, months before Biden's poor debate performance against Donald Trump led to intense pressure for him to step down in favor of Kamala Harris. Harris subsequently lost the presidential election to Trump, resulting in the former reality TV star's second term.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists excavating the Basilica of St. Stephen in Rome discovered a deteriorated stone head depicting a Roman deity within the church's foundation. The statue head, featuring curly hair and a beard, is believed to be an ancient religious symbol predating the fifth-century basilica. The artifact will undergo documentation and restoration at the Central Institute for Restoration in Matera, with students involved in the process. The discovery is expected to enhance understanding of the historical and artistic context of the Appia Antica territory during the late antique period.</p>

          <p>The implementation of Trump administration tariffs is causing significant disruption at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, with a third of traffic grinding to a halt. The tariffs, particularly on goods from China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, are expected to negatively impact waterfront communities and related industries, such as warehousing and transportation. The port, which handles 40% of containerized imports into the country, is seen as a bellwether for the US economy. The article also notes potential retaliatory actions from Beijing and the projection of increased canceled ships due to the new tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Innocence Project (LAIP) claims to have uncovered new evidence that could exonerate Scott Peterson, who was convicted of murdering his pregnant wife Laci in 2004. The LAIP argues that suppressed and destroyed exculpatory evidence, including information about a burglary near the Peterson's home and witness statements, support the theory that Laci was abducted and killed by someone else. They also claim new research on fetal growth indicates Laci died after the prosecution's timeline, suggesting Peterson could not have been responsible. The re-examination of the case has been met with skepticism, but the LAIP maintains that the new evidence warrants a new trial.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the Trump administration's health and social policies, arguing they promote a form of "soft eugenics" by prioritizing personal responsibility for health while cutting social services. The author argues that figures like Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk advocate for policies that disproportionately harm vulnerable populations, based on the idea that only the strong should survive. Kennedy's emphasis on individual diet and lifestyle, combined with cuts to public health programs, is presented as an example of this trend. The article also criticizes Musk's focus on encouraging "smart" people to have more children while reducing support for families and children in need.</p>

          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a one-person adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray," now on Broadway, exploring the dangers of image obsession in the age of social media. The play uses smartphones and elaborate camerawork to highlight the gap between false perfection and reality, showing how the act of deception becomes a source of pleasure for Dorian. The article contrasts this adaptation with "Vanya," another one-person show, to examine the different ways we imagine ourselves as characters in the modern world, and when performing a persona becomes a perversion of truth.</p>

          <p>More than a dozen US government health-tracking programs have been eliminated due to layoffs and budget cuts, potentially hindering the ability to monitor and address public health issues. Programs tracking deaths, diseases, injuries, and violence have been affected, raising concerns among health experts about the lack of data for informed decision-making. The Trump administration's focus on emerging and infectious diseases has led to cuts in other areas, with some officials arguing that the changes will eliminate waste and improve the nation's health.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article details how the Trump administration has cut over $800 million in research funding for LGBTQ health, impacting studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections. The cuts are justified by claims that the research is based on "unscientific" categories and "amorphous equity objectives." Critics argue that these cuts create a hierarchy of patients and undermine efforts to address health disparities affecting LGBTQ individuals, while the administration asserts it is prioritizing evidence-based science.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the ethical responsibilities of scientists in a world increasingly shaped by technology, referencing a conversation between Werner Heisenberg and Friedrich von Weizsäcker after the bombing of Hiroshima. The authors argue that scientists have a duty to ensure their discoveries are used for good and to engage with the public and policymakers. They highlight ethical dilemmas posed by AI, biotechnology, advanced medical procedures, and climate change, and emphasize the need for scientific education and communication to inform public debate and policy decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite growing concerns about the destabilizing effects of President Trump's tariffs on the US economy, Republicans in Congress have taken steps to protect his trade policy. The White House issued a veto threat against a Senate resolution to repeal the tariffs, and the House of Representatives blocked consideration of the resolution. The vote took place against the backdrop of data showing a contraction in the US economy, which economists attribute to the tariffs. This shows a strong commitment to Trump's agenda within the Republican party.</p>
