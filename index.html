          <p>A 69-year-old woman, Nancy Pexton, has been charged with the murder of Jennifer Abbott, also 69, who was found stabbed in her Camden home.

          <p>A robotics lab at China's National University of Defence Technology has created a mosquito-sized drone designed for covert military operations. The microdrone, showcased on CCTV 7, features tiny wings and legs, making it suitable for information reconnaissance and special missions. The development of such small drones presents manufacturing challenges, requiring collaboration across multiple disciplines to fit sensors, power devices, and control circuits into a limited space. This innovation follows the trend of miniaturized UAVs, such as the Black Hornet, used by armed forces globally.</p>

          <p>Brendan Paul, a former Syracuse basketball player implicated as Sean "Diddy" Combs' alleged "drug mule," testified under immunity in Diddy's federal trial. Paul's testimony is potentially crucial for the government to establish predicate felonies related to racketeering charges against Combs. The trial has presented allegations of drug use, coercion, and sexual misconduct, with witnesses describing "freak off" parties involving drugs and escorts. Diddy's defense team is signaling a shift in strategy as prosecutors prepare to conclude their case, focusing on whether the alleged behavior meets the threshold for federal charges.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, falling by 2.7%, the largest monthly decline since December 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Supermarkets saw a "dismal" month, with reduced sales of alcohol and tobacco as consumers cut back on spending. Government borrowing also increased to Â£17.7bn, the second-highest level for May since 1993, reflecting rising expenditure. While sales volumes in the three months to May were up by 0.8%, economists suggest that the earlier economic growth may be slowing (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against proposed cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the rising welfare bill but argued that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit were not the right approach. The government's bill aims to tighten eligibility criteria for personal independence payments and reduce the sickness-related element of universal credit. Impact assessments suggest that 370,000 existing Pips claimants could lose out under the changes, potentially saving Â£1.7bn by 2029/30.</p>

          <p>A US appeals court ruled that President Donald Trump can maintain control over National Guard troops in Los Angeles, rejecting objections from California's governor. The court stated that Trump's failure to issue the federalization order directly through the Governor of California does not limit his authority to call up the National Guard. The ruling halts a lower court decision that ordered Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. Trump hailed the ruling as a "BIG WIN," while Newsom emphasized that the President's powers are not unlimited.</p>
