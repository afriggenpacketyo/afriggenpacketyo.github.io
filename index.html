        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spirit Airlines is preparing for significant operational changes to address its financial difficulties, having recently declared bankruptcy for the second time in under a year. CEO Dave Davis announced in a memo that the airline will cut its flight capacity by 25% in November to focus on its most profitable markets. This reduction in service will also lead to further job cuts, and the company is currently in negotiations with vendors, aircraft lessors, and union leaders to stabilize its footing. The carrier has been struggling with high costs and a failed acquisition by JetBlue, prompting these drastic measures to ensure its survival.</p>

          <p>This opinion article highlights the societal pressure on young people in China to follow traditional academic and career paths, often determined by a single high-stakes exam. It uses the story of Gong Sheng, a student who chose a culinary program over a more conventional academic route, as an example of a positive shift. The author argues that in the current economic climate, it is beneficial for society and families to support young individuals who pursue their passions, even if they are unconventional. The piece suggests that this growing trend indicates a greater certainty among Chinese youth about their personal goals and aspirations.</p>

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely following public and political backlash against comments made by the host regarding the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decision came after the FCC Chair suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk and Nexstar Media Group, a major affiliate, announced it would preempt the show. Kimmel had suggested in his monologue that the man accused of the shooting was aligned with the MAGA movement, sparking outrage. The suspension highlights the intense and polarized media environment surrounding the assassination, with several other media figures also facing professional consequences for their commentary.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative called "AI Fluency," which will require all undergraduate students to incorporate artificial intelligence lessons into their studies, regardless of their major. Starting with the class of 2029, all freshmen must take a course in generative AI and attend workshops on its real-world applications. The university aims to prepare its graduates for a job market where AI skills are increasingly in demand, citing a Brookings Institution analysis showing a 619% increase in such job listings over the last decade. The program is designed to teach students how to use AI effectively as a tool for brainstorming and organization without replacing critical thinking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in technology and real estate sectors, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. The Fed's anticipated quarter-point cut was framed as a "risk management" move, with indications of two more potential cuts by year-end. While the Nikkei rose, other Asia-Pacific markets had mixed reactions, and U.S. markets closed unevenly after a volatile session. The Bank of Japan is also beginning its policy meeting, where it is expected to maintain its current rates for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire daycare worker, who admitted to secretly adding the sleep aid melatonin to children's food, has been spared jail time in a plea deal. The 53-year-old woman pleaded guilty to reckless conduct and falsifying evidence and received a suspended sentence of up to seven years. As part of her sentence, she is barred from working in daycare, must perform 100 hours of community service, and is prohibited from having unsupervised contact with minors outside her family. The prosecutor noted that the case exposed a "blind spot" in state law, as endangering a child is not always treated as a felony.</p>

The company faced intense customer backlash after announcing a new, modern logo, which critics called "soulless" and a departure from its American identity. In a notable reversal, the company abandoned the rebrand and reinstated its original "Old Timer" logo, a move that CEO Julie Masino said was a direct response to customer feedback.

          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day through their diet of fermented fruit. Scientists from UC Berkeley measured the alcohol content in figs and plum-like fruits favored by the primates, finding it averaged around 0.3% by weight. While this low concentration prevents the chimps from becoming intoxicated, it exposes them to a steady dose of ethanol. The research provides direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in our primate ancestors' fruit-eating habits.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the California Budget and Policy Center, California's poverty rate remains the highest in the nation, tied with Louisiana at 17.7%. This figure reflects the situation in 2024, where approximately 7 million residents could not afford basic necessities. The report notes that poverty rates surged after the expiration of pandemic-era aid programs, such as the federal child tax credit, which had temporarily lowered the rate to a historic low in 2021. The authors describe poverty as a "policy choice" and warn that recent and proposed cuts to social safety net programs at both state and federal levels could worsen the situation.</p>

The trip is seen as an opportunity for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government to deepen economic ties, with billions in new tech investments already pledged by U.S. companies.

Newsom's team responded by pointing out that Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has issued an emergency order banning applications for new duplexes and lot splits in the Palisades burn zone.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut, a move that is unlikely to end President Trump's persistent pressure campaign against the central bank. Trump has publicly advocated for much deeper cuts and has escalated his criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed's decision is seen as a balanced response to consecutive weak jobs reports and the threat of inflation. The situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's attempt to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook and the recent appointment of Stephen Miran, who remains a member of the administration, to the Fed board, raising concerns about the institution's independence.

Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut this year. The decision comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve recently cut its own interest rates, while the European Central Bank chose to hold its rates steady, highlighting different economic pressures across major economies.
