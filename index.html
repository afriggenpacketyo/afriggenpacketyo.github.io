        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's program by only a few months, contrary to claims of complete obliteration. The assessment found that while entrances to some facilities were sealed, the underground enrichment infrastructure remained largely intact. The report, based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, estimates it could take Iran a few months to less than a year to resume work. The White House has disputed these findings, while some officials express concern that any residual nuclear capabilities could intensify Iran's determination to create a weapon. </p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in the U.K. and consumed a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The park reported that the bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were safely escorted to a secure building as a precaution. Keepers monitored the bears and used recall training to guide them back into their enclosure without intervention.

The committee emphasizes that households must benefit from the transition through lower bills and calls for cheaper electricity. While electric car sales are rising and prices are expected to equalize with petrol cars, heat pump sales remain below target despite government grants. The committee suggests reducing electricity costs by removing charges added to support renewable energy projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing insights into how new stars are born. By studying thousands of stars, researchers found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older stars. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but voiced frustration with both countries for violating the agreement shortly after it was announced. Israel accused Iran of launching missiles, while Trump expressed anger at Israel for conducting strikes on Iran just before the ceasefire was due to begin. After a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, bombardments appeared to cease. The conflict between Israel and Iran has resulted in at least 1,000 deaths over 12 days.</p>

These moves include expanding tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and considering allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan.
