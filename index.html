          <p>President Trump indicated he would consider pardoning Diddy, while also asserting that China has violated its trade agreement with the U.S., leading to stalled talks. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the trade discussions have hit a standstill. Concurrently, Trump's tariff policies faced legal challenges as federal courts ruled against his unilateral imposition of certain levies, though these tariffs remain in place pending appeal. Elon Musk is stepping down from his role as a "special government employee" but will continue to advise Trump unofficially, offering insights from his private sector expertise. Optimism around the U.S. economy remains cautiously optimistic given these developments. </p>

          <p>During a White House press event with President Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk avoided answering questions about a New York Times report alleging his drug use during Trump's campaign and family legal issues. When Fox News reporter Peter Doocy attempted to ask about the Times report, Musk interrupted, questioning the publication's credibility by referencing past reporting on the Russia-gate controversy. The New York Times had detailed Musk's alleged consumption of ketamine and other substances, raising concerns about his behavior during a period when he was increasingly involved in Trump's political circle. Musk's deflection underscores the ongoing scrutiny surrounding his personal life and its potential impact on his professional and political relationships.</p>

          <p>At a contentious town hall, Republican Senator Joni Ernst faced criticism over proposed Medicaid cuts in Trump's legislative agenda, with constituents expressing fears that these cuts would lead to fatalities. Ernst responded controversially by stating, "Well, we all are going to die," while attempting to reassure the audience that vulnerable individuals meeting Medicaid eligibility requirements would be protected. She argued that those with alternative benefit options should seek them elsewhere, freeing up resources for the truly eligible, but her explanations were met with skepticism and booing. The debate highlighted the ongoing tensions and concerns surrounding the proposed changes to Medicaid within the broader spending package being negotiated in Congress. </p>

          <p>President Trump is asserting his authority over tariff policies, dismissing the need for congressional approval despite legal challenges to his measures. After a U.S. trade court briefly halted his tariffs, Trump criticized the idea of requiring congressional approval, claiming it would undermine presidential power. While Republican leaders have largely deferred to Trump on other issues, his tariff policies have faced resistance, leading him to act independently. The legal battle may reach the Supreme Court, testing the "major questions doctrine" regarding presidential authority, as Democrats accuse Trump of acting like a monarch.</p>

          <p>Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo and Wheat Thins, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying its packaging designs to mislead customers into buying store-brand products.

Mondelez is seeking monetary damages and a court order to prevent Aldi from selling the allegedly infringing products.

          <p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is known for his pessimistic outlook on the economy, even as his bank achieves record profits. Despite his warnings of economic hurricanes and geopolitical turmoil, JPMorgan's performance has consistently surpassed rivals, leading to increased investor confidence. Some analysts suggest Dimon's cautious pronouncements may be a strategy to keep his management team focused on potential risks and prevent complacency, while others believe it's wiser for bankers to broadcast caution rather than optimism. Dimon's track record of economic predictions is not as strong as his leadership of the bank, yet his vigilance has helped JPMorgan navigate challenging times. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring gold prices in June, as the market experiences fluctuations amid economic uncertainty. The price of gold has recently dipped from a record high but remains significantly elevated, driven by its appeal as a safe-haven asset during inflationary periods. With upcoming inflation readings and Federal Reserve meetings, experts anticipate potential price spikes, encouraging investors to consider cost-effective strategies like fractional gold or dollar-cost averaging. While gold prices typically rise over time, investors should evaluate the market carefully and limit gold to a small portion of their overall portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large sinkhole formed near a construction site in Ventura, California, causing damage to an adjacent industrial property. The sinkhole swallowed a shed and two vehicles, prompting the area to be red-tagged due to safety concerns.

          <p>The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held international events in Poland and Hungary, highlighting the increasing alliance between the Trump White House and Europe's populist conservative movement. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n praised President Trump's first 100 days back in office, while Trump sent a video message praising OrbÃ¡n. The events featured prominent right-wing leaders, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged Poles to vote for a conservative presidential candidate. This expansion underscores the growing collaboration between American conservatives and their European counterparts, despite tensions between Trump and traditional European allies.</p>

          <p>Pride Toronto has lost major corporate sponsorships from Google and Home Depot, following the earlier departure of Nissan, Adidas, and Clorox, with organizers citing President Trump's campaign against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as the cause. The loss of these sponsorships poses operational challenges for the festival, which attracts millions of attendees annually, and organizers are worried about the celebration's future. Experts suggest that corporations are shying away from publicly supporting LGBTQ+ events due to the White House's condemnation of DEI efforts. The trend of sponsors withdrawing from Pride events is also affecting other cities, potentially requiring greater reliance on grassroots efforts to sustain these celebrations.</p>

          <p>The CDC has updated its guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for children, stating that those without underlying health conditions "may receive" the vaccine, shifting from a broader recommendation for all children. This change follows a directive from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who cited concerns about the risks of the vaccine outweighing the benefits for healthy children. The new guidance allows for "shared clinical decision-making" between parents and healthcare providers, while still broadly recommending vaccines for immunocompromised children and most adults. The changes have sparked debate among health experts and raised questions about the influence of political considerations on public health recommendations.</p>

Libya has been divided since 2014, with rival governments in the east and west, and the recent events highlight the ongoing power struggles and instability.

          <p>The search for Grant Hardin, dubbed the "Devil in the Ozarks," has been hampered by heavy rain, which washed away the bloodhound's scent. Hardin escaped from a medium-security prison in Arkansas, and the FBI is offering a reward for information leading to his arrest. Bloodhounds are known for their tracking abilities, but their effectiveness is limited by weather conditions, and Hardin has a troubled past in law enforcement, having previously served as a police chief before being convicted of murder. The escape has raised concerns among local residents, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
