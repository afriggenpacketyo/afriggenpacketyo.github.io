          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 14:42:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Synopsys, a semiconductor design software firm, retracted its full-year guidance, citing a letter from the U.S. Commerce Department imposing new restrictions on product sales in China. CEO Sassine Ghazi had previously downplayed reports of White House pressure to halt sales to Chinese clients. The company is assessing the potential impact of these restrictions on its business and financial condition, with China accounting for approximately 10% of Synopsys' quarterly revenue. Ghazi had noted a slowdown in China during the fiscal second quarter due to cumulative restrictions and macroeconomic conditions, with competition in China being fierce due to government policies favoring local companies. This article reflects potential instability in the market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 8-0 to limit the scope of environmental impact statements required for major infrastructure projects under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, stated that NEPA had been used excessively to hinder infrastructure development. The ruling arose from a case involving a proposed railway in Utah, where environmental groups argued that the impact study failed to consider downstream effects like oil spills and greenhouse gas emissions. The court's decision aims to expedite project approvals by focusing on direct impacts rather than broader, secondary consequences, with proponents claiming it will boost the economy by facilitating energy transport. Optimism is present due to the potential for faster economic development.</p>

The company is adapting to the evolving trade landscape, including a recent court ruling that struck down many of Trump's tariffs.

The World Health Organization recognized snakebite envenoming as a neglected tropical disease in 2017, but progress has been limited.

          <p>A new study indicates that a significant portion of the world's glaciers are destined to shrink substantially over the next several centuries, regardless of climate mitigation strategies. Even if global temperatures were to stabilize at current levels, glaciers outside of ice sheets would lose roughly one-third of their mass. However, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels could save twice as much ice compared to the current trajectory of 2.7 degrees Celsius. The study underscores the urgency of ambitious climate measures to preserve glacial ice and mitigate the risks of sea level rise, floods, and freshwater shortages.</p>

          <p>Boeing's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month, following a pause due to trade tensions. China has indicated its intention to accept deliveries, with the first shipments scheduled for June.

Ortberg also mentioned that the company plans to increase production of its 737 Max aircraft.</p>

Jim Cramer suggested that the sell-off might present a buying opportunity, disagreeing with the notion that Benioff is out of ideas.

          <p>Harvard University secured a temporary reprieve in its legal battle against the Trump administration's attempts to restrict international student enrollment. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the administration from revoking Harvard's certification to enroll foreign students. The Department of Homeland Security has given Harvard 30 days to demonstrate compliance with the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVP). The lawsuit raises questions about the government's authority to dictate university policies and whether the administration's actions are based on ideological differences.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a ruling in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, which limits the scope of environmental impact statements required for infrastructure projects. The case involved a proposed railroad line in Utah intended to transport crude oil. Justice Kavanaugh's opinion emphasized that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) imposes no substantive environmental obligations and instructed courts to defer to agency decisions. The ruling is expected to make it easier for developers to build large-scale projects by weakening NEPA, a law that has often been used to hinder development.</p>
