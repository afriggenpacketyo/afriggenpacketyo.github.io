          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who participated in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon she received from him. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes that accepting the pardon would legitimize what she sees as a false narrative surrounding the events of that day. She has enlisted the help of her Republican senator to formally reject the pardon and is critical of others who have embraced their pardons. Hemphill's stance contrasts with many other January 6th defendants who actively sought and celebrated their pardons. </p>

Many Australian actors are known for their ability to mask their accents and their down-to-earth personalities, contributing to their success in the industry. The remoteness of Australia allows actors to develop their skills without the constant scrutiny of Hollywood, fostering a unique creative environment. </p>

This partnership has led to devastating attacks on major companies, including MGM Resorts and Colonial Pipeline, highlighting the need for increased cybersecurity measures and international cooperation to combat ransomware. The Russian government's tolerance of cybercrime, as long as it doesn't target Russian entities, exacerbates the problem. </p>

          <p>Robots are transforming the world of sculpture, offering precision and speed that were previously unattainable. Companies like Robotor are using robots to carve marble with remarkable accuracy, but this technological shift has sparked debate among artists. Some traditional sculptors argue that only a human touch can bring out the true artistry in stone, while others embrace the new possibilities that robots offer. The use of robots in sculpture raises questions about the role of technology in art and the definition of artistry. </p>

          <p>Cuban intelligence operations continue to pose a significant threat to U.S. national security, with American secrets being bartered and sold to adversaries worldwide. Recent cases, such as Ambassador Victor Manuel Rocha's decades-long espionage and Ana Montes' 17 years as a Pentagon spy, demonstrate the sophistication and persistence of Cuban intelligence. Cuba's tradecraft relies heavily on human intelligence, and they are known to share or sell the information they gather to countries like Russia, China, and Iran. The ideological motivations of Cuban spies, rather than financial gain, make them particularly dangerous. </p>

          <p>Former President Bill Clinton has defended Joe Biden's cognitive health, dismissing claims of decline as unfounded. In an interview, Clinton stated that he found Biden to be 'on top of his briefs' and in 'good shape,' even after long talks. Clinton attributed the concerns about Biden's health to political motivations. The former president added that he didn't read a recent book alleging cognitive decline in Biden because he believes it is being used to blame Biden for Trump's reelection. </p>
