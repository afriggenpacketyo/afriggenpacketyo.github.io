          <p>Taiwanese officials have strongly condemned China for allegedly intimidating a medical evacuation flight with warplanes, labeling it an “irrational” act that jeopardized lives and undermined humanitarian operations. The Mainland Affairs Council described the incident as a new form of “aerial grey-zone harassment” designed to assert Beijing's jurisdiction over the Taiwan Strait and test Taiwan’s military responses. This provocation, seen as a disregard for human life and a challenge to universal values, prompts a demand for Beijing to immediately cease such actions. Military sources suggest the maneuver aims to probe Taiwan's reaction in areas west of the median line, where response options are limited.</p>

          <p>WCMX, or wheelchair motocross, is rapidly growing in popularity, particularly online, with athletes like Tomas Woods sharing their tricks and travels. Described as "BMX in a wheelchair," the sport involves performing stunts over 90 seconds, similar to skateboarding. Its global community is expanding, with the World Championships returning to Europe this month. Organizers are now aiming for WCMX to be included in the Paralympics by Brisbane 2032, with hopes for a test event at LA 2028. However, challenges remain, including the high cost of specialist wheelchairs and limited access to suitable skateparks in some regions.</p>

          <p>American companies operating in China are experiencing unprecedented pessimism regarding their five-year business outlook, according to a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. Only 41% of firms expressed optimism, a significant drop from 2021, marking a record low for the fourth consecutive year. This decline in confidence is primarily driven by escalating geopolitical uncertainties, intense competition from increasingly innovative Chinese counterparts, and a chronic economic slowdown. The waning sentiment among US firms reflects a broader trend of global investors pulling back, as evidenced by a 13.4% year-on-year fall in China's foreign direct investment.</p>

The restructuring will incur a one-off cost of 8 billion Danish kroner ($1.26 billion), leading the company to adjust its full-year operating profit growth forecast downwards to 4% to 10%.</p>

          <p>Europe's contentious 2035 ban on new diesel and gasoline car sales has re-emerged as a major debate at the IAA Mobility auto show in Munich. Over 150 electric vehicle industry leaders, including Volvo and Polestar, have signed an open letter urging the European Commission to uphold the zero-emission target, citing hundreds of billions in new investments. Conversely, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) and the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) argue the target is no longer feasible, calling for a recalibration to protect industrial competitiveness amid a "polycrisis." German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also criticized one-sided political commitments to specific technologies, adding to the pressure on EU policymakers ahead of crucial talks.</p>

          <p>Despite winning only two Premier League games since April, statistical analysis suggests Manchester United's underlying performances have been better than their results indicate. The article highlights that United has taken the most shots and faced the fewest shots among 17 ever-present teams in their last 10 games, second only to Manchester City in restricting opposition chances. The primary issue lies in inefficiency in both scoring and saving goals, with the team scoring seven fewer and conceding four more than historically expected from their chances. While tactical choices under Ruben Amorim are considered, a lack of confidence or bad luck are also potential factors for this underperformance.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has reportedly called on the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India. This demand is part of his strategy to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin into ending the war in Ukraine, a source familiar with discussions told the BBC. The proposal, made during a meeting with US and EU officials, risks further destabilizing global trade relations. Trump also plans to speak with Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon, expressing optimism about trade talks with India.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary court ruling blocking President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Trump sought to remove Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden, citing alleged mortgage fraud, a move widely seen as an effort to undermine the Fed's independence. US District Judge Jia Cobb found that Trump had not identified sufficient grounds related to Cook's conduct or job performance as a Board member to warrant her dismissal. This ruling allows Cook to continue in her role while her lawsuit proceeds, safeguarding the central bank's independence from political interference, a critical factor for market confidence.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly fell by 0.4% year-on-year in August, deepening deflationary concerns, while wholesale prices also remained in deflation. This decline, worse than economists' forecasts, was primarily driven by lower food prices, particularly pork, fresh vegetables, and fruits. Although core CPI saw a slight increase, economists suggest it reflects temporary factors rather than significant improvements in underlying supply-demand imbalances. The persistent deflation, now in its third year for producer prices, highlights sluggish domestic demand and weakening exports, prompting increased calls for Beijing to implement stronger fiscal support measures.

Since 2000, underweight rates have decreased, while obesity rates have nearly tripled, affecting some 391 million children. The report attributes this alarming trend primarily to unhealthy food environments, where ultra-processed and fast foods dominate children's diets.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the strike by citing the leaders' role in the October 7, 2023, attack and ongoing operations against Israel. The incident has raised concerns about diplomatic efforts and regional escalation, with the UN Secretary-General and European leaders also condemning the violation of Qatar's sovereignty. The attack underscores the volatile geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Two former Meta safety researchers have testified before a US Senate committee, alleging that the social media giant covered up potential harms to children from its virtual reality (VR) products. The whistleblowers claim Meta lawyers intervened to shape internal research and demanded the erasure of evidence regarding sexual assault risks, including on the popular children's game platform Roblox. One researcher specifically flagged that Roblox was allegedly being used by coordinated pedophile rings, where children were paid to perform sexual acts with in-app currency. Meta denies these allegations, stating that the claims are based on selectively leaked documents designed to craft a false narrative. This article highlights serious concerns about child safety on digital platforms.</p>

          <p>The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) delivered a confident 2-0 victory over a rotated Japan side, with goals from Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun. This improved performance lends credence to coach Mauricio Pochettino's strategy of using recent games for player evaluation ahead of the World Cup. The USMNT deployed a 3-4-2-1 formation, providing opportunities for less-frequent starters to showcase their potential contributions. While the team showed greater comfort and sustained pressure, some areas, like goalkeeper confidence and clinical finishing, still require refinement. The article suggests this win indicates a growing comfort and capability within the team.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned following widespread public outrage and violent clashes during Gen Z-led anti-corruption protests. The demonstrations, initially sparked by a now-repealed social media ban, escalated with thousands taking to the streets of Kathmandu, resulting in at least 22 deaths and nearly 200 injuries. Protesters, many identifying as Gen Z, voiced deep dissatisfaction with government corruption and perceived infringements on freedom of speech. The army chief has called for dialogue while deploying troops, but with no clear central leadership for the protests, the country faces significant political instability and an uncertain path forward.</p>

          <p>Michael James Pratt, the founder and owner of the GirlsDoPorn website, has been sentenced to 27 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion. Forty victims testified at his sentencing, detailing how they were lured with modeling promises but then coerced into performing sexual acts on camera, with threats of lawsuits and online exposure if they refused. Many victims, mostly aged 18-21 at the time, shared the profound, long-lasting trauma, including mental health struggles, social ostracization, and even suicide attempts. This sentencing brings a measure of justice to those who suffered severe sexual exploitation and abuse.</p>

However, legal submissions reveal intentions to divide the remaining wealth among loyal members, raising concerns that some alleged perpetrators, particularly former leaders, could be among the beneficiaries.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated the deal addresses his country's concerns but warned it would be terminated if UN sanctions are reimposed.

The author highlights the region's existing world-class sports facilities, such as the Universiade Sports Complex in Shenzhen and the Olympic Sports Centre in Macau, which are already equipped for major events. Furthermore, Hong Kong's iconic harbor could serve as a scenic backdrop for temporary venues for sports like triathlon and beach volleyball, minimizing the need for costly new permanent infrastructure.

The district, reliably Democratic, saw the issue of federal job cuts under President Trump as a dominant factor, affecting a significant portion of the community. Walkinshaw has also pledged to sign a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, an issue with bipartisan support among voters.
