          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reduced its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, marking the lowest level since August 2022 and exceeding market expectations. This move represents the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, which showed a 7.4% year-on-year expansion. However, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, reflecting a slowdown from the previous financial year's 9.2%. The RBI's decision also comes amid a downtrend in India's inflation, with the most recent reading for April at 3.16%, the lowest since July 2019. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman marks a significant moment for the party, as he was pivotal in its rise since the general election. Yusuf, a self-made millionaire, brought financial support, organizational skills, and a minority-ethnic presence to the party, helping to temper criticisms of racism. While Reform UK isn't solely reliant on Yusuf's money, his departure raises concerns about the party's ability to maintain its rapid growth and organizational infrastructure. The resignation highlights the challenge of hiring and retaining staff to turn Reform UK into an election-winning machine, something Nigel Farage has struggled with in the past.</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court has reversed a prior ruling that held former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) liable for damages related to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster. The court determined that the massive tsunami causing the disaster was not foreseeable by TEPCO's management at the time, thus overturning the 2022 decision that ordered the executives to pay approximately 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. This ruling hinged on whether the management's inaction on tsunami countermeasures was acceptable, given a 2008 estimate of a potential 15.7-meter tsunami hitting the plant. The lawyer for the shareholders has expressed intentions to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee for U.S. surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means, has faced scrutiny for criticizing conflicts of interest in the medical and food systems while simultaneously promoting health and wellness products for personal profit.

Some MPs, who previously supported or abstained, now believe the bill crosses "red lines" and lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent coercion.

This marks the second failed lunar landing attempt for ispace, with CEO Takeshi Hakamada apologizing for the unsuccessful mission but affirming the company's commitment to future lunar endeavors. The mission aimed to deploy a rover with a shovel to collect lunar dirt and place a Swedish artist's Moonhouse on the surface.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent behind bars, unlike adults in the justice system. In many states, time spent in juvenile detention doesn't count towards any incarceration they may face, adding months to their confinement. Experts argue this undermines the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile system and deprives youth of fundamental rights. The lack of time credit can have negative impacts on young people, hindering their education, employment prospects, and overall well-being.</p>
