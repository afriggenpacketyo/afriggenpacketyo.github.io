        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock fell 10% after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and provided a weaker-than-expected forecast for the upcoming fiscal year. The report follows a significant public backlash last month against a major rebrand, which included a modernized logo that removed its iconic "Old Timer" image. After intense criticism from customers and conservative voices, the company executed a complete reversal, reinstating its original branding and pausing restaurant remodels. The CEO stated the company has listened to its customers and is refocusing on enhancing the guest experience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama described the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a "horrific" tragedy, extending condolences while also criticizing the current political climate. Without naming President Trump directly, Obama suggested the White House is empowering extremist views and fueling a "political crisis of the sort that we haven’t seen before." The White House responded by calling Obama the "architect of modern political division," creating a sharp exchange between the current and former administrations over responsibility for the nation's polarized state.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters marched in central London to demonstrate against President Donald Trump's second state visit to the United Kingdom, organized by a coalition of over 50 unions and charities. Demonstrators carried signs with slogans such as "no to racism" and "no to Trump," voicing a wide range of grievances against the U.S. president's policies and character. The rally, which included speakers like former Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, aimed to send a message that Trump was not welcome in the UK. The Metropolitan Police estimated up to 5,000 people attended the largely peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>A report has revealed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once designated two different properties in New York and Massachusetts as his "principal residence" on the same day in 2007. This situation bears resemblance to the allegations of mortgage fraud President Trump has leveled against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in his attempt to remove her from office. Bessent had previously commented that if a Fed official committed mortgage fraud, it should be examined. However, mortgage experts and Bessent's attorney state that his filings were proper and disclosed to the lender, indicating no wrongdoing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The state visit of President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump to the UK has showcased a significant degree of "fashion diplomacy," with the attire of the royals and their guests drawing considerable attention. Melania Trump's choices included a dramatic wide-brimmed hat and a bold yellow gown, while the Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla wore outfits by British designers, seen as a diplomatic gesture. Stylists and royal experts noted the coordinated colors and specific designer choices as subtle messages of support and reflections of national identity. The elaborate clothing, from tiaras to tuxedos, underscored the pomp and pageantry of the formal event.</p>

          <p>Florida is set to execute David Pittman, a 63-year-old man convicted of the 1990 murders of his estranged wife's parents and sister, followed by arson. This marks the state's 12th execution in 2025, a record number under Governor Ron DeSantis, who has signed more death warrants this year than any predecessor. Pittman's final appeals, which centered on claims of intellectual disability that were apparent at the time of the crime, were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. The execution underscores a significant increase in the use of capital punishment in Florida this year.</p>

Kennedy has disputed this account, claiming Monarez was fired for admitting she was untrustworthy.

          <p>With U.S. household debt reaching record levels, many Americans are finding it impossible to keep up with payments, especially as credit card interest rates exceed 21%. For those whose debt obligations surpass their income, traditional budgeting is often insufficient. This article outlines several strategies for significant debt relief, including consolidating high-interest debts into a single loan with a lower rate to make payments more manageable. Other options discussed include negotiating debt settlements for less than the full amount owed, entering a structured debt management plan, or, as a last resort, filing for bankruptcy.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, setting the new range between 4% and 4.25% in response to a slowing labor market. This marks the first rate reduction since December 2024, with central bank officials signaling the possibility of two more cuts before the end of the year. The move reflects growing concerns about downside risks to employment, even as inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target.

          <p>A new study involving nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is linked to a reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, particularly for those with a prior history of the disease. The research found that patients who took a 500 mg supplement twice daily after their first skin cancer diagnosis had a 54% lower risk of developing another one. This finding reinforces earlier research and has led dermatologists to more strongly recommend the over-the-counter supplement as a secondary prevention measure.

          <p>The average cost of homeowners insurance in the U.S. has risen by nearly 70% in the last five years, with single-family homeowners now paying an average of $2,370 annually. This dramatic increase is attributed to a combination of factors, including the rising frequency of climate-related disasters like wildfires and hurricanes, surging home prices, and higher costs for construction materials. The soaring premiums are forcing some homeowners to switch insurers or consider forgoing coverage altogether, a risky decision that experts strongly advise against.

Economists suggest that business caution, driven by uncertainty over federal policies on taxes, tariffs, and immigration, is contributing to the hiring slump.

          <p>A 29-year-old man hiking alone in Yellowstone National Park sustained serious, though not life-threatening, injuries to his chest and arm after being attacked by a bear. The incident occurred on the Turbid Lake Trail in what officials are calling a "surprise encounter," during which the hiker deployed bear spray. Because the attack was not considered a result of unnatural behavior, the bear will not be captured or euthanized. This is the first reported bear attack in the park since 2021, and officials are reminding visitors to remain cautious in the backcountry.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Supervisor Joel Engardio has been recalled from office after championing a successful but controversial initiative to permanently close a two-mile stretch of the Great Highway to create a car-free park. While the measure passed citywide, it failed in his district, where many residents argued the closure negatively impacted their quality of life and traffic safety. In conceding, Engardio stood by his decision, predicting the Sunset Dunes park would become a beloved city feature. This marks the fifth recall of an elected official in San Francisco in four years, signaling a still-active and discontented electorate.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act, is gaining momentum in Congress with the goal of protecting seniors and other vulnerable adults from financial abuse. The legislation would empower financial institutions, including mutual funds, to temporarily delay transactions they suspect are part of a fraudulent scheme. This measure aims to address the estimated $28.3 billion lost annually by older adults to financial theft, which is often perpetrated by someone they know. The House version of the bill was unanimously approved by the Financial Services Committee, signaling strong cross-party support for enhancing protections against such crimes.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 to 2025 due to an issue with door trim pieces. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the trim on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is moving, creating a potential road hazard for other drivers. The issue is reportedly related to a vehicle assembly problem rather than a defective part. Dealers will inspect and replace the trim for free, and Chrysler has stated it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the flaw.</p>

          <p>Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino argued that despite public perception, concert tickets remain relatively underpriced compared to major sporting events, citing an average price of $72. Speaking at a conference, Rapino highlighted the post-pandemic boom in demand for live experiences and noted that touring has become the primary revenue source for artists. He emphasized that the economics of putting on a major tour, like Beyoncé's, are comparable to producing a Super Bowl every night.

          <p>World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has offered a surprisingly optimistic view of the trade disruptions caused by President Trump's unilateral tariffs. She framed the challenges as an opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and spur a new wave of "reglobalisation." Speaking at a WTO forum, she pushed back against claims that the organization is obsolete, noting that nearly three-quarters of global commerce still operates under its rules. Despite the escalating tariff battles, she argued that the current moment presents a chance to reform and strengthen the global trading system.</p>

          <p>A new report from Yale University researchers reveals that Russia is operating an extensive network of reeducation sites for Ukrainian children, which includes military training for some as young as eight. The investigation identified 210 locations across Russia and occupied territories where children are stripped of their Ukrainian identity and taught Russian patriotic narratives. At 19% of these sites, there is evidence of military instruction, including grenade throwing and drone manufacturing. The findings suggest a systematic effort to militarize Ukrainian youth, adding a disturbing dimension to the war crime charges Russia already faces for unlawful child deportations.</p>

          <p>As Bitcoin's value has surged nearly 100% over the past year, a growing number of Americans are adding cryptocurrency to their retirement accounts, but financial experts remain split on the wisdom of this strategy. Proponents point to the high potential returns, while critics highlight the extreme volatility and inherent risks, arguing it is unsuitable for long-term savings. Financial planners who are open to crypto in retirement generally recommend a very small allocation, typically no more than 5% of a portfolio. They stress that it is only appropriate for investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon. (not investment advice)</p>

The comments came after Kirby predicted that struggling discounter Spirit Airlines would go out of business and described Frontier as the "last man standing on a sinking ship."
