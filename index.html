          <p>Arch Manning, the highly-touted quarterback for the Texas Longhorns, experienced a challenging game against the Ohio State Buckeyes, leading to significant criticism on social media. Manning completed only 17 of his 30 passes and was intercepted once in the 14-7 loss, a stark contrast to the high expectations set for the top recruit. The performance was a notable setback in his limited college career, prompting questions about his readiness for high-pressure situations. Despite the tough outing, Texas has a series of more favorable matchups in the coming weeks, offering an opportunity for him to rebound.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid concerns of a potential deployment of federal agents by the Trump administration. The order directs city departments not to cooperate with federal enforcement actions that could violate civil liberties and urges federal agents to wear identifying information and refrain from using masks. Johnson stated the city will use all available legal tools to resist what he termed a potential "militarized activity." The White House dismissed the order as a "publicity stunt," escalating tensions between the city and the federal government.</p>

          <p>A temporary immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is being shut down following a judge's order, but not before generating significant controversy over its conditions. Families of detainees describe harrowing experiences, including allegations of inadequate medical care and difficulty accessing legal counsel. The facility became a symbol of the Trump administration's immigration policies, with conflicting reports from lawmakers about the internal environment. Despite the government's defense of the center, a lawsuit and judicial scrutiny have forced its closure, though similar temporary facilities are planned elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Verizon users throughout the United States reported significant cellular network outages, with many phones being restricted to "SOS mode" for several hours. The company acknowledged a "software issue" was impacting wireless service for some customers and stated that its engineers were actively working to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage were widespread, stretching from California to Florida, with tens of thousands of complaints logged on service tracking websites. This incident follows a similar large-scale outage the company experienced in October of the previous year, raising concerns about network reliability.</p>

          <p>An in-depth article explores the largely unregulated for-profit industry of "body brokers" in the United States, who acquire and sell donated human remains for medical research and training. The piece highlights cases where families, believing they were making an altruistic donation, later discovered their loved ones' bodies were dismembered and sold for profit with little dignity. While proponents argue these brokers fill a critical need for medical science that universities cannot meet, critics point to a lack of federal oversight that allows for exploitation and disrespect of the deceased. This legal gray area has turned the U.S. into a global exporter of human body parts.</p>

          <h2>First Week of School Attendance Critical in Preventing Chronic Absenteeism, UK Data Shows</h2>

          <p>New government data from England reveals a strong correlation between school attendance in the first week of the academic year and a student's likelihood of becoming persistently absent later on. According to the figures, 57% of pupils who missed any school during the first week went on to miss at least 10% of the school year, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat this trend, which has worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic. The data underscores the importance of establishing consistent attendance habits early in the term.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has decided not to run for reelection in 2026, according to a senior Republican official familiar with her plans. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran. Her departure will create an open seat, with Representative Ashley Hinson reportedly planning to announce her candidacy. Ernst's tenure included leadership roles within the Republican party, and her decision is expected to set off a competitive race in a state that has trended Republican in recent federal elections.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the possibility of the Trump administration sending military forces to Chicago, labeling such an action an "invasion." Pritzker stated that the administration has not communicated any official plans but suggested that secret preparations are underway for reasons beyond crime control, possibly to interfere with future elections. The governor's comments came in response to reports that the Pentagon is drafting plans for a National Guard deployment. The White House has criticized Pritzker's stance, escalating the conflict between state and federal authorities over issues of law enforcement and jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, presenting an ambitious, nearly two-and-a-half-hour epic. The film, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, is a project del Toro has dreamed of making for decades. Early reviews are divided; some critics have praised it as one of the director's finest works for its epic scale and artistry, while others found it visually impressive but lacking in substance. Del Toro emphasized his goal was to explore the central question of what it means to be human, creating a story about imperfect characters and the right to remain so.</p>

          <p>A series of on-court outbursts from top tennis players has marked this year's US Open, prompting analysis of the underlying causes. Incidents involving Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Jelena Ostapenko highlight a trend of heightened frustration and anger. Commentators and fellow players like Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff suggest a combination of factors, including the pressures of the final Grand Slam of a long season, fatigue, and the uniquely intense and vocal New York crowd. While some players involved have a history of volatility, the frequency of such events in New York suggests the environment amplifies existing tensions within the sport.</p>

The clock recently underwent a £55,000 restoration funded by the council, and many local residents expressed that they consider the sound to be unobtrusive background noise.</p>

          <p>Manchester United narrowly defeated Burnley 3-2, thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a crucial win for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the victory was overshadowed by persistent issues with the team's goalkeepers, as Altay Bayindir made a critical error leading to Burnley's second goal. This follows similar mistakes from United's keepers in previous matches, prompting Amorim to admit it is a difficult moment for them. The team also suffered injuries to key players Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount, adding to the challenges facing the club despite the dramatic last-minute victory.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on numerous countries, deeming the action an illegal use of presidential power. The court found that the power to impose such taxes resides exclusively with Congress, invalidating levies justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ruling, which the Trump administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, puts a significant portion of the president's trade agenda in jeopardy, though sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum remain unaffected.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines expert consensus on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that recommendations vary based on developmental stages. For children under three, the advice is to be nearly screen-free to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, limited and supervised screen time can be introduced, but it's crucial that it doesn't replace essential activities like physical play and social interaction. For adolescents, open communication is key, as monitoring becomes more difficult. Experts stress that content quality is more important than screen duration, and parents should model healthy media habits.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor and policy analyst Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his push to fire Governor Lisa Cook, could jeopardize the central bank's independence and harm the U.S. economy. Patterson argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, leading to negative long-term consequences like higher inflation, weaker stock market performance, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she cautions that the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately hurt consumption and economic stability.

This unique system features deep craters and vents that release cooler, hydrogen-rich fluids, believed to resemble the conditions on early Earth when life first began. The site supports a diverse ecosystem of deep-sea life, challenging previous assumptions about where such systems can form and offering new insights into abiogenesis. The discovery also highlights a potential new source for deep-sea hydrogen energy.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health. In an op-ed, Sanders condemned Kennedy's long-standing anti-vaccine stance and advocacy for conspiracy theories, which he argues are being implemented as dangerous policy. The call for resignation follows the firing of the CDC director and the subsequent resignation of four other top officials in protest. Sanders warned that Kennedy's actions represent a "full-blown war on science" that threatens to unravel decades of progress in combating preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK plan to continue their legal efforts to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that favored the government. The court overturned an injunction obtained by Epping Forest District Council, a decision seen as a potential precedent. However, some councils, including those controlled by Reform UK, stated they will press on with their own legal actions, primarily citing planning law violations and public safety concerns. The ruling has intensified the political debate over asylum accommodation, with protests and counter-protests occurring across the country.</p>

A local man discovered the fish "gasping for air" in a shrinking pool of water and, after receiving no immediate response from the environmental agency Natural Resources Wales (NRW), organized a community rescue effort. The group successfully moved salmon, trout, and other species to a nearby river. NRW later stated that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm than good, but the residents felt they had no choice but to act.</p>
