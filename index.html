        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey faces a federal indictment on two counts, including making false statements to Congress. Sources allege one charge stems from his 2020 testimony where he denied authorizing his associate, Daniel Richman, to leak information to the press regarding an FBI probe related to Hillary Clinton. The indictment asserts that Comey willfully misled the Senate Judiciary Committee, directly contradicting his sworn statements about not using anonymous sources for news reports. This legal action intensifies the ongoing political fallout from the investigations surrounding the 2016 presidential candidates, placing Comey's past conduct under judicial scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The coroner for Chelan County has stated that the cause and manner of death for Travis Decker may never be determined. Decker was the primary suspect in the killing of his three young daughters in Washington state earlier this year, which prompted a months-long manhunt. Only minimal skeletal remains were found, which were confirmed to be Decker's through DNA testing, leaving insufficient material for a traditional autopsy. The former soldier, who had extensive survival skills, was accused of binding and suffocating his daughters after failing to return them to their mother following a visit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The architectural and urban planning ideals long championed by King Charles are reportedly inspiring a new generation of towns set to be developed in England. Government officials have outlined plans for 12 new towns that will prioritize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" housing like terraces instead of high-rise buildings. This approach aligns with the King's philosophy, which once drew criticism but is now seen as mainstream, emphasizing community-focused design and harmony with the local environment. Proponents argue this shift moves away from car-centric, isolating designs toward creating more humane and connected living spaces.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a public health alert for Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce sold at Walmart due to possible listeria contamination. The alert is linked to a previous deadly outbreak tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals that killed four people. While no illnesses have been reported from the meatball product, testing found the same listeria strain in the pasta ingredient, prompting Walmart to remove the items from shelves. Consumers who purchased the affected meals, which have best-by dates through October 1, are urged to discard them or return them for a refund.</p>

          <p>The pro-life group 40 Days for Life is urging Florida's Attorney General to investigate Mayday Health, a nonprofit organization, for its billboard and boat-based advertisements promoting abortion pills. The group alleges the ads are deceptive and misleading by failing to disclose critical FDA safety warnings, such as risks of hemorrhage and infection associated with the medication. In a formal letter, they argue that the campaign violates Florida's deceptive advertising laws by omitting federally required safety protocols and potential legal risks for residents.

          <p>President Trump has announced a new series of tariffs scheduled to take effect on October 1, targeting a range of imported goods. The plan includes a 100% tariff on branded pharmaceutical drugs, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets, and 30% tariffs on both upholstered furniture and heavy trucks. The administration stated the tariffs are for national security and to protect domestic manufacturers from what it calls unfair foreign competition. However, this move could lead to significantly higher prices for consumers and increase costs for industries like homebuilding, raising concerns about its potential impact on inflation and the broader economy.

Research indicates that teen boys are significantly less comfortable than girls discussing their mental health, making such initiatives critical.

He has declared that history will not forgive Labour if they fail to vigorously oppose Reform's agenda, which he describes as detrimental to the nation. This sharpening of rhetoric comes as Starmer acknowledges that his party was too slow to address public concerns about illegal immigration, a key issue for Reform voters. The Prime Minister is positioning his government in direct opposition to Reform's rise, setting the stage for a contentious political fight ahead of the Labour Party Conference.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records pertaining to the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. The enduring mystery of what happened to Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, during their attempt to circumnavigate the globe has captivated the public for decades. This move follows a request from a lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands, citing theories that Earhart may have been taken into custody by the Japanese on the island of Saipan. While most historians believe she crashed in the Pacific Ocean after running out of fuel, the declassification aims to shed light on any classified government information about the incident.</p>

          <p>Southern California experienced a dramatic weather event as thousands of lightning strikes were recorded over a 48-hour period. The National Weather Service reported at least 2,000 strikes from the Channel Islands to the Central Coast, with most of the thunderstorm activity occurring over the Pacific Ocean. This unusual electrical storm is attributed to a slow-moving low-pressure system that has trapped moisture in the region. Forecasters anticipate that this system will bring the potential for more wet weather, including isolated showers and thunderstorms, to the area over the weekend, with the highest chances for rain in interior valleys and mountains.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements to Congress and obstruction of justice, though it rejected a third proposed charge. The indictment stems from his 2020 testimony before a Senate committee, where he denied having authorized leaks to the media regarding FBI investigations into Hillary Clinton. President Trump, a long-time critic of Comey, welcomed the indictment, while Comey maintained his innocence and stated he would not "live on his knees." The prosecution is being led by a newly appointed U.S. Attorney who previously served as Trump's personal lawyer, raising questions about political influence.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent member of the Black Liberation Army who has been a fugitive from the U.S. since 1979, has died in Cuba at the age of 78. Born Joanne Chesimard, she was convicted in 1977 for the murder of a New Jersey State Trooper but escaped from prison two years later and was granted political asylum by Fidel Castro. For decades, the U.S. government, which listed her as a "most wanted terrorist," demanded her extradition, making her a symbol of the tense relations between the two nations. Supporters viewed her as a political prisoner, and her writings became influential in modern racial justice movements.</p>

          <p>Following the UK's formal recognition of a Palestinian state, a group representing Palestinian families is urging the British government to apologize and provide reparations for alleged colonial-era war crimes. The petitioners submitted a 400-page legal document detailing abuses by UK forces during the British Mandate period from 1917 to 1948, including claims of torture, murder, and collective punishment. They argue that while statehood recognition is a welcome step, it does not resolve the historical injustices that continue to affect Palestinians today. The group hopes to build on past UK concessions for colonial-era actions in other parts of its former empire.</p>

          <p>Supporters of Proposition 50, a California ballot measure to redraw congressional districts, have raised significantly more funds than their opponents. The campaign backing the measure, led by Governor Gavin Newsom to aid Democrats in gaining House control, has amassed $77.5 million, dwarfing the $35.3 million raised by opposition groups. The proposition, if passed in the November special election, would replace the current districts drawn by an independent commission with new boundaries created by state lawmakers. This financial advantage suggests a heavy advertising push is forthcoming in what has become a high-stakes political battle over electoral maps.</p>

          <p>The upcoming APEC summit in South Korea is being viewed as a crucial stage for international diplomacy, particularly concerning tensions on the Korean peninsula. With both the U.S. and Chinese presidents expected to attend, the event could facilitate high-level talks, potentially including a summit between the U.S. and North Korea, with China and South Korea acting as mediators. This analysis comes after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's recent visit to China, which is seen as a strategic move to re-engage with multilateral diplomacy. The back-to-back hosting of APEC by South Korea and then China presents a unique opportunity to foster regional cooperation.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced that the Medals of Honor awarded to 20 U.S. soldiers for their roles in the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre will not be revoked. The decision finalizes a review ordered by his predecessor and halts efforts by lawmakers and Native American groups to rescind the honors, which they argue were given for participation in a massacre of hundreds of unarmed Lakota people. Hegseth stated that a review panel concluded the medals were justly awarded to "brave soldiers," a characterization that critics and historians contest. The move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to reinterpret controversial aspects of U.S. history.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the ideology behind the health policies of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the "Make America Healthy Again" movement. The analysis suggests that Kennedy's skepticism toward vaccines and modern pharmacology is rooted in a conservative form of nostalgia, which views the past as a purer, healthier time. This perspective gained significant traction on the right following the COVID-19 pandemic, which eroded public trust in institutions like the CDC. The article argues that this growing distrust of established medical expertise could have dangerous public health consequences, even beyond Kennedy's tenure.</p>

          <p>Sinclair and Nexstar, two of the largest owners of local TV stations, have announced they will resume broadcasting "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on their ABC affiliates. The companies had preempted the late-night show for nearly a week following controversial comments made by the host about a conservative activist's death. This decision followed a temporary suspension of the program by Disney's ABC network. The broadcasters stated their decision was independent of government influence and came after receiving feedback from viewers and community leaders, ending a standoff that had raised questions about free speech and media influence.</p>

The National Hurricane Center has not issued any coastal watches or warnings for the U.S. at this time, as the storm is forecast to continue moving northwest over open water.
