          <p>U.S. President Trump has publicly urged Turkish President Erdoğan to halt oil purchases from Russia to weaken Moscow's position in the ongoing war in Ukraine. During a White House meeting, Trump suggested this action would be "the best thing" for Turkey, while also expressing optimism about resolving ongoing issues related to US sanctions and the sale of F-35 fighter jets. Turkey was previously removed from the F-35 program after acquiring a Russian air defense system, and the meeting concluded without firm commitments on these key diplomatic points.</p>

          <p>Major streaming services, including Disney+ and Apple TV+, are implementing another round of price hikes, leading to growing frustration among consumers who initially sought streaming as a cheaper alternative to cable. Despite the financial strain, many viewers now consider these services essential, creating a standoff between companies leveraging this dependency and budget-conscious subscribers. The industry is evolving, with some experts predicting a return to bundled packages and new strategies to combat "serial churners" who frequently cancel and resubscribe to services.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a large and unusual gathering of numerous generals, admirals, and their staff to meet in Quantico, Virginia. The Pentagon confirmed the meeting will take place early next week but has not provided specific details about its agenda. U.S. officials noted that while meetings with senior military leaders occur regularly, a gathering of this size, convened in person and on such short notice, is highly uncommon and potentially unprecedented, signaling a matter of significant importance.</p>

          <p>President Trump is renewing his argument that the U.S. should regain control of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, emphasizing its strategic proximity to China's nuclear weapons development and testing sites. While experts note China's main manufacturing is deeper inland, a key test range is located about 1,200 miles from Bagram. The Taliban has rejected any plan to hand over the base, citing the 2020 Doha agreement, though Trump has suggested negotiations are possible, creating a complex diplomatic and military challenge for his administration.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has begun a gradual recovery of its operations after a cyberattack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT networks and production lines. While factories remain closed, the company has restored some financial and logistics systems, allowing it to process payments to suppliers and manage vehicle sales. The UK government is actively working on a support package for JLR's suppliers, many of whom face financial ruin due to the prolonged production halt, though no final plan has been agreed upon yet.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly made its support for Argentina contingent on the South American nation reducing its financial dependence on China. In recent meetings, U.S. officials explicitly requested that Buenos Aires scale back its reliance on an $18 billion credit line, or currency swap, with Beijing. Washington argues that this financial arrangement poses a long-term risk to Argentine sovereignty and provides China with an avenue to expand its regional influence, signaling a clear U.S. preference for the deal to be unwound.</p>

          <p>Two-time Emmy winner Billy Crudup reflects on his successful role as network executive Cory Ellison on "The Morning Show," a part he says he was not expecting at this stage of his career. Crudup discusses his journey from theater to film, where he intentionally avoided traditional leading man roles to pursue more complex characters. He credits a challenging one-man stage show, "Harry Clarke," with not only building his confidence but also catching the attention of Jennifer Aniston, who was instrumental in his casting for the popular series.</p>

          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy is set to become the first former French president to serve prison time after receiving a five-year sentence for criminal conspiracy in the "Libyan money" trial. The verdict has reignited fierce political divisions, with Sarkozy and his supporters claiming he is the victim of a judicial and media cabal, pointing to his acquittal on more serious charges. Conversely, opponents view the sentence as just accountability for a powerful political figure who has repeatedly faced accusations of corruption and illegal campaign funding.</p>

          <p>The FBI has determined that the suspect in the deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility engaged in a "high degree of pre-attack planning." Investigators found that the gunman, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, had downloaded a list of DHS facilities, researched ballistics, and used apps to track the presence of ICE agents. The attack, which killed one detainee and injured two others before the suspect took his own life, is being investigated amid a rise in political violence, with handwritten notes indicating a desire to instill terror in federal agents.</p>

The attack occurred on the popular Exit Glacier Trail, which was subsequently closed for assessment by wildlife officials and state troopers. The National Park Service advises visitors to give bears ample space and properly store food, noting that while defensive attacks are rare, individuals should play dead unless the bear continues its assault, at which point they should fight back.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is facing a significant backlash from fellow Labour Party members over his thinly veiled leadership ambitions. After Burnham criticized the current Labour government and claimed MPs were urging him to challenge Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a BBC survey of Labour MPs revealed little appetite for such a move. Many respondents expressed that a leadership contest would be damaging and self-indulgent, urging Burnham to focus on his mayoral duties rather than undermining the party's leadership during a difficult period.</p>

          <p>U.S. new vehicle sales have received an unexpected lift as consumers purchase cars sooner than planned due to fears of higher prices from potential tariffs and the expiration of EV tax credits. Cox Automotive has raised its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million vehicles, up from an earlier projection, attributing the strong demand to this pull-ahead effect. However, analysts caution that this sales pace is likely unsustainable and expect a slowdown in the fourth quarter and into the next year as policy changes take full effect.
