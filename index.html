          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement allowing colleges and universities to directly pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement, resolving three antitrust cases, permits schools to share up to $20.5 million annually with athletes and allocates $2.7 billion to former players denied revenue for years. Payouts will vary by sport and career length, with some football and basketball players potentially receiving nearly $135,000 each, and the highest estimated payout reaching nearly $2 million due to "Lost NIL Opportunities." The settlement also establishes a clearinghouse to ensure NIL deals exceeding $600 are valued at fair market rates. </p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. The indictment alleges his involvement in smuggling undocumented migrants into the U.S. between 2016 and earlier this year. Garcia's lawyer calls the charges "fantastical," arguing the administration is prosecuting him to justify the initial deportation. If convicted, Abrego Garcia will be deported to El Salvador after serving his sentence in the U.S.</p>

Sridhar emphasizes the need for collective responsibility in creating environments that support healthy living, advocating for policies that prioritize nutritious food, clean air, and preventive healthcare.
