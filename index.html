          <p>While meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump voiced his frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's continued aggression in Ukraine. Trump stated he was "very disappointed" after recent rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities, suggesting he will shorten the 50-day timeline he previously gave Russia to agree to a peace deal. The original deadline, issued in mid-July, was tied to a threat of severe tariffs on Russia. The president did not specify the new, shorter timeline but indicated he felt he already knew Russia's response.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Donald Trump responded with "I don't know" when asked if he believed Israel's claim that there is no starvation crisis in Gaza. However, Trump immediately referenced television images showing hungry children, noting that the U.S. and other nations are providing significant aid. Starmer interjected, calling the situation a humanitarian "catastrophe." The discussion occurred as the Hamas-run Health Ministry reported 14 new malnutrition deaths, highlighting the severe and ongoing crisis in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following five days of intense fighting that resulted in at least 33 deaths, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The agreement was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who mediated the talks after pressure from the U.S. government, which linked future tariff negotiations to the cessation of hostilities. Tensions had escalated over a long-standing border dispute, leading to military confrontations and the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians. Both nations have pledged to honor the ceasefire and work towards de-escalation, though deep mistrust remains.</p>

          <p>Roy Cooper, the popular former two-term Democratic governor of North Carolina, has officially announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. He will seek the seat being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis in the 2026 midterm elections. Cooper's entry is considered a significant boost for Democrats' hopes of flipping the Republican-held seat and narrowing the GOP's majority in the Senate. He is expected to face Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley, who has received a strong endorsement from Donald Trump, setting the stage for a highly competitive and expensive race.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a significant trade deal with the European Union following a meeting with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen at his Scottish golf resort. The framework agreement sets a 15% tariff rate for most EU imports, including vehicles, averting a potential trade war where Trump had threatened a 30% blanket tariff. In return, the EU has agreed to purchase substantial amounts of U.S. military hardware and energy, and to increase investment in the U.S. The deal also opens all 27 EU nations to American products with zero tariffs, aiming to bring stability to the $2 trillion annual trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Recent trade agreements between the United States and several Southeast Asian nations, including Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, are causing analysts to question the potential impact on European Union exports. These countries have agreed to lower their tariffs on U.S. goods to nearly zero in exchange for reduced U.S. tariffs on their own exports. While this could put some EU products at a disadvantage, some experts believe it may pressure Southeast Asian countries to offer similar favorable terms to the EU. The deals come as the U.S. and EU also finalized their own trade framework, setting a 15% tariff on EU goods.</p>

Z.ai claims the model requires only eight of Nvidia's H20 chips, which were specifically designed for the Chinese market under U.S. export controls.

He cites examples from global conflicts and domestic U.S. policies, asserting that such abuses of power erode civility and threaten the social fabric. Reich contends that living a moral life in this era requires active, collective resistance against brutality and injustice. He calls for holding the powerful accountable, protecting the vulnerable, and organizing to restore decency, framing it not as a political issue but as a fundamental moral imperative for civilization.</p>

Despite immense pressure and early setbacks, Gill's defiant batting performance, which included a century, was instrumental in securing a draw and preventing an English series victory. The author suggests this display of grit and leadership, in his first tour as captain and without several veteran players, could be a formative experience for the 25-year-old. While noting some tactical areas for improvement, the piece praises Gill's character and suggests he has the potential to lead the next generation of Indian cricketers effectively.</p>

These observations were made possible by detecting the infrared light emitted when radiation from the event heats the surrounding dust. The study provides new evidence that so-called "dormant" black holes are more active than previously thought, occasionally feeding on passing stars. This new method opens up possibilities for studying a greater number of these rare events and gaining a better understanding of black holes and their galactic environments.</p>

          <p>The California horse racing industry's effort to introduce Historical Horse Racing (HHR) machines to bolster purses is facing significant obstacles, primarily from the state's powerful Indigenous tribes who hold exclusive rights to slot machine-style gaming. A recent ruling by the state's Attorney General against daily fantasy sweepstakes has reinforced the tribes' strong legal position. Industry leaders see HHR revenue as essential for survival amid declining national interest, but tribal leaders view it as an encroachment on their exclusivity and express skepticism that it can save the struggling sport.

          <p>In the second quarter, Huawei reclaimed its position as the top smartphone seller in China, shipping 12.2 million units for an 18% market share. This marks a significant comeback for the company, which has been hampered by U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, Apple also saw a positive turn, with its shipments growing 4% year-over-year to 10.1 million units, marking its first growth in China since late 2023. Apple's rebound is attributed to strategic price adjustments and discounts on its iPhone 16 series, a welcome sign for investors concerned about the company's performance in the highly competitive Chinese market.</p>

          <p>The newly announced trade deal between the United States and the European Union has drawn sharp criticism from France, with Prime Minister François Bayrou calling it a "dark day" for Europe and an act of "submission." The agreement, which imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., was finalized at Donald Trump's golf resort in Scotland. While it averts the threat of a higher 30% tariff, European business leaders and politicians are concerned that it puts EU exporters at a significant disadvantage compared to the previous, much lower tariff rates, with key sectors like steel still facing uncertainty.</p>

The deal brought initial relief to markets, but it has exposed divisions within the EU. German carmakers face billions in costs despite the tariff being lower than threatened, while U.S. carmakers could benefit from lower EU tariffs on their own exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This advice column explores the philosophy of Ruth Chang to help with difficult life decisions, such as choosing between a high-paying corporate job and morally fulfilling but lower-paying nonprofit work. Chang argues that hard choices are not hard because one option is secretly better, but because the options are "on a par"—they are in the same league of value but offer different kinds of value. In these moments, external reasons run out, and individuals must exercise their own power to create reasons for themselves. By making a committed choice, one actively defines the kind of person they want to be.</p>

In contrast, the moon will be much dimmer for the peak of two other showers, the Southern Delta Aquariids and the Alpha Capricornids, on the night of July 29-30. Together, these two events could produce 20 to 30 meteors per hour under dark skies, offering a better viewing opportunity.</p>
