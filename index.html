          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Sébastien Lecornu, the former armed forces minister, as the new prime minister following the ousting of his predecessor in a confidence vote. Lecornu's immediate task is to navigate the passage of a contentious, cost-cutting budget through a parliament where Macron's party lacks a majority. The appointment comes as France grapples with a spiraling public debt of €3.3 trillion. Lecornu's leadership is already facing condemnation from both left and right-wing political factions, indicating a challenging tenure ahead as the nation also prepares for widespread anti-government protests.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers are evaluating the strategic benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). Short-term CDs currently offer higher rates and greater flexibility for reinvestment as market conditions evolve. In contrast, long-term CDs provide an opportunity to lock in the current, relatively high rates for an extended period, shielding savings from subsequent rate reductions. The article suggests a "CD ladder" strategy, diversifying funds across multiple CDs with varied maturity dates, as a balanced approach to maximize returns while retaining liquidity.

          <p>A new report from the National Assessment of Education Progress, known as the Nation's Report Card, indicates that U.S. high school students' proficiency in reading and math has fallen to historic lows. The post-pandemic data shows that nearly half of high school seniors are testing below basic levels in these subjects, a trend Education Secretary Linda McMahon described as "devastating." The report also highlighted a significant increase in student absenteeism since the pandemic. These findings raise serious concerns among educators and policymakers about the state of the American education system and the widening achievement gap.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it will suspend its nationwide restaurant remodeling plans, following significant customer backlash against its recent brand overhaul. This decision comes shortly after the company reverted to its classic logo due to public outcry that contributed to a substantial drop in its stock value. The company stated that the planned modernizations did not align with what customers love about the brand's "Old Country Store" feel. This move reflects the company's attempt to listen to its customer base and stabilize its brand image amid recent financial performance struggles.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley has officially launched his campaign for Governor of Wisconsin, positioning himself as a Democratic candidate ready to challenge the influence of former President Donald Trump. In his announcement, Crowley criticized Trump for bringing "chaos and cruelty" and argued that Republican policies are attacking Wisconsin's core values of community and fairness. His entry into the race follows the decision by current Democratic Governor Tony Evers not to seek a third term.

          <p>A verdict is expected in the Düsseldorf trial of Issa Al H., a Syrian national charged with murder and terrorism for a deadly knife attack at a Solingen street festival in August 2024. The defendant, who has confessed to the crime, is accused of killing three people and injuring ten in an attack claimed by the "Islamic State" (IS). The case has highlighted significant political issues in Germany, including bureaucratic failures that prevented the attacker's deportation as a rejected asylum seeker. The incident has intensified the national debate on migration, asylum policies, and internal security measures.</p>

Attorney General Dana Nessel condemned the decision, stating the evidence of their knowledge and intent was clear.

          <p>When filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, federal law mandates the disclosure of every single debt, without exception. This comprehensive requirement ensures transparency and allows the legal process to provide a complete financial fresh start. Filers must list all obligations, including credit cards, medical bills, personal loans, and even money owed to family members. Omitting a debt, whether intentionally or accidentally, can have severe consequences, such as the debt not being discharged or even facing accusations of bankruptcy fraud.

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics has significantly revised U.S. job growth figures, revealing that the economy added approximately 1.2 million fewer jobs over the past 16 months than previously reported. This substantial downward revision suggests the labor market is much weaker than realized, intensifying pressure on the Federal Reserve to implement interest rate cuts. Economists suggest that had this data been available earlier, monetary policy would already be looser, with some now arguing for a half-percentage-point cut. The report has fueled criticism from the White House, which reiterated its call for immediate rate reductions to stimulate the wobbling economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Dimon, a highly regarded voice on economic matters, remarked, "I think the economy is weakening," though he was uncertain if it would lead to a full recession.

          <p>The U.S. manufacturing industry has shed 42,000 jobs since April, with a total decline of 33,000 jobs so far in 2025, according to a new analysis of government labor data. A report from the Center for American Progress attributes this downturn to economic uncertainty fueled by the Trump administration's tariffs and hardline immigration policies. Companies like John Deere have cited hundreds of millions in tariff-related costs and have announced layoffs. This contraction in manufacturing employment, particularly in durable goods, contributes to a broader slowdown in national hiring and signals growing stress within the industrial sector.

          <p>Police in Los Angeles discovered a decomposing human body inside the trunk of a Tesla registered to the singer D4vd. The vehicle had been impounded at a Hollywood tow yard after being reported as missing, and authorities were called to investigate a foul odor emanating from it. Investigators believe the body, which was found in a plastic bag, had been in the trunk for approximately five days before the car was towed. The identity of the deceased and the cause of death have not yet been released, and the investigation is ongoing. D4vd is currently on a concert tour.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declined to comment further on a letter he allegedly signed for Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday book in 2003, dismissing the matter as a "dead issue." The message was part of documents released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating Epstein's network. The White House has consistently denied the authenticity of the note and its signature, calling it "fake" and pursuing a defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal for its initial reporting. Committee Chairman James Comer stated the investigation is ongoing and expects to receive more documents to provide accountability for victims.</p>

          <p>Bulgaria's defense industry has become a crucial source of weapons and ammunition for Ukraine, initially providing Soviet-era equipment that Ukrainian forces could readily use. These deliveries were once kept secret due to fears of Russian sabotage but are now openly discussed as Bulgaria prepares to produce a significant portion of the artillery shells promised by the EU. German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall is investing €1 billion in a new joint venture in Bulgaria to produce NATO-standard 155-mm shells. This strategic shift marks a significant development for Bulgaria's arms industry and its contribution to Ukraine's defense efforts.</p>

          <p>More than 1,000 former UFC fighters are set to receive substantial payments this month from a $375 million settlement of a class-action antitrust lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed in 2014, accused UFC's parent company, Zuffa, of using monopolistic practices to suppress fighter pay. With a 97% participation rate from eligible class members, the net fund of over $251 million will be distributed based on a formula combining total compensation and the number of bouts fought. Payouts will range from approximately $16,000 to a high of $10.3 million, marking a landmark, life-changing victory for the fighters involved.</p>

He asserted that California remains strong and "fully committed to defending democracy," highlighting the state's resilience in disaster response, clean energy investments, and economic power despite federal opposition.</p>

          <p>In an advice column, a 26-year-old reader expresses concern about her inability to feel a romantic "spark" despite intentionally dating for three years to find a long-term partner. She describes meeting nice men but feeling no excitement, leading her to wonder if her expectations are unrealistic or if she is emotionally blocked. The columnist, James Parker, suggests that her highly rational and controlled approach to dating may be stifling the unpredictable nature of attraction. He advises her to become more available to the unlikely and less regulated, implying that her past emotional tumult may have led her to over-correct with caution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Labor Department has issued a significant downward revision to its jobs data, indicating that 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the year leading up to March 2025 than initially reported. This preliminary benchmark revision is one of the largest on record and suggests the labor market and income growth were on much shakier footing than previously understood. The largest markdowns were in the leisure, hospitality, and retail sectors. The report adds to growing evidence of a weakening economy and has intensified calls from the White House for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
