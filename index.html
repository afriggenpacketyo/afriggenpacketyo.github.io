          <p>Recent developments from the Trump administration include the president's public rejection of a potential deal with Senate Democrats to advance his nominees, which he called "embarrassing." Concurrently, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel has opened a Hatch Act investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith, following a referral from Senator Tom Cotton. The administration also faced criticism for firing Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a disappointing jobs report, a move her predecessor condemned as a "dangerous precedent" that undermines the credibility of federal economic data.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, upholding a lower court's finding that the Trump administration's operations appeared to unconstitutionally target individuals based on race or speaking Spanish. The ruling affirms that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone and cannot base arrests solely on factors like ethnicity or location. Pro-immigrant advocates praised the decision for protecting constitutional rights, while the Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, stating that its enforcement actions target individuals based on their illegal status, not their race.</p>

The claims were detailed in a legal submission from a former contestant and were said to be widely discussed among the show's cast and crew. In response, the corporation stated it has clear protocols for handling serious complaints and has appointed an external law firm to assist with the probe. This follows a year of other controversies and new welfare measures being implemented for the long-running program.</p>

The incident was triggered by a seismic event earlier in the week, which also resulted in another fatality outside the mine. Over 100 rescue workers are continuing the search for the four other missing miners at the state-owned Codelco facility, one of the world's largest copper mines. President Gabriel Boric met with the families of those trapped, assuring them that all necessary resources are being deployed in the ongoing rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, along with MP Zarah Sultana, is establishing a new left-wing political party but has yet to decide on a name, opting instead to involve supporters in the process. The currently unnamed party has reportedly attracted over 600,000 registered supporters, who are being asked to help define its platform and identity. Before it can field candidates, the party must register an official name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. This unconventional approach aims to build a grassroots movement from the ground up, emphasizing supporter engagement.</p>

          <p>The increasing frequency of landslides in the Swiss Alps, exacerbated by climate change, is forcing a difficult debate over the future of mountain villages. Following a recent disaster that destroyed the village of Blatten, questions are being raised about the high cost of rebuilding and protecting communities in high-risk areas. Scientists warn that thawing permafrost and shrinking glaciers are destabilizing mountains, making catastrophic events more unpredictable. While these villages are integral to Swiss national identity and culture, the financial and safety challenges are prompting a national conversation about potentially relocating some communities.</p>

His stepfather's death at age 54 made him realize he did not want to spend his life in a job he was not passionate about.

          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus named Winston, a diplomatic gift to Winston Churchill from Australia during World War II, died during its voyage to England. While wartime myth blamed the animal's death on shock from a nearby Nazi submarine attack, newly analyzed records suggest a more mundane cause. Archival logs of water and air temperatures on the ship indicate that the platypus was exposed to prolonged heat as it crossed the equator. This, combined with potentially reduced food rations, would have been enough to kill the sensitive creature, debunking the more dramatic wartime tale.</p>

          <p>The viral popularity of Labubu dolls on TikTok has created a lucrative market for criminals producing dangerous counterfeit versions. Trading Standards officers recently seized thousands of fake dolls from a London location, which were found to have easily detachable parts that pose a serious choking hazard for children. Authorities warn that these fakes, often sold at a fraction of the price of genuine products, are made with cheap, unregulated materials and can contain toxic chemicals. The high demand and scalpers buying genuine dolls in bulk have made it difficult for consumers to find authentic products.</p>

          <p>Protests held by anti-migrant groups outside hotels used to house asylum seekers in England have led to clashes with counter-demonstrators and resulted in fifteen arrests. Demonstrations in London, Newcastle, and Manchester saw police intervening to manage the tense situations. In London, nine people were arrested for public order offenses. The protests come as the Home Office reports a decrease in the number of hotels being used for asylum seekers and announces plans to phase out their use entirely by 2029, a move aimed at restoring control to the asylum system.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly criticized his players' mentality, effort, and ego following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their first Scottish Premiership match of the season. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and lambasted what he described as a "mentality problem" rather than a tactical one. The unusually harsh post-game comments, made after just one competitive match, have raised concerns among pundits and fans. Former players expressed alarm at the manager calling out his team so early in the season, suggesting deep-seated issues within the squad.</p>

Only one will survive the final roster cuts on August 26, highlighting the brutal nature of the NFL where players are always competing for their jobs.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start since returning from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his return was spoiled by two home runs from Tampa Bay's Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite Snell showing flashes of his Cy Young-winning form and not issuing any walks, the Dodgers' offense was shut out in a 4-0 loss. The outing was still seen as a promising step for the Dodgers' late-season rotation depth.</p>

          <p>South African police have arrested nearly 1,000 undocumented foreign nationals for their involvement in illegal mining at the Sheba Gold Mine in Mpumalanga province. The large-scale operation, titled 'Vala Umgodi,' targeted the so-called "zama-zamas" working underground in one of the country's oldest mines. Those arrested, many from neighboring countries, will face charges for immigration violations and potentially for illegal mining. The issue is a persistent problem in South Africa, which has thousands of abandoned mines that have become hotspots for dangerous and unregulated resource extraction.</p>

          <p>The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening, with at least 325 people killed by Israeli forces over the past week while trying to access food aid, according to the territory's Health Ministry. These deaths occurred despite Israeli assurances of a humanitarian pause, as deaths from malnutrition soar and a famine unfolds. Aid agencies report that the limited supplies entering Gaza are often looted by armed gangs and desperate crowds before they can be properly distributed. A recent visit by U.S. officials to an Israeli-overseen distribution site has drawn criticism amid reports of hundreds of deaths near such locations.</p>
