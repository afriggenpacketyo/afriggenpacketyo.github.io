          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a unilateral three-day ceasefire in Ukraine from May 8-10, coinciding with Russia's World War II Victory Day. Ukraine has accused Putin's forces of violating previous ceasefire agreements, casting doubt on the sincerity of this latest truce. This announcement comes amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration on both Kyiv and Moscow to reach a peace agreement to end the three-year conflict, with officials indicating that Ukraine may need to cede some territory. Recent meetings between Trump and Zelenskyy, along with warnings from Vice President Vance, suggest a renewed urgency in brokering a lasting ceasefire. Optimism Score: 35</p>

          <p>DHL has reversed its decision to halt shipments of packages valued over $800 to U.S. consumers, resuming the service after discussions with the Trump administration. The initial suspension was prompted by increased inspections and delays due to new U.S. customs rules and tariffs. The company said that the policy reversal that took effect Monday came in response to discussions with the Trump administration over recent logistical challenges in international shipping. Shipments between $800 and $2,500 can now enter the U.S. through the informal entry process, though customers may still experience delays as DHL works through its backlog. Optimism Score: 70</p>

          <p>This article examines the increasing focus on IQ within both MAGA circles and Silicon Valley, arguing that this obsession could lead to a dehumanizing future. The author points out that figures like Trump and tech leaders often praise 'high-IQ' individuals, while simultaneously investing in AI that could automate many white-collar jobs traditionally associated with high intelligence. The piece suggests this focus on innate intelligence undermines the value of education and societal interventions, ultimately leading to a society where human skills are devalued in favor of AI.
