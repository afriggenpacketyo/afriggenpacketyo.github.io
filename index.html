            <p>A mass shooting at Florida State University's Student Union resulted in two fatalities and six injuries, with the alleged shooter, Phoenix Ikner, also wounded. Among the deceased was Robert Morales, a university dining worker, identified by his family. All six injured victims are in stable condition and are expected to recover, according to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital staff.

            <p>President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, asserting that interest rates would be lower if Powell "understood what he was doing." Trump's comments come amid increasing White House attacks on Powell, with economic advisor Kevin Hassett suggesting the administration is assessing options for removing him. Powell previously stated that Trump's tariff plan could increase inflation and create challenges for the Fed. Some Democrats, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, have warned that firing Powell would destabilize financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A contributor argues that President Trump's conflict with Harvard highlights a larger issue of accountability in higher education. The author suggests that universities have benefited from taxpayer support while straying from their original purpose of instilling values and contributing to the common good. Trump's efforts to condition federal grants on compliance with civil rights laws are seen as a step towards recalibrating the relationship between taxpayers and universities. The author posits that universities should not receive taxpayer funding if they engage in discriminatory practices.</p>

This adjustment follows reports and outcry from lawmakers regarding potential privacy violations. However, confusion remains among clinicians who are unsure how to meet privacy requirements while returning to overcrowded facilities, as the memo does not explicitly allow for continued work from home.</p>

The incident, captured in a social media video, prompted humorous reactions from other celebrities and Lowe's son, who has previously compared his father to Stamos. This isn't the first time Lowe has been confused for Stamos, as his son has replaced his face with Stamos' on family Christmas cards.</p>

            <p>A federal court has blocked the Trump administration's effort to terminate a large number of staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The ruling puts a legal hurdle in front of mass layoffs that followed a federal appeals court modification of an injunction limiting the agency's ability to terminate employees. The layoffs have eliminated several divisions within the agency, raising concerns about its ability to protect consumers. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the move as an assault on consumers and democracy.</p>

            <p>Attorneys for Venezuelan migrants held in a Texas detention center are warning that their clients are at "imminent risk" of deportation to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU filed an emergency application for a temporary restraining order after ICE officers allegedly informed the migrants they were being sent to El Salvador, even if they did not sign deportation papers. The Trump administration has invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a "hybrid criminal state."</p>

            <p>A federal judge declined to take immediate steps to enforce his order requiring the Trump administration to stop blocking The Associated Press' access to presidential events. The AP argues that the White House is violating its free-speech rights by punishing the news outlet for its editorial decision to not rename the Gulf of Mexico. The White House issued a new press policy that occasionally lets the AP into events it used to routinely cover. The AP's lawyer argues that the new policy is a tactic to diminish the outlet's influence.</p>
