          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina decided to back the AI voice startup ElevenLabs after a single 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski in 2022, long before the company had a concrete product. Reina was drawn to Staniszewski's deep technical knowledge and vision for solving the problem of robotic-sounding AI voices, an area overlooked by many other investors at the time. His early pre-seed investment proved prescient, as ElevenLabs has since achieved a multi-billion dollar valuation, specializing in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning technology. The story highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of investing in founders with compelling technical expertise and a unique market thesis.</p>

          <p>President Trump has started a five-day diplomatic tour of Asia, with scheduled stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea for major international summits. Aboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters he would be open to another meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, stating he had a "great relationship" with him. The trip's agenda includes high-stakes trade negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, aimed at de-escalating the ongoing trade war between the two economic powers. The tour proceeds even as a government shutdown continues in the United States, raising questions about the administration's focus on foreign policy amidst domestic turmoil.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' World Series Defeat Prompts Questions About Impact of Week-Long Layoff</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 01:44:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series opener, analysts are questioning whether the Dodgers' performance was negatively affected by a seven-day break. The team secured the layoff after sweeping the National League Championship Series, but historical data shows that teams with such breaks have often struggled. Pitchers Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan, who had extended rests, appeared to lack their usual sharpness, contributing to a nine-run inning for the Blue Jays. While manager Dave Roberts dismissed the idea that rust was a factor, the decisive loss has raised concerns about the team's momentum heading into the rest of the series.</p>

          <p>A large-scale police operation is in progress to locate Hadush Kebatu, an asylum seeker who was incorrectly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu had been sentenced to 12 months in prison for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl and was scheduled for deportation. Instead of being transferred to an immigration detention center, he was set free and is now believed to be in London. The incident has drawn sharp criticism from political figures, with Justice Secretary David Lammy expressing outrage over the error. The Prison Service has suspended an officer and launched an investigation into the systemic failures that led to the mistaken release.</p>

          <p>Despite initial successes in curbing hyperinflation, Argentine President Javier Milei is confronting growing political and economic challenges as the country heads into parliamentary elections. His radical austerity measures, including deep cuts to state spending and subsidies, have led to a severe recession, with thousands of small businesses closing and purchasing power for citizens plummeting. Several lawmakers have defected from his ruling party, citing concerns over corruption and neglect of the middle class. The upcoming election is seen as a crucial test of public support for his shock therapy policies. (not investment advice)</p>

However, access through border crossings remains severely restricted by Israel, which has linked their opening to the return of deceased hostages held by Hamas.

The project, privately funded by corporations and individuals, has drawn sharp criticism from presidential historians and preservation groups for its rapid and destructive pace.

For decades, Russia has struggled with low birth rates, a problem exacerbated by economic uncertainty, the war in Ukraine, and an exodus of young men.

          <p>A chaotic scene unfolded outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California, when law enforcement officers fired upon a U-Haul truck that was reversing toward them. The incident occurred during a day-long protest against a planned immigration enforcement surge in the Bay Area. According to witnesses and the Coast Guard, the driver ignored commands to stop before officers discharged their weapons. The driver was wounded but managed to flee before abandoning the vehicle nearby and being taken into custody. The shooting escalated tensions at the protest, which had earlier seen authorities use smoke grenades and flash bangs to disperse demonstrators.</p>

          <p>Queen Mother Sirikit of Thailand has passed away at the age of 93 in a Bangkok hospital, according to an announcement from the Royal Household Bureau. The former queen and wife of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej had been a central figure in Thai public life for nearly seven decades. Born into a diplomatic royal family, she married the future king in 1950 and became a beloved national symbol, with her birthday celebrated annually as Thailand's National Mother's Day. She had been largely absent from public duties in recent years due to declining health, following the death of her husband in 2016.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico have asked a U.S. appeals court to intervene and halt a Trump administration order that would force them to end their long-standing joint venture. The U.S. Department of Transportation mandated the dissolution of the partnership, which allows the airlines to coordinate flights and pricing between the U.S. and Mexico, citing anticompetitive effects. The airlines argue the order is "arbitrary and capricious" and would cause severe operational disruptions, cancel numerous routes, and eliminate up to $800 million in annual consumer benefits if allowed to proceed.

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, significantly increasing U.S. military presence in a region where recent strikes have targeted alleged drug trafficking vessels. This move follows Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's accusation that the U.S. is fabricating a pretext for war and is seen by some analysts as a message to regional leaders to align with U.S. interests. The deployment involves thousands of additional personnel and advanced military hardware, heightening speculation about the Trump administration's ultimate objectives in Venezuela, including potential actions aimed at regime change. The U.S. frames the operations as part of a broader counter-narcotics effort.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has confirmed the first death from West Nile virus in 2025. The patient, a resident of the San Fernando Valley, was hospitalized with a severe neurological illness caused by the mosquito-borne disease. Health officials note that half of the county's 14 documented cases this year have occurred in the San Fernando Valley. Recent studies suggest that ongoing drought conditions in the area may be increasing the risk of transmission, as limited water sources concentrate both infected birds and mosquitoes, potentially accelerating the virus's spread to humans. Residents are urged to take precautions against mosquito bites.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is advancing a plan to auction offshore oil and gas drilling leases in areas that have been off-limits for decades, including waters off California, New England, and the Carolinas. According to internal documents, these lease sales could begin as early as 2026, reversing previous policies that protected these coastlines. The proposal has already generated strong bipartisan opposition from coastal state governors and lawmakers, who cite the significant economic and environmental risks associated with offshore drilling. This initiative aligns with the administration's broader goal of expanding domestic fossil fuel production. (not investment advice)</p>
