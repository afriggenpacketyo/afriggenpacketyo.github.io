          <p>An elderly woman was violently shoved off a public bus in Boston, an incident captured on video that has led to an arrest. This attack has amplified nationwide fears about commuter safety on public transportation systems. The event is drawing comparisons to other recent high-profile transit violence, such as the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina. Officials are responding by vowing to increase security presence and review safety protocols to reassure the public.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are grappling with significant budget challenges following a temporary freeze on nearly $7 billion in federal funding by the Trump administration. Although the funds were eventually released after a lawsuit and public outcry, the incident has created lasting uncertainty for educators. Districts, particularly those in low-income and rural areas like Ashe County, North Carolina, are now forced to plan for potential future cuts that could impact teacher salaries, after-school programs, and essential student services. The situation highlights the precarious reliance on federal aid for public education.</p>

          <p>During a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating Putin had "let me down" regarding the war in Ukraine.

The press conference, held at the conclusion of a two-day state visit, focused on areas of alignment, with Trump praising the UK's commitment to defense spending.

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Trump has announced his intention to designate Antifa as a "major terrorist organization." This article explains that Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a decentralized, leaderless movement of far-left activists who oppose far-right and fascist ideologies. Legal experts question the feasibility of such a designation, as U.S. law is primarily designed for foreign organizations, and the First Amendment protects rights of association for domestic groups. Critics also note that Antifa is more of an ideology than a formal organization, making it difficult to target legally.</p>

          <h2>Ukraine Eases Travel Restrictions, Allowing Young Men Aged 18-22 to Leave the Country</h2>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has changed its martial law regulations to permit men between the ages of 18 and 22 to travel abroad freely. This decision aims to keep more young people in Ukraine by giving them the flexibility to leave and return, rather than seeking ways to exit permanently. The move has sparked debate, with some viewing it as a positive step toward normalcy and others seeing it as unfair to older men subject to mobilization. While border officials have not noted a massive exodus, the new rule provides young Ukrainians with opportunities for short-term travel, work, or study abroad.</p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic, art became a crucial outlet for processing the heartbreak and chaos she witnessed on the front lines.

          <p>In her upcoming campaign memoir, "107 Days," former presidential nominee Kamala Harris expresses her dismay over running mate Tim Walz's performance in the 2024 vice-presidential debate. Harris writes that she watched in frustration as Walz "fumbled" a key answer and fell for opponent JD Vance's "fake bipartisanship" instead of mounting a stronger defense. The book also reveals that her first choice for a running mate was then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, but she ultimately decided against it, believing it was "too big of a risk" for the ticket. The memoir offers a candid look inside the strategic and personal dynamics of her presidential campaign.</p>

          <h2>New Research Quantifies the Cost of Reducing Suffering for Farmed Chickens</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new commentary in the journal Nature Food proposes a method for measuring the "welfare footprint" of farmed animals, focusing on the suffering of chickens raised for meat. Researchers estimate that the average factory-farmed chicken endures approximately 700 hours of pain during its short 45-day life due to rapid-growth genetics. The article argues that switching to slower-growing breeds could prevent at least 15 to 100 hours of the most severe pain for a cost of just half a cent to three cents per hour. This approach aims to incorporate animal welfare into food policy discussions alongside economic and environmental costs.</p>

          <p>In Long Beach, Minnesota, one of the smallest towns in the U.S. with that name, a tiny chapel and a vibrant garden offer a place of tranquility on the shores of Lake Minnewaska. The Morning Glory Gardens were established in the 1960s to replace a marsh, and the adjacent chapel, which seats about 12 people, was moved to the site in 1981. Maintained by a dedicated caretaker and over 30 volunteers, the site hosts several weddings each year and attracts visitors from across the country. The intertwined chapel and garden serve as a beloved local landmark for reflection and serenity.</p>

          <h2>How the Recent Fed Rate Cut Affects Reverse Mortgage Options for Retirees</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has nuanced implications for retirees considering a reverse mortgage. Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond the Fed's benchmark, so rates may not fall in lockstep. However, lower rates can significantly increase a homeowner's borrowing capacity, as the formula used to determine loan amounts is rate-sensitive. The article advises retirees to shop around for rates, carefully consider the choice between fixed and adjustable-rate products, and weigh the long-term costs against the benefit of accessing more home equity.

He notes that under-invested money managers are likely to buy on any dips, providing a floor for the market. However, he identifies the Federal Reserve's handling of inflation and potential future rate cuts as a key variable to watch. The most significant short-term risk, he argues, is the potential for escalating tensions between China and Taiwan, while long-term concerns revolve around the U.S. national debt.

          <p>Irish author Sally Rooney stated she could not travel to the UK to accept a book award due to concerns she might be arrested for her financial support of Palestine Action. The UK government recently proscribed the activist group as a terrorist organization following protests targeting arms companies involved with the war in Gaza. In a statement read at the Sky Arts awards ceremony, Rooney explained she was advised against entering the UK but reiterated her support for non-violent anti-war protest and her solidarity with the people of Palestine. The situation highlights the legal complexities and potential consequences for supporters of the newly banned group.</p>
