          <p>The Powerball jackpot's climb to $1.8 billion is providing a substantial boost to DraftKings through its lottery courier app, Jackpocket. The platform has processed 15 million ticket orders during this lottery run, with sales surging as the grand prize grows. This increased activity highlights the value of DraftKings' 2024 acquisition of Jackpocket, which the company uses to cross-sell customers to its sports betting and iGaming services. The company projects the subsidiary will add hundreds of millions in revenue by 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw a significant drop to 6.29%, its largest one-day decrease since August 2024. This decline was a direct reaction to a weaker-than-expected August employment report, which has influenced the bond market. For a homebuyer purchasing a $450,000 house, this rate drop could translate to a monthly saving of around $169. However, economists remain uncertain if this decrease is substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as high home prices and economic uncertainty persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion article supports Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s assertion that the exact number of American deaths from COVID-19 is unknown. The author argues that official figures from the CDC and WHO are unreliable due to inconsistent classification methods, such as counting individuals who died 'with' COVID rather than 'of' COVID. The piece criticizes the medical establishment for what it calls a failure to provide accurate data and for suppressing dissenting scientific voices during the pandemic. It frames Kennedy's role as a necessary effort to restore public trust in health institutions.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested two 17-year-olds for the murder of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern who was killed by stray bullets in Washington D.C. on June 30. A third juvenile suspect is still being sought by investigators. The two arrested teens, Jalen Lucas and Kelvin Thomas Jr., will be prosecuted as adults on first-degree murder charges. During the announcement, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro criticized the D.C. City Council's policies on juvenile crime, arguing they hinder efforts to prosecute young violent offenders.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News just two days after it was filed, but has granted Newsmax the opportunity to submit an amended version. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled the initial complaint was an impermissible "shotgun pleading," where each count improperly incorporates all previous allegations. Newsmax stated it views this as a technical matter and its legal team is already in the process of refiling the suit. The lawsuit accuses Fox News of monopolistic behavior and using intimidation tactics to suppress conservative media competitors.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis outlines three possible scenarios for how the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein controversy could impact Donald Trump's administration. The first scenario suggests that continued public pressure, especially from victims, could create a significant political crisis for the White House. A second possibility is that the story persists as a background issue, causing some political drag but no lasting damage. The third scenario posits that, without new revelations, public interest will wane and the scandal will fade, much like other controversies Trump has weathered.</p>

The author contends that this approach dangerously downplays the seriousness of authoritarian measures, such as deploying the National Guard in cities or attacking the justice system. By constantly trying to refocus public attention on Epstein, Democrats risk implying that Trump's other abuses of power are not significant in their own right.

Regardless of the choice, the IRS requires a mandatory 24% federal withholding on prizes over $5,000. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a substantial additional tax payment will be due.

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot reaches $1.8 billion, data analysis shows significant variations in take-home winnings based on state tax laws. States like California and Florida do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to keep more of their money, while high-tax states like New York see the lowest payouts after all taxes are applied. The analysis also looked at which numbers have been drawn most and least frequently, although each drawing is a random event. The current jackpot run is the longest in the lottery's history without a grand prize winner.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of slowing as employers added just 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of the 80,000 forecast by economists. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised previous months' data downward, revealing that the economy actually shed 13,000 jobs in June. This marks the first monthly job loss since late 2020. The weak report is attributed to economic uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's tariff policies and is likely to increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

          <p>Financial experts suggest that a good retirement income is typically 75% to 85% of one's pre-retirement earnings, but the reality for most Americans is far different. The median retirement income is around $47,000 annually, or about $3,900 per month, which may not be sufficient in high-cost-of-living areas. The article explores various strategies to increase retirement income and ensure financial stability. These methods include purchasing annuities for a guaranteed income stream, utilizing reverse mortgages for homeowners, and optimizing Social Security benefits by delaying claims until age 70.

The father reportedly told authorities he was trying to spend time with his son away from technology's influence.
