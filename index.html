          <p>Israeli forces launched airstrikes near Syria's presidential palace in Damascus following warnings from Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding the protection of the Druze minority. The strikes occurred amidst sectarian clashes between Sunni gunmen and Druze community members, sparked by a controversial audio clip. Netanyahu's statement emphasized that Israel would not allow Syrian forces to deploy south of Damascus or threaten the Druze population. This marks the second instance of Israeli strikes in Syria within two days, underscoring Israel's commitment to defending the Druze minority and reflecting deep mistrust of Sunni Islamists since Bashar Assad's ouster. The optimism score reflects the continued regional instability and potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>Standard Chartered reported first-quarter profits surpassing expectations, driven by robust growth in wealth management, global markets, and global banking sectors. The bank's profit before taxation reached $2.103 billion, a notable increase from the previous year. CEO Bill Winters highlighted the double-digit income growth in Wealth Solutions, Global Markets, and Global Banking, though the bank also faced a $219 million credit impairment charge due to rising rates affecting repayments. While the earnings don't fully reflect the impact of U.S. tariffs, Standard Chartered remains focused on high-growth markets in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and is currently undertaking a cost-saving initiative called "Fit for Growth."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially ended the de minimis rule, a loophole allowing Americans to buy cheap goods from China tariff-free, a New York Times article reports. This move, affecting shipments from mainland China and Hong Kong, aims to protect U.S. manufacturers but is expected to raise prices for American consumers and disrupt online retail. The administration cited concerns about fentanyl smuggling and job losses in warehousing as reasons for the change. The article notes that the decision could impact airlines and carriers like FedEx and UPS, while also potentially leading to confusion among consumers and small retailers. The article details the history of the exemption and the potential implications for trade and consumer behavior.</p>

          <p>Japan and the U.S. have agreed to expedite tariff negotiations, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal as early as June. Following meetings in Washington, Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa announced intensive ministerial discussions would begin in mid-May. While details remain undisclosed, Akazawa emphasized Japan's intention to protect its national interests. The meeting occurred shortly after Trump eased tariffs on the auto industry and Akazawa urged the removal of auto and other tariffs imposed in recent months. Japan is considering increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and expanded tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of the negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Senate approved an effort to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency rule designed to limit seven of the most hazardous air pollutants emitted by heavy industry, according to CBS News. The 52-46 party-line vote marked the first time Congress has moved to weaken the Clean Air Act. The rule, finalized by the Biden administration in 2024, required industrial facilities to maintain strict pollution controls. Republican lawmakers argued that the rule disincentivized companies from deploying new technology to reduce pollution, while environmental groups criticized the move as harmful to public health.</p>
