          <p>Senate Republicans are struggling to secure enough votes to pass President Trump's extensive tax and spending bill before a July 4th deadline, facing defections from within their own party. Key holdouts have raised concerns over the bill's contents, including the scale of welfare cuts intended to fund the extension of Trump-era tax breaks. With a slim majority, leadership is engaged in intense negotiations to win over undecided senators like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. The bill's passage remains uncertain as some senators demand more time to review the nearly 1,000-page document. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Phoenix, Arizona, rescued a baby who had been left alone in an apartment for several days after the infant's mother passed away. Officers were conducting a welfare check when they discovered the deceased woman and found the baby on a bed, visibly emaciated. Bodycam footage showed an officer carefully moving the infant, who was then transported to a hospital for lifesaving care. The baby is expected to make a full recovery, while the cause of the mother's death is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>Wall Street concluded a volatile week with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new record highs, a surprising outcome given the initial market anxiety over U.S. strikes on Iran. After an initial surge, energy prices fell sharply, which investors interpreted as a sign that the conflict would not systemically impact economic growth or inflation. This sentiment, combined with renewed investor hopes for multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by year-end, fueled the market rally. The week demonstrated the market's ability to look past geopolitical turmoil when immediate economic threats appear contained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest Supreme Court term concluded with significant victories for conservative-leaning states and President Trump's assertions of executive power, though without the blockbuster rulings of previous years. The court's 6-3 conservative majority handed down decisions giving states more authority on issues like transgender medical care and Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. Concurrently, the court has repeatedly sided with the Trump administration in procedural rulings, reining in the power of lower court judges to block executive actions. These trends reflect a states-rights focused conservatism and a judiciary hesitant to rule directly against the president's broad power claims.</p>

          <p>New genetic research on skeletons from Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k, a 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, suggests it may have been a matriarchal or matrilineal society. By analyzing DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses, scientists found that where biological connections existed, they were traced through the female line. This indicates that women likely remained in their family homes after marriage while men moved in. The findings, published in the journal Science, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>

          <p>Following Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's upset victory in the New York City mayoral primary, Republican leaders are using his win to frame the Democratic party as extremist. High-profile Republicans, including Donald Trump, have labeled Mamdani a "communist" and are attempting to tie his progressive platform to national Democrats. While some Democrats have embraced Mamdani, others have been more cautious. In response to what they call Islamophobic attacks on Mamdani's background, several Democratic members of Congress have called for unity in denouncing the hateful rhetoric.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris expressed his satisfaction after securing a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, describing his final qualifying lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for. Norris, whose season has been marked by qualifying errors, outpaced the field by a significant margin, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc starting alongside him. He credited recent car upgrades and a return to his old form for the dominant performance. The result puts him in a strong position for the race, as he aims to close the championship gap to his teammate Oscar Piastri.</p>
