          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed minerals explorer Trilogy Metals experienced a dramatic increase, skyrocketing over 200% in premarket trade on Tuesday. This surge occurred shortly after the White House announced its acquisition of a 10% stake in the Canadian company. The U.S. government's investment signals a strategic interest in securing critical mineral resources, potentially impacting future supply chain stability. This significant development underscores the growing importance of government backing in the resource sector, leading to considerable market enthusiasm and investor optimism for Trilogy Metals' prospects.</p>

          <p>UNESCO's executive board has nominated Khaled el-Anani, an Egyptian professor and former minister, to be the agency's next director-general. If confirmed, he would be the first from the Arab world to hold this prestigious position, a move celebrated by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. El-Anani's appointment comes at a critical time as UNESCO faces significant budget challenges, particularly after the U.S. withdrew its funding. He has committed to addressing these financial issues and working towards the U.S. rejoining the organization, alongside continuing UNESCO's efforts against antisemitism and religious intolerance.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index reached a record high for the second consecutive day, initially paring gains before closing flat. The rally was primarily driven by a tech sector surge on Wall Street, spurred by a significant deal between OpenAI and AMD, which is seen as a direct challenge to Nvidia. While chip-related stocks on the Nikkei 225 experienced volatile trading, the broader market was also influenced by the election of a new conservative leader in Japan's ruling party. This market movement reflects a broader trend of investor enthusiasm for technology advancements, despite rising Japanese Government Bond yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is in Washington for talks with President Trump, aiming to get stalled trade negotiations back on track. Despite a missed August deadline, Canada is not rushing, benefiting from existing USMCA carve-outs. The meeting occurs amid renewed Trump rhetoric about Canada becoming the 51st state and domestic pressure on Carney to secure a favorable deal, particularly concerning U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods. While no major breakthroughs are expected, face-to-face dialogue is hoped to ease the trade stalemate and address broader economic and security issues, including an upcoming USMCA review.</p>

          <p>France is facing a severe political crisis after Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned just 27 days into his term, unable to form a stable minority government. This situation stems from President Macron's decision to dissolve parliament last year, leading to inconclusive elections and persistent political deadlock. Lecornu's departure, the third such failure, highlights the intransigence of rival parties regarding budget and policy demands. Macron now faces difficult choices, including appointing another prime minister or calling new parliamentary elections, with the latter posing risks given the current political polarization and the rise of far-right parties.</p>

          <p>Pine martens, a native species crucial to woodland ecosystems, have been reintroduced to Exmoor National Park, marking their return after a century. Nineteen animals, sourced from Scottish populations, were released at secret locations by the Two Moors Pine Marten Project. Each marten is fitted with a radio collar for monitoring, reflecting a dedicated conservation effort. This reintroduction is hailed as a "positive sign for nature" and a demonstration that wildlife can be restored, benefiting the region's woodlands. It follows a successful reintroduction on Dartmoor last autumn, where kits were born earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Clearsprings Ready Homes, a company contracted by the UK Home Office to house asylum seekers, has generated nearly £187 million in profits since 2019, despite widespread allegations of "terrible" conditions, inedible food, and rationed basic supplies at its hotels. The company, which supports approximately 30,000 asylum seekers, is part of a system where overall contract costs have more than tripled to £15 billion. Critics, including charities and MPs, argue that private firms are profiting obscenely from vulnerable individuals while providing inadequate care. The Home Office claims it is recovering excess profits and reducing hotel spending, but concerns about value for money persist.</p>

          <p>The father of Stephen Lawrence, Dr. Neville Lawrence, insists that David Norris, one of his son's murderers, must name the other killers involved in the 1993 racist stabbing before he can be considered safe for release on parole. Norris, serving a life sentence, is seeking release despite only recently admitting his presence and involvement in the attack, though denying the stabbing itself. Dr. Lawrence also seeks assurances that Norris is no longer racist, stressing the importance of accountability and a genuine change in character. The Parole Board will review evidence, including impact statements from Stephen's family, in a public hearing this week.</p>

The chain, founded in 1975, once boasted over 200 U.S. locations before a hepatitis A outbreak and bankruptcy led to its closure in 2004. Its revival is thanks to an agreement with Hormel Foods, which owns the trademark, allowing the son of one of the original founders to re-establish the physical restaurants.</p>

          <p>Illinois and Chicago have filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to the city, arguing it is "patently unlawful" and an "unconstitutional invasion." Despite the legal challenge, a judge declined an immediate restraining order, and Texas National Guard troops are already en route, with Illinois Guard members ordered for training. Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson decried the move as a political power grab and an attempt to sow chaos, accusing the administration of using military-style enforcement actions to justify the deployment. The lawsuit cites militia clauses and the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

This dramatic decrease, a seismic change from record highs under the previous administration, is attributed to the Trump administration's sweeping clampdown on illegal immigration. Policies include sealing and militarizing the border, closing the asylum system, and launching large-scale deportation campaigns. While the administration hails this as a success in securing the border, critics, including civil liberties groups and local Democrats, denounce the policies as inhumane and unconstitutional, sparking protests in major cities.</p>
