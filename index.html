          <p>In his New York Times opinion piece, Thomas Friedman reflects on the shared sense of entrapment felt by both Israelis and Gazans, who are disillusioned with their respective leaders. He notes a lack of trust in leadership on both sides, contributing to the ongoing conflict and political deadlock. The piece does not offer solutions but rather highlights the deep-seated frustrations and the urgent need for new approaches to break the cycle of distrust and violence. Friedman emphasizes the mutual feeling of being stuck in a seemingly endless loop of conflict with no clear path forward for either side, reflecting a pessimistic outlook on the current state of affairs.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump reportedly told the children of Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of "Chrisley Knows Best," that he would pardon their parents, who are currently serving prison sentences for bank fraud and tax evasion. The couple was convicted in 2022 for submitting false financial statements to obtain over $30 million in loans and concealing income from the IRS. Trump stated he felt they received "pretty harsh treatment." Their daughter, Savannah, had been seeking a pardon, claiming they were unfairly targeted due to their celebrity status, comparing their case to Trump's legal troubles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. companies, President Trumpâ€™s steep global tariffs have led to a surge in fraudulent activities aimed at evading these taxes, with the government struggling to keep pace. Shipping companies, primarily based in China, are offering U.S. firms methods to bypass tariffs, such as altering shipment information or transshipping goods through countries with lower tariff rates. This illicit activity is estimated to cost the U.S. government billions in tariff revenue annually, disadvantaging honest companies that comply with regulations. The Trump administration plans to focus more on combating trade fraud, but many believe the scale of the problem is overwhelming. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rep. Judy Chu and advocacy groups are urging FEMA to provide additional housing assistance for survivors of the Eaton Fires, arguing that many are still struggling to find stable housing despite available federal vouchers. Chu is requesting FEMA authorize a Direct Lease program, which would allow the agency to directly rent apartments for those unable to find housing on their own. Advocates cite barriers such as high income requirements, low credit scores, and landlords not accepting vouchers. The push comes amid cuts to FEMA and resistance from the Trump administration for disaster spending, but Chu says money is available through the existing disaster allocation.</p>

The article suggests that Putin's actions are now a liability for Trump, who had previously boasted about his ability to quickly resolve the conflict. It also points out the U.S. might be in a better position to force concessions if it had a more functional national security team.</p>

The advisory urges Americans to avoid travel to Venezuela "at all costs," citing the risk of unjust imprisonment, often based solely on their nationality. While the exact number of detained Americans remains undisclosed, at least eight are known to be held, and the State Department has classified Venezuela under its most severe travel advisory since 2019. The Trump administration has successfully negotiated the release of seven other Americans and has said it has offered no concessions to the Maduro regime in exchange for freeing U.S. nationals.</p>

This decision, coinciding with the anniversary of George Floyd's death, effectively abandons a crucial tool for police reform, leading to concerns about increased rights violations and violence, especially against individuals of color. While high-profile incidents often spark outrage, meaningful reforms are rare, and the political process is often ineffective, making the federal statute that allows for court-ordered reforms essential.

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are facing increasing difficulty finding employment, despite holding degrees that typically enhance job prospects. Unemployed recent graduates account for 12% of the rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023, with the unemployment rate for this group nearing 6%. The rise is attributed to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields with waning business demand, particularly in the tech sector, and economic uncertainty is also slowing hiring. The underemployment effect, where college-educated workers take jobs below their skill level, is also a contributing factor. (not investment advice)</p>
