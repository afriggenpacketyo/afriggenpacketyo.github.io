          <p>The Women's Super League (WSL) is set to expand from 12 to 14 teams starting in the 2026-27 season, a proposal presented by WSL Football at a shareholders' meeting. The Football Association (FA) is expected to formally approve the changes, which include adjustments to promotion and relegation processes between WSL 2 and the WSL. Initially, the top three teams from WSL 2 will have the opportunity to move up, with a play-off determining the final spot; however, the future structure will involve one automatic promotion and a play-off between the second-lowest WSL team and the WSL 2 runner-up. These changes aim to foster growth and competitiveness within women's football, requiring all participating clubs to meet specific licensing criteria.</p>

Short-term CDs are currently offering the highest interest rates, making them ideal for those seeking to maximize returns quickly, while long-term CDs provide stability and predictability for savers with a solid emergency fund. A CD ladder, combining various CD term lengths, offers a balance between high rates and flexibility. Regardless of the chosen term, experts recommend researching and comparing rates from different banks and credit unions to secure the best possible return. (not investment advice)</p>

The closure, occurring months after President Macron unveiled a plan to address infrastructure issues, highlights the museum's struggle with overtourism; with 8.7 million visitors last year, staff feel overwhelmed despite a daily cap of 30,000 visitors.

Detectives are investigating online posts related to the disorder, and a man has been charged with sending menacing messages and encouraging offenses; community leaders are expressing concern about the violence and its impact on migrants, calling for support and addressing issues contributing to anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>

While dramatic swings are unlikely, rates could remain stable, rise, or decline depending on economic triggers; experts suggest that rates will hover around 6.875% to 7.125% unless there is a clear break in labor or inflation unexpectedly cools. If rates remain the same, experts recommend negotiating rate buydowns or exploring different loan programs, while a cooling economy could prompt the Fed to cut rates. (not investment advice)</p>

While some abortion rights advocates view this as another consequence of restrictive abortion laws, others argue it's about preserving life, including that of the incapacitated. The debate centers on who should make decisions for brain-dead individuals and whether the state's abortion ban influenced the hospital's actions.</p>

          <p>The stands of at least two major Israeli defense firms were blocked off at the Paris Air Show, reportedly ordered by the French government following a dispute over displays. Firms including Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) had their pavilions surrounded by boards, preventing attendees from viewing their military hardware. Israel's Defense Ministry condemned the move as an "outrageous and unprecedented decision," attributing it to policy-driven and commercial considerations; the ministry stated that the French government ordered the removal of offensive weapons systems, breaking with standard practice at defense exhibitions.</p>
