          <p>A 19-year-old surfer in New South Wales, Australia, has been found safe after a massive search operation. Darcy Deefholts went missing after paddling out, prompting a land and sea search when his bicycle and clothes were discovered at a beach access point. He was located the next day on North Solitary Island, approximately 8 miles from where he started, suffering from cold and exposure but otherwise uninjured. Family members, who had feared the worst, expressed immense relief, noting that a strong current likely swept him south despite calm seas.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science made an unexpected discovery on its own property, finding a dinosaur fossil while drilling a deep borehole for a geothermal energy study. The core sample, taken from over 750 feet below the parking lot, contained a vertebra believed to be from a small, plant-eating dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period. Museum officials described the find as incredibly rare, like a "hole in one from the moon," given the small diameter of the bore. The fossil is now on display, but there are no plans for a full excavation.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House, coinciding with Nvidia becoming the first company to close a trading day with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. The meeting's agenda was not disclosed, but it occurs as Nvidia grapples with U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly to China. The Trump administration's restrictions have effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to the significant Chinese market, impacting billions in planned orders. Trump praised the company's stock performance in a social media post prior to the meeting.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Standard Fiber, a Nevada-based home bedding company, is facing significant challenges due to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, describing the situation as making planning nearly impossible. Chad Altbaier explained that the tariffs have led to reduced orders from major retailers like Walmart and Target, who fear consumers will not accept higher prices. The uncertainty has forced the company to lay off about 45 of its 250 workers. Altbaier noted that moving all production out of Asia is not feasible due to a lack of infrastructure, workforce, and raw materials in the U.S.</p>

          <p>In Nashville, Tennessee, a group of volunteers, including 80-year-old Lynne McFarland, are delivering food and basic necessities to undocumented immigrant families. Many of these families are too afraid to leave their homes due to the fear of detention or deportation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The effort highlights the widespread anxiety within immigrant communities following increased enforcement actions. The article notes that of the approximately 59,000 detainees held by ICE, nearly half have no criminal record, amplifying the fears of families who are trying to navigate their legal status.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas during the Fourth of July weekend have resulted in at least 121 fatalities, with dozens of people still missing. The disaster, which struck Kerr County particularly hard, was caused by a massive weather system that dumped extreme rainfall on the flood-prone region, causing the river to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Among the victims were numerous children and counselors from a summer camp. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness of warnings and evacuation orders, with some survivors stating they received no alerts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has threatened a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as justification. The stated reasons include retaliation for the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and an incorrect claim that the U.S. runs a trade deficit with Brazil. This use of IEEPA, a law intended for national emergencies, is already being challenged in federal court over previous tariffs.

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris sustained a superficial eye injury during a Fourth of July fireworks mishap. According to his agent, the injury was minor, and the prized free-agent signing is fully expected to be ready for the upcoming NFL season. The confirmation came after online speculation suggested a more severe injury. Harris, who has four 1,000-yard rushing seasons, signed a one-year deal with the Chargers and is anticipated to be a key part of their offense, pairing with first-round pick Omarion Hampton in the backfield.</p>

          <p>As the UK experiences its third heatwave of 2025, analysis shows that such extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense due to human-caused climate change. Spring 2025 was the UK's warmest on record, and scientists warn that global warming disproportionately increases heatwave temperatures by 3-4°C in the region. While many compare current heatwaves to the summer of 1976, data shows that event was an isolated occurrence in a cooler decade. Climate projections indicate that hot spells will become a more regular feature of UK summers, especially in the southeast.</p>

          <p>A surgeon who was banned from working for the private healthcare company Nuffield Health following a patient safety investigation is still operating on patients at an NHS hospital. Nuffield Health withdrew Marc Lamah's practicing privileges after an inquiry found his conduct did not meet their standards. However, University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, where he continues to work, stated its own audit found his outcomes were within the expected national range. The case has drawn criticism, including from a former NHS patient who was left with a twisted bowel after an operation he performed.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a significant boom in demand. Between 2018 and 2022, the number of fertility treatments in the country rose by nearly 50%, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with their assistance. Experts attribute this trend to a generational shift, where more people seek control over their family planning, including egg-freezing and IVF. This demand offers a small glimmer of hope in the country's demographic crisis, as it suggests some people still desire children but face social, financial, or biological barriers.</p>

          <p>Clashes broke out between federal agents and protesters during an ICE raid at an agricultural farm in Ventura County, Southern California. The incident was one of at least two large-scale immigration enforcement operations in the region on the same day. Masked federal agents were observed using crowd control measures, including irritants, and detaining at least one person. The raids are part of a broader increase in immigration enforcement, which has included the deployment of U.S. troops to California and has heightened tensions and fear within local communities.</p>

          <p>A senior Israeli official has stated that Israel believes Iran could potentially retrieve deeply buried stocks of enriched uranium from its Isfahan nuclear facility, one of three sites targeted in U.S. military strikes last month. This assessment complicates the Trump administration's claim that the sites were "obliterated." While U.S. intelligence suggests the strikes caused significant setbacks, the potential for Iran to recover nuclear material from the rubble at Isfahan remains a concern. The agency that designed the "bunker buster" bombs used in the strikes is still awaiting data to confirm if they reached their intended targets.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the overall pace of global warming. The findings, published in Nature Geoscience, indicate that as the planet warms, the longest and most extreme heat waves will accelerate the most, posing significant risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure. Researchers warn that this non-linear effect means even small increments of warming will have a disproportionately large impact. The study underscores the urgent need for accelerated adaptation strategies to cope with longer and more intense periods of extreme heat.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a policy change that will exclude undocumented children from Head Start, the federal preschool program for low-income families. This move reverses decades of policy and is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for undocumented immigrants. The Department of Health and Human Services reclassified Head Start and at least 12 other programs as "federal public benefits," thereby restricting access based on immigration status.
