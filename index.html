          <p>Families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea decades ago appealed to the Trump administration for assistance in bringing their loved ones home. During meetings with U.S. officials and legislators in Washington, the families stressed the urgency of the situation and expressed hope that President Trump would actively engage in resolving the abduction issue, referencing a promise he made during his first term. Takuya Yokota, who leads the group representing the families, emphasized his continued hope in Trump's commitment. Japan officially lists 17 nationals as having been abducted by North Korea, with five having been returned, and suspects North Korea's involvement in many other disappearances.</p>

          <p>President Trump acknowledged that Americans may have to accept having less as a result of the ongoing trade war with China. While answering questions at the end of his Cabinet meeting, Trump argued that the trade war would ultimately be worse for the Chinese, who depend on the U.S. market, and insisted that Americans do not require many of the goods imported from China. Trump stated that children may have two dolls instead of 30, and the two dolls may cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board members reportedly reached out to executive search firms to identify a successor for CEO Elon Musk, prompted by his extensive involvement with the Trump administration. Musk's commitments to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and his embrace of far-right politics have drawn criticism and protests. While the board has asked Musk to dedicate more time to Tesla, it remains unclear whether he is aware of the succession planning, as Tesla's EV sales face challenges and its stock price declines.</p>
