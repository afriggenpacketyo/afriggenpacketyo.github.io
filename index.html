          <p>A second unvaccinated child in Texas has died from complications related to a measles outbreak, which has now spread to multiple states and even Mexico, raising concerns about the potential loss of the U.S.'s measles elimination status. The outbreak, primarily affecting unvaccinated individuals, has prompted the deployment of CDC teams to assist with response efforts, including vaccination and community outreach. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., despite his past anti-vaccine activism, has stated the importance of the MMR vaccine. Experts emphasize the need for high vaccination rates to prevent further spread, especially with the upcoming summer travel season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior partners are increasingly leaving large venture capital firms, driven by factors like slow decision-making, a focus on asset management over founder support, and the rise of smaller, specialized funds. Some investors feel distanced from their passion for venture capital in larger firms, seeking more control and early-stage involvement in their own funds. The growth of technology platforms like AngelList and Carta has also made it easier for individuals to start their own venture capital funds. However, some departures are involuntary, reflecting the industry's downturn and the challenges of achieving returns in the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman criticized President Trump's tariff policies, warning they could lead to an "economic nuclear winter" by eroding confidence in the U.S. as a trading partner. Ackman, who previously endorsed Trump, argued that the tariffs, particularly on China, would negatively impact low-income consumers and harm the overall economy. He suggested Trump should consider a timeout for negotiations or risk severe economic consequences. Ackman also criticized Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, citing a potential conflict of interest due to his firm's financial positions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has strongly criticized the U.S. government's deportation of a Maryland man to a prison in El Salvador, calling it "wholly lawless." Judge Paula Xinis stated there was little evidence to support allegations of gang affiliation and that an immigration judge had previously barred his deportation to El Salvador. The Justice Department has suspended the attorney who handled the case, and the judge has ordered the government to bring the man back to the U.S. The case raises concerns about due process and the government's authority to deport individuals to dangerous prisons.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering closing the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office established during the civil rights movement to prevent and resolve racial conflicts.

          <p>Stock exchanges use trading halts, known as circuit breakers, to prevent market crashes during periods of extreme volatility. These halts are triggered when stock prices or futures fall rapidly, allowing investors to reassess and prevent panic selling. Currently, surging global trade tensions sparked by surprisingly high universal tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump are putting massive pressure on equities. During non-U.S. trading hours, a 7% drop in S&P futures triggers a halt until buyers emerge at the 'limit down' level.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs anticipates that Chinese policymakers will implement significant fiscal easing measures to offset the negative impact of higher tariffs imposed by the United States. The firm estimates that the new tariff rates could reduce China's GDP growth by at least 0.7 percentage points this year. Goldman Sachs noted a commentary in China's state-run People's Daily hinting at potential monetary policy actions, including reserve requirement ratio cuts and interest rate reductions. The investment bank also downgraded Taiwan in its Asian market allocations due to its high exposure to U.S. exports and market sensitivity. (not investment advice)

          <p>Bitcoin's price dropped below $78,000 as investors braced for increased financial market volatility following a significant decline in U.S. equities due to President Trump's global tariffs. The cryptocurrency, often viewed as a leading indicator of market sentiment, experienced a 6% decrease. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Solana's token, also suffered substantial losses. The decline triggered a wave of long liquidations, as traders betting on a price increase were forced to sell assets to cover losses.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing regulations on car firms ahead of the 2030 ban on petrol vehicles, aiming to support the industry amid new tariffs imposed by the US. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced the changes to protect jobs, including more flexibility for manufacturers to meet electric vehicle targets and allowing smaller firms to continue producing petrol cars beyond 2030. Opposition parties have criticized the measures as insufficient, but Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized tax breaks for electric vehicle purchases and infrastructure improvements.</p>

          <p>International stock markets experienced significant declines amid fears of a global trade war following President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which he defended as necessary "medicine." Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 saw substantial losses, while US stock market futures also signaled further weakness. Trump stated that foreign governments would have to pay "a lot of money" to lift the tariffs, triggering retaliatory levies from China and sparking concerns about a global recession. The tariffs have created uncertainty among investors and political leaders regarding the future of global trade relations.</p>
