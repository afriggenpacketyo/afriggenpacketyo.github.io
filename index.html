Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, stating that it was unnecessary and would escalate tensions.

          <p>The article calls for cooler heads to prevail in Los Angeles, where clashes between federal agents and protesters have escalated following immigration enforcement actions. It highlights the risk of further violence and the potential for long-term damage to civic bonds. The author notes President Trump's incentives to redirect public attention and Governor Newsom's focus on opposing Trump, while emphasizing the need to protect innocent people. It suggests that farsighted protest leaders should maintain law-abiding demonstrations, as the rule of law is a precious safeguard, and street violence gives Trump the ability to fight his enemies with the law on his side.</p>

          <p>Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has urged the police to "do their bit" to "embrace change" as the Home Office and the Treasury negotiate this week's Spending Review. Kyle indicated that while spending for schools and scientific research would increase, policing may face a squeeze. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp expressed concern about potential police number cuts and urged the government to protect their budget. The Chancellor is expected to announce departmental spending allocations for the next three to four years on Wednesday.</p>

          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, the most common reasons for fights include tone of voice or attitude, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone often signals contempt, a major predictor of divorce, while arguments about family reflect misalignments and unmet needs. Conflicts over chores usually stem from an uneven distribution of labor and a lack of recognition for the "invisible load." Ineffective communication can derail conversations, leading to defensiveness and criticism. The article suggests strategies for addressing each of these issues to improve relationship dynamics.</p>

The author argues that small residential liberal-arts colleges are particularly vulnerable to the pervasiveness of technology, as it undermines the closely knit community and in-person learning that these institutions prioritize.
