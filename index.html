          <p>Following a championship match loss to Cody Rhodes, John Cena was addressing the audience at WWE's SummerSlam event when he was unexpectedly interrupted. Brock Lesnar, who had been absent from WWE programming since 2023, made a shocking return to the ring. Lesnar attacked Cena with his signature "F5" finishing move, signaling a potential renewal of their long-standing rivalry. This appearance marks Lesnar's first since being named, but not charged, in a lawsuit involving former WWE chairman Vince McMahon.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic legislators has fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum for a vote on a contentious new congressional map. The proposed redistricting plan, supported by former President Trump, could create five additional GOP-leaning districts, strengthening the party's majority. The Democrats, who traveled to Chicago, argue the map is a "racist, gerrymandered" power grab and are protesting what they call a "corrupt special session." Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers removed from their positions if they do not return.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for significant travel disruption as Storm Floris is expected to bring strong winds on Monday. The Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for most of Scotland, cautioning of a potential "danger to life" and damage to property. A yellow warning is also in effect for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland, with gusts predicted to reach up to 70mph in exposed areas. Several train and ferry operators have already canceled services and are advising passengers to alter their travel plans.</p>

          <p>According to an Israeli official, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for a "military solution" to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas. This shift in strategy comes amid a perceived lack of interest from Hamas in reaching a diplomatic deal. The push for expanded military operations coincides with growing protests in Tel Aviv, where families of the hostages are demanding their government secure their release, citing their deteriorating health. The situation is further complicated by a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with widespread hunger and malnutrition reported.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent Biologics and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's biotechnology sector. This development indicates a maturation of the industry, which is increasingly creating value for patients and government payers without relying on investor funding. Innovent's financial turnaround is expected to be driven significantly by sales of its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide. The success of these firms, which listed in Hong Kong under rules for pre-profit companies, signals a new phase of financial stability for Chinese biotech start-ups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has allocated an extra £100 million to intensify efforts against illegal people smuggling across the English Channel, following a record number of crossings this year. The new funding will support the National Crime Agency with up to 300 more officers and advanced technology to target smuggling networks. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the investment would help track and dismantle the criminal gangs responsible. This initiative is part of the government's broader strategy, which also includes a proposed new offense for advertising illegal crossings online.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a new system to dramatically increase the survival rate of combat drones. The concept involves fitting small or medium-sized drones with side-mounted rocket boosters for "terminal evasion." These boosters would allow a drone to perform sudden, high-G maneuvers in the final moments before a potential missile impact, making it difficult for air defense systems to track. Digital simulations of the technology suggest it could improve a drone's ability to survive an attack to nearly 90 percent.</p>

          <p>A recent report highlights the significant and often prohibitive costs associated with egg freezing, a medical procedure growing in popularity among women seeking to preserve their fertility. The average all-in cost for a single cycle can range from $12,000 to $13,000, and multiple cycles are often recommended to increase the chances of a future successful pregnancy. While some employers are beginning to offer coverage, the majority of women must pay out-of-pocket for the procedure, storage, and subsequent IVF treatments. Experts also caution that the procedure does not guarantee a successful birth.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated a new AI model named Genie 2, which can create playable, interactive 3D environments from a single static image or text prompt. This technology represents a significant leap in generative AI, moving beyond simple image and video creation. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis explained that the primary goal is to build a "world model" that can understand and simulate our physical world. Such technology could be used not only for entertainment but also to train AI agents and robots in a vast array of simulated environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, prominent economist Jeffrey Sachs cautioned that persistent sabre-rattling by the United States towards China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to conflict. He argued that the US initiated the trade war and must show prudence, as both nations have reasons to cooperate and can inflict mutual damage. Sachs also advised that China should focus its export growth on markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America rather than relying on the US and Europe. He expressed hope that rationality would prevail but noted any agreements with the unpredictable Trump administration are unstable.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, forcing the pilot to declare an emergency. The pilot of Flight 108 issued a "mayday, mayday, mayday" call to air traffic control while the Boeing 787 was ascending. The aircraft safely returned to Dulles, where it was met by emergency crews, and no injuries were reported among the 219 passengers and 11 crew members. The flight was subsequently canceled, and the airline made alternate travel arrangements for affected customers.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck the region. An aviation alert was issued for aircraft, though no populated areas were directly threatened by the ash cloud. Seismologists suggest the powerful earthquake may have triggered the eruption, explaining that seismic waves could have disturbed the magma system of a volcano that was already close to erupting.</p>

          <p>A pest control worker in North Yorkshire, England, discovered a massive rat measuring over 22 inches from nose to tail inside a residence. Local councilors shared a photo of the rodent, which they compared to the size of a small cat, to highlight what they describe as a "growing problem" in the area. They stated that this was not an isolated incident and called for more significant action to address the recurring rodent issue. The story has gained national attention, which local officials hope will spur a more effective response to the infestation.</p>

This athletic setback concludes a difficult week for Richardson, who was arrested days earlier in connection with a domestic violence allegation. As the defending 100-meter world champion, she automatically receives a spot to compete in that event.</p>
