        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview with Dr. Phil, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made several inaccurate statements regarding vaccine safety and the FDA's approval process, contradicting established scientific consensus and public health recommendations. Kennedy advised parents to "do your own research" before vaccinating their children, echoing a sentiment that gained traction during the pandemic and is often used to justify vaccine hesitancy. Experts like Dr. Paul Offit and Dr. Peter Hotez criticized Kennedy's remarks, highlighting the dangers of relying on misinformation from unreliable sources. The FDA commissioner also refuted Kennedy's claims, emphasizing the rigorous safety evaluations vaccines undergo before licensure. Optimism surrounding the situation is low due to the spread of misinformation by a public figure.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's efforts to secure greater control over a highway and public beach near its Starbase launch facility in Boca Chica, Texas, have been thwarted by state lawmakers. The Texas House State Affairs Committee rejected a bill that would have granted SpaceX increased authority, amidst ongoing disputes over beach closures required for test flights and launches. These closures have sparked legal challenges and protests from local residents and environmental groups, who cite damage to sensitive habitats and endangered species. Elon Musk's company has faced previous fines for environmental violations and criticism for its handling of environmental concerns in the area. The rejection of the bill underscores the challenges SpaceX faces in balancing its ambitions with local community and environmental interests.</p>

Khalil, who has been approved for deportation, claims the Trump administration is eroding his rights, while the Department of Homeland Security argues he lied on his visa applications by failing to disclose his employment with the Syrian office in the British Embassy in Beirut. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Khalil "hates America" and his privilege to be in the country should be revoked. The judge in Louisiana will decide if he will be deported to Syria or Algeria.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have won the Canadian federal election, but will form a minority government, requiring them to negotiate with other parties to pass legislation. Carney has pledged to prioritize the relationship with the U.S. under President Trump, and quickly introduce legislation focused on securing Canada's economy in the face of U.S. tariff headwinds. The Bloc Québécois and the NDP could play a role in helping the Liberals pass their legislation, with the Bloc Québécois leader suggesting a "truce" among parties.

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders that rolled back some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors and others complained would backfire on U.S. manufacturing. The changes will modify Mr. Trump’s tariffs so carmakers that pay a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, for example on steel and aluminum, or on certain imports from Canada and Mexico, according to the orders. However, the rules do not appear to protect automakers from tariffs on steel and aluminum that their suppliers pay and pass on. General Motors abandoned a previous forecast for solid profit growth this year as a result of the uncertainty created by Mr. Trump’s trade policies.</p>

However, sensitive sectors like electric vehicles and critical minerals may remain challenging unless Washington softens its stance towards Canada.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a narrow victory in Monday's election, falling just short of a majority in Parliament. The Liberals will need support from other parties to pass legislation, including confronting President Trump’s economic and sovereignty threats. Despite the close margin, the result marks a significant turnaround for the Liberals, who were predicted to lose badly before Trump's tariffs and Carney's rise to leadership. Trump and Carney spoke by phone, agreeing on the importance of Canada and the United States working together as independent nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs his administration put into place earlier this month, as the car industry grapples with regulatory uncertainty and additional costs due to the levies. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies. Under the order, additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years.</p>

          <p>UPS announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting effort linked to delivering fewer packages from Amazon, its biggest customer. The layoffs will impact slightly over 4% of its workforce and are part of a plan to consolidate facilities and workforce. UPS expects to save $3.5 billion this year as a result of its consolidation plan. The company said the reduction of package volume from Amazon is a choice to focus on revenue quality, and increase domestic operating margin and profitability.</p>
