          <p>A new report in the medical journal The Lancet declares plastic pollution a grave and growing global crisis, with health-related economic losses exceeding $1.5 trillion annually. The review of existing evidence links plastics to a range of diseases and developmental issues, from infancy to old age, including impaired reproductive potential, diminished cognitive function, and increased risk of cancer. Researchers are urging delegates at upcoming UN talks to agree on a meaningful international treaty, comparing the scale of the plastic crisis to that of climate change and emphasizing the urgent need for action.</p>

          <p>Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has publicly requested donations of unwanted small pets, such as rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as horses, to be used as food for its predators. The zoo states this practice is part of its responsibility to mimic the animals' natural food chain, providing them with "whole prey" for better nutrition and welfare. Donated animals are gently euthanized by trained staff, with the zoo emphasizing that this ensures nothing goes to waste and supports the natural behavior of its captive carnivores.</p>

Authorities have arrested a suspect, whom Vogler identified during the attack, and stated the incident stemmed from a personal matter unrelated to Vogler's political position.

          <p>US rapper Soulja Boy, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

          <p>Hopes for an ambitious global treaty to curb plastic pollution are diminishing as negotiators gather in Geneva for what was intended to be the final round of talks. Efforts to cap virgin plastic production are being threatened by opposition from petrochemical-producing countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia, as well as the Trump administration in the U.S. Diplomats and advocates fear this resistance will lead to a watered-down deal focused on waste management rather than addressing the root cause of pollution, despite warnings that plastic production is set to triple by 2060.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has awarded CEO Elon Musk a new share package worth approximately $29 billion, aiming to incentivize his continued leadership at the company. This move comes after a Delaware court invalidated his previous, larger 2018 pay package, a decision Musk is appealing. The company justified the new award by highlighting the intense competition for AI talent and stating it is imperative to retain Musk as Tesla pivots towards becoming an AI and robotics-focused company, in addition to his other ventures.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Nancy Mace has officially launched her campaign for governor of South Carolina, positioning herself as a GOP firebrand ready to take on the state's establishment.

          <p>Tensions are high in Switzerland as it faces a looming deadline for a potential 39% U.S. tariff on its goods, a rate set by the Trump administration. The Swiss business community is alarmed, warning of massive job losses and trade disruptions, as it would be difficult to offset such a high duty. Economists have noted the risk of a Swiss recession has increased, which could put deflationary pressure on the economy. The Swiss government is reportedly open to tweaking its trade proposal, but uncertainty remains over whether a deal can be reached in time.</p>

          <p>According to legal scholars and former prosecutors, the U.S. Department of Justice is being transformed into President Trump's "personal weapon" to an unprecedented degree. This article details concerns over the department's actions, including launching investigations into Trump's political rivals and firing dozens of staff who worked on cases involving the president or his allies. Critics argue these moves are eroding the rule of law and the DOJ's independence, turning it into a tool to serve Trump's personal and political agendas rather than the Constitution.</p>

          <p>A tense encounter occurred between Taiwanese and mainland Chinese coastguard vessels near the strategically important Dongsha Islands, which are controlled by Taiwan but claimed by Beijing. Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration reported that it dispatched a patrol ship to shadow a Chinese vessel that had entered its claimed waters and was ignoring radio warnings. At one point, the two ships were separated by only one nautical mile before the Chinese vessel eventually changed course and withdrew from the area.</p>

          <p>A new Harris Poll reveals that while American children are living a heavily screen-based life, their primary desire is for more real-world freedom and unstructured play with friends. The article argues that a culture of parental fear has severely restricted children's independence, pushing them toward the online world as their only unsupervised social space. It highlights emerging initiatives aimed at restoring free play and concludes that granting kids more real-world autonomy is the most effective way to reduce their screen time.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has instituted a new policy requiring the vetting of all future event attendance by Pentagon officials, effectively restricting their ability to speak at outside conferences and forums. The move is intended to prevent the department from lending credibility to organizations that run counter to the administration's values. Critics, including former military officers, warn that this will create an intellectual bubble at the Pentagon, stifling strategic thinking and cutting off the military from challenging outside perspectives and ideas.</p>

First elected in 2016, she had a rapid political rise, serving as finance secretary and narrowly losing the 2023 SNP leadership contest before becoming deputy to First Minister John Swinney.</p>

          <p>The global fur industry has experienced a dramatic collapse, with the number of animals farmed for fur plummeting from over 140 million in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This sharp decline is attributed to a combination of successful animal rights campaigns, major fashion brands like Gucci and Prada adopting fur-free policies, and external factors such as COVID-19 outbreaks on mink farms. The shift represents a profound change in consumer and corporate ethics, turning fur from a luxury status symbol into an ethical misstep.</p>
