          <p>Taiga Nishino, a 15-year-old Japanese figure skater, is generating buzz after successfully landing two quadruple jumps. Despite being too young for the next Winter Olympics, Nishino has drawn comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata. He landed a quad toe loop at a competition in Yokohama and previously executed a quad salchow at the junior high school nationals. Nishino, who started skating at 5, aims for success at the world junior championships and Junior Grand Prix Final, showing significant growth and potential in the sport.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed military academies to base future admissions solely on merit, ensuring the most qualified candidates are admitted. In a memo to West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy, and the U.S. Air Force Academy, Hegseth stated that prioritizing merit ensures lethality and warfighting readiness. Military departments have 30 days to certify that race, ethnicity, or sex will not be considered in applications, with merit potentially weighted by athletic talent, prior military service, or performance at a preparatory school. Hegseth emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards for a strong officer corps.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni regarding their film "It Ends with Us." Swift's spokesperson dismissed the subpoena as a tabloid clickbait attempt, emphasizing Swift's minimal involvement with the film, limited to the use of her song "My Tears Ricochet." Lively sued Baldoni for sexual harassment, which he denies, and Baldoni countersued Lively for defamation, alleging extortion and invasion of privacy, referencing Swift and Ryan Reynolds as Lively's "most trusted partners." The trial is expected to begin in March 2026.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, with both sides exchanging airstrikes and drone attacks. Pakistan accused India of targeting its air bases with missiles, while India claimed to have thwarted Pakistani drone attacks. The conflict has prompted international concern, with the G7 urging restraint. The escalating tensions have led to civilian casualties and economic disruptions, including the suspension of cricket leagues. Asfandyar Mir notes that the conflict has eliminated the diplomatic space that had allowed the neighbors to avoid a devastating conflict.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for trespassing at the Delaney Hall detention center while protesting its opening. The facility, which houses migrants detained by ICE, has faced opposition from Baraka, lawmakers, and advocates citing safety concerns and lack of proper permits. DHS claims members of Congress "stormed the gate" at the ICE facility and that the facility detains "murderers, sexual assault perpetrators, suspected terrorists, and gang members." Baraka was charged with trespassing and later released, with Governor Murphy condemning the arrest as outrageous and Menendez and Watson Coleman suggesting it was an act of intimidation.</p>

          <p>The White House is blocking Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's choice for chief of staff, reflecting concerns about turmoil in his office. Stephen Miller said the Trump administration is considering suspending habeas corpus, a move that would escalate efforts to deport people without due process. A judge ordered the release of a detained Tufts student, while Trump floated cutting tariffs on China from 145% to 80% before trade talks. The US is also considering a special status agreement with Greenland and a lawyer who prosecuted Trump is expected to appear before the House judiciary committee.</p>

Martin's nomination failed after Senator Thom Tillis withdrew his support. He will now serve as an associate deputy attorney general and pardon attorney.

          <p>The Soviet spacecraft Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space and is expected to return within the next few days. While the exact landing location is unknown, experts believe it will likely splash down in the ocean. Although the spacecraft was designed with a heat shield, it is expected to break apart upon impact, and any surviving pieces legally belong to Russia.</p>

The union insists that bold investment decisions are necessary to support offenders in the community and prevent reoffending. The Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that the prisons and probation budget has decreased by 12% since 2007, underscoring the need for increased funding.</p>

          <p>Asfandyar Mir argues that the ongoing military conflict between India and Pakistan marks a dangerous shift in their rivalry, eliminating diplomatic space. India's rise as a geopolitical power has hardened its stance toward Pakistan, while Pakistan's internal crises have made it unwilling to back down on Kashmir. The conflict threatens crucial guardrails, such as the Indus Waters Treaty, and the United States has stepped back from its role as a crisis manager. Mir urges the United States and other global partners to intervene and restore equilibrium in the region to prevent a potentially catastrophic escalation.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that the U.S. may reduce tariffs on China, writing on Truth Social that "80% Tariff on China seems right!" ahead of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese negotiators in Switzerland.

Wall Street analysts believe that the market is eager for a resolution to the trade war, and that a reduction below 80% would likely result in a positive reaction.

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels along the West Coast from Oregon to the Mexican border, effective through October 31. Naturally occurring toxins, which can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and amnesic shellfish poisoning, make the mussels potentially poisonous to humans. Biotoxins accumulate in the mussels' tissue as they consume toxic algae, and cooking does not reliably eliminate the toxins. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt due to frequent testing.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge in Vermont ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked, allegedly due to her political speech. Judge Sessions criticized the government's lack of evidence against her, aside from an op-ed she co-wrote. Ozturk's lawyers argued she was targeted for criticizing the university's response to resolutions regarding Israel. She testified about her humanitarian work and involvement in school groups, and the judge cited declarations attesting to her peaceful character.</p>

The ACLU welcomed her release, emphasizing that no one should be imprisoned for expressing their beliefs.

Consumer Reports and Democratic senators have condemned the firings, arguing that they undermine the independence of the CPSC.
