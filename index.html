          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had the Signal messaging app installed on a computer in his Pentagon office to facilitate easier communications in a building with poor cell service and restrictions on personal phones. According to sources, Hegseth had cables installed to connect a private computer to Signal in early March, enabling him to send and receive instant messages in areas where personal cellphones are not permitted. This move highlights the challenges of communication within the Pentagon and the lengths to which officials go to maintain connectivity. The use of a personal computer raises security questions given the sensitive nature of discussions that may occur in his office.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with wounded veterans, former President Donald Trump noticed a 'Let's Go Brandon' sticker, leading to a lighthearted exchange. The phrase originated in 2021 during a NASCAR interview when a reporter misheard a crowd chanting an expletive directed at Joe Biden, and it has since become a popular way to express disapproval of the former president. Following the sticker exchange, Trump addressed the veterans and their families, expressing his appreciation for their service and love for America. The event also marked the rollout of several new executive orders focused on education and technology initiatives.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges related to his former son-in-law's employment at an airline. Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law, Seo, was hired despite lacking relevant experience, in exchange for the airline's CEO leading a state-funded agency. Seo received around $150,000 in salary and housing support, which prosecutors claim constitutes bribes intended for Moon. This indictment comes amid a series of prosecutions against officials in Moon's administration, with his party condemning it as politically motivated.</p>

This move reflects Pop Mart's strategy to maintain profitability amidst rising costs due to tariffs, leveraging its position as a high-end brand targeting adult buyers.

This strategy signals US resolve to Beijing, particularly as the US administration appears to be disengaging from Europe and NATO.

However, SK Hynix warned of potential demand volatility due to macroeconomic uncertainties, including US tariff policies.

          <p>Chinese robot makers are largely unaffected by US tariffs due to their unique products and lack of international competition. At the Canton Fair, an automated cafe by Dolphin Robot Technology garnered significant interest, demonstrating strong demand despite rising US duties. The company is not bearing the tariff or lowering prices, as US customers have rigid demand for their specialized robotic solutions. This situation highlights the competitive advantage of certain Chinese manufacturers in niche markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive actions aimed at both higher education and K-12 schools, targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. One action focuses on college accreditors, aiming to prevent them from imposing discriminatory DEI-based standards. Another promises new discipline guidance for K-12 schools, ensuring policies are based on objective behavior rather than DEI. These orders aim to cement Trump's conservative agenda in education, rolling back policies from the Biden administration and bolstering workforce training.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has criticized Volodymyr Zelensky for harming peace negotiations by refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea. Trump suggested that a deal to end the war was 'very close,' but Zelensky's stance would prolong the conflict. US Vice-President JD Vance outlined a vision for a deal that would 'freeze the territorial lines' close to where they are today, implying territorial concessions from both sides. Trump's remarks hint that the US might be willing to recognize Russia's seizure of Crimea, a move contrary to international legal norms.</p>

This has united union electrical workers and big utilities against rooftop solar owners and environmental groups. Opponents argue that the bill would unfairly reverse incentives and harm the solar industry, while supporters claim it would alleviate the financial burden on non-solar ratepayers.</p>
