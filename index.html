          <p>The Trump administration took a significant step by halting Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, citing concerns over a records request as part of a Homeland Security investigation. This move, described as a major escalation, targets a crucial funding source for the university, as international students constitute a significant portion of Harvard's student body and tend to pay larger shares of education costs. Harvard is likely to challenge this decision legally, arguing it undermines the university's academic and research mission. The article highlights the potential harm to the Harvard community and the nation, with concerns raised about the impact on the university's global standing. </p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have dropped to their lowest point in 2025, averaging around 8.23%, making it an opportune time for homeowners to consider this financing option. Unlike HELOCs, home equity loans offer fixed rates, providing stability against potential future rate hikes. The article suggests that homeowners with pressing financing needs, such as consolidating high-interest debt like credit card balances, should consider acting now. However, the article also cautions borrowers to carefully calculate repayment costs, as their home serves as collateral and could be subject to foreclosure if they fail to meet their obligations.

          <p>The House Republicans passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act", a tax and spending package that could significantly impact household finances. The bill proposes making President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, increasing the SALT deduction limit, and expanding the child tax credit, which would disproportionately benefit higher earners. However, to offset these tax cuts, the bill includes substantial cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, potentially impacting millions of individuals and households. The legislation also introduces new savings accounts for children, reduces student loan benefits, and creates a tax deduction for car owners who pay interest on auto loans for vehicles assembled in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fire broke out on the roof of St Michael's Hospital in Bristol, a maternity hospital, leading to the evacuation of pregnant women and babies. The fire, involving solar panels, was extinguished within an hour, and the hospital reopened by 19:00. Mothers-to-be and babies were moved outside of the building, supported by midwives who brought out milk and fruit. No injuries have been reported, and the cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move that the chamber's parliamentarian says Republican lawmakers may not have the right to make. The three waivers set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including the "EV mandate" requiring all new vehicle sales in California to be zero emissions by 2035. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Attorney General Rob Bonta announced they would sue the Trump administration over the vote. Voting down California's waivers is expected to impact cities and states across the country, as 16 additional states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>

Residential solar installer Sunrun plummeted 37%, while Enphase and SolarEdge also saw substantial losses.

While the manufacturing tax credit remained relatively unscathed, analysts expect the Senate to make changes to the legislation.</p>
