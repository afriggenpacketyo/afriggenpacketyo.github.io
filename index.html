          <p>Following high-level trade talks in London, U.S. and Chinese officials announced they have reached a framework agreement to implement the Geneva trade consensus, which was previously discussed during a phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The deal aims to de-escalate tensions arising from alleged violations of the Geneva trade agreement, including a 90-day suspension of tariffs added in April. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the agreement awaits approval from both presidents, after which implementation can begin. Economist Jianwei Xu noted that unresolved details still require internal discussion, making the potential for concrete breakthroughs uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asian economies are accelerating their shift away from reliance on the U.S. dollar, driven by geopolitical uncertainties and a desire to reduce exposure to U.S. policy decisions. The trend, known as de-dollarization, involves countries seeking to use their own currencies for trade and investment, reducing foreign exchange risks. ASEAN nations have committed to boosting the use of local currencies in trade and investment, while the BRICS nations are developing alternative payment systems to bypass traditional systems like SWIFT. This shift is reflected in central bank reserves gradually reducing their dollar share, and investors increasingly hedging their U.S. dollar exposures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second consecutive night of unrest, with petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks thrown at police. The violence followed a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, with tensions fueled by rising concerns about immigration. Democratic Unionist Party assembly member Paul Frew expressed fears of fatalities and emphasized the need to stop the violence, which he said drowns out sympathies for victims of sexual violence. The police responded with baton rounds and water cannons, and are investigating the incidents.</p>

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is facing a vote of confidence in parliament after a recent presidential election defeat where right-wing nationalist Karol Nawrocki won, backed by the opposition Law and Justice party and Donald Trump.

Critics argue that Tusk has made little progress since taking office, and the opposition views the election loss as the beginning of his downfall.

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump asserted that the president has the authority to abolish national monuments, disavowing a 1938 determination that previous presidents' monument designations are irreversible. The opinion argues that presidents can cancel monument designations if protections aren't warranted, potentially impacting monuments like Chuckwalla National Monument and SÃ¡ttÃ­tla Highlands National Monument in California. Environmental groups have criticized this stance, while supporters argue that some monument boundaries hinder mining for critical minerals. The decision revives a long-standing debate over presidential power and land conservation.</p>
