          <p>Japan is reportedly considering importing 60,000 tons of U.S. rice annually without tariffs. This move comes as Japan seeks to fulfill trade agreements and stabilize its rice market. The potential agreement could ease trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan and provide American farmers with a new export market. Further details are awaited as negotiations progress.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration over its decision to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants, claiming the move is unlawful. University President Alan M. Garber argues that the funding freeze would severely impact critical disease research, including studies on pediatric cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. The lawsuit alleges that the administration is using the funding as leverage to control academic decision-making at Harvard. The White House responded by stating that the "gravy train of federal assistance" was ending, with potential implications for other elite universities as well.</p>

          <p>China's economy shows signs of improvement due to a September 2024 stimulus package, with GDP growth reaching 5.4% in the first quarter. Policymakers acknowledged falling demand as a major problem, particularly in the real estate market. To alleviate pressure on local governments, the central government allowed them to expand debt financing through long-term bonds. The government is also cautiously maintaining faster credit growth and understands that stabilizing property and stock markets could mitigate the slowdown in consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Russia is leveraging Libya's infrastructure for human trafficking and smuggling to bolster its interests in the Mediterranean and exert pressure on the EU. With its military presence in Syria uncertain, Russia has shifted focus to Libya, supporting warlord Khalifa Haftar and using mercenary groups like the former Wagner Group. These groups facilitate the smuggling of weapons, drugs, fuel, and people, with migrants often exploited and trafficked to Europe. The Kremlin is accused of weaponizing migration to destabilize the EU's external borders, highlighting the complex interplay between geopolitical interests and human suffering.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar briefly fell below 140 yen following President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. Trump's remarks raised concerns about the central bank's independence, leading to dollar selling. The yen was also bought on speculation that the U.S. administration will urge Japan to address the yen's weakness against the dollar during upcoming finance minister meetings. Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks ended mixed, and gold prices hit an all-time high in yen terms due to investor wariness over the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>The article explores alternative systems for the NFL draft, aiming to balance league parity with player agency. Proposed changes include flip-flopping the draft order to reward teams closer to the playoffs, implementing a draft lottery similar to the NBA, and waiving the eligibility rule to allow players to enter the draft earlier. A salary pool system is also suggested, enabling players to negotiate contracts and choose teams. These ideas seek to address concerns about top prospects being drafted by struggling franchises and to provide players with more control over their careers.</p>

          <p>The climate crisis is intensifying the global housing crisis by driving up costs and reducing available housing stock. Extreme weather events and rising sea levels are changing the appeal of neighborhoods, leading to climate gentrification and displacement of low-income residents. Post-disaster housing costs are also skyrocketing, as seen in cities recovering from wildfires and hurricanes. Solutions include increasing housing supply, shifting housing density to low-risk areas, and retrofitting existing housing for climate resilience. A broader societal approach to housing affordability and climate change is essential to address these challenges.</p>

          <p>Burkina Faso's military government claims to have thwarted a coup attempt planned by masterminds in Ivory Coast. The government alleges the plot aimed to sow total chaos and culminate in an assault on the presidency. Interim President Ibrahim Traore has frequently accused Ivory Coast of harboring his opponents. Since taking power in 2022, the junta has cracked down on dissent, with kidnappings and extrajudicial arrests on the rise.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes Max Verstappen's driving style and the recent five-second penalty he received at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix for gaining an advantage by leaving the track. Stewards cited driving standards guidelines, noting Verstappen did not give Oscar Piastri enough room. The analysis suggests Verstappen races hard and pushes the limits of the rules, often forcing stewards to make decisions. While he is unlikely to drastically change his approach, he may learn from this incident. Piastri's assertive racing has also laid down a marker to Verstappen.</p>

          <p>Conor Benn and Chris Eubank Jr. are set to face off in the ring at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, continuing the rivalry that began with their fathers in the early 1990s. The fight was originally scheduled for 2022 but was cancelled after Benn failed a drugs test. Eubank is looking for revenge, while Benn is predicting a one-sided beatdown. The fight has been steeped in history, hatred, and hostility.</p>
          <p>65/100</p>

          <h2>The Vivienne Hid Ketamine Addiction to Protect Family</h2>

          <p>The sister of James Lee Williams, known as The Vivienne, revealed that the family only learned of his ketamine addiction after watching Drag Race UK. Williams died in January from cardiac arrest caused by ketamine use. The family is now campaigning to encourage open conversations about substance abuse and reclassify ketamine as a Class A drug. His sister believes the stigma around addiction prevented him from seeking help. A full inquest is scheduled for June 30.</p>
