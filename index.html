          <h2>Dropshipping Businesses Face Challenges Due to Trump's Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses are feeling the pressure as Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods lead to decreased revenue and logistical problems. The cumulative tariff of 145% on Chinese goods is forcing businesses to raise prices and shift focus to the European market. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, is a major blow. Industry insiders emphasize the importance of diversifying markets to navigate the changing trade environment, as some businesses may no longer be viable. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is causing central banks worldwide to tread carefully, weighing the benefits of currency devaluation against potential risks. A weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, potentially allowing central banks to cut rates. However, devaluation could spark inflation, invite U.S. retaliation, and trigger capital flight, especially in emerging markets. While some central banks, like the ECB, have cut rates, most are avoiding a currency war to maintain economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Noor Abdalla, wife of detained Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, gave birth to their son while Khalil remained in a Louisiana detention facility. ICE denied Khalil's request for temporary release to attend the birth, despite suggestions of alternatives like an ankle monitor. Abdalla criticized ICE's decision as a deliberate attempt to cause suffering and silence support for Palestinian rights.
