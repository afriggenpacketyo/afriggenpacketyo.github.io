          <p>A Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite having protected legal status.  A federal judge ordered the government to return him by April 7th, citing an "administrative error." The Justice Department denied the existence of a $6 million deal with El Salvador for housing deported migrants, contradicting statements from Secretary of State Rubio and DHS Secretary Noem. The White House Press Secretary, meanwhile, labeled Abrego Garcia an MS-13 leader.</p>

          <p>President Trump granted TikTok a second 75-day extension to comply with a law requiring it to sell its US assets or face a ban.  ByteDance, TikTok's owner, is negotiating a potential solution with the administration, but an agreement hasn't been reached.  The extension comes amid reports of several potential buyers, including Amazon and a consortium led by Frank McCourt. Trump suggested linking a deal to tariff relief on Chinese imports.</p>

          <p>A UCLA report suggests that Los Angeles's "mansion tax" (Measure ULA) has unintended consequences, slowing commercial development.  The study found a significant drop in non-single-family property transactions after the tax's implementation.  This decline, according to the report, leads to reduced property tax revenue and hinders the creation of much-needed multifamily housing.  The report suggests reforming the tax to target only properties not reassessed in 20 years.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced another day of significant declines, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down nearly 6%, extending losses for the week to around 9% and 10%, respectively.  Despite a brief rally following comments about Vietnam negotiating tariff reductions, the market downturn resumed after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech.  Powell's acknowledgement of higher inflation and slower growth dampened investor optimism.  However, homebuilders and related stocks outperformed the broader market due to falling bond yields, suggesting potential benefits from lower mortgage rates.</p>
