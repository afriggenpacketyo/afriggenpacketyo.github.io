          <p>Law enforcement in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, provided new details on an ambush that killed two firefighters and critically injured a third. The suspect, identified as 20-year-old Wess Roley, allegedly started a fire to lure the first responders to the scene before opening fire. Authorities believe the act was intentional and are investigating the motive. The suspect was found deceased at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, while the fire has grown to 26 acres but is not threatening structures.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move intended to support the country's path toward peace and stability under its new government. The action dismantles the broad sanctions architecture but retains targeted restrictions against former leader Bashar Al Assad and his collaborators. Administration officials emphasized that the move is an opportunity for Syria's interim government to rebuild and normalize relations, including potentially joining the Abraham Accords, without the U.S. dictating its political framework.</p>

However, a money market account, despite its variable rate, could yield more over a nine-month period.
