          <p>Eliana Pinckney, daughter of Reverend Clementa Pinckney who was killed in the Mother Emanuel AME Church shooting ten years ago, shared her reflections on the tragedy and its impact on her life. Despite the pain, Pinckney, now a professional actress, focuses on putting good into the world and wishes for growth for the shooter, Dylan Roof, rather than harboring hatred. Other survivors and family members of victims have also spoken about forgiveness and healing in the years following the shooting, emphasizing the importance of finding peace and resilience.

Decker, an Army veteran, is considered dangerous and may be armed, and the U.S. Marshals Service is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his arrest. The search involves ground and air support from multiple agencies, with authorities urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity, especially in remote areas.

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 1.7% year-on-year in May, the sharpest decline in eight months, though slightly better than economists' forecasts. This decline follows a 2% gain in April and comes amid concerns highlighted by the Bank of Japan about moderating growth due to trade factors. Imports also fell by 7.7% in May, reflecting broader economic challenges and trade tensions, especially with the United States, where Japan faces potential tariff increases if a trade deal is not reached soon. Falling exports had already made a dent in Japan's GDP.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels, and restaurants, allowing ICE to resume worksite enforcement operations. This decision comes after concerns were raised about the impact of aggressive immigration enforcement on industries relying on foreign-born workers. The administration maintains that worksite enforcement is crucial for safeguarding public safety, national security, and economic stability, targeting illegal employment networks. Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.</p>

The ruling allows individuals to choose their gender identity on passport applications, including selecting "X" for those who do not identify as male or female. This decision expands on a previous ruling and is based on the finding that the policy discriminates against transgender Americans and lacks a rationale related to an important governmental interest.

          <p>England forward Alessia Russo says she prefers to stay off social media during major tournaments because of how "damaging" abuse can be. Russo, along with her Lionesses teammates, addressed the issue of online abuse and its potential impact on players' mental health as they prepare for the European Championship. Other players, like Grace Clinton and Lauren James, also shared their strategies for avoiding toxic environments and dealing with abuse. Russo wants to help younger players in the squad deal with it.</p>

          <p>Rancho Palos Verdes will restart a program to trap and relocate peafowl in an effort to curb the growing population and limit nuisance behaviors, with a goal of reducing the numbers by about 30%. The city has received numerous complaints about the birds' noise and damage to property, prompting the reinstatement of the trapping program in three neighborhoods. Trapped peafowl will be relocated to screened homes off the peninsula, with assurances that they will not be euthanized or treated inhumanely. The city's goal is to return the population to 2000 levels.</p>

Carney invited India to the summit due to its importance in global supply chains, and the leaders reaffirmed the importance of Canada-India ties based on mutual respect and sovereignty.

          <p>President Trump will sign an order extending the deadline for TikTok to separate from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, for another 90 days, marking the third delay since his inauguration. A deal to spin off TikTok's U.S. operations has remained elusive, with China's approval being a key factor. Despite the delays, Trump expressed confidence that a deal will eventually be reached, reiterating his support for the app. Congress has passed a law requiring ByteDance to sever ties with TikTok, citing national security concerns, but there has been little action to enforce it.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by ICE agents at the city's main immigration court, but was released from custody four hours later. Lander's arrest prompted strong reactions, with New York Governor Kathy Hochul calling it "total bulls---." The Department of Homeland Security stated that Lander was arrested for "assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer," but federal prosecutors said they were "continuing to investigate the actions involving" Lander. As of 5 p.m. ET, Lander had not been charged with a crime.</p>
