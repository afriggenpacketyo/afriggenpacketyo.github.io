          <p>Nell Wulfhart, a decision coach, suggests individuals often overthink decisions due to fear of regret, advising to minimize deliberation for faster clarity. She recommends creating a list of personal values and envisioning an ideal life in the future to align choices with long-term goals. Wulfhart emphasizes that some regret is inevitable and encourages testing options to gather tangible data for informed decisions. She also cautions against seeking advice from too many people, suggesting limiting input to three to five supportive individuals with relevant experience to streamline the decision-making process.</p>

          <p>During a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, a man allegedly threw Molotov cocktails at the group, injuring twelve people, two critically. Omer Shachar, a group co-leader, described the immediate panic as friends caught fire and the efforts to extinguish the flames. The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, was apprehended and charged with a federal hate crime and attempted first-degree murder, reportedly stating his desire to kill Zionist people.

          <p>Ford Motor reported a 16.3% increase in U.S. sales for May, driven by an employee pricing program and a rise in hybrid vehicle sales, despite a drop in electric vehicle sales. The automaker's gains in traditional internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids offset a 25% decline in EV sales compared to the previous year. The employee pricing program, which continues through the Fourth of July weekend, was introduced as President Trump's auto tariffs on imported vehicles took effect. Ford has also announced price increases on some vehicles imported from Mexico, citing seasonal adjustments and tariff impacts.</p>

He highlighted the Justice Department's success rate in Jan. 6 trials, emphasizing that convictions were based on overwhelming evidence. Rosen also criticized the marginalization of prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases following Mr. Trump's Inauguration-Day pardons, viewing it as an affront to the department's independence.</p>

          <p>After Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis was revealed, Donald Trump initially offered a message of sympathy, but quickly shifted to promoting conspiracy theories about Biden's health. Trump questioned why the public wasn't notified sooner and alluded to theories about Biden's alleged use of an "autopen" due to cognitive impairment. Others in Trump's circle, including Donald Trump Jr., also made disparaging comments about Jill Biden and the diagnosis. Trump reposted a message suggesting Biden was a "decrepit corpse" used to steal the 2020 election, illustrating a rapid departure from initial well-wishes to renewed political attacks.</p>

          <p>Efforts by President Trump and congressional Republicans to mandate proof of citizenship for voter registration are encountering difficulties at both federal and state levels. A federal executive order was blocked by a judge, and similar legislation lacks Senate support, while state-level initiatives have seen limited success, even in Republican-controlled areas. In Texas, a sweeping bill requiring proof of citizenship for all registered voters failed to pass the legislature, with concerns raised about implementation and voter inconvenience.

          <p>Hong Kong's legalization of stablecoins is drawing attention from mainland Chinese institutions, with Citic Securities predicting a surge in tokenized real-world assets (RWA) in the city. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a reference asset, could facilitate mainland companies' RWA projects in Hong Kong by providing market stability. The new law is expected to enhance digital currency payment and settlement interfaces, while CSC Financial analysts believe Hong Kong is entering a phase of accelerated RWA tokenization. The move coincides with global regulatory interest in stablecoins, as the US Senate advances its own bill on these assets.</p>

          <p>New U.S. restrictions on Chinese labs testing consumer electronics bound for the U.S. are raising concerns about potential price increases for American consumers. The FCC's ban on labs deemed security risks, due to their connections with the Chinese Communist Party and military, may limit choices and increase costs. Analysts question the enforceability of the rules, given the complex global supply chains involved in electronics manufacturing. While the move aims to curtail China's influence, it could ultimately impact American consumers through higher prices and reduced options.</p>

However, those desiring a more comfortable retirement lifestyle will need a higher income than before, according to the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA). While basic costs have fallen due to lower energy bills, the expenses associated with moderate and comfortable retirement standards have increased. The report serves as a guide for planning retirement savings, with calculations developed by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University.</p>

Br√ºckner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for an unrelated offense, with authorities fearing he may disappear if not charged in connection with Madeleine's disappearance.

          <p>The OECD forecasts a sharp economic slowdown in the U.S., with GDP growth expected to decline to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, citing the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. The report attributes the slowdown to new import duties, which have increased the effective tariff rate to the highest level since 1938. These tariffs are expected to drive up inflation, projected to reach 3.9% by the end of 2025, as costs are passed onto consumers. The OECD also warns of downside risks, including policy uncertainty and potential financial market corrections. (not investment advice)</p>
