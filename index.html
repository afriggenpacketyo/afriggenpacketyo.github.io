          <p>House GOP leaders have introduced a short-term funding bill to keep the government operating until November 21, aiming to prevent a shutdown at the end of the month. The legislation extends current funding levels and includes an additional $88 million for security for lawmakers and other federal officials, a response to recent political violence. However, the bill faces significant opposition from Democrats, who are demanding negotiations to include extensions for Affordable Care Act subsidies, creating a contentious path to passage before the deadline.</p>

The suit alleges that the newspaper and publisher engaged in a coordinated campaign to damage his reputation with a series of libelous articles and a book ahead of the 2024 election. In response, a spokesperson for The New York Times stated that the lawsuit lacks merit and is an attempt to stifle independent reporting, vowing to defend their First Amendment rights.</p>

While rates have decreased from their recent peaks, they remain competitive, offering savers a way to lock in a fixed return and protect against anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The analysis provides specific earning examples based on different deposit amounts, positioning long-term CDs as a stable option compared to variable-rate accounts like high-yield savings.

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has released a deposition transcript in which former Attorney General Bill Barr stated he was never made aware of any evidence of criminal ties between Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein. Barr told investigators that he believes any incriminating information would have leaked if it existed and that prosecutors would have pursued it, regardless of the individual's profile. The transcript appears to counter claims from some Democrats that Barr's testimony did not clear the former president of potential wrongdoing in the matter.</p>

          <p>Recent and conflicting changes in federal guidance regarding COVID-19 vaccines have created significant confusion and obstacles for pregnant Americans, a group at higher risk for severe illness. The shifting recommendations from the FDA and CDC have left patients, pharmacists, and even doctors uncertain about eligibility, prescription needs, and insurance coverage for booster shots. In response to this federal ambiguity, some states have begun to establish their own clearer policies to ensure vaccine access for this vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was in the Chicago area as federal authorities ramp up immigration enforcement under a new initiative called "Operation Midway Blitz." The operation is intended to target undocumented immigrants with criminal records, a focus DHS claims is necessary due to the city's sanctuary policies. This increased ICE presence, along with the arrival of the agent who led a similar crackdown in Los Angeles, has created significant anxiety within Chicago's immigrant communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nearly two years after its historic strike, SAG-AFTRA has established a new fund to provide performers with bonuses from successful streaming projects. The fund will collect 25% of viewership-based bonuses from high-budget streaming shows and distribute it to a wider pool of workers, including background actors and stunt performers. This "Robin Hood" initiative is a key gain from the 2023 contract, designed to create a new income stream that compensates for the loss of traditional syndication residuals in the streaming age.</p>

          <p>Recent Wall Street research has reinforced positive sentiment for several key technology and finance stocks.

Similarly, Goldman Sachs received a price target increase from Wells Fargo due to robust activity in capital markets, while Microsoft was praised for a 10% dividend hike that analysts believe contributes to a strong total return profile for investors.

          <p>For the first time since it sank in 1916, artifacts have been recovered from the HMHS Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. A specialized deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and first-class silver trays from the wreckage, which lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. The Britannic was serving as a World War I hospital ship when it struck a mine; the recovered objects will be conserved and displayed in a new museum in Greece.</p>
