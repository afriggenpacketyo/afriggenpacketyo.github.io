            <p>A helicopter carrying a family of Spanish tourists crashed into New York's Hudson River, resulting in the deaths of all six people on board, including three children and the pilot. The incident occurred near the West Side of Manhattan, and video footage showed the helicopter falling upside down into the river. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, which is one of the deadliest helicopter incidents in New York City since 2018. The helicopter, a Bell 206 commonly used for sightseeing, had taken off from Lower Manhattan and flown past several landmarks before crashing near Jersey City.</p>

            <p>Lawyers for Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil argued that the government failed to provide evidence justifying his deportation, claiming his presence poses a foreign policy risk. The government presented a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserting Khalil's alleged role in "antisemitic protests" creates a hostile environment for Jewish students. Khalil's attorneys criticized the memo, arguing it targets First Amendment activity and has no bearing on foreign policy. They plan to request to depose Rubio to understand the grounds for his determination, arguing that the case could set a precedent for silencing critics.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant drop, surrendering gains from the previous day, due to ongoing concerns about the trade war between the U.S. and China. The market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that tariffs on Chinese imports would be 145%, not 125% as initially announced, contributing to market volatility. Despite positive inflation data, uncertainty surrounding trade policies continues to weigh on investor sentiment, with analysts cautioning that the situation remains uncertain.

            <p>A federal judge ruled that everyone in the U.S. illegally must register with the federal government and carry documentation, siding with the Trump administration's enforcement of an existing requirement. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that the registration requirement will be enforced to the fullest extent, warning illegal immigrants to leave the country. The DHS will enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act, which includes criminal penalties for migrants who fail to register or notify the government of address changes. Registration is mandatory for anyone 14 and older without legal status, requiring fingerprints and address information.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings in lower court. The court acknowledged that the deadline for Garcia's return had passed, but required the government to ensure his case is handled as if he had not been improperly deported. Garcia, who was granted withholding of removal to El Salvador due to potential persecution, was mistakenly sent to a Salvadoran prison. The case sparked controversy after a Justice Department lawyer admitted the deportation was an error.</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring inflation down to 2%. However, experts caution that inflationary risks remain a threat due to ongoing tariffs orchestrated by President Trump, which could impact consumer prices later in the year. While the CPI data showed easing inflation due to lower fuel and travel prices, egg prices continued to increase. Economists anticipate the Federal Reserve will likely hold rates steady at its next meeting, but potential rate cuts may occur later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>CBS has lost distribution rights to "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" after a Los Angeles court denied the network's request to block Sony from taking over.

            <p>President Trump is facing accusations of manipulating stock markets through his social media posts, particularly after a "buy" recommendation was followed by an announcement pausing tariffs, leading to a market surge. Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts are calling for investigations into potential insider trading or deliberate manipulation. The White House defends Trump's actions as reassuring the markets, but critics argue that such statements from senior officials are inappropriate and potentially unethical.</p>

            <p>A pioneering project at the University of Bristol is tracking the brain development of babies and toddlers to understand how they develop key skills. Researchers are using specially designed games and brain-scanning technology to measure skills like inhibitory control and working memory. The study is unique because it involves the children of participants who have been part of a health-focused project since the 1990s, providing a lifetime of data that could reveal links between parental health and child brain development. The findings could help support children who might struggle academically or socially.</p>

            <p>A tattoo belonging to a man from Derbyshire, Pete Belton, has appeared in a US government document used to identify members of a notorious Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua (TdA), despite the man having no connection to the group. Mr Belton said it was a "bit strange, bit funny at first" but is now worried the family trip he booked to Miami with his wife and daughter in August might end up "being a six month all-inclusive holiday to Guantanamo". His tattoo - a clock face with the date and time of his daughter's birth - was included in a set of nine images for "detecting and identifying" TdA members.</p>

            <p>A new drug, capivasertib, has been approved for use on the NHS in England to slow the progression of incurable breast cancer. The drug, which is a targeted therapy, works by blocking the activity of a protein molecule called AKT, which drives cancer growth. Clinical trials showed that capivasertib, when combined with hormone therapy, doubled the time the cancer took to grow and shrank tumours in a quarter of patients. The drug is expected to benefit around 3,000 women a year.</p>

            <p>California and a coalition of states are suing the Trump administration over its attempt to claw back COVID-19 school funds, arguing that the funding is still needed to address ongoing challenges. The states allege that Education Secretary Linda McMahon's decision to rescind the funding violates the Administrative Procedure Act. They are calling for the court to restore access to the funds through March 2026. The lawsuit argues that the withdrawal of funding will harm students by cutting after-school programs, mental health services, and classroom technology.</p>

            <p>Apple’s sprawling supply chain, from Chinese factories to global retail stores, faces unprecedented uncertainty as the US-China trade war intensifies, according to analysts and consumers. While Chinese consumers are not rushing to Apple stores to pick up iPhones over fears of price hikes – most iPhones are not subject to Beijing’s retaliatory 84 per cent tariffs on US goods – there are signs of mounting concerns about supply disruptions and rising costs generally. Prices for existing iPhone models sold in the country are unlikely to change. However, the iPhone 17 series could see higher prices as part of a global adjustment.</p>
