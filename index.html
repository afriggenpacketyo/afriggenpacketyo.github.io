        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a recent wave of drone incursions, European leaders convened in Copenhagen to discuss bolstering continental defenses. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen highlighted an ongoing "hybrid war," advocating for increased production of drones and anti-drone systems. The European Commission has proposed several flagship projects, including an air defense shield and a controversial "drone wall," aiming for total self-defense capabilities by 2030. While some leaders, like France's Emmanuel Macron, express skepticism about simplistic terms, the urgency is underscored by Ukraine's experience, which is seen as a vital source of knowledge for developing effective countermeasures.</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has presented a proposal to cut over $2 trillion from federal spending. In a letter to the Office of Management and Budget, she identified numerous areas for reduction, including unspent COVID-19 funds, unused federal office space, and various government programs she deemed nonessential. Ernst stated the shutdown offers a "golden opportunity" to address government waste and put taxpayers first. This move comes as Senate Democrats continue to block a short-term funding bill, creating a stalemate with no clear resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have revealed that two victims of the recent synagogue attack, one of whom died, appear to have been hit by police gunfire. Chief Constable Stephen Watson stated that a provisional determination from the Home Office Pathologist indicated one deceased victim had a wound consistent with a gunshot. The suspect, Jihad Al-Shamie, was not armed with a firearm, leading investigators to conclude the victims were tragically struck as officers engaged the attacker. The victims were reportedly behind a door inside the synagogue as worshippers tried to prevent the assailant from entering.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has officially shut down after Republican and Democratic lawmakers failed to agree on a spending bill. The impasse stems from Democrats' demands to extend expiring tax credits for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and reverse cuts to Medicaid, which Republicans have so far rejected. As a result, non-essential government services are suspended, and approximately 750,000 federal workers face unpaid leave. Unlike past shutdowns, the Trump administration has indicated it may use the situation to permanently reduce the size of the federal workforce, raising the stakes of the political conflict.</p>

The article criticizes her analysis that the party "governed left," calling it a "perverse revision of history" that ignores austerity, a hard Brexit, and Liz Truss's mini-budget. This flawed perspective, the editorial contends, leads to poor policy choices like repealing the Climate Change Act and threatening to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

The school board asserts that Roberts should never have been presented as a finalist and is seeking to recoup taxpayer money and address the reputational damage caused by the scandal.</p>

          <h2>Readers Express Support for Democratic Strategy in Government Shutdown, Citing It as Necessary Leverage</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collection of reader opinions indicates broad support for the Democratic Party's decision to force a government shutdown to secure policy concessions. Many view it as the only leverage Democrats have against the Trump administration, particularly to protect healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. While acknowledging the negative impact on federal workers and public services, most respondents felt the fight was necessary to counteract Republican policies. Some expressed concern about the Democrats' communication strategy and whether the focus on healthcare was the most effective approach to challenge the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri led the field in Friday practice for the Singapore Grand Prix, setting the fastest time of the day. His teammate, Lando Norris, had a more difficult session, finishing fifth and expressing frustration with his performance after a collision with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the pit lane. The incident, for which Ferrari was fined, caused damage to Norris's front wing. The practice was also disrupted by two separate crashes involving Mercedes' George Russell and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson, limiting the teams' ability to conduct long-run race simulations.</p>

          <p>Both Google and Apple have removed apps from their online stores that allowed users to anonymously report the locations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Apple's decision to remove "ICEBlock" and similar apps came after direct pressure from the Department of Justice, which cited safety risks to law enforcement officers. The move follows an incident where a gunman who attacked a Dallas ICE facility had reportedly used such an app. The app's creator had defended it as a tool to help immigrants, drawing parallels between current enforcement and historical persecution.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has given Hamas a Sunday deadline to accept a U.S.-backed peace plan for Gaza, warning that "all hell" will break out if the agreement is not reached. The 20-point plan proposes an immediate ceasefire and the release of 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian detainees. While mediators are pushing for a positive response, a senior Hamas figure has indicated the group is likely to reject the proposal, partly because it requires handing over all hostages within the first 72 hours. The plan also controversially outlines a future governance structure for Gaza headed by Trump.</p>

          <h2>Expiring ACA Health Insurance Tax Credits Emerge as Central Issue in Government Shutdown</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The core dispute in the U.S. government shutdown revolves around enhanced premium tax credits that help 22 million Americans afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. These subsidies, which have nearly doubled ACA enrollment since 2021, are set to expire at the end of 2025. Democrats are demanding an extension as a condition for funding the government, a position supported by a majority of Americans, including many Republicans. If the credits expire, average premiums could more than double in 2026, potentially forcing millions to drop their coverage.</p>

          <p>Internal government data shows that nearly 40% of the 3,550 arrests made during the Trump administration's federal law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., have been for civil immigration violations. While the operation was publicly framed as an effort to combat violent crime, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has made almost 1,400 administrative arrests of individuals for deportation. The remaining arrests were for criminal offenses, including homicide, narcotics, and firearms charges. The data highlights a significant focus on immigration enforcement within the broader crime-fighting initiative in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece raises concerns about the Trump administration's increasing use of the military for domestic law enforcement and its efforts to reshape military leadership into a partisan force. The article points to the deployment of troops to U.S. cities against governors' wishes and a recent meeting where the president referred to Democratic-run cities as an "invasion from within." The author questions at what point military leaders will decide that their constitutional duty supersedes loyalty to a president who is blurring the lines between military and civilian roles, especially after the dismissal of several high-ranking, non-partisan officers.</p>

While her recovery is ongoing, she was happy to reunite with friends and teachers. The incident has prompted her family to advocate for common-sense gun legislation to address the high rates of gun violence in the U.S.</p>
