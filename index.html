          <p>Deadly sectarian clashes between Bedouin and Druze communities continue in southern Syria’s Suweida province, despite a recently announced ceasefire. The violence, which has reportedly killed over 900 people in the past week, has drawn international attention, with the U.S. calling for an end to the conflict and Israel intervening militarily to protect the Druze minority. Syrian government forces deployed to the area have been accused of participating in the attacks, undermining the fragile peace deal brokered by the United States. The ongoing fighting highlights the deep-seated tensions and the complex, multi-faceted nature of the Syrian conflict.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of individuals missing after recent devastating floods, lowering the count from nearly 100 to just three. This positive development follows extensive verification efforts by local, state, and federal agencies, confirming that most of the initially unaccounted-for people are safe. The update provides a measure of relief to the community, although the overall death toll from the floods across Texas remains high at 134. The focus now shifts to recovery and supporting those affected by the disaster.</p>

          <h2>Federal Funding Cuts Threaten Viability of Rural Public Radio Stations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 00:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) are posing an existential threat to small, rural radio stations across the United States. Operations like Allegheny Mountain Radio, which serves remote communities in West Virginia and Virginia, rely on CPB funding for a majority of their budget and provide essential local news, emergency information, and community programming. The funding clawback, championed by the Trump administration over claims of political bias at NPR and PBS, disproportionately affects these non-partisan local outlets. Station managers now face difficult decisions about cutting staff or shutting down, which would leave many rural listeners without a primary source of daily information.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has pledged a significant donation to fund a medical center within an Israeli settlement in the Binyamin region, a move that could have complex geopolitical repercussions. The financial support for the Nanasi Medical Centre at Sha’ar Binyamin was announced in the presence of Israeli settlement leadership. This action by Taiwan is notable as it involves direct investment in a controversial settlement project, distinguishing it from other forms of international aid. Experts suggest this development could backfire, potentially straining relationships and inviting criticism from nations that view the settlements as a violation of international law.</p>

          <p>A man intentionally drove his vehicle into a crowd of people outside a Hollywood nightclub early Saturday, injuring 30 individuals, with at least seven reported in critical condition. Police identified the driver as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez, who allegedly made a U-turn before plowing into the line of patrons. Following the crash, bystanders pulled Ramirez from the car and attacked him, during which he was shot by an unknown individual who then fled the scene. The incident, which is being investigated as an assault with a deadly weapon, has been described by the Los Angeles mayor as a heartbreaking tragedy.</p>

          <p>A California woman, Linda Duffey Gwozdz, has been convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey. The case gained notoriety for its unusual defense, in which she claimed the shooting was an accident that occurred while the couple was playfully mimicking the cartoon character Elmer Fudd. Prosecutors argued she shot her sleeping husband twice in the head in a planned execution. After an initial trial ended with a deadlocked jury, a second jury found her guilty, leading to a sentence of 40 years to life in prison.</p>

Investigators later identified another man, George Steven Burch, through DNA evidence found on the victim's clothing. Burch's location data from Google Dashboard then placed him at the crime scene, leading to his arrest and subsequent conviction for first-degree intentional homicide.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee visited the Palestinian Christian village of Taybeh in the occupied West Bank to condemn a recent arson attack on the historic Church of Saint George. Residents have blamed extremist Israeli settlers for the fire at the fifth-century Byzantine-era ruins. Huckabee called the desecration of a place of worship an "act of terror" and insisted that those responsible must be found and prosecuted. The visit comes amid a surge in settler violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges the newspaper defamed him by publishing a story about a supposedly "bawdy" birthday letter from the early 2000s that it claimed was signed by Trump for Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling the letter a fake and accusing the paper of journalistic failures. Dow Jones has stated it has full confidence in its reporting and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The use of nicotine pouches, also known as white snus, is rapidly increasing among young people in the UK, raising significant health and regulatory concerns. These products, which can contain extremely high levels of nicotine, are easily accessible as there is currently no minimum age for purchase. Health experts and users report severe side effects, including significant gum damage, and addiction. Trading Standards officials are frustrated by their inability to prevent sales to children and are urging the government to pass legislation that would regulate these highly addictive products.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that the first solar panels installed in English schools under the government's "Great British Energy" initiative were manufactured by Chinese firms. This has sparked criticism from MPs, who raised concerns about using taxpayer money to support supply chains linked to alleged forced labor in China's Xinjiang region. While the state-owned GB Energy stated that all contracts complied with modern slavery rules, the revelation has fueled debate over ethical procurement and the failure to support the UK's domestic renewables industry. China dominates the global solar panel market, making it difficult to avoid Chinese-made products.</p>

          <p>Motorists across the UK are finding creative ways to avoid increasingly expensive airport drop-off fees, often referred to as "kiss-and-fly" charges. At Edinburgh Airport, where the fee is £6 for a 10-minute stay, drivers are waiting in nearby lay-bys and coordinating pickups via phone to bypass the official zone. This behavior highlights widespread frustration with the charges, which have been raised at over half of the country's busiest airports in the last year. Critics argue the fees are exorbitant, while airports maintain they offer free alternatives further from the terminal.</p>

          <p>In occupied areas of Ukraine, Russia is conducting a comprehensive campaign to indoctrinate children and erase their national identity. This effort involves forcing children to participate in pro-Russian patriotic events, teaching a Russian curriculum that justifies the invasion, and utilizing state-sponsored youth military groups like Yunarmia. Russian soldiers give "bravery lessons" in schools, and thousands of children have been taken on tours to Russia or relocated to "re-education camps." International bodies have condemned these actions as violations of humanitarian law, with the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for President Putin for the unlawful deportation of children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and help families struggling with "holiday hunger." However, opponents, including many teachers, emphasize the need for a long break to recharge and plan, while also questioning whether it would truly lower holiday costs. While some school districts have already moved to a five-week summer, a recent consultation in Wales showed the proposal remains highly divisive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global transition to green technology is creating a severe environmental crisis in Chile's Atacama Desert, home to the world's largest lithium reserves. Soaring demand for lithium, essential for electric car and solar batteries, has led to intensive mining operations that extract vast amounts of water from the arid region. This has resulted in shrinking lagoons, dying native flora, and threats to wildlife like flamingos, while also depleting the freshwater resources of local indigenous communities. The situation raises a critical question about whether the solution to one environmental problem is unintentionally creating another.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a shift in public savings habits, encouraging people to move money from low-interest cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) to stocks and shares ISAs. The goal is to channel some of the £300 billion held in cash ISAs into investments that can fuel the UK economy. The government plans to launch a new advertising campaign and have banks message customers about investment opportunities. However, the proposal has sparked debate, with concerns that pushing risk-averse savers, particularly women, into volatile markets could backfire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent season of the Iowa Public Radio podcast "Unsettled" delves into the multifaceted gender gap in American society. The series examines critical areas where divides are growing, particularly among young people. It explores the education achievement gap, where boys are increasingly falling behind girls in literacy and overall success, and the widening political gap, where young men and women show starkly different voting patterns. The podcast attributes some of these trends to the influence of social media and differing life vulnerabilities that shape political and social views.</p>
