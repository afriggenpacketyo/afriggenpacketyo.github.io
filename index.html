          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures driven by weak domestic demand and trade tensions.

Price wars in the automotive sector and falling property prices have contributed to the downward pressure on consumer prices. Chinese policymakers have been urged to halt the brutal price wars to improve business profitability and efficiency, as analysts watch for further monetary easing to stimulate the economy.

          <p>China has started mass production of the worldâ€™s first non-binary AI chip, a breakthrough led by Professor Li Honggeâ€™s team at Beihang University in Beijing. This innovation merges binary and stochastic logic, enhancing fault tolerance and power efficiency in intelligent control applications. The chip aims to overcome the power and architecture limitations of traditional binary systems, which consume significant power and struggle to communicate with non-silicon chips. This development could potentially circumvent some U.S. chip restrictions and marks a significant advancement in China's technological capabilities.</p>

          <p>Energy firms in Britain are being paid substantial sums to curtail power generation due to grid capacity limitations, leading to increased energy bills. Wind farms like Moray East and West are compensated for reducing output when the grid cannot handle the electricity they produce. Simultaneously, gas-fired power stations are paid to generate more electricity, creating inefficiencies in the system. The government is considering regional electricity markets to address these issues, but the proposal has sparked debate and concerns over potential cost increases for some consumers.</p>
