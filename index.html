          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the legendary West Hollywood Italian restaurant that became a favored spot for celebrities for decades, has passed away in Belgrade, Serbia at the age of 90. Born in the former Yugoslavia, Tana was a professional soccer player and actor before opening his eponymous eatery in 1964. The restaurant, known for its classic red-sauce dishes and discreet service to A-listers like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney, became a Hollywood institution. Tana sold the establishment in 2009 but it continues to operate, preserving a piece of old Hollywood charm.</p>

          <p>A planned visit by United States trade representatives to New Delhi has been called off as trade relations between the two nations continue to sour. The cancellation comes after the Trump administration imposed significant tariffs on Indian exports, partly as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized the tariffs as unfair, pointing out that many Western nations continue their own trade with Russia. The U.S. is India's largest export partner, making the ongoing dispute a critical economic issue for New Delhi.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decades-old guideline known as the '85% rule,' which sets speed limits based on the speed of the fastest drivers, is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies. This rule often leads to speed limits being raised even in areas with high pedestrian traffic, creating a feedback loop where faster driving justifies higher limits. Amid rising road fatalities, safety advocates and some officials are pushing for new methods that consider a road's context, including pedestrian and cyclist safety. However, the change faces resistance from those who argue that drivers naturally travel at a road's safest speed, regardless of the posted limit.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method that renders biological tissues, like the brain, transparent, allowing for exceptionally clear and accurate 3D imaging. The technique creates what is described as an 'ionic glassy tissue' that preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used for analysis. This breakthrough produces vivid images of the brain's intricate inner workings. The process also allows for the long-term storage of the preserved tissues at low temperatures, maintaining their structural integrity for future study.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Alaska, President Trump has expressed support for a proposal from Vladimir Putin that would see Russia take full control of Ukraine's Donbas region in exchange for a peace agreement. This represents a significant policy shift, moving away from previous calls for a simple ceasefire and toward a territorial settlement. The proposal would freeze the current front lines elsewhere but require Ukraine to surrender the remaining territory it controls in Donetsk. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has consistently rejected ceding territory, is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West.

Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, while his counterpart walked numerous batters in the early innings. The Dodgers capitalized on every mistake, building an early lead that the Padres could not overcome in the pivotal series.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer will join French and German leaders for a call to coordinate their stance on the war in Ukraine before President Zelenskyy's critical visit to the White House. The meeting comes after President Trump shifted his position to support a peace deal with Russia that could involve Ukraine ceding territory, bypassing calls for a ceasefire first. European allies are emphasizing that any path to peace must involve President Zelenskyy and that Ukraine's sovereignty cannot be negotiated without its participation. The leaders praised Trump's efforts to end the conflict but stressed the need for Ukraine to be at the center of future talks.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is heading to Washington for peace talks in a precarious position, facing pressure from President Trump to accept a deal potentially favorable to Russia. Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, Trump abandoned the call for a ceasefire, instead advocating for a direct peace agreement that reportedly includes Ukraine ceding the Donbas region. This shift has alarmed Kyiv, as it suggests Russia could negotiate from a position of military advantage while the conflict continues. Zelenskyy must participate in the talks to avoid being seen as an obstacle to peace, despite the risk of being undermined.</p>

While increased public awareness may be leading more people to seek early treatment, officials are reminding the public of the importance of prevention and proper tick removal to avoid diseases like Lyme.</p>

Miller's defense admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia.

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier based on a 'scissor wing' concept previously explored by NASA. The innovative design features a single, central wing that rotates up to 90 degrees during flight. This allows the aircraft to maximize lift at lower speeds for takeoff and then pivot the wing to become a streamlined 'waverider' at hypersonic speeds up to Mach 5. The adaptable design aims to solve the fundamental aerodynamic conflict between low-speed efficiency and high-speed drag, potentially revolutionizing long-range, high-speed flight.</p>

The article suggests that infidelity can stem from a lifetime of being 'good' and repressing one's own identity, the burnout from perfectionism, or having poor boundaries developed in childhood. Other powerful catalysts include being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage, or experiencing a significant recent loss, such as the death of a parent, which can trigger a re-evaluation of one's life and priorities.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the Pembrokeshire coast. After purchasing the abandoned island for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook the immense challenge of making it habitable, which included cutting through solid rock to install plumbing. The historic, off-grid property is now a fully modernized 40-bed venue with its own nightclub and is back on the market for £3 million. The project was a massive undertaking, requiring helicopters to bring in equipment and a crew living on-site for years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has abruptly stopped issuing visitor visas for critically ill and injured children from Gaza who require medical treatment in the United States. The decision came after Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer, launched an online campaign against the program, falsely describing arriving children as 'Islamic invaders.' The State Department announced a 'full and thorough review' of the temporary medical-humanitarian visa process. Aid organizations have condemned the move, stating it will have a devastating impact on their ability to provide life-saving care to vulnerable children from the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>Claire's, the accessory and ear-piercing chain that was a cultural touchstone for tweens in the 1990s and 2000s, has appointed administrators for its UK and Ireland operations amid falling sales. The brand has struggled to compete with the rise of online fast-fashion giants like Shein and Temu, which can produce trendy items faster and at lower prices. Social media has also changed how young people shop, with many now following older influencers and aspiring to more premium brands. While its stores will continue trading for now, the future of the once-ubiquitous high-street presence is uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing summer heat, parts of the UK are showing signs of an early autumn, with leaves turning yellow and falling from trees. Experts are calling this a 'false autumn,' a stress response from trees and plants suffering from the prolonged hot and dry conditions. While some crops like melons have thrived, the drought is causing classic autumn fruits like apples and blackberries to ripen prematurely. This phenomenon could have negative knock-on effects for wildlife that depend on these food sources to survive the winter, highlighting nature's struggle to cope with a changing climate.</p>

          <p>A 66-year-old homeless man in Washington D.C., Bill Theodie, became an unwitting part of a political campaign when President Trump posted a photo of him by his tent, using it as an example of the city's decay. Just four days later, following Trump's announcement of a federal crackdown on homelessness, city officials sent a bulldozer to clear the encampment where Mr. Theodie had lived for years. The article details the human impact of the policy, as Mr. Theodie and others were forced to move with little notice, highlighting the disconnect between political rhetoric and the reality for unhoused individuals.</p>

          <p>After 11 years, a legal inquest into the mysterious 2013 death of wealthy British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers in Kenya has concluded that his cause of death cannot be determined. His body has remained in a mortuary for over a decade due to a bitter and protracted legal battle between his children from two different marriages. The case involved accusations that his second wife poisoned him to inherit his estate, a hurried burial, a subsequent exhumation, and conflicting forensic reports. The magistrate's ruling leaves the family still divided on where to rebury him, ensuring the dispute will continue.</p>

          <p>As they prepare to receive their GCSE exam results, a group of 16-year-old students opened letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, just after returning to school from a major COVID-19 lockdown. The time capsule letters, written when they were 11, reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, asking questions like 'Do you have a girlfriend yet?' and 'Are you still happy?'. The exercise provides a poignant reflection on how the pandemic disrupted their education and shaped their formative years, while also showcasing their enduring optimism and ambition.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Vladimir Putin during their Alaska summit, intended to address the plight of children in the Ukraine war. While administration officials suggested it raised the issue of Russia's abduction of Ukrainian children, the released text of the letter is notably opaque. It speaks generally of children's dreams and innocence and vaguely implores Putin to 'restore their melodic laughter' with a 'stroke of the pen.' The letter makes no direct mention of the abductions or the war crimes for which Putin has been indicted by the International Criminal Court.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a seemingly quaint German-style tourist village in Chile, was formerly known as Colonia Dignidad, a secretive and abusive cult that also served as a torture and execution center for the Pinochet dictatorship. The Chilean government now plans to expropriate part of the property to create a memorial for the victims, a decision that has divided the community. Some of the remaining German residents, who were themselves victims of the cult's leader, oppose the plan as it includes their homes and businesses. Other former residents and victims' families support the memorial to ensure the site's horrific past is not forgotten.</p>
