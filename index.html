        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New UK government figures indicate a strong correlation between student attendance in the first week of the school year and their overall presence throughout the academic term. The data reveals that over half of pupils who were partially absent in the first week of September 2024 later became "persistently absent," missing at least 10% of school. In response, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize full attendance from the start of the new term to combat the high absenteeism rates that have persisted since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>A senior Republican source has indicated that Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will not run for reelection in 2026, a decision that will conclude her tenure after two terms. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first female combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate and the first woman from Iowa in the chamber. Her departure is expected to trigger a competitive race for the open seat, with Representative Ashley Hinson reportedly planning to announce her candidacy. Ernst has held several leadership positions within the Senate Republican conference during her time in office.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Cowboys are mourning the death of Lee Roy Jordan, a celebrated linebacker and key member of the team's famed "Doomsday Defense," at the age of 84. Jordan was instrumental in leading the Cowboys to their first Super Bowl victory in 1971 and retired in 1976 after a career that included five Pro Bowl selections. As a former first-round draft pick from Alabama, he remains second on the franchise's all-time tackles list and was among the first players inducted into the team's Ring of Honor under owner Jerry Jones.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his office has not been contacted about the deployment and suggested President Trump has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. The governor's remarks highlight escalating tensions between state and federal authorities over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement, following similar deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is uniquely positioned to offer the world a new diplomatic framework based on "constructive pragmatism." As a leader of a major economic power that is not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo could leverage Indonesia's influence to foster cooperation over confrontation. This approach is presented as a potential corrective model for an international system often paralyzed by competing national agendas and great power rivalries. The article posits that the world needs practical action rather than revolutionary rhetoric to address global challenges.</p>

          <h2>Chicago Mayor Issues Executive Order to Counter Potential Federal Agent Deployment</h2>

          <p>In anticipation of a potential deployment of federal agents, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights. The "Protecting Chicago Initiative" seeks to prevent local police from being deputized by federal forces, requires federal agents to be clearly identifiable, and restricts them from wearing masks. This preemptive measure is a direct response to credible reports of imminent federal action and underscores the city's firm opposition to what local leaders fear could become a militarized presence on their streets.</p>

For toddlers, the consensus leans toward being screen-free until age three to encourage exploration of the physical world, with a maximum of one hour per day for children aged two and up. As children grow, recommendations shift to supervised, limited use to ensure time for social interaction, imaginative play, and motor skill development. The article stresses that content quality and parental engagement are more critical than strict time limits.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has expressed concern that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could threaten the central bank's political independence. Patterson warns that politicizing the Fed could erode its credibility and lead to negative long-term economic outcomes, such as higher inflation, a weaker currency, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she argues the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy and its standing.

          <p>Jack Grealish has made an immediate impact at Everton since joining on a season-long loan, transitioning from a bench player at Manchester City to a key playmaker for his new club. In his first few appearances, he has already registered multiple assists, earning man-of-the-match honors and praise from manager David Moyes. The move is seen as an opportunity for Grealish to secure more playing time and potentially reclaim a spot on the England national team ahead of the World Cup.

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health. In an op-ed, Sanders criticized Kennedy's long-standing anti-vaccine stance and advocacy for scientifically rejected conspiracy theories, which he argues are now being implemented as dangerous policy. The call for resignation follows the firing of the CDC director and subsequent resignations of other top officials, adding to a growing bipartisan backlash against Kennedy's leadership and what critics describe as a war on science.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with plans to eliminate over 500 jobs at Voice of America and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM). The announcement was made by acting CEO Kari Lake, who framed the move as a necessary reduction of federal bureaucracy. This action comes just one day after a federal judge blocked Lake from firing VOA's director and ordered her to comply with previous rulings to restore the news organization's operations. A group of employees suing the agency called the move abhorrent and vowed to continue their legal fight.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing their legal efforts to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling against such an injunction in Epping. The court overturned a temporary ban on using The Bell Hotel for asylum accommodation, a decision seen as a key precedent. However, councils in West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne have stated they will press on with their own legal actions, primarily citing planning law violations. The ongoing disputes highlight the intense local and national debate over the government's asylum accommodation policies.</p>
