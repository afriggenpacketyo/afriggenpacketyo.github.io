          <p>An infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient in the world to undergo personalized gene-editing treatment using CRISPR technology. Diagnosed with severe Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase 1 deficiency (CPS1), a rare and often fatal metabolic disorder, KJ received three infusions of the experimental therapy to fix the mutated gene in his liver. So far, he has shown no serious side effects and is gaining weight while thriving in the hospital. Doctors are optimistic about the potential of personalized CRISPR treatment to address other rare genetic disorders, though KJ will need careful monitoring for the rest of his life.</p>

The visit aims to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries, but comes after the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State claimed Afrikaners face "egregious discrimination" in South Africa, a characterization Ramaphosa disputes. The new law in South Africa allowing the state to seize land without compensation has heightened concerns among Afrikaners, though the government denies racial motivation.</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Transportation Authority committee has voted to move forward with a $9.4-billion budget for the 2026 fiscal year, despite a looming deficit and uncertain federal funding for the Olympics. The budget prioritizes public safety and transit operations, but future funding is uncertain due to economic factors and state investment decisions. Critical parts of Metro's Olympics plans are yet to be nailed down, including funding for buses and potential impacts from the city of Los Angeles' financial crisis.</p>
