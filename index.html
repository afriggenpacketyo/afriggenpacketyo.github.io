          <p>The Israeli military has initiated an expanded ground operation in Gaza City, aiming to dismantle Hamas's military infrastructure and urging residents to evacuate south. The offensive follows a night of intense airstrikes, with local hospitals reporting numerous casualties. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Qatar for diplomatic talks, warning that the window for a negotiated peace settlement is rapidly closing. The situation is further complicated by escalating rhetoric from regional powers like Egypt.</p>

          <p>An independent commission established by the United Nations Human Rights Council has concluded there are "reasonable grounds" to believe Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The report cites actions such as killing members of the group and deliberately inflicting destructive living conditions, alleging that statements from Israeli officials demonstrate genocidal intent. Israel has categorically rejected the report, calling it "fake" and based on "Hamas falsehoods," while reiterating its position that its actions are a response to the October 7th terror attack.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has announced that five partially built homes in Laurel Canyon will be torn down, concluding a legal dispute that has spanned over two decades. The structures were part of a development halted in 2002, and subsequent owners failed to comply with demolition orders. The current developers reached a plea agreement, requiring them to demolish the dilapidated homes by 2026 or face significant penalties. This decision marks a resolution for the local community, which has long dealt with the dangerous and unsightly properties.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is planning to vote on a temporary spending bill this Thursday to fund the government through November 27 and avert a shutdown. Republican leadership is currently working to secure enough votes from within their party, as they can only afford to lose two members if Democrats vote in opposition. The timing is critical, as a delay could push Senate proceedings into the weekend, creating further uncertainty ahead of the September 30 deadline.</p>

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, stated that he does not expect a trend of major sports franchises going public, despite their soaring valuations. Speaking at a conference, Harris argued that sports assets have historically been valued more highly as private entities and that public markets may not embrace the long-term, win-focused spending strategies of team owners. He noted that private ownership allows for long-term perspectives, such as major stadium deals, without the short-term pressures of public shareholders.</p>

          <p>A 71-year-old man, George Zinn, has been arrested for obstruction of justice after allegedly making a false confession at the scene of Charlie Kirk's assassination. Authorities state that Zinn shouted "I shot him" to divert attention from the actual shooter, later admitting he wanted the real suspect to escape and hoped to become a "martyr." The actual suspect, Tyler Robinson, allegedly referenced Zinn's detention in text messages, noting police had "grabbed some crazy old dude." Zinn was also charged in connection with child sexual abuse material allegedly found on his phone.</p>

          <p>Executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, a company that owns numerous strip clubs, have been charged with bribing a New York state tax auditor to avoid paying over $8 million in sales taxes. The indictment alleges that over a decade, the auditor was given perks including complimentary trips, meals, and private dances at the company's clubs in exchange for favorable audit outcomes. New York's Attorney General stated the executives "shamelessly used their strip clubs to bribe their way out of paying millions." The company has disputed the allegations as baseless.</p>

He noted that concerns over drug pricing and rebates have led Lilly and other companies to pause or pull back on investments in the country. Ricks contrasted the UK's environment with more favorable markets, suggesting that capital flows to where it is most welcome.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell sharply on Tuesday, reaching its lowest point since late 2022. The drop to 6.13% appears to be driven by investor anticipation of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. However, analysts caution that this downward trend may not be guaranteed to continue after the Fed's announcement. Past instances of rate cuts have sometimes led to a paradoxical increase in mortgage rates, as market reactions can be unpredictable. (not investment advice)</p>
