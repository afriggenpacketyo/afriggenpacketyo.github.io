          <h2>PepsiCo Lowers Earnings Outlook Amid Tariff and Spending Concerns</h2>

          <p>PepsiCo has revised its earnings forecast downwards, citing anticipated challenges from new tariffs, global economic volatility, and cautious consumer spending. The company's international sales partially offset weaker demand in North America, but overall net sales dropped by 1.8% in the first quarter. CEO Ramon Laguarta stated that the company expects increased supply chain costs due to global trade developments, with consumer conditions remaining subdued in many markets. PepsiCo is taking actions to improve its North American performance, where both its food and beverage volumes have declined. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv resulted in at least nine fatalities and numerous injuries, marking one of the most severe strikes on the city since 2024. The attack occurred amidst stalled negotiations for peace, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cutting short his diplomatic trip to South Africa to return to Kyiv. The Russian military confirmed the strike, stating that they continue to target military and near-military objectives, with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense condemning the attacks as evidence that Russia is not seeking peace.

Russia disrupted Zelenskyy's visit with an airstrike on Kyiv, prompting him to cut short his trip. The visit underscores Ukraine's effort to gain international legitimacy beyond Europe, especially as Trump has criticized Zelenskyy and briefly paused military aid. For Ramaphosa, the visit is equally significant, as South Africa also faces pressure from the Trump administration, leading both countries to seek new alliances.</p>

The Mexican government has been engaged in a war against drug trafficking groups since 2006, with violence resulting in a high number of homicides. The Jalisco New Generation cartel was designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. in February.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a warning about "serious consequences" regarding Russia's plans to establish a naval base in Sudan. This move is seen as Moscow's attempt to expand its influence in Africa and establish a strategic military presence in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. The potential Russian naval facility raises concerns about regional destabilization and the disruption of global shipping routes. The warning comes as Sudan grapples with a civil war, with the U.N. describing the humanitarian crisis as the world's worst, and the U.S. is expressing deep concern about the Rapid Support Forces' declaration of a parallel government.</p>

          <p>Economic nostalgia, exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and the Trump-era tariffs, leads to detrimental policies. Both instances emerged from a fear of economic transformation and a longing for a romanticized past, resulting in costly mistakes that undermined the economies they were meant to protect. Trump's tariffs, like Smoot-Hawley, have hurt the very manufacturers they were intended to help, leading to layoffs and trade tensions. The lesson is that economies are dynamic, and trying to freeze them in place with trade barriers only makes the transition harder and more painful.</p>

          <p>Colossal Biosciences' claim to have resurrected the dire wolf from extinction has been met with skepticism from the genetics community, with some calling it "colossal baloney." Experts question whether the animals produced are truly dire wolves or merely gray wolves with minor genetic alterations. The company's marketing efforts, including a partnership with "Game of Thrones" author George R.R.

          <p>Energy secretary Ed Miliband is considering plans to introduce regional pricing for power that would give discounts to homes near infrastructure. The Daily Telegraph reported the government was "poised" to implement zonal pricing, which would split the country's single national power market into different regions and ultimately raise bills for southern England households. Miliband dismissed the story as "nonsense," saying he would not approve a plan that led to an energy price "postcode lottery". He did confirm that the government was looking to shake-up the energy market, which he said could involve "zonal pricing and reformed national pricing".</p>
