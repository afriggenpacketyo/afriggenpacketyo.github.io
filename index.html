          <p>Vishwaskumar Ramesh, the sole survivor of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India, described his harrowing experience of surviving the crash that killed 241 passengers and crew, along with five people on the ground. He recalled the plane crashing into a building shortly after takeoff, and his escape through a broken door, emphasizing the chaos and his initial disbelief at being alive. The plane, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, crashed into a medical college, also injuring many others inside the building, with Ramesh's brother calling his survival a 'miracle.'

          <p>Stock markets worldwide experienced a downturn, and oil prices surged following Israel's military strike on Iran, raising concerns about escalating tensions in the Middle East. S&P 500 futures contracts fell, and U.S. benchmark crude oil jumped significantly, with analysts suggesting that hopes for lower oil prices may be dashed. The attack, which targeted Iranian nuclear facilities and military personnel, prompted Iran to respond by launching drones at Israel, further exacerbating market anxieties. Analysts suggest that the primary economic risk lies in potentially higher oil prices, which could hinder efforts to reduce inflation.</p>

          <p>The Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) has provided assistance to approximately 50 households, including emergency accommodation for 14 families, following unrest in Ballymena. The violence began after a protest concerning an alleged sexual assault, with police reporting numerous injuries among officers and a racially motivated arson attack on a family in Coleraine. NIHE Chief Executive Grainia Long anticipates a rise in the number of people needing help and expresses concern about vulnerable households, particularly those with children.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, experts believe it's unlikely that Tehran will block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil artery, as retaliation. The Strait sees about 20 million barrels of oil pass through daily, representing nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments, but disrupting this flow could harm Iran's interests, especially its relationship with China, its largest oil importer. Analysts note that closing the Strait is likely physically impossible and would trigger further retaliation, as well as potentially impacting Iran's own access to goods. While attacks on tankers are possible, a full-scale blockade is considered unlikely due to the presence of the US Fifth Fleet.</p>

          <p>Investigators have reportedly recovered at least one of the "black boxes" from the wreckage of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India, which is crucial for determining the cause of the disaster.

          <p>Seven men have been convicted of sexually exploiting two teenage girls in Rochdale over a five-year period, during which the girls were repeatedly sexually assaulted. The victims, who were groomed from the age of 13, were treated as "sex slaves" and expected to engage in sexual activity with the men at any time, according to court testimony. The abusers, some of whom worked on market stalls or as taxi drivers, provided the girls with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and places to stay.

          <p>Summer Fridays, once a popular workplace perk, are becoming increasingly rare as companies shift towards more flexible work arrangements, such as work-from-home Fridays. While employees value summer Fridays highly, as they offer a chance to prevent burnout and boost morale, most workers are not offered any summer-specific benefits. As hybrid work schedules become more prevalent, fewer employees are commuting on Fridays, leading some companies to phase out the traditional summer Friday policy. However, a survey indicates that workers still appreciate the opportunity for a shortened workweek during the summer months.</p>

          <p>President Trump's planned military parade on the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army contrasts sharply with George Washington's vision of American parades, raising questions about whether the event celebrates the country or the leader. Washington resisted attempts to turn his visits into military displays, emphasizing a constitutional republic based on the will of the people and dedicated to prosperity and liberty. He favored parades that honored artisans and tradespeople, reflecting the egalitarian values of the newly empowered citizens.

          <p>President Trump is attempting to create a new religious right that prioritizes American nationalism over traditional religious values, differing from the traditional "Christian nationalism" focused on theocratic principles. This new model resembles Soviet Russia, where the church is subject to the state's whims, rather than post-revolutionary Iran, where religious leaders govern the state. Trump's Religious Liberty Commission, dominated by evangelicals and conservative members of other faiths, focuses on promoting American interests and institutions, rather than addressing moral failings through religious collaboration. The movement seeks to reshape America in unprecedented ways, prioritizing political utility over theological consistency.</p>

          <p>MLB owners may favor the Angels' strategy of developing young talent through the draft over the Dodgers' approach of acquiring expensive star players, as the Angels' model emphasizes cost control. The Angels' roster includes several first-round draft picks who quickly advanced to the major leagues, contrasting with the Dodgers, who rely on high-priced acquisitions like Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts. However, there's no clear evidence that the Angels' approach leads to winning, as they haven't had a winning season in a decade, while the Dodgers have invested heavily in scouting and player development. As negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement approach, the Angels' model could influence discussions about minor league teams and player development.</p>

          <p>Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israeli territory in response to an Israeli missile strike that killed several senior military leaders. Israel stated that the attack targeted Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, while Iranian state media reported fresh Israeli strikes on a military airport in Tabriz. Rocket sirens sounded in northern Jordan, with reports of intercepted Iranian drones in Jordanian airspace. The escalating tensions come days before planned nuclear deal talks between U.S. and Iranian officials, with President Trump urging Iran to reach a deal "before it's too late."</p>

          <p>Israel's attack on Iran has triggered market volatility, with rising oil prices and investor flight to safe-haven assets, heightening fears of a regional conflict that could disrupt global oil supplies. The Middle East, a major oil-producing region, faces potential disruptions to energy markets and trade routes, with the Strait of Hormuz being a key choke point. A prolonged conflict could exacerbate global economic uncertainty, driven by U.S. tariff policies, potentially leading to increased consumer prices and a higher risk of a global recession. The travel and leisure sector has been significantly impacted, while energy and defense stocks have seen a rally.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in extracting rubidium directly from salt lake brine on a commercial scale, potentially reducing China's reliance on imports, primarily from Canada. This new industrial-scale method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations, offering a new domestic source for this strategically vital material. Rubidium, used in electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace, has extensive military, technological, and civilian applications, including improving the performance of perovskite solar cells and in ultra-precise atomic clocks.</p>

While the AI work is transparent, other publications have been less forthcoming about their use of AI, leading to issues like errors and fabrications.

The government defended the policy, stating it would raise Â£1.8bn a year to spend on raising standards in the state sector. The court found that the government was entitled to consider the expected revenue raised for public services outweighed concerns about some families no longer being able to afford private school fees.</p>
