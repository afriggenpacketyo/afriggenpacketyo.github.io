          <p>Despite a sixth consecutive month of declining visitor numbers, Las Vegas's top tourism official, Steve Hill, insists the city remains a competitive and valuable destination for travelers. July saw a 12% drop in visitors compared to the previous year, though gaming revenue remains strong, indicating higher spending from those who do visit. In response to social media complaints about high costs, many resorts are offering promotions like waived fees and free parking, while the tourism authority is highlighting the city's budget-friendly options.</p>

          <p>Former NFL referee Terry McAulay has criticized the implementation of a new college football rule intended to prevent players from faking injuries to stop the clock. During a crucial moment in the Georgia Tech vs. Colorado game, Georgia Tech was charged a timeout when a player went down with what McAulay argued was a clear and immediate injury. He contended that officials are being overly officious and that the rule unfairly penalizes teams for legitimate injuries, a concern he had raised in a previous game as well.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two civilian workers for allegedly providing false information to the Navy about a massive jet fuel spill at the Red Hill storage facility in 2021. The spill later contaminated the drinking water for 90,000 people, sickening 6,000 residents in military housing. The indictment alleges the workers misled regulators about the amount of fuel leaked, claiming 1,618 gallons spilled instead of the actual 20,000 gallons. These are the first criminal charges stemming from the incident, which led to the military's decision to close the aging facility.</p>

          <p>A controversial Video Assistant Referee (VAR) decision disallowed a goal by Fulham's 18-year-old midfielder Josh King during a Premier League match against Chelsea. King's goal was overturned after the referee reviewed a foul in the build-up, where teammate Rodrigo Muniz was judged to have committed a "careless challenge" on a Chelsea defender near the halfway line. Pundits and former players heavily criticized the decision, arguing the contact was minimal and not a "clear and obvious" error, calling it one of the worst officiating decisions of the season.</p>

          <p>Five Democratic U.S. senators have sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanding an immediate and "massive surge" of humanitarian aid, particularly baby formula, to Gaza. The letter highlights that international monitors have officially declared a famine in Gaza City, where infants are dying of starvation. Citing a moral obligation, the senators, led by Ruben Gallego, are urging the U.S. to use its full authority to address the crisis as Israel prepares for a new ground operation that could worsen conditions.</p>

          <p>Lawyers are calling for the release of a longtime Oregon resident who was arrested by Border Patrol agents while fighting a wildfire in Washington. The firefighter, who arrived in the U.S. as a child, was reportedly on a path to legal status through a U-visa for crime victims after assisting federal investigators. His attorneys argue the arrest was illegal, violating Department of Homeland Security policies that prohibit immigration enforcement at emergency response sites and against those who have applied for victim-based immigration benefits.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans is still grappling with the effects of the mass firing of over 4,000 teachers, most of whom were Black women. The post-storm overhaul of the public school system into a charter-based model led to a drastic drop in Black educators, from 71% to 49% by 2014. Black-led organizations like Black Education for New Orleans (Be Nola) are now working to rebuild this workforce, offering professional development and support to increase retention and restore a vital sense of community and representation for students.</p>

His approach offers a rare window into voter concerns and demonstrates a commitment to public engagement that has become uncommon within his party.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the heightened anxiety surrounding children's diets, fueled by movements like Robert F.

Author Virginia Sole-Smith argues against restrictive food approaches, stating they can create toxic relationships with food and that pathologizing body size is counterproductive. She advocates for focusing on systemic issues like food access and poverty, rather than blaming parents, to truly improve children's health and well-being.</p>

          <p>Finland is set to become the first country to implement a permanent solution for nuclear waste by burying spent fuel rods deep underground in a facility named Onkalo. Developed over two decades, the repository will hold over 6,000 U.S. tons of high-level waste from the country's five nuclear power plants. The project uses a multi-barrier system of copper canisters and clay, buried in stable bedrock, and is being hailed by the International Atomic Energy Agency as a game-changing step in sustainable nuclear waste management.</p>
