          <p>Rising allegations of espionage are straining educational ties between the US and China, with claims of Chinese spies at Stanford and Chinese student scouts near a Michigan military site. These allegations have fueled online discussions and US government efforts to restrict educational engagement. The State Department announced it would "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students with connections to the Communist Party and in critical fields. Lawmakers and government officials argue that restricting engagement with Chinese students and universities is necessary to protect national security, reflecting growing concerns about intellectual property theft and propaganda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sports betting stocks experienced a downturn after Illinois lawmakers approved a budget that included increased taxes on online wagers, raising concerns among investors that other states may follow suit. The budget introduces a tax of 25 cents per wager on the first 20 million online sports bets made each fiscal year, increasing to 50 cents per bet thereafter. Truist analyst Barry Jonas noted that this unexpected tax is the second consecutive year of such levies in Illinois, making the state's rate among the highest in the country. The potential impact on smaller competitors is modest, but DraftKings and Flutter's FanDuel are expected to surpass 20 million wagers, facing the higher tax rate.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected an appeal from gun rights advocates, allowing Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines to remain in place. The decision is a significant victory for gun safety advocates, upholding a ruling by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that the state can constitutionally prohibit the sale and possession of these weapons. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, expressing their desire to address the issue nationwide, while Justice Kavanaugh expects the high court to weigh in formally on the legality of the AR-15 in the near future. Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons.</p>

Judge John Holcomb ruled that individuals subject to deportation under the AEA must have the opportunity to challenge the action. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan, a Venezuelan citizen detained by ICE, who claims to be a vocal dissident of the Venezuelan government. The judge also stated that the president has "unlimited" authority to invoke the AEA, which is being challenged separately.</p>

Deficit hawks like Rand Paul and Ron Johnson are pushing for deeper cuts than those in the House-passed bill, complicating its path through the Senate. While the bill reduces outlays by over $1.5 trillion against current baseline spending, it is still projected to add about $3.1 trillion to the debt. The White House claims the legislation will save $1.6 trillion over 10 years, but faces skepticism from some senators.</p>
