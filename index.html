          <p>A cyberattack has targeted Collins Aerospace, a key software provider for the aviation industry, causing significant disruptions at several major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the 'Muse' software, which manages check-in and baggage systems, forced airlines to revert to manual processing, leading to long queues and flight delays for hundreds of passengers. While the company is working to resolve the issue, national cybersecurity agencies and the European Commission are investigating the incident, which highlights the vulnerability of interconnected global travel systems.</p>

          <p>A right-wing, anti-immigration demonstration in The Hague, Netherlands, descended into violence weeks before the country's general election. Rioters clashed with police, throwing objects and setting a police car on fire, leading authorities to deploy tear gas and a water cannon to disperse the crowd. The unrest, which also saw a centrist political party's office vandalized, was condemned by political leaders across the spectrum, including caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing politician Geert Wilders, who called the rioters "scum."</p>

          <p>New York State Democratic Committee Chairman Jay Jacobs has announced he will not endorse his party's own mayoral nominee, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, causing a significant rift within the party. Despite Mamdani having the backing of Governor Kathy Hochul, Jacobs cited fundamental disagreements on policy and Mamdani's critical stance on Israel as reasons for withholding his support. This public break highlights deep ideological divisions within the Democratic party in New York, potentially impacting both Mamdani's campaign and Jacobs's leadership position.</p>

          <p>Correctional officers at the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC) in Norco are appealing to the state to reverse its decision to close the facility by 2026. The officers argue that the prison has available beds and effective rehabilitation programs that could help alleviate overcrowding in county jails, a problem currently facing Los Angeles County. However, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation maintains that the prison was chosen for closure due to its aging infrastructure, high investment costs, and a population of lower-level inmates who can be more easily relocated.</p>

          <p>In her book "Love by Design," social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh highlights disrespect as a critical red flag that can severely damage a romantic relationship over time. She explains that disrespectful behavior, such as ignoring a partner's priorities, devaluing their identity, or disregarding commitments, can erode the other person's self-esteem and sense of self. Nasserzadeh advises that recognizing these behaviors is crucial, as relationships are fundamentally about being seen and valued, and a persistent lack of respect undermines the foundation of a healthy partnership.</p>

          <p>The fate of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" remains unresolved as host Jimmy Kimmel is reportedly in ongoing discussions with Disney and ABC executives regarding his return to the air. The show was suspended indefinitely after Kimmel made remarks linking the man who killed conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement, which drew pressure from the FCC Chairman and President Trump. With ABC airing reruns in his time slot, the negotiations highlight the intense political and corporate pressure surrounding free speech and media commentary in a polarized environment.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., one resident of Leicester, North Carolina, is building his dream house using salvaged materials from the storm's wreckage. John Saunby has been collecting debris like porch posts and floorboards that were destined for the landfill, repurposing them into a unique home with features like Black Locust bark siding. The project represents a creative and resilient response to the destruction, turning the rubble of the past into a "last hurrah" of home-building and a testament to finding treasure amidst tragedy.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses have advanced to their seventh straight Women's Rugby World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory against a resilient French team. Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two tries upon her return from injury, while the team's powerful driving maul also proved decisive. Despite a strong challenge from France, who kept the score close for much of the game, England's improved second-half performance and bench strength secured their spot in the final against Canada at a sold-out Twickenham stadium.</p>

          <p>A panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's talk show as part of a wider crackdown on dissent by the current administration. Panelists noted that the move against Kimmel, which followed pressure from the FCC, cannot be viewed in isolation and reflects a pattern of increased administrative action since the assassination of Charlie Kirk. The discussion framed the incident as a signal that the "rules for engagement" for media are changing, suggesting a more aggressive stance against critical voices and press freedom.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, writer Dave Schilling critiques the new, thinner iPhone Air as a symbol of a broader, miserable trend toward minimalism in technology, design, and culture. He argues that this aesthetic, seen in everything from spartan restaurant interiors to stripped-down theater productions, represents a loss of boldness and personality in favor of a bland, inoffensive, and controlling style. The column suggests that while the sleek design of modern technology appears clean and orderly, it serves as a deceptive delivery device for the chaos and anxiety of the digital age.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, critics and political analysts are warning that the Trump administration is using the tragedy as a pretext to crack down on political dissent. The administration has escalated threats against "radical left" groups, considered classifying some as domestic terrorists, and attacked the Democratic party, despite no evidence linking them to the killing. Observers describe this as a classic authoritarian tactic, leveraging a violent act to justify eroding civil liberties, silencing opposition, and consolidating power under the guise of preventing future violence.</p>

          <p>In the wake of his killing, conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being positioned as a martyr for the Christian nationalist movement in the United States. Religious and political allies are framing his death not just as a tragedy but as a key moment in a spiritual battle, using rhetoric of holy war to galvanize supporters. This narrative builds on Kirk's own political evolution, where he and his organization, Turning Point USA, increasingly embraced Christian culture war themes, aligning with anti-democratic ideologies that seek to establish the U.S. as an explicitly Christian nation.</p>
