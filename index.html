          <p>China is experiencing a significant downturn in its early education sector as a direct result of a plunging national birth rate. Kindergartens, including those previously reserved for officials' children, are now struggling to find pupils and are expanding their enrollment to the general public. The number of kindergartens in the country fell by over 13% between 2020 and last year, while the number of enrolled children dropped by more than 25% from its peak. This demographic shift is forcing major operational and economic adjustments within the preschool system.</p>

          <p>Melissa Turner was sentenced to over 20 years in prison for the second-degree murder of her boyfriend, Matthew Trussler, in a case that hinged on audio-visual evidence. While Turner claimed she stabbed Trussler in self-defense during a physical altercation, prosecutors used audio from a neighbor's security camera and video from an in-home ADT camera to argue against her narrative. The recordings captured yelling and showed Turner appearing angry and following an unarmed Trussler shortly before his death. A jury ultimately found her guilty, concluding she chose to kill him rather than de-escalate the situation.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon men's final will feature a compelling showdown between the world's top two ranked players, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, renewing a rivalry that is defining modern tennis. This meeting comes just weeks after their classic five-set match at the French Open, which Alcaraz won. The two young stars have dominated the last six Grand Slam tournaments, and their contrasting on-court personalities—the expressive Alcaraz and the stoic Sinner—add to the drama. The match is seen as a significant moment for the sport, potentially heralding a new long-term rivalry akin to those of the "Big Three."</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old farmworker, Jaime Alanís Garcia, has died after falling from a greenhouse roof during a large-scale immigration raid at a cannabis operation in Camarillo, California. While his family states he was fleeing federal agents, the Department of Homeland Security claims he was not being pursued. The raid, which led to over 300 arrests and clashes with protesters, has heightened tensions surrounding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics. The incident has also sparked a child labor investigation into the farm and a federal judge's order temporarily restricting certain random detention practices by agents.</p>

A Los Angeles judge has ordered the district attorney's office to justify why certain evidence was excluded from their trial, which the brothers argue supports their claim of self-defense due to long-term abuse. This evidence includes a letter from Erik detailing sexual abuse and a separate affidavit from a former boy band member alleging he was sexually assaulted by their father, Jose Menendez.

With Ukraine facing shortages of manpower and munitions, and Western support wavering, the author contends that complacency is dangerous. The piece calls for more decisive action from NATO, tougher sanctions on Russia, and a recognition that a Ukrainian defeat would usher in a new era of widespread conflict.</p>

          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a notable shift in its political landscape, characterized by the growing influence of Islamic-oriented parties and conservative ideologies. The opposition Perikatan Nasional coalition, which includes the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained significant electoral ground, challenging the current government of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This "green wave" reflects a segment of the population's support for policies aligned with conservative Islamic values, such as stricter dress codes and the implementation of Islamic criminal law. The trend poses a long-term challenge to Malaysia's traditionally multi-ethnic and multi-religious identity, prompting debate over whether it is a genuine ideological shift or a political tool.</p>

          <p>A new study offers preliminary evidence that could ease concerns in India about China's dam construction on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, known as the Brahmaputra in India. Contrary to fears that the dams would cause droughts, data collected downstream from two existing Chinese dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, suggests the opposite effect. The research indicates that since 2014, water flows during the dry season have significantly increased, with low flows in February rising by over 50%. This finding hints that China's massive new dam project in Tibet might regulate water flow, potentially benefiting downstream regions during drier periods.</p>

The Toronto rapper shared the stage generously, allowing collaborators to perform their own hits and creating numerous viral moments for the massive crowds. The enthusiastic reception from London fans and the strong showing of support from UK rap titans served as a powerful statement amid his ongoing feud with Kendrick Lamar.</p>

          <p>Hong Wang, a celebrated Chinese mathematician and a leading contender for the prestigious Fields Medal, has become a target for cyber-nationalists in her home country. The criticism erupted online because she delivered recent academic lectures at top Chinese universities, including Peking University and Tsinghua University, in English rather than Mandarin. Despite her groundbreaking research and the packed attendance at her seminars, some online commentators have attacked her for not using her native language. Wang, a graduate of Peking University, is currently an associate professor at NYU and will soon join a prominent French research institute.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the British Medical Association (BMA) are scheduled to meet next week in an attempt to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The BMA has announced the walkout from July 25th over an ongoing pay dispute, arguing that real-term pay is still 20% lower than in 2008. The government has offered a 5.4% increase for this year but insists it cannot improve the offer, though it is reportedly open to discussing working conditions. The union states the strike will only be canceled if the talks result in a credible offer to its members.</p>

          <p>China's space sector is experiencing a boom driven by private investment, which is projected to constitute 45% of all aerospace investment by 2025. This growth is fueled by technological advances, lower costs, and state support for private enterprises like i-Space and LandSpace, which have achieved significant milestones in rocket technology. The global space economy is forecast to reach US$1.8 trillion by 2035, moving beyond state-led missions to include commercial activities like satellite constellations and resource mining. This article argues that Hong Kong is well-positioned to contribute to and benefit from this burgeoning industry as it develops. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration. The plan aims to reduce the domestic workforce by 15% and includes closing or merging numerous offices to streamline what officials call a "bloated bureaucracy." Many of the cuts targeted bureaus focused on human rights, refugees, and foreign assistance, drawing sharp criticism from Democratic senators who argue the move weakens U.S. diplomacy. The layoffs have caused alarm among staff, with the American Foreign Service Association calling them "untethered from merit or mission."</p>

          <h2>A Look at Why Boeing Discontinued Production of the C-17 Globemaster III Cargo Jet</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, an iconic military transport aircraft, ceased production in 2015 primarily due to a lack of demand and significant budget cuts. Despite its unique capabilities, such as carrying massive payloads and landing on short, undeveloped runways, the U.S. Air Force had completed its purchase order by 2013. The 2011 Budget Control Act led to defense spending reductions, making the expensive C-17 program a target for cuts. Ironically, recent global conflicts have renewed interest in the versatile cargo hauler, prompting reports that Boeing is now considering resuming its production.</p>

          <p>A woman from Norfolk, England, has been reunited with the older brother she never knew she had, after her father revealed a long-held family secret.
