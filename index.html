A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that the U.S. has increased export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, and announced it would revoke visas for Chinese students, actions that Beijing views as detrimental to its interests. China vows to take measures to protect its rights and benefits if the U.S. continues to damage China's interests, while maintaining its control over rare earth exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. politicians and Jewish groups have condemned the attack in Boulder, Colorado, where eight people were injured during a peaceful rally in support of Israeli hostages. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa, was arrested after allegedly setting victims on fire while shouting "Free Palestine" and other criticisms of Israel. Officials are investigating the attack as a hate crime and an act of terrorism, with many leaders expressing solidarity with the Jewish community and condemning antisemitism. The incident has sparked concerns about rising antisemitism in the U.S. following recent attacks against Jewish people.</p>

Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high, averaging 84% for the year, as fleet expansion faces challenges due to supply chain issues.

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has been elected as the new president of Poland, according to the state electoral commission. Nawrocki secured 50.9% of the votes, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, who received 49.1%. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to obstruct Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda, supporting traditional Catholic and family values and advocating for Polish sovereignty within the EU. The outcome is poised to energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition, potentially influencing the 2027 parliamentary elections.</p>

Several papers also spotlight the record number of migrants crossing the English Channel, quoting the defence secretary as saying boats were arriving like taxis.

          <p>Six people were injured in a fire attack in Boulder, Colorado, after a suspect shouted "free Palestine" and threw Molotov cocktails at a gathering supporting Israeli hostages. The attack occurred at the Pearl Street Mall, and the FBI is investigating it as a suspected terror attack. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails, and other incendiary devices. Footage shows the suspect screaming at the group while holding what appeared to be Molotov cocktails.</p>

          <p>Mexico held its first judicial elections, becoming the only nation in the world to select judges and magistrates by popular vote. Supporters believe this is needed to overhaul the judicial system, while critics argue it will politicize the judiciary. Voters had to elect around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates. Turnout appeared to be low as many voters struggled to choose from hundreds of largely unknown candidates.</p>

          <p>Ukraine conducted a major attack on Russia, using drones to strike bombers at four military bases, including some with nuclear capabilities. The attacks come as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are heading to Istanbul for a second round of peace talks. Ukraine says it completed its biggest long-range attack of the war with Russia, and that 117 drones were used in the operation. Expectations are low for the peace talks, as the two sides remain far apart on how to end the war.</p>

The MLS Players Association (MLSPA) expressed solidarity, stating the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of the prize money to the players. FIFA will pay MLS teams large amounts to participate, but the current collective bargaining agreement stipulates players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million for the entire team. The MLSPA said players have sought to meet with MLS to make changes, but the league has failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal.</p>
