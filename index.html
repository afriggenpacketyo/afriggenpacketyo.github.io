          <p>The NFL has fined the Atlanta Falcons $250,000 and defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich $100,000 after Ulbrich's son, Jax, prank-called NFL Draft prospect Shedeur Sanders. Jax Ulbrich obtained Sanders' phone number and impersonated a team interested in drafting him, which led to the fines for failing to protect confidential information. The Falcons issued a statement accepting the discipline and emphasizing their commitment to security policies, and the Ulbrich family will participate in community service. Jax Ulbrich apologized to Sanders for his actions, which he called inexcusable and selfish.</p>

          <p>This article recounts how 11-year-old Kevin Nazemi, an Iranian immigrant, persistently called the White House in 1993 to request an interview with President Bill Clinton for a school project. His determination impressed a White House staffer, Dave Anderson, who arranged an eight-minute interview with Clinton. The interview became a half-hour special on KOMU, and Nazemi credits the experience with setting him on his path to success, later establishing college funds for Anderson's children.

          <p>This New York Times article reports that the U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter of 2025, with GDP declining at an 0.3 percent annual rate due to the chaotic start to President Trump’s second term and the implementation of sweeping tariffs. While underlying economic growth remained solid, the negative number reflected the impact of consumers and businesses reacting to tariff announcements and policy shifts. Economists expect spending and investment to slow in the coming months as tariffs drive up prices and uncertainty keeps businesses on hold. The article also notes some good news on inflation, which cooled in March.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student and Palestinian activist, has been released from ICE detention after a federal judge ordered his release on bail. Mahdawi, who has permanent US residency, was detained when he went to his American citizenship interview. His lawyers argued that his arrest was in retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian. Several prominent politicians, including Senator Bernie Sanders, have spoken out in support of Mahdawi and called for his release.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of breaking its promise to set up five local inquiries into grooming gangs, despite pledging to do so. The Conservative leader stated that only one inquiry was delivered, in Oldham, despite promises of £5m to fund five investigations. Badenoch suggested Sir Keir Starmer was "dragging his heels" on inquiries to shield Labour-run councils from scandal. The issue has been thrust back into the spotlight by Elon Musk, leading to calls for a second national inquiry into grooming gangs.</p>

Fortunately, the car accident was minor with no injuries or damage, and Sheila is reported to be unharmed.

          <p>With inflation and elevated interest rates impacting household budgets, homeowners are considering home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) as a way to access their equity. Experts offer varied perspectives, noting HELOCs can be valuable alternatives to high-interest credit card debt but come with risks due to variable interest rates. They advise careful consideration of income stability, debt-to-income ratio, and the purpose of borrowing. Alternatives like home equity loans and cash-out refinance loans may be more suitable for some borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that Israel launched airstrikes on Syria in response to sectarian violence in Druse-dominated areas. The Israeli military said its aircraft struck a group of “operatives” south of Damascus, accusing them of attacking Druse civilians. The strikes came after clashes between pro-government fighters and Druse militiamen, sparked by an audio clip insulting the Prophet Muhammad. The violence has stoked fears among Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious minorities, who worry about persecution under the country’s new Islamist leadership.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a sharp slowdown in the first quarter of 2025, with GDP shrinking at a 0.3% annual rate as businesses stockpiled goods ahead of President Trump's tariff policies. The slowdown is attributed to increased imports and a decline in government spending, partially due to cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency. Concerns about tariffs have caused businesses and consumers to alter their behavior, signaling potential economic headwinds. The report also highlights weak ADP employment numbers, adding to recession concerns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has blamed President Biden for the U.S. economy's contraction in the first quarter, while simultaneously defending his sweeping tariff policies. In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that the negative GDP was a result of Biden's policies and that his tariffs would soon spur economic growth. However, economic analysts have noted that the GDP decline was due to companies importing goods to get ahead of Trump's tariffs, not Biden's policies. Trump's attempt to shift blame mirrors his earlier efforts to take credit for the stock market's rise during the Biden administration.</p>
