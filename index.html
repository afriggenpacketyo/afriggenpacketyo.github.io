          <p>As student loan collections resume, the U.S. government has broad powers to garnish payments, including federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits. Experts caution that up to 15% of Social Security benefits can be seized, potentially leaving retirees with insufficient funds for basic needs. Borrowers can avoid garnishment by contacting the Default Resolution Group to explore income-driven repayment plans or loan rehabilitation, with retroactive forbearances also an option to cover missed payments.

          <p>Former Congressman George Santos has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. The sentencing marks the end of the downfall of the novice New York politician, who was expelled from Congress after being found guilty of misusing campaign funds. The judge in the case stated that he was elected with words, most of which were lies. Santos has been ordered to pay at least $374,000 in restitution.</p>

          <p>Consumers are adjusting their spending habits in response to tariffs, with some rushing to buy cars ahead of price increases, while others delay major purchases. The auto sector has seen a surge in sales, while retailers report consumers are hesitant to spend on other items. Surveys indicate that a significant percentage of consumers plan to postpone major purchases due to tariffs. This uncertainty has led to a "conservation mentality" among shoppers, who are closely watching economic headlines.</p>

          <p>A new analysis suggests that tariffs imposed by President Trump would disproportionately harm lower-income households compared to wealthier ones. The study indicates that taxes for the poorest 20% of households could rise significantly more than those in the top 1%. Economists explain that tariffs increase the price of essential goods like food and clothing, which constitute a larger portion of low-income households' budgets. The findings align with previous research indicating that Trump's tariffs are a regressive policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's continued attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the central bank have raised concerns about the independence of the Fed. Trump has publicly criticized Powell's interest rate policy and even flirted with the idea of removing him from office. This interference breaks with Washington tradition and has drawn comparisons to past presidents who attempted to exert control over the Fed.</p>

          <h2>The Trump Administration's Shifting Stance on Deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's stance on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongfully deported to El Salvador, has evolved from acknowledging an "administrative error" to asserting he is a dangerous criminal who will never return. Initially, officials explored ways to bring him back, but the White House later seized the case as a political opportunity to assert executive authority. Despite doubts among some officials about his alleged gang ties, the administration has resisted pressure to reverse course, leaving Abrego Garcia detained in El Salvador.</p>
