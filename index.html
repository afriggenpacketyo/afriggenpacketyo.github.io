        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing political backlash after approving a law allowing the state to expropriate privately owned land without compensating owners in certain circumstances, in an effort to redistribute land ownership to Black South Africans. The law has been criticized by US President Donald Trump and local political groups, who argue it threatens property rights, while the government maintains it is necessary to address historical inequalities. Legal experts clarify that expropriation without compensation would only occur in rare cases, such as when land is unused or held for speculative purposes. The law's implementation remains uncertain due to political and economic concerns, and is currently in limbo.</p>

          <p>A suspect is in custody after an attack on Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, where at least five people were injured during a march for Israeli hostages. Witnesses reported that the suspect threw Molotov cocktails, burning some of the victims, and allegedly yelled "End Zionist!". The FBI initially called it a targeted terrorist attack, but Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn stated that it was too early to make that determination. The injured were outside the Boulder County Courthouse, and authorities have evacuated three blocks of Pearl Street, investigating a vehicle of interest.</p>

          <p>Senior officials at the US Department of Veterans Affairs have reportedly instructed VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. This decision follows the publication of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine co-authored by VA pulmonologists, warning that cancelled contracts, layoffs, and staff reductions jeopardize veterans' healthcare. Veterans advocates have characterized this as censorship by the Trump administration. The article highlights concerns about the health of a million veterans who served in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.</p>

Ben Griffin finished second, earning $2.2 million, while Sepp Straka finished third. Tournament host Jack Nicklaus praised Scheffler's playing style, comparing it to his own strategy of focusing on fairways and greens, and making enough putts to secure a low score.

The operation reportedly destroyed 34% of Russia's fleet of air missile carriers, with damages estimated at $7 billion, although this claim has not been independently verified.

Williams discovered that due to a change in military pension rules, his brother-in-law, who had a similar service record but was discharged two years later, received a significantly better pension. Despite numerous appeals to official bodies and support from MPs, Williams has been told his pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement" based on the rules at the time of his discharge.

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses the ways in which the current political climate, particularly the actions of President Trump, are negatively affecting the stock market, creating a "Trump discount." He points to several sectors, including retail, pharmaceuticals, and technology (specifically Apple and Nvidia), as being held back by unpredictable policies and regulatory actions. Cramer suggests that this uncertainty is driving investors to seek stability in other markets, such as Europe, despite stronger performance from U.S. companies. He also notes the lack of regulatory relief in sectors like banking and energy, despite expectations of deregulation under the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Canada have forced the evacuation of over 25,000 residents across three provinces, while also impacting air quality in parts of the United States. Manitoba has declared a state of emergency due to nearly two dozen active wildfires, with over 5,000 evacuees from Flin Flon. Smoke is worsening air quality and reducing visibility in both Canada and some U.S. border states, prompting health warnings. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service is providing assistance to Canada, as ongoing hot, dry weather continues to fuel the fires.</p>

          <p>Pharmacists are warning that a shortage of Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, is severely impacting cancer patients, as well as those with cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis. The shortage is causing patients to ration their medication, skipping meals and traveling long distances to obtain it. The Department of Health and Social Care acknowledges the European-wide supply issues, attributing them to manufacturing constraints. Some experts predict the shortages will continue into next year, causing stress and worry for patients who rely on the drug for digestion and nutrient absorption.</p>
