          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:09:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports experienced a significant 5.8% year-on-year increase in June, surpassing market expectations. This acceleration is attributed to exporters capitalizing on a 90-day tariff truce with the United States, rushing shipments to avoid potential future duties. The growth, which reached US$325.2 billion, marks a notable rise from the 4.8% increase seen in May. This development provides a temporary boost to the world's top merchandise exporter amid ongoing global trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major wildfire, named the Dragon Bravo Fire, has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures at the park's North Rim. Fueled by strong winds, the fire expanded to approximately 5,000 acres, also damaging a water treatment facility, which resulted in a chlorine gas leak and complicated firefighting efforts. While all guests and employees were evacuated safely with no reported loss of life, the event marks a significant loss of historic park infrastructure. The incident occurs as smoke from Canadian wildfires affects air quality across the U.S. Midwest.</p>

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol for women's rights in France, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband and 50 other men who drugged and sexually assaulted her over a decade. Her insistence on a public trial shocked the nation and was instrumental in advancing reforms to France's legal definition of sexual assault. The case resulted in long prison sentences for her ex-husband and his co-defendants.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump marked the one-year anniversary of the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania, with a statement reflecting on the event. He credited divine intervention for his survival and honored the heroism of first responders and rally attendees who assisted the injured. The president also paid tribute to Corey Comperatore, the attendee who was killed while protecting his family during the attack.

          <p>Singapore successfully avoided a technical recession by posting a 1.4% economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a 0.5% contraction from the previous quarter. The expansion, driven primarily by a 5.5% year-over-year increase in the manufacturing sector, beat economists' forecasts. Despite this positive performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry issued a warning about significant uncertainty and downside risks for the remainder of the year. The concerns stem from a lack of clarity regarding U.S. tariff policies and their potential impact on global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, following an announcement that the U.S. will sell weapons to European allies for transfer to Ukraine. This strategy allows for faster delivery of U.S.-made weapons already deployed in Europe to the front lines. The meeting comes as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to enact stronger sanctions against Russia's economy and its international supporters. The discussions are expected to focus on coordinating a stronger, unified response to Russia's ongoing invasion and bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities.</p>

          <h2>French President Macron Calls for Major Defense Spending Increase Amid Growing Threats</h2>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that Europe faces its greatest threat since World War II and called for a significant increase in France's defense spending. In a speech to the armed forces, he outlined a plan to double the military budget to €64 billion by 2027, three years ahead of schedule. Citing "imperialist policies" and the "proliferation of major conflicts," Macron emphasized the need for France to be powerful to remain free. This move aligns with a broader NATO commitment to increase defense spending in response to geopolitical instability, particularly the threat from Russia.</p>

The victims were identified as Beverly Gum, 72, and Christina Combs, 32. The suspect, who was also killed by police at the scene, may have had a connection to the church victims. The incident began when the suspect shot and wounded a trooper during a traffic stop, then carjacked a vehicle and drove to the Richmond Road Baptist Church. Two other men were also wounded by the gunman during the violent spree.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers entered the All-Star break with a 5-2 extra-innings victory against the San Francisco Giants, securing a 5.5-game lead in the NL West. The first half of the season has been a success in terms of record, but marked by inconsistency, with an injury-plagued pitching staff and slumps from key veteran hitters. Sunday's game encapsulated this duality, featuring a stellar seven-inning performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto but also a blown save by the bullpen. Despite the challenges, the team remains in a strong position as one of baseball's top contenders.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing a "notably different" climate compared to just a few decades ago, with extreme heat and rainfall events becoming more frequent, according to a new Met Office report. The assessment shows the country is warming at about 0.25°C per decade, leading to more very hot days and fewer cold nights. This warming trend is also making the UK wetter, with winter rainfall increasing significantly. The report highlights that these changes, driven by global greenhouse gas emissions, are having tangible impacts on the natural world and increasing risks like flooding.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, admired by some international conservatives for his "illiberal democracy" model, is facing weakening power at home. While his playbook of targeting liberal values and consolidating power has been effective for years, a new political challenger, Peter Magyar, is gaining traction by focusing on domestic issues like the poor state of public services. Magyar, a former insider from the center-right, has capitalized on a government scandal and is now polling competitively against Orban's Fidesz party. This presents the most significant challenge to Orban's 15-year rule, coming not from the left but from within his own political sphere.</p>

          <p>A severe, multi-year drought in northern Mexico is escalating a water-sharing dispute with the United States. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send a specified amount of water from the Rio Grande to Texas, but it is currently in arrears. Mexican farmers in Chihuahua argue they cannot give what they don't have, while Texan farmers, facing their own water shortages, accuse Mexico of hoarding the resource. The Trump administration has threatened tariffs if Mexico doesn't comply, highlighting how climate change is straining international agreements and fueling cross-border tensions.</p>

          <p>The White House has defended a new 50% tariff on Brazil, framing it as part of a larger strategy to onshore production and reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which it defines as a national security risk. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett acknowledged that the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil but argued for a consistent global strategy to prevent transshipping. The move was criticized, as the president's letter to Brazil also cited the criminal case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, raising questions about the tariff's true motivation.
