          <p>As the new school year approaches, many American families are altering their shopping strategies in response to economic pressures. A National Retail Federation survey indicates that over half of households earning less than $50,000 annually are focusing only on essential items, with many shopping earlier to avoid potential tariff impacts. The cost of school supplies is at a record high, with prices for typical items up more than 7% this year. To save money, experts recommend comparing prices, considering refurbished electronics, and opting for store-brand products over name brands, reflecting a broader consumer anxiety about affordability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced an initiative to broker a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with subsequent trilateral talks to follow. This diplomatic effort seeks to create momentum for a peace agreement, focusing on security guarantees for Ukraine and the return of Ukrainian prisoners. However, significant obstacles remain, as Ukraine insists on a ceasefire prior to substantive negotiations, a condition the U.S. deems non-essential. Russia also maintains firm positions against European military presence and certain arms sales to Ukraine, complicating the path to a resolution.</p>

          <p>In celebration of World Photography Day, NPR has curated a collection of images from its member station photographers that highlight scenes of community and connection across the United States. The photo essay, titled "Here, together," explores diverse gatherings, from the joy of a first day of school celebration in Hartford to the solemnity of a memorial for flood victims in Texas. These photographs document both ordinary and extraordinary moments, such as a quinceañera photo shoot in Washington, D.C., and a Cowboys of Color rodeo in Dallas, collectively illustrating the complex and varied ways people coexist and connect in their daily lives.</p>

          <p>A former coach at the renowned Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute, Sean Gardner, has been arrested by the FBI on federal charges related to child sexual abuse imagery. The arrest follows allegations that Gardner sexually abused at least three young gymnasts at the Iowa academy and secretly recorded others at a previous job in Mississippi. Despite being suspended by the U.S. Center for SafeSport in 2022, his disciplinary case remains unresolved, highlighting significant concerns about the watchdog's slow and opaque investigative process. The case raises further questions about athlete safety and institutional accountability in the wake of the Larry Nassar scandal.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 3 storm, is forecast to move north between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda, bringing dangerous high waves and life-threatening rip currents throughout the week. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., its significant size is prompting warnings for coastal areas, with tropical storm watches and storm surge alerts issued for North Carolina's Outer Banks. Officials have ordered mandatory evacuations for Hatteras and Ocracoke islands due to the risk of severe coastal flooding. Authorities are urging the public to heed local warnings and avoid entering the ocean.</p>

Walton believes the Democratic party's losses, including in the presidential election, stem from a failure to present a message that resonates with working-class voters. Citing the success of progressive ballot measures even in red states, she contends that now is the time for progressives to stand firm on their principles rather than capitulating to the establishment.</p>

          <p>An interest in cow-derived products like beef tallow and raw milk is growing within political circles aligned with the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement. Promoted by figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, these products are being framed as healthier, traditional alternatives to modern processed foods, despite disagreement from mainstream health organizations. This trend aligns with a broader romanticization of a bygone, agrarian lifestyle, often contrasted with modern urban life. While not all proponents are political, the cow has emerged as a symbol in this cultural shift, appearing in everything from skincare to fine dining favored by conservative figures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has effectively ended the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) student loan repayment plan by resuming interest charges for all borrowers, causing significant financial distress for millions. This policy shift reverses a key Biden-era initiative that had provided relief to approximately 8 million people. Many borrowers now face sharply increased monthly payments and feel forced to switch to less favorable repayment plans to avoid accumulating more debt. The decision has sparked fear and anxiety among individuals who now see their progress toward financial stability, such as homeownership or starting a family, as increasingly unattainable.</p>

          <p>The global professional footballers' union, FIFPRO, has urged Indian football authorities to resolve an administrative crisis that has indefinitely suspended the Indian Super League (ISL). The suspension stems from a contractual dispute between the Indian Football Federation and the league's operating company, leaving thousands of players and staff in limbo. Several clubs have already suspended player salaries, which the union condemns as an unlawful breach of labor rights. The uncertainty is causing significant distress and impacting the livelihoods of players, prompting FIFPRO to call for a clear roadmap to ensure the 2025-26 season can commence as planned.</p>

          <p>A new study on gastroenterologists in Poland raises concerns about medical professionals becoming overly dependent on artificial intelligence. The research, published in The Lancet, found that doctors' ability to independently detect polyps during colonoscopies decreased by approximately 20% after they began using an AI-assisted system. The findings suggest that even a short period of AI use can lead to a subconscious reliance on the technology, with doctors waiting for AI prompts rather than actively scanning for abnormalities themselves. While some experts question the study's methodology, it highlights the need for further research into how AI integration is changing the practice of medicine.</p>

          <p>Despite recent gains, Republican support among Latino voters may be wavering, as polling indicates a drop in approval for former President Trump and dissatisfaction with his handling of immigration and the economy. This shift suggests that the GOP's assumption that Latino voters are a monolithic conservative-leaning bloc is a miscalculation. While Democrats previously erred by focusing too heavily on social justice issues over economic concerns, Republicans now risk alienating these voters by pushing an extreme social agenda and aggressive anti-immigrant policies. Recent research shows a significant portion of Trump-voting Latinos oppose mass deportations, indicating a limit to their alignment with the MAGA platform.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that the Trump administration's demand for a $1 billion settlement from UCLA, ostensibly to combat antisemitism, is a disingenuous charade. The authors contend the move is a politically motivated attack on higher education and academic freedom, using the real issue of antisemitism as a pretext. They warn that such actions will not make the campus safer for Jews but instead risk fueling antisemitic tropes of manipulation and control. The piece calls for a defense of the university and its values, urging Jewish community members to form alliances with other groups to resist what they see as a destructive, illiberal agenda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece explores the disparity in the federal government's response to antisemitism versus anti-Black racism on college campuses. The author notes that while the Trump administration is aggressively penalizing universities like UCLA for failing to address antisemitism, generations of Black students and employees have endured persistent racial harassment, slurs, and threats with no equivalent federal intervention. Citing FBI data on hate crimes, the article argues that both forms of bigotry are serious problems deserving of fierce accountability. The question "What about us?" is posed not to diminish the severity of antisemitism, but to highlight a selective approach to enforcing civil rights on campuses.</p>

Drawing inspiration from historical orators like Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, the speech aims to awaken people from the lethargy induced by dictatorship. Gilroy notes that actor Genevieve O'Reilly's performance captures the character's journey of overcoming fear to deliver a message of defiance against Emperor Palpatine's tyranny.</p>

          <p>A proposal by former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt to build a gondola from Union Station to Dodger Stadium remains in limbo after more than eight years, facing significant community opposition and bureaucratic delays. Opponents recently rallied against a state bill that would fast-track the project's legal challenges, a move the Los Angeles City Council also formally opposed. The city's own study of traffic alternatives, authorized in 2024, is still in its early stages, highlighting the slow pace of municipal processes. The prolonged timeline raises questions about the feasibility of executing large-scale infrastructure projects in Los Angeles, even for well-funded proponents.</p>

A recent Miami jury verdict held the company partially liable for a fatal crash, awarding victims $240 million and concluding that Tesla misled consumers about Autopilot's capabilities. Additionally, the company is being sued by the California DMV for false advertising and by shareholders who allege founder Elon Musk inflated stock prices by exaggerating the readiness of its robotaxi program.

An estimated 11% of CSU students experience housing insecurity, prompting the system to add thousands of new beds in recent years. However, demand continues to outpace supply at many campuses, such as Cal State Northridge, which had a 2,000-student waitlist.
