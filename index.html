          <p>President Trump announced his nomination of economist E.J. Antoni to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The move comes shortly after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a July jobs report that showed slower-than-expected growth and significant downward revisions for prior months. Antoni, currently the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, has been a vocal critic of the BLS and was reportedly supported by former White House advisor Steve Bannon. Trump stated that Antoni will ensure the economic numbers released are "HONEST and ACCURATE." (not investment advice)</p>

Carter expressed a sense of relief when white players also missed, highlighting the disproportionate pressure on Black players. Carter, who was also a target of online racism during the tournament, spoke about the devastating psychological impact of the abuse, stating it made her feel "scared to play" in the final.

          <p>Colorado is grappling with two significant wildfires, prompting the deployment of over 1,000 firefighters. The Lee fire has become the fifth-largest single fire in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres with only 7% containment due to gusty winds and dry conditions. Another blaze, the Elk fire, has burned over 14,000 acres but is 30% contained. Governor Jared Polis has declared a disaster emergency for a third fire, while evacuations and air quality warnings are in effect across several counties, reflecting an explosive fire season across North America.</p>

A search and rescue operation is ongoing for the missing employee, and the plant has since been stabilized. Officials and Pennsylvania lawmakers have expressed their condolences, and a temporary stay-at-home order for nearby residents has been lifted after air quality was deemed safe.</p>

He was eventually apprehended by officers who used a Taser to detain him, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved thanks to the quick thinking of his killer's girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead. Her boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to hitting Parsons with his car in 2017 and burying the body. When McKellar showed her the remote burial site, she secretly dropped a can of Red Bull to mark the location and later informed the police. This crucial clue led investigators to discover Parsons' remains, bringing a long-awaited resolution for his family, who expressed immense gratitude for her actions.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's federalization of Washington D.C.'s police force is a long-threatened move enabled by the city's unique semi-colonial status. The author contends that the action, predicated on a single reported crime, ignores data showing a significant drop in violent crime and serves as a show of force. The piece criticizes the Democratic party for failing to secure D.C. statehood when they had the chance, leaving the district vulnerable to such executive overreach. It calls for future Democratic leadership to prioritize structural reforms, including D.C. statehood, to prevent similar actions.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon has embarked on a 50-state tour to promote the Trump administration's goal of dismantling the Department of Education and returning control to the states. The tour began in Louisiana, a state highlighted for its recent improvements in elementary literacy. McMahon argues that states are better equipped to innovate and decide on curriculum, while critics express concern that shuttering the federal department would create chaos and jeopardize funding for critical programs, including for low-income and special education students. Abolishing the department would ultimately require congressional approval, which remains unlikely.</p>

          <p>Paramount will become the exclusive U.S. home for all Ultimate Fighting Championship events starting in 2026, following a seven-year deal with TKO Group valued at $7.7 billion. The agreement will move the UFC's full slate of events, including marquee pay-per-views and "Fight Nights," to the Paramount+ streaming service, with some events also airing on the CBS broadcast network. The shift marks an end to the UFC's traditional pay-per-view model, aiming for broader consumer reach. Shares of TKO Group, UFC's parent company, jumped over 10% following the announcement.

          <p>President Trump announced that gold will not be tariffed, reversing a recent ruling by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The customs agency had determined that certain gold bars imported from Switzerland would be subject to a 39% tariff, which caused the precious metal to hit a record high. Following Trump's announcement on Truth Social, gold futures fell more than 2%. The Swiss Precious Metals Association had warned that the tariffs could have negatively impacted the international flow of physical gold, which is used to back futures contracts.

          <p>President Trump has dismissed the idea of renovating and expanding the White House press briefing room, telling reporters, "I don’t want you to be comfortable." The comment came in response to a question at a press conference about whether the press corps could get a larger space, similar to a new ballroom being constructed. The current James S. Brady Press Briefing Room is notoriously cramped, with only 49 seats. While past administrations have floated moving the press to a larger space outside the West Wing, reporters have historically opposed it due to the loss of proximity to the Oval Office.</p>

The move signals renewed confidence in the IPO market, which has seen a recent revival with several tech companies going public.

In an interview promoting her new memoir, Sturgeon reflected on the contentious debate over Scotland's gender recognition laws, admitting she was partly responsible for it losing "all sense of rationality." The comments mark a shift from her previous stance during the controversy surrounding a transgender offender who was initially placed in a women's prison, a case that drew intense scrutiny and led to a change in policy.</p>

          <p>This analysis characterizes President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police as a "farcical" act of bullying against a uniquely vulnerable target. The article argues the move is not a prelude to a full authoritarian takeover but rather an exploitation of D.C.'s legal status, which offers few protections from presidential overreach. It notes that the supposed emergency is based on a single incident, while violent crime is actually at a 30-year low. The author suggests the deployment is more about political theater than effective crime fighting, though it will negatively impact the city's most vulnerable residents.</p>

          <p>European leaders are expressing anxiety over being shut out of the upcoming bilateral summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where the war in Ukraine will be a central topic. Despite calls for Ukraine to be included in any peace negotiations, it remains uncertain if President Zelensky will attend, and Europe has not been invited. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, warned that an aggressor should not be rewarded with territory. In an attempt to influence the process, European leaders have scheduled a virtual meeting with Trump and Zelensky ahead of the summit.</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a major investment to retool its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to produce a new, more affordable midsize electric pickup truck. The company is aiming for a price point in the $30,000 range, which would make it highly competitive with both electric and gasoline-powered trucks. This move represents a pivot for Ford toward smaller, cheaper EVs, as it faces headwinds from slowing demand and competition from Chinese automakers. The plan is part of a $5 billion investment and is seen as a critical, though risky, bet on making EVs profitable. (not investment advice)</p>
