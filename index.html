          <p>Taiwan has blacklisted China's Huawei and SMIC, adding them to its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List" and requiring licenses for domestic firms shipping products to these entities. This move aligns Taiwan more closely with U.S. trade policy amid growing tensions with Beijing, as both Huawei and SMIC are already on a U.S. trade blacklist. According to an analyst, the new export controls aim to reinforce existing policies and tighten loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) already adheres to U.S. export restrictions, and this action is likely to further solidify those measures.</p>

          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation has uncovered serious concerns about the safety and regulation of funfair rides in England, Scotland, and Wales, revealing 3,188 injuries over the last decade. The report highlights the story of Jade Harrison, who suffered severe injuries after being thrown from a ride in 2019, and the case of Adelene Leong, who died in a similar accident in Australia in 2014 involving the same ride model. The investigation also focuses on an inspector, David Geary, who has a history of inspecting rides later involved in accidents and has faced criminal convictions and safety warnings. Concerns are being raised about the effectiveness of the Adips safety scheme for ride inspectors, with calls for a major overhaul of safety regulations at funfairs.</p>

          <p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) is set to launch a nationwide operation to target and imprison perpetrators of child sexual abuse, focusing on grooming gangs. This initiative aims to provide "long-awaited justice" to victims whose cases have not progressed through the criminal justice system and to prevent further harm to children. The operation also seeks to address the "culture of denial" within local services and authorities regarding the prevalence of such crimes. The Home Office stated that police have reopened over 800 historic cases of group-based child sexual abuse since January, and a national statutory inquiry covering England and Wales will be launched to compel investigations into these cases.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent actions, including the response to the October 7, 2023 attack and strikes against Iran, have damaged its international reputation and increased instability in the Middle East. The article argues that Israel's disproportionate response in Gaza and attacks on Iran have stretched the justification for allied support and broken trust. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accused of using the conflict to bolster his political career, making Israelis less safe and capitalizing on insecurity. The strikes on Iran, based on contested intelligence, risk escalating the conflict further, mirroring the situation in Gaza with no clear end in sight.</p>

          <p>Analysts are cautioning that Donald Trump's proposed ‚Äúrevenge tax‚Äù could jeopardize foreign investment into the United States. This provision, within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would permit the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions that levy ‚Äúunfair foreign taxes‚Äù on U.S. individuals and companies. Digital service taxes and diverted profits taxes are classified as unfair, potentially affecting many European countries. Concerns are rising that this could undermine the dollar's safe-haven status and prompt companies to relocate their stock market listings to New York to avoid the tax.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed ICE to expand its detention and deportation efforts in America's largest cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. This order follows weeks of anti-ICE protests in major cities, some of which have turned violent. Trump asserts that these cities, which he identifies as Democrat power centers, use undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base and grow the welfare state. He aims to reverse what he describes as "Mass Destruction Migration" and prioritize the remigration of undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <h2>Newspaper Headlines: Grooming Gang Inquiry and Israel-Iran Conflict</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Monday's newspaper headlines are dominated by two main stories: Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement of a national inquiry into grooming gangs, a decision framed as a "retreat" by some, and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. Several papers highlight the call for Starmer to apologize for the delay in launching the inquiry, while others focus on the G7 summit where world leaders will discuss the escalating crisis in the Middle East. The papers also cover other topics, including a "bullying probe" at BBC Breakfast and a heatwave expected in Britain.</p>

          <h2>G7 Summit Focuses on Trump Amidst Global Crises</h2>

          <p>The G7 summit in Canada is largely focused on navigating the dynamics surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump, amidst the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. With Trump's unpredictable approach to trade and defense, the summit is expected to be less about shared understanding and more about individual leaders attempting to influence him. The Canadian hosts are reportedly forgoing the traditional joint communique to avoid potential discord. The summit's success hinges on managing Trump's disruptive presence and finding common ground on critical global issues.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, faces increasingly limited options as Israel intensifies its attacks, prompting defiance from Tehran but failing to halt the strikes. Khamenei, known for his pragmatic and ruthless approach, has built a coalition of Islamist militias to deter Israel, but this strategy appears shattered. With ineffective air defenses and a collapsing regional strategy, Khamenei's long career is drawing to a close amidst growing challenges.

          <p>Despite the threats posed by Trump's "America First" policies and Putin's aggression, Europe is increasingly mirroring their approaches, undermining its own ideals. From migration policies to climate initiatives and treatment of civil society, the EU and its member states are exhibiting a convergence with Trump's ideology. This shift weakens Europe's ability to respond to pressing issues like Ukraine, Gaza, and big tech. The article argues that European leaders need to articulate a compelling alternative to far-right messaging and champion EU-wide action to protect and strengthen European nations.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump are potentially meeting in Canada during the G7 summit to discuss ongoing bilateral tariff talks. The leaders aim to follow up on ministerial-level discussions to conclude a mutually beneficial deal following the imposition of higher import tariffs by the United States. Tokyo is advocating for Washington to focus on boosting investment and jobs rather than imposing tariffs to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. The leaders are also likely to address security alliance issues amidst China's military activities and North Korea's weapons programs.</p>
