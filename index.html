          <h2>Opponents Criticize Andrew Cuomo's Re-entry into NYC Mayoral Race</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 19:03:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic, Republican, and independent candidates for New York City mayor have united in their criticism of former Governor Andrew Cuomo's decision to re-enter the race as an independent. Opponents like Zohran Mamdani and Curtis Sliwa, along with incumbent Eric Adams, argue that New Yorkers have moved on and are seeking new leadership, repudiating what they describe as Cuomo's style of back-room politics. Cuomo's campaign has responded by highlighting his past electoral performance and framing the race as a necessary stand against socialist policies. The situation creates a complex dynamic, with proposals for non-socialist candidates to consolidate around the strongest contender to prevent a Mamdani victory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The West Indies cricket team was dismissed for just 27 runs, the second-lowest total in Test cricket history, leading to a decisive 176-run victory for Australia in Jamaica. This performance secured a 3-0 series sweep for the tourists. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was instrumental, taking six wickets for only nine runs, which included the fastest five-wicket haul ever recorded in Test cricket. The result was described as "heartbreaking" by the West Indies captain, highlighting a recurring and disappointing batting fragility for the team throughout the series.</p>

          <h2>MLB Urged to Adapt Home Run Derby to Secure Participation from Stars like Ohtani and Judge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 18:41:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball's annual Home Run Derby is proceeding without its two biggest stars, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, prompting calls for the league to be more flexible with the event's format. Ohtani cited the physical toll of the current rules as his reason for declining, having previously experienced a performance slump after his 2021 appearance. This article suggests that MLB should consider Ohtani's proposals, such as limiting pitches or focusing on distance, to maximize the star power and cultural relevance of the event. The absence of these key players is seen as a missed opportunity to elevate the sport and its other talented athletes.</p>

          <p>A large-scale cannabis operation on California's Central Coast, recently raided by federal immigration agents, is now under a state investigation for alleged child labor. The Department of Cannabis Control confirmed it opened an active probe into Glass House after receiving a complaint, although an earlier site visit in May found no violations. During the federal raid, officials arrested 361 people and stated they "rescued" at least 14 migrant children from potential exploitation and human trafficking. The company has denied ever employing minors, creating a significant legal and ethical controversy for one of the state's largest legal cannabis producers.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the market is currently in the early "ripple stage" of a new wave of corporate deal-making that is expected to grow in the coming months. He points to recent acquisitions, such as Ferrero's purchase of WK Kellogg, as indicators of this warming trend in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Cramer suggests that the current political environment, with a more M&A-friendly Federal Trade Commission under the Trump administration, is encouraging this activity. He advises that this is a positive sign for the market as a whole, not just for investment banks that facilitate such deals. (not investment advice)</p>

The Home Office stated it now has sufficient information to make accurate assessments, and returns to Syria can be conducted where appropriate. The decision affects over 7,000 Syrians who were left in limbo, unable to work or plan for their future. Updated guidance suggests that while some groups like Alawites may still face significant risk, opponents of the former regime or members of other religious minorities are now considered unlikely to be at risk solely on that basis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent shift to a tougher policy on Russia, including authorizing new weapons for Ukraine, is reportedly driven by personal frustration rather than a strategic change. According to White House sources, Trump feels that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ignored his calls to end the war, making him appear weak and like a "junior partner." This sense of personal humiliation, rather than a newfound commitment to Ukraine or transatlantic alliances, has motivated the president to threaten tariffs and approve new military aid. The move is seen as an attempt by Trump to reassert his strength after his diplomatic overtures to Putin were consistently rebuffed.</p>

Proponents, like the Florida Tomato Exchange, laud the move as a victory for American farmers, arguing it will help rebuild the domestic industry.

The plaintiffs allege that design defects in the Autopilot system failed to detect the obstacle, making the technology responsible for the fatal accident. Tesla contends the crash was caused by a distracted driver who was searching for a dropped cell phone and overrode the car's systems.</p>

          <p>Teddy Bridgewater, a former NFL quarterback, has been suspended from his role as head football coach at his alma mater, Miami Northwestern High School. The suspension is related to an investigation into allegations that he provided impermissible benefits to his players. Bridgewater reportedly posted on social media about paying for services like Uber rides and meals for his team last season. In a statement, Bridgewater confirmed the suspension but vowed to remain committed to the school, even if it means volunteering from the stands. The Florida High School Athletic Association is currently gathering more information on the matter.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to finish the Badwater 135, often called "the world's toughest foot race." The 135-mile course runs through California's Death Valley in extreme heat, climbing from below sea level to over 8,300 feet. Becker completed the race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a "score" after falling just short of the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. Having started running ultramarathons at age 60, Becker's achievement is a testament to his remarkable endurance and determination.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed a new arrangement where NATO allies will purchase "top-of-the-line" American weapons for delivery to Ukraine. The plan, announced alongside NATO chief Mark Rutte, is designed to keep military aid flowing as direct U.S. funding is nearly depleted. In a significant shift in tone, Trump also threatened Russia with severe secondary tariffs if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days, expressing frustration with Vladimir Putin's failure to engage in meaningful negotiations. This marks a more aggressive stance toward Moscow, with Trump stating that after repeated empty talks, "it's got to be action."</p>

The announcement, which also saw the FDA approve a new plant-based blue dye, continues a pattern of voluntary agreements with industry rather than mandatory regulation. The administration also signaled future dietary guidelines would elevate the status of dairy products, including full-fat dairy, aligning with the industry's long-held positions.</p>

The Dragon Bravo Wildfire, which has been burning since early July, grew rapidly and destroyed an estimated 50 to 80 structures, including the main lodge building and its surrounding cabins. Designated a National Historic Landmark, the lodge was first built in the 1920s and had to be rebuilt after a previous fire in 1932. The loss of the iconic structure, beloved by generations of visitors and staff, has prompted Arizona's governor to call for an investigation into the fire's handling.</p>

In a social media post, Trump called her a "Threat to Humanity" and suggested she should remain in Ireland. This article argues that this threat, while legally dubious for a native-born citizen, is a disturbing attack on free speech and part of a pattern of using such threats to punish political opponents. This action continues to normalize the idea that the president can unilaterally punish citizens for exercising their constitutional right to criticize the government.</p>

The Trump administration has seized on the cost overruns as a new line of attack against the central bank, with which it is already at odds over interest rate policy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has defended the project, stating that claims of luxury upgrades are exaggerated and that costs have been driven by unexpected issues and inflation. To address the complaints, Powell has now requested a review of the project by the Fed's inspector general. (not investment advice)</p>

This timeline traces the story from Epstein's 2019 arrest and death, through the unsealing of court documents, to the Trump administration's recent announcements that have inflamed his base. Key moments include Trump's 2024 campaign promise to release Epstein files, followed by a DOJ release in February 2025 that disappointed conspiracy theorists. The recent DOJ conclusion that no "client list" existed and that Epstein's death was a suicide has directly led to the current backlash against Attorney General Pam Bondi and the administration.</p>

While products like Zyn are tobacco-free, they contain nicotine, which can be highly toxic to young children. Researchers analyzed U.S. poison center data and found that while pouch ingestions are a small fraction of all nicotine exposures, they are more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospitalization. Health advocates point to the colorful packaging and flavoring of these products as a potential factor in their appeal to children.</p>
