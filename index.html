        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian nationals constitute the largest group of "abandoned seafarers" globally, a crisis where shipowners sever ties with crews, withholding wages and repatriation. The article highlights cases like the crew of the Anka, stuck in Ukrainian waters for months, unable to leave without forfeiting significant back pay. Experts attribute the problem to the widespread use of "flags of convenience," where ships are registered in countries with lax regulations, obscuring ownership and hindering accountability. This system leaves sailors vulnerable, often trapped in dangerous situations far from home with little recourse.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is unofficially outsourcing its healthcare to mainland China as residents seek more affordable and accessible medical services in cities like Shenzhen. While this provides a short-term solution for an overburdened local system, the author warns it poses a long-term threat. The piece suggests that this trend could erode Hong Kong's healthcare market, diminish its capacity for medical innovation and talent development, and ultimately weaken the system it has spent decades building. The convenience and clear pricing across the border are highlighted as major draws for patients.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has signed a new law that makes all state residents, regardless of their immigration status, eligible for state-funded student financial aid. The legislation aims to provide equitable access to higher education for undocumented and other noncitizen students who do not qualify for federal aid. Supporters, like Democratic state Senator Celina Villanueva, praised the law for ensuring no student is left behind due to their birthplace. However, the move has drawn sharp criticism from Republicans, such as Representative Mary Miller, who called it a "slap in the face" to taxpayers and citizens.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis piece critiques former President Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, suggesting it was driven by a desire to shift the news cycle rather than achieve a meaningful peace agreement. The author argues that Trump's subsequent push for a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, without preconditions like a ceasefire, effectively buys more time for Russia's military campaign. The article posits that the hurried visit by European leaders to Washington was a direct response to prevent Trump from unilaterally endorsing a land-for-peace deal that would partition Ukraine. While a partition was averted for now, the outcome is seen as providing no substantive progress for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Following a high-stakes meeting at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, former President Donald Trump announced he has contacted Vladimir Putin to arrange direct talks between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. Trump stated that a trilateral summit involving himself would follow this initial meeting, calling it a "very good, early step." While Zelenskyy confirmed readiness for such a meeting, he noted no date has been set. The Kremlin's response was more cautious, acknowledging a discussion about continuing direct negotiations but not confirming a leaders' summit, highlighting the diplomatic challenges that remain.</p>

          <p>Following talks in Washington, former President Trump announced he is arranging a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to be followed by a trilateral summit. This development came after European leaders joined the discussions, appearing to push back against Trump's suggestion that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for negotiations. Trump also hinted at providing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a crucial element for any potential peace deal, though specifics remain vague. The meeting also saw President Zelenskyy adopt a more conciliatory and grateful tone compared to a previous, more acrimonious White House visit.</p>

          <p>The trial for Hernandez Govan, the man accused of orchestrating the 2021 murder of rapper Young Dolph, began in Memphis on Monday. Prosecutors allege Govan, 45, directed the two shooters who ambushed and killed the 36-year-old artist at a local cookie shop. The state's key witness is Cornelius Smith Jr., one of the admitted shooters, who previously testified that the killing was part of a $100,000 hit ordered by a rival. Govan's defense is attempting to discredit Smith, portraying him as an unreliable witness motivated by the prospect of a lighter sentence for his own charges.</p>

          <p>The opening of Camp East Montana, a new migrant detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, was met with protests from immigration advocates over the weekend. The facility, which can eventually hold up to 5,000 people, is the latest and largest of its kind. Critics, including Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar and advocacy groups, are demanding that detainees have proper access to legal counsel and are questioning the high cost of the facility. The Department of Homeland Security defended the center, stating it is a necessary part of the administration's plan for mass deportations and that it will offer all the services of a traditional ICE facility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity for a significant geographic realignment of teams into Eastern and Western conferences, similar to the NBA. Speaking during a broadcast, Manfred argued that such a move could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason matchups for broadcast partners. While the idea could face strong opposition from traditionalists, it would aim to create more regional rivalries and better broadcast time slots. Manfred hopes to have the expansion process, with Nashville and Salt Lake City as potential frontrunners, approved before his term ends in 2029.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has collected long tubes of sediment, or mud cores, from the Antarctic seabed to study centuries of the Southern Ocean's history. By analyzing the distinct layers, scientists aim to understand the historical state of marine life and the impact of human activities, such as industrial whaling. A key part of the research involves environmental DNA analysis, which can reveal the genetic "fingerprint" of past life. This will help scientists calculate how much carbon was naturally stored by large whale populations before they were decimated, providing insight into their role in regulating the global climate.</p>

          <p>According to a new court filing, a federal agent claimed the May 9th arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was carried out "per the deputy attorney general of the United States." The claim, cited from body camera footage, was made in a motion by Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was also charged in the incident. The chaotic scene occurred when lawmakers attempted an oversight visit at an immigration detention center, leading to Baraka's arrest for trespassing, a charge that was later dropped. This new information raises further questions about whether top Justice Department officials are directing law enforcement actions against political opponents.</p>

          <p>A massive, 672-tonne wooden church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being moved intact to a new location 5km away to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining.

This delicate and complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the city's center away from the expanding mine.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's economic problem of "involution," or excessive internal competition leading to diminishing returns, is a symptom of deeper issues on both the supply and demand sides. While authorities have criticized local governments for offering incentives that fuel over-competition in crowded sectors, the author suggests these actors often have no other viable options. The article posits that without strong consumer demand and alternative growth paths, businesses and local governments are forced into a self-defeating rat race. This ultimately stifles innovation and investment as profit margins shrink to near zero.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug also known as "designer Xanax." The immediate action classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, empowering law enforcement to make arrests for its sale or possession. The move came at the request of Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who is leading a coalition of 21 state attorneys general urging the federal DEA to issue a similar nationwide emergency ban. The unregulated drug, linked to dozens of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year, poses a growing public health threat.</p>

The center is overcrowded and struggling to cope with a surge in patients, reflecting a broader mental health crisis among Afghan women exacerbated by the crackdown on their rights.
