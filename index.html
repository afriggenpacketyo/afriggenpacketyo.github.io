          <p>Vani Hari, founder of the Food Babe movement, defends Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy's efforts to overhaul American health policy, arguing that entrenched bureaucrats have failed to protect human health. Hari highlights the need for structural disruption and new personnel without conflicts of interest to address issues like obesity, infertility, and depression. She emphasizes that voters, particularly MAHA moms, voted for change and accountability in public health, and that reformers like Kennedy should not back down in the face of insider discomfort. Hari believes this moment is about prioritizing prevention over pharmaceutical profits, and outcomes where American children are healthier.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 10% tariffs on nearly all imports have taken effect, sparking economic uncertainty and global stock market declines. More severe tariffs on imports from China and the European Union are slated to follow soon. The move has been met with criticism from economists and trading partners, who fear inflationary pressures and damage to global economic growth. Trump has dismissed concerns about short-term pain to American consumers, claiming the tariffs will benefit the U.S. economy in the long run.

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs could significantly impact the tech industry, particularly Apple, by raising production costs and potentially increasing consumer prices. The iPhone, largely manufactured in China, could become more expensive due to the tariffs, and other tech companies may face similar challenges. While the White House aims to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., experts say shifting production is complex and may not be feasible in the short term.

          <p>Sectarian killings have ravaged Syrian villages, leaving hundreds dead and raising doubts about the new government's ability to maintain order. The violence, targeting Alawites, has fractured the honeymoon period following the ousting of former President Bashar Assad and threatens international recognition.

Superintendent Alberto Carvalho detailed plans to quickly rebuild the campuses, using a $9 billion construction bond and insurance funds, with FEMA support expected. The rebuilding process aims to get students back to their campuses as soon as possible, with ongoing environmental testing and temporary classrooms planned. The cleanup's speed could serve as a model for other schools affected by fires.</p>

          <p>Poodle-dog bush, a rash-causing plant, is growing in fire-scarred areas of the Angeles National Forest following recent fires. The plant, which thrives in the wake of wildfires, can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. While botanists acknowledge its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing wildlife cover, hikers are advised to avoid it and take precautions such as wearing long sleeves and staying on marked trails. Conditions are favorable for a new crop of poodle-dog bush to flourish in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's selection of Paula White, a televangelist known for prosperity gospel theology and controversial statements, to head the "White House faith office" has stirred criticism. White's history of financial solicitations, including selling "resurrection seeds" and offering blessings for a fee, has drawn scrutiny.

          <p>Akkermansia muciniphila is a type of gut bacteria that lives in the large intestine and helps maintain the gut barrier, which is important for overall health. This bacteria uses enzymes to extract energy from glycoproteins in mucin, a layer of mucus that covers the large intestine's surface. Studies have shown that A muciniphila can calm the immune system and prevent obesity and diabetes. Eating a variable, high-fiber diet can help support A muciniphila and other beneficial bacteria in the gut.</p>

Nadler argues that Trump, who has appointed antisemites to high positions and undermined civil rights efforts, does not genuinely care about protecting Jewish people. He warns that curtailing freedom on campuses will ultimately harm Jews and that Trump's actions are dangerous and counterproductive.</p>
