          <p>The United Kingdom is poised for a 30C heatwave this bank holiday Monday, marking what is expected to be one of the hottest summers on record. This warm period, influenced by the remnants of Hurricane Erin, will be brief, giving way to unsettled weather, including wind and rain, from Tuesday. The sustained dry conditions have already led to widespread hosepipe bans and raised concerns among farmers about a potentially catastrophic harvest. Scientists are increasingly linking these more intense and frequent heatwaves to the broader impacts of climate change, highlighting a worrying trend for the future.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested a 38-year-old man in connection with an attempted residential burglary at music legend Lionel Richie's Beverly Hills home. The incident occurred overnight, with Richie reportedly present when his security system activated, deterring the intruder before any items were stolen. The suspect was apprehended nearby, and police confirm the investigation is ongoing. This event is part of a recent trend, coming weeks after another high-profile burglary investigation at Brad Pitt’s former residence, where four suspects were arrested in connection with a string of residential break-ins across Southern California.</p>

          <p>An Air Canada flight en route from Toronto to Las Vegas was forced to make an emergency landing at Chicago's O'Hare Airport due to a disruptive passenger. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the crew's report of a passenger disturbance, leading to the diversion. While the situation was resolved without an arrest, the flight experienced a three-hour delay before continuing to its destination. This incident highlights a persistent issue in air travel, as airlines have reported over 1,000 unruly passenger incidents so far this year, with potential civil penalties reaching up to $37,000 per violation for offenders.</p>

          <p>A tragic tour bus accident on the New York State Thruway in western New York resulted in five fatalities and left many of the 54 passengers injured. The bus, returning to New York City from Niagara Falls, lost control and rolled over into a ditch for reasons still under investigation, though mechanical failure and operator impairment have been ruled out. Several hospitals received patients, with some requiring intensive care for critical injuries. The victims included individuals from Indian, Chinese, and Filipino nationalities, and the highway was temporarily closed, prompting Governor Kathy Hochul to express condolences and coordinate assistance efforts.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has finalized the acquisition of England international Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace in a deal valued at £60 million, including add-ons. The 27-year-old forward, a boyhood Arsenal fan who started his youth career with the club, chose to rejoin the Gunners despite Tottenham having previously agreed terms with both Palace and the player. Sporting director Andrea Berta praised Eze as a "creative and explosive talent," while manager Mikel Arteta highlighted his powerful attacking game and strong mentality. Eze shared an emotional farewell message to Crystal Palace fans, expressing gratitude for their support throughout his career.</p>

          <p>Widespread protests against the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers took place across the UK, often met by counter-demonstrations from anti-racism activists. Police were deployed in riot gear and on horseback in several cities, including Bristol, Liverpool, and Perth, to maintain separation between the opposing groups. These demonstrations come in the wake of a High Court ruling that prevented an Essex hotel from accommodating asylum seekers, prompting other councils to explore legal action. The government remains committed to closing asylum hotels in a managed way, despite a recent 8% increase in the number of asylum seekers housed in these facilities.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lieutenant General Jeffery Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), along with two other senior military commanders. This decision comes weeks after the White House publicly rejected a leaked DIA report that assessed American strikes had only set back Iran's nuclear program by months, a finding President Trump called "flat out wrong." Senator Mark Warner criticized the sacking as a sign of Trump treating intelligence as a "loyalty test," aligning with a pattern of removing officials whose analyses conflict with the administration's narrative. The FBI is reportedly investigating the leak of the assessment.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has declared that the nation's current welfare state is no longer financially viable, calling for reforms and dismissing any notion of increasing income tax on medium-sized companies. These statements, delivered at a CDU party conference, are likely to create friction with his Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners. While the SPD also acknowledges the need for social insurance system reforms due to rising costs, they stress the importance of innovative solutions rather than solely focusing on benefit cuts. Merz's comments are seen as an attempt to consolidate support among his base and address concerns from voters who have gravitated towards the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).</p>

While institutional investors dominate the overall ETF market, they are largely absent from risky categories like single-stock, leveraged, or inverse ETFs, which have attracted over $60 billion year-to-date, primarily from retail investors. ETF Action's Mike Akins notes that this "product proliferation" and "money flows chasing returns" echo patterns seen at previous market tops.

          <p>A federal judge has expanded a previous order, blocking the Trump administration from cutting federal funding to 34 "sanctuary cities" and counties that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Judge William Orrick ruled that the administration's attempts to freeze Housing and Urban Development grants to these municipalities were unconstitutional. Cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, and Denver are now protected from these funding cuts. The administration, which argues against subsidizing policies that hinder immigration control, has escalated its confrontation with Democrat-led jurisdictions, even deploying the National Guard in some areas.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to be armed, escalating the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses an earlier stance that troops would not carry weapons, despite their primary role being near landmarks rather than direct law enforcement. President Trump, who took control of the city's police force and declared D.C. "safe," suggested expanding the mission to other Democratic-run cities like Chicago. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed "grave concerns," calling the deployment "uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound," fearing it could inflame tensions and undermine crime reduction progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has announced it will not defend a decades-old grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), deeming the funding unconstitutional. The department agrees with a lawsuit arguing that reserving grants for colleges with at least 25% Hispanic undergraduates provides an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity, citing the 2023 Supreme Court affirmative action ruling. Over 500 colleges are designated HSIs, eligible for about $350 million in annual grants. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities plans to intervene in the lawsuit, arguing the grants are constitutional and help level the playing field for institutions that enroll a significant portion of Latino students but receive less overall funding.</p>

She maintained that Trump was a "gentleman" in social settings and denied introducing Prince Andrew to Epstein, suggesting Sarah Ferguson was responsible.

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted again, spewing lava 100 feet into the air across its summit crater floor, marking its 31st eruption since December. This frequent activity is characteristic of one of the world's most active volcanoes, with the eruption contained within the summit and posing no threat to homes. Scientists explain that magma continuously rises from a lower chamber, building pressure until it's forced to the surface through narrow vents, creating spectacular lava fountains. The ongoing eruptions have significantly boosted visitation to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, offering unique opportunities for observation while emphasizing safety precautions due to unstable terrain and volcanic gases.</p>

This declaration has intensified international pleas for a ceasefire as Israel prepares for a major offensive in Gaza City, which it claims is a Hamas stronghold.

          <p>A mechanic has identified six SUV models that are likely to incur significant ownership costs beyond their warranty period, cautioning consumers about potential financial drains. Chris Pyle of JustAnswer highlights issues such as massive depreciation, high maintenance expenses, and specific mechanical failures like problematic CVT transmissions in Nissans or electronic issues in Lincoln Aviators. Other vehicles, including the Land Rover Range Rover, GMC Yukon, VW Tiguan, and Jeep Compass, are flagged for costly engine problems, poor fuel economy, or fundamental design flaws.

          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a controversial Republican-backed redistricting bill, which Governor Greg Abbott has pledged to swiftly sign into law. This measure aims to redraw the state's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to bolster the party's majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, as urged by President Trump. Democrats have vowed legal challenges, arguing the plan undermines fair representation and dilutes minority voting power. The bill's passage follows a weeks-long standoff where Texas House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum, and has sparked a nationwide debate, with California Governor Gavin Newsom introducing a counter-redistricting plan.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were denied parole after separate hearings in California, with parole boards citing their prison conduct and a perceived lack of full candor regarding their past actions. Erik's denial stemmed from involvement in fights, drug use, a tax-fraud scheme, and stashing banned items, which commissioners deemed indicative of a lack of self-awareness. He also admitted to associating with a prison gang, claiming it was for survival in an "extremely violent yard" where friends were stabbed or sexually assaulted. Lyle's denial, despite acknowledged remorse, pointed to "anti-social personality traits" and repeated mobile phone violations. Both brothers maintained their parents' murders in 1989 were self-defense due to sexual assault.</p>
