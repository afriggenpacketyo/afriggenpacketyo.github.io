          <p>Rebecca Patterson, former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater, warns that foreign investors are losing faith in the reliability of the U.S. market due to concerns about tariffs and the weaponizing of capital markets. She suggests that global investors are gradually reducing their exposure to U.S. assets, which could lead to a significant impact on U.S. markets. Even a small reduction in global participation could result in a $1.2 trillion sell-off, representing 2.3% of the S&P 500's total market capitalization. This shift is expected to occur gradually as investment committees deliberate and implement changes over several months.</p>

          <p>Boaz Barak, a computer science professor at Harvard University, argues against the increasing politicization of university classrooms. He recounts his personal experiences of balancing his professional duties with his activism, emphasizing the importance of maintaining boundaries between academic and political spheres. Barak believes that the erosion of trust in higher education is partly due to the blurring lines between scholarship and activism. He advocates for professionalism and the development of critical thinking skills, suggesting that universities should focus on fostering habits of mind rather than promoting specific ideologies.</p>

          <p>Two planes were instructed to perform "go-arounds" at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) to avoid a potential collision with a military helicopter. This incident occurred less than a month after the FAA increased staffing and oversight at DCA following a deadly midair collision in January. The FAA had previously restricted non-essential helicopter operations and prohibited simultaneous use of certain runways when helicopters are operating near DCA. An investigation is underway to determine how this incident occurred despite the new safety guidelines. The airport is known for having the busiest runway in America.</p>

With the series tied, the Clippers now have an opportunity to advance further than any team in franchise history, contingent on Harden maintaining his level of play in the upcoming game.

While traditional media stocks have struggled, Netflix's co-CEO stated that they haven't seen any major impacts from the economic climate, as entertainment has historically been resilient during tougher times.

          <p>Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, was found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, Kendy Howard. Kendy was found dead in their bathtub with a gunshot wound to her head in February 2021, initially dispatched as a suicide. However, suspicious clues at the scene, such as a packed duffle bag and freshly cleaned towels, led investigators to suspect foul play. The prosecution argued that Dan Howard used a carotid restraint hold, learned during his law enforcement training, to kill Kendy, while the defense maintained it was suicide. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

The incident highlights concerns about aging infrastructure and the push to expand offshore oil drilling.

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a "catch and revoke" policy, resulting in a zero-tolerance approach for visa holders who violate U.S. laws. Under this policy, foreign nationals can have their visa status revoked for even minor infractions, prompting concerns from immigration experts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that a visa is a privilege, not a right, emphasizing the administration's commitment to strict enforcement. This policy has already been applied to student visa holders who protested Israel's war in Gaza, leading to criticism about potential overreach and the targeting of political dissent.</p>

          <p>A review of the western film "Rust" acknowledges the tragic accidental death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during production, noting the context is unavoidable. The article asserts that the film is a moody indie with a heart and a conscience, and that it is a woeful story about an unintended shooting death. Despite the weight of the tragedy, the review praises the film's cinematography and its exploration of violence, atonement, and justice. However, it finds the central relationship and overall storytelling somewhat lacking, making it a solemn performance at a wake rather than a work to be accepted on its own terms.</p>

          <p>The US and Ukraine have established a United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Fund to attract global investment into Ukraine. The US will contribute to the fund, potentially including air defense systems, while Kyiv will contribute 50% of revenues from new licenses for extracting raw materials. The fund will invest in projects for extracting fossil fuels, oil and gas, and related infrastructure or recycling. Experts believe that investment can only be expected after the end of the "hot phase" of Russia's war against Ukraine.</p>
