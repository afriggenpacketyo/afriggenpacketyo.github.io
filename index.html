While not expected to directly impact the U.S. mainland, a Hurricane Watch is in effect for Haiti, which faces risks of heavy rain, flash flooding, and landslides. The National Hurricane Center notes significant uncertainty in the storm's future track and intensity, urging residents in Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Cuba to monitor forecasts closely.

          <p>Coca-Cola reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to climb. Despite the positive results, the company noted that overall consumer demand for its beverages remains soft but is showing signs of improvement. Unit case volume saw a slight 1% increase, reversing the previous quarter's decline, though key markets like North America and Latin America remained flat. The company is targeting budget-conscious consumers with smaller, more affordable options while seeing growth in its premium brands like Fairlife and Smartwater. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced it is reviewing strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company, after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties. This development sent the company's shares up by 10% and expands upon its earlier plan to split into two separate entities by mid-2026. Sources indicate that potential suitors include Netflix and Comcast, and that WBD had previously rejected several offers from Paramount Skydance. The move comes as the media giant continues to grapple with over $40 billion in debt from its 2022 merger.</p>

          <p>A tribunal revealed that a wiring mistake by a BT engineer resulted in three innocent people being wrongly accused of downloading child abuse images. The error caused the internet activity of the actual offender to be traced to the claimants' address, leading to police searches and seizure of their devices. The false accusations had severe personal and professional consequences, including child protection referrals and one person having a job offer withdrawn. While the tribunal found that the police acted lawfully and the error was technical, BT's mistake caused significant distress for the wrongly accused individuals.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat have skyrocketed, surging 47% on Tuesday alone and more than 127% since Monday. The dramatic rally was triggered after Roundhill Investments added the struggling company to its Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a short squeeze against investors betting against the stock. The surge marks a significant turnaround for the former penny stock, which had been underperforming for years. This revival, alongside a new distribution deal with Walmart, has brought renewed attention to the company, though some see it as a potential sign of market froth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas that, over a 20-year period, traps approximately 84 times more heat than carbon dioxide, making it a major driver of climate change. While it has a shorter atmospheric lifespan than CO2, it is responsible for about 20-30% of the global warming seen since the Industrial Revolution. About 60% of methane emissions come from human activities, including agriculture, landfills, and the energy sector, where it leaks during the production and transport of oil and gas. The article notes that solutions, such as fixing leaks in energy infrastructure, can be relatively simple and could significantly reduce emissions.</p>

Each of the four firms reported third-quarter profits that beat Wall Street estimates, driven by increased defense deliveries and robust commercial orders. Lockheed Martin's CEO noted "unprecedented demand" from both the U.S. and its allies, prompting investments to increase production capacity. The positive forecasts reflect a thriving defense sector with substantial backlogs and growing sales across their divisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Foreign Office has added eight countries, including Japan, Mexico, and Russia, to its travel advisory list concerning the risk of methanol poisoning from tainted alcoholic drinks. The warning, which now covers 16 countries, advises travelers to be cautious of counterfeit or homemade alcohol, as unscrupulous producers sometimes add the toxic industrial chemical to cut costs. Methanol poisoning can cause severe illness, blindness, and death, with early symptoms like blurry vision and confusion. The updated guidance urges British nationals to buy sealed drinks from licensed venues and seek immediate medical help if symptoms appear.</p>

Brands, has stepped in to acquire the remaining 64 restaurants, saving 1,276 jobs. This marks the second time the UK dining business has faced administration in less than a year, reflecting ongoing struggles in the casual dining sector.</p>

          <p>A new survey from Schroders reveals that nine out of ten working Americans intend to claim Social Security benefits before the recommended age of 70, despite knowing it results in a lower monthly payment. While waiting until 70 maximizes benefits, 44% of respondents plan to file before reaching the full retirement age of 67. Researchers suggest this is not an oversight but a reflection of financial necessity, as many workers need the income immediately upon retiring. Concerns about the long-term solvency of the Social Security system also contribute to the trend of claiming benefits earlier. (not investment advice)</p>

Ranchers argue that instead of market interventions that could harm domestic producers, the government should focus on biosecurity and eradicating the parasite threat to ensure the long-term stability of the U.S. beef supply.</p>
