          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have arrived in Alaska for a high-stakes summit focused on Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. The meeting, held at a military base, is expected to last several hours and will involve top aides, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was not invited, has urged for a subsequent trilateral meeting and stated that Russia continues its aggression even on the day of negotiations. European leaders are anxiously awaiting the outcome, hoping Trump will represent their interests and provide a debrief following the talks.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Health Forum finds that children on Medicaid experiencing a mental health crisis frequently get stuck in emergency departments for days while awaiting hospital admission. This practice, known as "boarding," affects about one in ten pediatric mental health ER visits, with depressive disorders and suicidal ideation being common triggers. Experts attribute this national problem to a severe shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds and adequate outpatient services for children. These prolonged ER stays in non-therapeutic environments can worsen a child's condition due to isolation and lack of specialized care.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, currently tracking over the ocean as a Category 1 storm. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate it will continue to strengthen, potentially becoming a major hurricane with Category 4 winds early next week. While not expected to make a direct impact on the United States mainland, its path is projected to pass near the northern Leeward Islands, prompting tropical storm watches in the Caribbean.

          <p>Rapper Sean Kingston, legally named Kisean Anderson, has been sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison for his involvement in a million-dollar fraud scheme. He was convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud for obtaining luxury items like an SUV, jewelry, and electronics without payment, often using fake wire transfer receipts. Kingston's mother, Janice Turner, was also convicted for her role and received a five-year sentence. The arrests followed a SWAT raid on Kingston's rented Florida mansion in May 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, concerns about its long-term financial stability are growing. The program, which supports nearly 70 million Americans, is projected to see its trust funds depleted by 2034, potentially leading to a 23% reduction in benefits if no action is taken. This is due to outgoings increasingly outpacing income from payroll taxes as the population ages. Potential solutions being debated include raising the cap on income subject to Social Security taxes or increasing the full retirement age. The article notes these challenges are mounting amid declining public confidence in the program's future. (not investment advice)</p>

The feat puts him in line to share a significant bonus prize with another player who made a 147 earlier in the tournament. O'Sullivan's performance demonstrates his enduring skill and dominance in the sport as he aims for his first ranking event title in 19 months.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted on federal corruption charges following a multi-year investigation. The indictment is linked to allegations that she accepted gifts, such as sports tickets and a cellphone, from a local businessman in exchange for official acts. A retired police officer who served as her bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, was also charged as a co-defendant in relation to an alleged affair and payroll fraud. Cantrell is the first mayor in the city's history to be federally charged while still in office, adding to a legacy of political corruption scandals in New Orleans.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General, Brian Schwalb, has filed a federal lawsuit to challenge President Trump's executive order placing the city's Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. The suit argues the move is an "unlawful" and "hostile takeover" that infringes upon the district's right to self-governance and was based on a false premise of out-of-control crime. Schwalb is seeking a temporary restraining order to halt the directive, which installed a DEA administrator as the head of the D.C. police. The lawsuit names Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and several federal agencies as defendants, escalating the conflict over local autonomy.</p>

          <p>The horror film "Weapons," from director Zach Cregger, is being praised for its daring narrative that provides clear answers to its central mystery about a group of children who mysteriously vanish. The article describes the movie as a "feel-bad, feel-good" experience, where the eventual supernatural explanation and defeat of the villain offer cinematic catharsis. However, the review notes that the film smartly underlines the fallacy of this relief, emphasizing that vanquishing the evil force does not erase the trauma and grief it caused the community.

          <p>A new survey indicates that nearly 60% of U.S. adults are prioritizing the repayment of credit card debt, which collectively stands at over $1.2 trillion. With average interest rates near 22%, carrying a balance has become a significant financial strain for many households. The article notes that while motivation is high, the challenge is compounded by the fact that 45% of adults have balances on more than one card. It suggests several strategies for tackling debt, including debt management plans, credit counseling, and consolidation, to help borrowers create a manageable path toward financial freedom.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, particularly her most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." It explores Spark's "steely command of omniscience" and her central concern with moral education and faith, themes rooted in her conversion to Catholicism. The review highlights how "Miss Jean Brodie" investigates the powerful influence a magnetic teacher can have on impressionable adolescents. It notes that while the story is about the students' journey, it ultimately reveals how one character's path to adulthood and religious conversion is deeply, and permanently, shaped by her formative teacher.</p>

          <p>The NCAA has levied significant penalties against the University of Michigan's football program for a sign-stealing scheme that occurred from 2021 to 2023. The university faces a fine of approximately $30 million and four years of probation, though it will not have to vacate its 2023 national championship. Former coach Jim Harbaugh, now with the NFL's Los Angeles Chargers, received an extended 10-year show-cause penalty, making a return to college coaching difficult. The staff member who orchestrated the scheme, Connor Stalions, was given an eight-year show-cause penalty for arranging the improper in-person scouting of opponents.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly streamlined his national security decision-making process, moving away from the traditional, expert-driven National Security Council (NSC) structure. Major foreign policy decisions are now primarily made by a small group of trusted advisers, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This shift reflects Trump's preference for a more personalized and less bureaucratic approach, trusting his own instincts over a wider range of viewpoints. While this allows for more nimble decision-making, critics cited in the article warn it increases the risk of unintended consequences by limiting expert input and rigorous policy debate.</p>

The lawsuit claims the report, authored by five scientists described as "known climate contrarians," was produced without public transparency and is being used to justify revoking the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which allows for the regulation of greenhouse gases. Critics argue the report is full of inaccuracies, cherry-picks data, and misrepresents peer-reviewed research to downplay the risks of climate change, constituting a politically motivated effort to rewrite science.</p>

          <p>Senior Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Jamie Raskin, have introduced a joint resolution to terminate President Trump's federalization of the Washington, D.C. police force. The resolution invokes the D.C. Home Rule Act, arguing that Trump has not demonstrated the "special conditions of an emergency" required by law to justify such a takeover. The sponsors contend that the president's action is an egregious attack on D.C.'s self-governance, based on misleading crime statistics, and has actually harmed public safety by blocking local funds.

The activity is centered in the Geysers steam field, an area known for frequent minor quakes due to the operations of its geothermal power facilities. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, these small, induced earthquakes are common and caused by the withdrawal of steam and the injection of cold water to generate electricity.
