          <h2>President Trump and Fed Chair Powell Publicly Clash Over Renovation Costs During Site Visit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 16:27:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell engaged in a public disagreement over the cost of the Fed's headquarters renovation during an unprecedented presidential visit. The confrontation occurred as Trump toured the construction site, a move widely seen as part of his ongoing pressure campaign to influence the central bank's interest rate policies. Trump asserted that renovation costs were over $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately disputed, stating it included a separate, previously completed project. This visit highlights the intense and unusual political pressure being applied to the historically independent Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a rescissions bill into law, successfully clawing back approximately $9 billion in previously allocated funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting. The legislation, which marks a rare use of this presidential power, targets organizations such as USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The passage of the bill was contentious, facing hurdles in both the House and Senate, with some Republicans expressing reservations about cuts to specific programs like global AIDS relief before a final version was approved.</p>

          <p>Ride-sharing company Lyft has launched a new feature that allows passengers to designate drivers as a "favorite" within the app. This function prioritizes matching riders with their preferred drivers for future scheduled trips, aiming to enhance customer experience and build better relationships between riders and drivers. The move gives drivers priority access to certain customers and follows a trend of offering more personalized options, similar to competitor Uber's feature that allows female passengers to request female drivers. The feature is set to be widely available across the U.S. and Canada by the end of August.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B is being sued by a woman who alleges she was injured when the artist threw her microphone into the crowd during a Las Vegas performance in July 2023. The lawsuit, filed just before the statute of limitations expired, accuses the rapper of battery, assault, and negligence, calling the act an "unreasonable escalation." The plaintiff, who is proceeding as Jane Doe due to alleged trauma, is seeking up to $15,000 in damages for physical and emotional injuries. The microphone in question was later auctioned for charity for nearly $100,000.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a settlement with the Trump administration, paying $221 million and committing to institutional reforms to resolve federal investigations into campus antisemitism. The deal requires the university to create a new vice provost role to ensure "balanced" Middle East studies programs and to hire more faculty for its Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies. While the agreement ends a period of intense government pressure, critics warn that it sets a troubling precedent for government intervention in academic freedom and curriculum.</p>

          <p>A six-month investigation by CBS News has uncovered the significant risks associated with Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) technology used by law enforcement across the country. The report details over a dozen verified cases where technology glitches or administrative errors led to innocent individuals being wrongly identified as suspects, resulting in potentially dangerous situations, including armed stops. While police departments praise ALPR systems as a vital crime-fighting tool, the findings raise serious concerns about accuracy, privacy, and the potential for civil rights violations.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim suggesting the animated series "The Simpsons" predicted a recent kiss cam moment at a Coldplay concert has been debunked as false. A fact-check by DW found that the alleged screenshot from the show circulating online is not from any actual episode and was likely generated using artificial intelligence or digital manipulation. The article notes that while the show has had some uncanny coincidences over its long run, many of its most famous supposed predictions are either misattributed, exaggerated, or entirely fabricated.</p>
