          <p>A New York City police officer and three civilians were killed in a shooting inside a Midtown Manhattan office building. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a documented mental health history, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the attack. The deceased officer, Didarul Islam, was a four-year NYPD veteran and father of two with a third child on the way. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, but authorities believe the shooter acted alone and there is no ongoing threat.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of bribery and witness tampering. The court ruled that Uribe conspired to influence testimony from former paramilitary members who had accused him of having ties to their groups. Uribe, a polarizing figure credited by some for fighting leftist rebels but criticized by others for human rights abuses, faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal. The verdict has drawn praise from his opponents and condemnation from supporters, including U.S. officials.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has encouraged his new South Korean counterpart to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling."

The two ministers reaffirmed their commitment to advancing their strategic partnership, signaling a potential thaw in diplomatic tensions and a focus on pragmatic cooperation between the neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>To combat a looming demographic crisis, China has announced its first nationwide subsidy program aimed at encouraging more births. The government will offer parents an annual payment for each child under the age of three, a policy expected to assist around 20 million families. This move follows various local initiatives and addresses China's falling population, rapidly aging workforce, and the high costs associated with raising children, which have deterred many from expanding their families.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is being viewed by some economists as asymmetric and potentially damaging to the EU's economy. The agreement imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, which could reduce the bloc's annual GDP, while U.S. goods will face no new tariffs. Despite the unfavorable terms, the deal removes the uncertainty of President Trump's previous threat to impose a much higher 30% tariff. (not investment advice)</p>

He argues that Wall Street is currently focused on this week's major tech earnings reports, an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and key employment data. The predictable nature of the trade negotiations, along with unresolved deals with other major partners, has led to a sense of "tariff ennui" among investors. (not investment advice)</p>
