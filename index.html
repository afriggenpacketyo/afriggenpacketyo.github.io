          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, emphasizing the department's need to fulfill its obligations as mandated by Congress. This order follows the Education Department's announcement on March 11 of a reduction in force that would have significantly cut the agency's staff. The decision comes after multiple lawsuits were filed against the Trump administration, including one by 21 states, challenging the staff cuts. Optimism score is 70.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed the "Big, Beautiful Bill," resulting in several winners and losers, with some experiencing mixed outcomes. The House Freedom Caucus gained influence by shifting Medicaid Work Requirements to take effect earlier than initially proposed. Blue-state Republicans secured a higher State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) for their constituents, while President Trump saw his tax cuts preserved. However, the bill's passage contributes to the national debt and deficit, leading to criticism from Democratic leadership and concerns over cuts to green energy tax credits and abortion provider funding. Optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>The House has passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000 for individuals and phasing it out for incomes over $500,000. This provision, set to take effect in 2025, aims to provide tax relief to residents in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. However, the revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap, and the proposal may face opposition in the Senate.

The 4-4 split, with Justice Barrett not participating, means the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling stands, preventing public funds from flowing directly to religious schools in this instance. The legal battle stemmed from an attempt to establish St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which Oklahoma's highest court deemed a violation of the state's requirement for charter schools to be nonreligious. The issue of religious institutions' participation in charter school systems is likely to return to the Supreme Court in the future. Optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>In times of frustration and cynicism, seeking moral beauty in acts of charity, kindness, and self-sacrifice can provide a path to happiness. Witnessing moral beauty elicits "moral elevation," leading to a desire to be better and help others, resulting in prosocial actions and higher levels of happiness. Ways to cultivate moral beauty include spending time with generous people, dedicating leisure time to serving others, and practicing gratitude.

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's close alliance with Donald Trump has backfired, as Trump's recent actions demonstrate a shift away from unconditional support for Israel. Trump has announced new nuclear negotiations with Iran, halted Americaâ€™s campaign against the Houthis, and secured the release of an American Israeli hostage from Gaza without involving Israel. These actions have exposed Netanyahu's carefully cultivated image as a geopolitical genius and the ultimate guarantor of Israeli security. Netanyahu's reliance on Trump has left him isolated and vulnerable. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>A man in Norway awoke to discover a 440-foot container ship had run aground just meters from his house. Johan Helberg was alerted to the incident by a neighbor who had tried to ring his doorbell but couldn't get him to answer. The ship, the NCL Salten, caused damage to a heating pipe in Helberg's cabin, but no one was injured. The cause of the incident is being investigated, and the ship is awaiting refloating. Optimism score is 85.</p>
