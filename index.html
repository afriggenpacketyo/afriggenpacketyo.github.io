          <p>A grand jury in Colorado indicted Barry Morphew for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in May 2020 and whose remains were found in September 2023. Barry Morphew was initially charged with her murder in 2021, but the charges were dropped before trial. The indictment alleges inconsistencies in Barry's statements regarding their marriage and reveals that Suzanne had discussed divorce plans with a friend. The autopsy determined her death was a homicide caused by intoxication from a chemical mixture known as BAM, which Barry Morphew had access to due to his prior work as a deer farmer. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration, preventing them from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. The ruling bars the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database for student visa applications. The Department of Homeland Security had previously threatened to revoke Harvard's certification, citing alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism. This legal battle is part of a broader conflict between Harvard and the Trump administration, including demands for policy changes and threats to cut off billions in grants. </p>

          <p>Recently unsealed court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a "prepper" who had given his wife a "bailout plan". Boelter is accused of killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. The affidavit details that Boelter's wife told investigators they prepared for major incidents and that her husband instructed her to go to her mother's home in Wisconsin.

          <p>The Supreme Court sided with the oil and gas industry in its challenge to California’s emission standards, reviving the industry’s lawsuit in a 7-2 decision. The court ruled that fuel makers had standing to sue over California’s strict emissions standards, arguing that the state and the EPA were abusing their power. The court did not rule on the suit itself, but said the fuel makers had standing to sue because they would be injured by the state’s rule. This decision aligns with recent actions by President Trump and congressional Republicans to limit California's authority in setting emission standards. </p>

          <p>A new analysis suggests that the Republican's One Big Beautiful Bill Act could lead to higher monthly payments for many federal student loan borrowers. Under the proposed "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), borrowers earning around $80,000 annually could face significantly higher payments compared to the Biden administration's SAVE plan. While some borrowers may see smaller bills under RAP compared to existing income-driven repayment plans, the overall impact could push more borrowers into default. The repayment timeline would also stretch to 30 years before loan forgiveness. </p>
