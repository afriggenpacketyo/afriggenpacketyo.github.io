          <p>In a significant display of transatlantic solidarity, several key European leaders will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are among those attending. This collective presence is seen as an effort to bolster Ukraine's position and prevent a repeat of a previously contentious solo meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump. The united front aims to underscore Europe's unwavering support for Ukraine and influence potential peace negotiations with Russia.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly intensifying to a powerful Category 5. Currently located north of the Caribbean, the storm is not forecast to make a direct impact on the United States mainland, though its path is being closely monitored. Forecasters note the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that can cause temporary weakening before potential re-intensification. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands, with heavy rain and swells affecting the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.</p>

          <p>Germany has suspended its humanitarian visa program, potentially preventing approximately 300 Russian and Belarusian dissidents, including Kremlin critics, from entering the country for safety. The decision by the new coalition government affects individuals whose visas had already been approved by the Foreign Office but were awaiting final issuance from the Interior Ministry. Activist groups like The Ark Project highlight the danger these individuals face in neighboring post-Soviet states, where they risk abduction or extradition back to Russia. The German Interior Ministry cites a review of admission programs as the reason for the suspension, leaving many anti-war activists in a precarious situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's ruling coalition is at odds over how to expand the Bundeswehr to meet NATO personnel targets, with a central debate over reinstating compulsory military service. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of the SPD has proposed a more attractive voluntary service model, which includes mandatory questionnaires and medical checks for young men. However, members of the CDU/CSU coalition partners argue this approach is insufficient given the current security climate and advocate for a quicker path to potential conscription. The disagreement highlights a fundamental split on security policy, balancing individual liberties against the need for a stronger national defense amid regional threats.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old California man, Ryan Wardwell, was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in Tulare County. While attempting to rappel down the Seven Teacups waterfalls, extreme water hydraulics forced him off his lines and into a secluded spot with no escape route. After he was reported missing, a search operation involving a drone located him, leading to a dramatic helicopter hoist rescue. Wardwell sustained only minor injuries and dehydration, and has since been reunited with his family in what authorities called a "stunning survival story."</p>

While these colleges eliminate the financial burden of tuition, they often have highly selective admissions standards and may require students to participate in work-study programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation. These unique models provide an alternative path to a degree for students concerned about affordability and debt.</p>

          <p>A growing trend of "5-to-9" vlogs, which document people's meticulously scheduled routines before and after their standard workday, highlights how productivity culture is infiltrating personal time. These videos often showcase a relentless optimization of leisure hours, filled with workouts, meal prep, and chores, leaving little room for spontaneous rest. The article suggests that this phenomenon reflects a broader societal pressure where, in a life centered around work, even free time becomes a form of labor. This constant drive to be productive blurs the lines between personal and professional life, turning relaxation into another task to be efficiently completed and documented.</p>

          <p>Three years after the launch of ChatGPT, generative AI has become a standard tool for a majority of college students, fundamentally altering the landscape of higher education. Students now routinely use AI for tasks ranging from summarizing readings to completing assignments, driven by academic pressure and the need to manage heavy workloads. While some faculty are adapting by reverting to in-class, handwritten assignments, many remain unaware of the technology's deep integration into student life. The article suggests that this rapid, student-led adoption of AI presents a profound challenge, forcing universities to reconsider traditional methods of teaching and assessment to maintain academic integrity and relevance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its oversight of university admissions by requiring federally funded institutions to submit detailed applicant data. This move aims to enforce the 2023 Supreme Court ruling that ended race-based affirmative action, with the administration investigating whether schools are using "racial proxies" to circumvent the ban. Amid this scrutiny, some policy experts advocate for class-based affirmative action, which they argue would legally promote both racial and economic diversity. However, there are concerns that the administration may also challenge class-based preferences, potentially creating conflict with its own political base, which includes many working-class families who could benefit from such policies.</p>

However, removals to France have not yet begun, and the continued crossings are putting pressure on the UK government to demonstrate the deal's effectiveness as a deterrent.

          <p>The South Korean government's decision to significantly reduce radio broadcasts into North Korea, a move intended to ease inter-Korean tensions, is reportedly endangering the North's underground Christian population. For the estimated 400,000 Christians in the totalitarian state, where religious practice is a crime punishable by death, these foreign broadcasts are a vital and often sole link to religious teaching and information. Critics argue that cutting these transmissions silences a message of hope and empowers the Kim Jong Un regime, which views Christianity as a direct threat to its authority. The policy change has been described by some human rights advocates as a "catastrophic strategic mistake."</p>

Argentina mounted a significant second-half comeback, narrowing the deficit to just seven points at one stage. However, two late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho secured the win for New Zealand, extending Argentina's winless home record against the All Blacks to 15 matches.</p>

          <p>West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced they will send hundreds of their National Guard troops to Washington D.C. at the request of the Trump administration. This deployment will bolster a federal intervention aimed at addressing crime and homelessness in the nation's capital, an action initiated by President Trump's executive order that federalized local police forces. The move has been met with protests from residents and city officials, who view it as a federal overreach and a "military occupation," particularly as local data shows violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term. The escalation marks a significant assertion of federal control over the district's governance.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on how her appreciation for Renaissance art evolved from youthful indifference to a profound connection forged through life experience. Initially dismissing the art form as unrelatable religious iconography, she found new meaning in its depictions of complex human emotions after experiencing trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood. The author connects her journey to the work of contemporary artist Jenny Saville, whose motherhood paintings are heavily influenced by Renaissance masters like Michelangelo. The article posits that understanding the deep emotional resonance of such art often requires a maturity and perspective that only living through life's significant events can provide.</p>

          <p>Phoenix police captured a notorious cold-case killer through an undercover operation at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. Detectives arranged to meet with Bryan Patrick Miller, a person of interest in the 1990s "canal murders," under the guise of a casual conversation. The true purpose was to covertly collect his DNA from a drinking glass. Miller, known locally for dressing as a "Zombie Hunter" character, was not initially considered a strong suspect by the lead detective. However, eleven days later, the DNA from the glass provided a direct match to evidence found on the victims, leading to Miller's arrest, eventual conviction, and a death sentence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has brokered a novel deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China in exchange for sharing 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This represents a significant shift from previous export bans and raises concerns among trade experts that it sets a "dangerous precedent" of selling export control licenses. While the White House frames it as a "revenue-sharing" agreement, critics suggest it functions as a potentially illegal export tax. The arrangement highlights a new, transactional approach to managing the technology arms race with China, balancing national security concerns with economic interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century painter Ilya Repin, with a focus on emphasizing the artist's "Russianness." The collection, on loan from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, is curated to highlight periods of Repin's life and work within the context of the Russian Empire. This cultural diplomacy event comes as Ukraine has also claimed Repin, who was born in present-day Ukraine, as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition's framing underscores the close cultural and political ties between Beijing and Moscow, using art to reinforce a specific national narrative amidst contemporary geopolitical tensions.</p>
