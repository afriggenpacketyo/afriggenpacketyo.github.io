          <p>President Trump claimed that China has violated its preliminary trade agreement with the United States, hinting at potential retaliatory actions. Trump stated that China reneged on a deal that had paused retaliatory tariffs between the two nations, a claim echoed by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that trade talks with China were stalled, raising concerns about the future of the agreement. The U.S. and China had previously agreed to a 90-day suspension on most tariffs imposed on each other's imports.</p>

          <p>Following the New York Knicks' Game 5 victory against the Indiana Pacers, NBA analyst Charles Barkley expressed skepticism about the team's chances of winning the NBA championship. During a post-game interview with Knicks superfan Spike Lee, Barkley quipped that Lee would "keep" his Academy Awards rather than see the Knicks win a championship. Despite Barkley's doubts, the Knicks secured a 111-94 win, with Jalen Brunson scoring 32 points and Karl-Anthony Towns adding 24 points and 13 rebounds. The Knicks now head back to Indiana hoping to replicate their Game 5 performance and continue their playoff run.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariff threats have led to a market trend known as "Taco trades," where investors sell at-risk assets when tariffs are threatened and rebuy them when Trump backs down. This strategy reflects an awareness of Trump's negotiation tactics, causing recognizable patterns on Wall Street. Despite this volatility, many investors still believe "there is no alternative" (TINA) to investing in U.S. assets. The S&P 500 declined sharply after Trump imposed high tariffs but rebounded when he paused most import duties for 90 days, illustrating the Taco mentality.</p>

          <p>The death toll from widespread floods in central Nigeria has risen to 88, following torrential rains that swept away more than 50 homes in the market town of Mokwa. Rescue efforts are ongoing, but many people remain at risk. The flooding was triggered by heavy rain and the collapse of a nearby dam, with Nigeria's Meteorological Agency warning of possible flash floods in several states. Nigeria has been experiencing its rainy season, which typically lasts around six months and often results in fatalities due to poor drainage and construction practices.</p>

          <p>Record-breaking wildfires in Canada are causing widespread evacuations and threatening air quality across eastern North America. Over 17,000 people are being airlifted from wildfire zones, and states of emergency have been declared in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

The fires have been intensified by prolonged warm and dry conditions, exacerbated by climate change, with experts recommending the use of N95 masks and air filtration systems to mitigate the health effects of wildfire smoke.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering a strategy to draw Russia closer to the United States to counter China, a move dubbed a "reverse Nixon." This approach aims to isolate China, guarantee European security, and solidify American global primacy. However, analysts warn that this plan could backfire, potentially fracturing the American alliance with Europe without successfully splitting Russia from China. The article suggests that the bond between Russia and China, driven by shared interests and antipathy toward the U.S., may be too strong to break.</p>

          <p>The artist Christina Ramberg's paintings explore the artifice of the female body and the ways women construct themselves through mass-market products. Her works often feature fragmented, depersonalized torsos in corsets and high heels, reflecting both fascination and repulsion with the taming and unruly forces in women's lives. Ramberg's art captures the contradictions of second-wave feminism and the commodification of female sexuality. Her work delves into hidden desires and the artificiality of self-presentation, questioning whether our identities are constructed by what we wear and how we present ourselves to the world.</p>

Benner suggests that Machiavelli's insights into human nature and politics remain relevant in contemporary society, particularly in understanding the rise and fall of republics.</p>
