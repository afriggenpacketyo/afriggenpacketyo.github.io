          <p>President Trump has drastically shortened his deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to just 10 or 12. Announced during a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland, the decision stems from a perceived lack of progress in peace negotiations. Trump expressed his disappointment with Vladimir Putin's continued aggression, stating there is no reason to wait longer. Failure to meet the new deadline would trigger severe secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia, escalating economic pressure significantly.</p>

          <p>Quantum computing company IonQ has appointed Marco Pistoia, the former head of applied research at JPMorgan Chase, as its new senior vice president of industry relations. Pistoia will focus on helping corporate clients adopt quantum computing and transition to quantum-safe cryptography to protect against future security threats. His hiring reflects the growing race to commercialize quantum technology, which has the potential to break current encryption methods. Pistoia expressed his belief that usable quantum computers are only two to three years away, highlighting the urgency for industries to adapt.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Trump questioned Israeli claims that there is no starvation crisis in Gaza. When asked if he believed Prime Minister Netanyahu, Trump responded, "I don't know," but pointed to television images of hungry-looking children as a cause for concern. He affirmed the U.S. commitment to providing aid, while Starmer described the situation as an "absolute catastrophe." The discussion occurred as the Hamas-run health ministry reported additional deaths from malnutrition, highlighting the severe humanitarian conditions in the region.</p>

          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, active listening is a powerful but underutilized tool for gaining influence and likeability at work. The tactic involves more than just hearing; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking thoughtful follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said. This approach not only shows respect and empathy but also subtly showcases one's competence and helps build trust with colleagues and superiors. Research co-authored by Brooks indicates that the simple act of asking questions makes individuals more likeable, which can positively impact career progression.</p>

          <p>Over 3,200 union workers at three Boeing plants in the St. Louis area are set to strike after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract offer from the company. The facilities are responsible for producing U.S. military fighter jets, including the Navy's Super Hornet. Despite union leadership recommending approval of what it called a "landmark" agreement with a 20% wage increase, members voted it down, stating it did not adequately address their priorities. A strike is expected to begin on August 4, adding significant labor pressure on the aerospace giant.</p>

          <p>Recent trade deals struck by the U.S. with Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines are set to reduce tariffs on their exports to the American market, but the impact on the EU is mixed. While some European exports to the region could face increased competition from U.S. goods, which will now have nearly zero tariffs, analysts believe the effect will be limited. The new agreements may also pressure Southeast Asian nations to offer similar low-tariff terms to the EU, potentially strengthening Europe's position in ongoing free trade negotiations with countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

          <p>NHS England has criticized the British Medical Association (BMA) for its "increasingly hardline" stance on allowing striking resident doctors to return to work for emergencies. During the latest five-day walkout over pay, the BMA has rejected 18 out of 27 'derogation' requests from hospitals facing patient safety risks, a significant increase from previous strikes. NHS officials expressed particular concern over rejected requests related to cancer care. The BMA defended its position, stating that poor planning by hospitals, not the strike, was stretching staffing resources too thin.</p>

The initial framework deal, which imposes a 15% tariff on many EU goods, did not include a decision for the alcohol industry, with discussions planned for the coming weeks. Industry bodies argue that tariffs would force price increases and could push some European companies out of the vital U.S. market.

The new model is built on "agentic" AI, which breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks for more accurate completion, and is open-sourced for developers. Z.ai stated the model can run on just eight of Nvidia's customized H20 chips, designed for the Chinese market. This development continues the trend of Chinese firms creating powerful yet cost-effective AI, challenging established U.S. players in the field.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich argues that we are living in an "age of bullies," where powerful figures from Vladimir Putin to Donald Trump operate with fewer constraints. He questions how to lead a moral life when brutality and the abuse of power seem to be escalating globally and domestically. Reich contends that morality requires collective action and resistance against such behavior, framing it not as a left-right issue but as a fundamental struggle for civilization against cruelty. He calls for holding the powerful accountable to protect the vulnerable and preserve social fabric.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition parties, the KMT and TPP, are looking to build on recent political momentum after a recall vote targeting 24 KMT lawmakers failed to unseat any of them. The vote, seen as a setback for President William Lai Ching-te's ruling party, has re-energized the informal "Blue-White" opposition alliance. Observers suggest the outcome strengthens the coalition's position ahead of the 2026 local elections and the 2028 presidential race. The failed recall is being interpreted as a political miscalculation that deepened coordination between the two opposition parties.</p>

One VPN provider reported an 1,800% increase in UK sign-ups over the weekend.

The policy is a significant step toward direct financial support for families, but economists are skeptical that the amount is large enough to meaningfully reverse the demographic trend or boost household consumption in the short term.

The killing has sparked outrage from human rights organizations, which condemned the attack and called for urgent state protection for activists. At least 54 environmental defenders have been murdered in Peru since 2012 amid rising threats from illegal mining and drug trafficking.</p>
