          <p>Nvidia has announced its intention to resume selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese clients, stating it has received assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary licenses will be granted. The sales of these chips, specifically designed to comply with export controls, were unexpectedly halted in April. This development follows increased lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued that the restrictions were undermining American tech leadership and had already significantly reduced Nvidia's market share in China. The potential policy shift is seen as a major positive for the company, expected to serve as a new growth catalyst in the coming quarters.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left one other critically injured. Firefighters arrived to find heavy flames and smoke, rescuing numerous residents from windows while about 30 were transported to hospitals. Five firefighters sustained minor injuries during the heroic rescue efforts, which officials said prevented an even greater loss of life. While the cause of the fire is under investigation, it is not currently considered suspicious, and the community is rallying to support the survivors and the families of the victims in what the fire chief called an "unfathomable tragedy."</p>

          <p>Over 50 million people in the Northeast are under flood watches as severe storms cause life-threatening flash flooding, significantly impacting transportation in major cities like New York City. Flash flood warnings were issued for New York, Washington D.C., and Baltimore, with rainfall rates reaching up to four inches per hour in some areas. The extreme weather has led to thousands of flight cancellations and delays, particularly on the East Coast. New Jersey's governor declared a state of emergency, urging residents to stay indoors as reports of stranded vehicles emerged from multiple counties in New Jersey and New York.</p>

          <p>Agricultural workers and activists in California have announced a three-day "Strike for Dignity" following the death of a farm worker during a recent immigration raid. The strike, scheduled for July 16-18, was organized after 57-year-old Jaime Alanís García died during an ICE operation at Glass House Farms in Camarillo, where over 200 undocumented immigrants were arrested. At a press conference in Los Angeles, workers demanded an end to mass raids in agricultural zones and a pathway to citizenship for those who sustain the nation's food industry. The movement highlights the fear and precarious conditions faced by essential farm laborers.</p>

They argue that the legislation, which aims to make it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds, infringes on their human rights to private property. The claimants contend the changes could result in significant financial losses and impact their ability to invest in communities and charitable activities. Leasehold campaigners, however, fear the legal battle will stall much-needed reforms and complain their voices are not being represented in the proceedings.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts assisted-living facility where a fire killed nine people was scheduled for a recertification and compliance review later this year. State officials noted that Gabriel House had its last onsite visit in October 2023, where several areas of non-compliance, primarily related to missing documentation, were found. The facility submitted a correction plan and received a certificate to operate until November 2025. A preliminary investigation suggests the fire was not set intentionally and may have been caused by an electrical or mechanical issue, as scrutiny of the facility's regulatory history intensifies following the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Former Major League Baseball pitcher Daniel Serafini has been found guilty of first-degree murder for the 2021 shooting death of his father-in-law, Robert Gary Spohr. Prosecutors argued the attack was financially motivated, stemming from a dispute over a ranch renovation project. The jury also convicted Serafini of the attempted murder of Spohr's wife, who survived the initial attack but later died by suicide. Serafini, whose MLB career ended in 2007, now faces a potential life sentence. A second defendant, described as a friend and lover, pleaded guilty to being an accessory in the heinous and calculated crime.</p>

          <p>At least four firefighters have sustained injuries while battling three major wildfires burning across Northern California's forests amid extreme heat and dry conditions. The injuries, including blunt force trauma and heat-related illnesses, occurred as crews fight blazes in steep, remote terrain where temperatures have topped 110 degrees. The Green fire in Shasta-Trinity National Forest and the Orleans Complex fires have collectively charred nearly 20,000 acres since being sparked by lightning in early July. Fire officials described the conditions as extremely challenging, with nearly 700 firefighters deployed to manage the situation.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles reported its busiest June in history, processing a record number of shipping containers as businesses raced to import goods ahead of President Trump's tariff deadlines. This surge in ocean freight, an 8% increase over last year, is described by port officials as a "tariff whipsaw effect" rather than a sign of sustained economic growth. Importers accelerated holiday and consumer goods shipments to avoid anticipated cost increases. Port officials expect this volume to ease significantly in the coming months once new tariffs are in place, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

For Tesla, they point to a high valuation and shrinking margins, while for Moderna, they highlight regulatory hurdles and a lack of near-term growth drivers.
