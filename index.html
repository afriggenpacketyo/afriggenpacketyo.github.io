          <p>Two Japanese men were murdered in Dalian, China, allegedly by a Chinese business partner following a business dispute. Chinese authorities have detained the suspect, who is a long-term resident of Japan, and are investigating the case. The Japanese Embassy in Beijing is providing support to the victims' families, who have already returned to Japan after the bodies were cremated. This incident follows other recent attacks involving Japanese nationals in China, raising concerns among the Japanese business community in Dalian. The article notes that the incident is believed to be related to a business grudge rather than anti-Japanese sentiment.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projects that U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year, down from 2.8% last year, due to President Donald Trump's trade policies. The OECD cites disruptions to global commerce, increased costs, and uncertainty for businesses and consumers as contributing factors. The report notes that Trump's tariffs have significantly increased U.S. tariff rates, impacting both consumers and manufacturers. The OECD also forecasts a slowdown in global economic growth, attributing it in part to increased trade barriers and policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>50 Cent has publicly warned President Donald Trump regarding a potential pardon for Sean "Diddy" Combs, his longtime rival, after Trump indicated he would consider it if he believed Diddy was mistreated. Diddy faces serious charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault, and maintains his innocence throughout the ongoing trial. 50 Cent has used social media to highlight Diddy's past negative statements about Trump, seemingly to dissuade the president from granting a pardon. The feud between 50 Cent and Diddy dates back years, involving accusations and diss tracks, adding a personal dimension to the political situation.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has found systemic failures and calls for stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlighted issues such as pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures that have shaken public trust. The review suggests clearer direction from the government, a better approach to long-term investment, and a stronger voice for local communities are needed. The findings also emphasize the need for regulators to have more resources and technology to monitor and hold water companies accountable.</p>

          <p>Many popular holiday destinations are struggling with the environmental impact of excessive visitor numbers, known as overtourism. Overtourism strains infrastructure and local resources, leading to noise, littering, and damage to landscapes and water resources.

Some cities and regions are implementing measures to limit travelers, such as taxes, access restrictions, and digital booking systems, while others are promoting attractions outside city centers or rewarding climate-friendly travel.</p>

          <p>The Dutch coalition government, led by Prime Minister Dick Schoof, has collapsed after Geert Wilders, head of the far-right PVV party, withdrew his party due to disagreements over immigration policy. Wilders expressed frustration with the slow pace of implementing stricter immigration measures that he had agreed upon with coalition partners. The collapse comes shortly before the Netherlands is set to host a NATO summit. Wilders' plan included border closures for asylum-seekers and tougher border controls, but these were deemed unviable or illegal by political experts.</p>

Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, admitted that the decision to pit Verstappen for hard tires was also incorrect.

          <p>Beijing has amplified its warnings about cutthroat price wars among carmakers in China, citing concerns over deflationary pressure and the long-term development of the industry. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and other state media have expressed concerns that these price wars could hinder companies' investments in research and development, ultimately affecting product quality. The MIIT has vowed to step up governance over competition in the industry. The People's Daily described the carmaking sector as being in a "sub-healthy" state due to shrinking profit margins and industrial overcapacity.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has further reduced its economic growth forecasts for the U.S., projecting only 1.6% growth this year and 1.5% in 2026. The downgrade is attributed to President Donald Trump's tariff policy, elevated economic policy uncertainty, a slowdown of net immigration, and a smaller federal workforce. The OECD also expects global growth to be lower than previously forecast, particularly in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Frequent changes in tariffs have led to uncertainty in global markets and economies. (not investment advice)</p>
