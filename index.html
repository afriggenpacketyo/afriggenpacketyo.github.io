          <p>The mother of a British-Israeli hostage who was freed after 15 months in captivity has condemned the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Mandy Damari argued that the move effectively rewards Hamas for its October 7th attack while hostages are still being held and the conflict is ongoing. She described the two-state solution as a delusion, directly contrasting with the UK government's position that the recognition is intended to revive hope for a lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Speaking on the day of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's memorial service, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro called for national healing and a universal condemnation of political violence. The governor, whose own residence was targeted in an arson attack, described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and urged Americans to find commonalities rather than focus on differences. He praised Kirk's legacy of engaging in debate and emphasized that the answer to speech one disagrees with should be more speech, not violence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch and his father, Rupert Murdoch, are likely to be part of the investment group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as probable members of the consortium, describing them as "American patriots." This development comes as negotiations continue to allow the Chinese-owned social media platform to operate in the U.S. under American control, addressing national security concerns.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially recognized a Palestinian state. The leaders stated the action is intended to revive the fading hope for a two-state solution and is not a reward for Hamas, which they affirmed can have no future role in governance. The announcement was met with swift condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed that a Palestinian state would not be established.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, the Department of Justice shut down a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," after he was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash during an FBI sting operation. The probe, which began under the Biden administration, reportedly involved Homan agreeing to potentially help undercover agents obtain government contracts. The closure of the case has raised concerns among some officials about the politicization of the Justice Department and the protection of high-profile allies from scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new restrictions requiring journalists to sign an agreement pledging not to disclose any information, including unclassified material, that has not been officially approved for public release. Failure to comply could result in the revocation of press credentials, effectively limiting reporters' access to the building and their ability to conduct independent scrutiny of the U.S. military. Press freedom organizations and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the move as an affront to the First Amendment and government transparency.</p>

Advocacy groups report that the strikers are demanding access to medical care, prescription medications, clean drinking water, and basic hygiene products. The detention center, located in a former prison camp known as Camp J, was recently reopened by the Trump administration, prompting concerns that detainees are being subjected to an environment with a history of abuse.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's escalating pressure on the Justice Department to prosecute his rivals is a sign of his weakening political position. With declining public support, stalled job growth, and rising grocery prices, Trump's project to consolidate power is facing significant headwinds. The article suggests that this urgency reflects a fear that he may lose his impunity if he cannot subvert the legal system and upcoming elections, forcing officials around him to calculate the risks of collaboration.</p>

          <p>According to well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can physically accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. She explains that stress shortens telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes, which naturally shrink as we age. However, this process can be slowed or even reversed through lifestyle changes. Epel recommends simple, sustainable practices like eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short daily breaks for meditation, and prioritizing deep rest to restore cells and combat the negative effects of stress.</p>

While many party members remain concerned about civil liberties and data security, Davey suggested that a system focused on empowering individuals to access services, similar to one in Estonia, could be beneficial.</p>
