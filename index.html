          <p>California officials denied Erik Menendez parole after a nearly 10-hour hearing, citing his extensive history of prison policy violations since 2013, which included drug smuggling and inappropriate behavior. Menendez, who along with his brother Lyle killed their parents in 1989, argued he no longer poses a public threat and took responsibility, reiterating claims of self-defense due to alleged sexual assault and abuse. However, the parole panel, while empathizing with abuse claims, deemed he still presents an unreasonable risk, emphasizing that victims typically do not resort to killing their abusers. He must wait three years for another hearing, with his brother Lyle's parole review scheduled for the next day.</p>

Huang's trip aimed to thank TSMC for their work on Nvidia's next-generation AI chip platform, Rubin, and confirmed TSMC is producing six new products for Nvidia. These remarks come amidst U.S. interest in acquiring stakes in tech companies receiving CHIPS Act funding, with TSMC promised $6.6 billion for U.S. fabrication plants. Huang also addressed China's security concerns over Nvidia's H20 chips, expressing hope for a resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have denied that recent price increases in the U.S. are a direct result of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Toyota stated its July price adjustments were regular annual increases reflecting operational costs, not tariffs, despite anticipating a significant tariff impact on its full-year earnings. Honda similarly attributed its price changes to added feature content and enhanced value for customers, noting its high percentage of American-made vehicles helps mitigate tariff costs. This comes after a Nikkei Asia report suggested Japanese automakers were passing tariff expenses to U.S. buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking Florida from further expanding the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Everglades, formalizing a temporary halt. Judge Kathleen Williams ruled against the state, which argued the facility was under state control, finding it was a joint partnership and thus subject to federal environmental laws. Florida officials, including Governor Ron DeSantis, swiftly criticized the ruling as an "unlawful decision" and vowed to immediately appeal, asserting their resolve to continue aiding the Trump administration's efforts to remove undocumented immigrants. The facility has faced numerous complaints regarding its harsh conditions.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk and his social media firm X (formerly Twitter) have reached a tentative settlement with thousands of former employees who had sued for $500 million in severance pay. The deal, reported in a court filing, aims to resolve claims from approximately 6,000 staff members who were laid off after Musk's 2022 takeover and allegedly denied promised benefits. The lawsuit contended that many received only one month's severance or nothing at all, despite company policies. While details remain private pending court approval, this agreement marks a significant step towards resolving a contentious legal dispute stemming from widespread cost-cutting measures.</p>

This pause is intended to conduct a comprehensive review of screening and vetting protocols to ensure driver qualifications and improve road safety, citing recent deadly accidents where foreign drivers' English proficiency may have been a factor. The Trump administration argues that the increasing number of foreign drivers endangers American lives and undercuts American truckers' livelihoods. This move comes despite an existing shortage of approximately 60,000 commercial truck drivers in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June and marking its lowest level since March, primarily due to easing rice prices. Despite this decline, the figure was hotter than the 3% expected by economists, indicating persistent inflationary pressures. Headline inflation also dropped to 3.1%, while the "core-core" rate, closely watched by the Bank of Japan, held steady at 3.4%. With this being the 40th consecutive month above the BOJ's 2% target, experts like Jesper Koll argue the central bank is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates, affecting purchasing power.

Markets are largely pricing in a September rate cut, though some Fed officials remain cautious. Powell's speech will also review the Fed's long-term policy goals, potentially retooling its inflation targeting framework to prioritize preemptive action, making it a critical moment for economic guidance.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom accused President Trump of attempting to "rig the election" and undermine American democracy, as California lawmakers approved a partisan redistricting plan favoring Democrats. Newsom argued this ballot measure, Proposition 50, is a necessary counterweight to Trump's authoritarian policies, including his actions against mail-in voting and deployment of federal agents. The plan aims to discard existing congressional boundaries and could remove up to five California Republicans from Congress, neutralizing similar efforts in Texas. Republicans, however, criticized Newsom for "tearing up California’s Constitution" to advance his own political career.</p>

Farm operators had diverted creeks, cleared vegetation, and left thousands of pounds of trash, along with evidence of poaching.
