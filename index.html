          <p>Data from the CDC indicates a marginal 1% increase in US births in 2024, totaling approximately 3.6 million, marking a potential shift after a prolonged decline since the 2008 recession. Demographers caution against premature trend conclusions due to ongoing economic challenges impacting families, including housing and childcare costs. The report highlights a continuing trend of older women having children and an increase in birth rates among Hispanic and Asian women, while rates declined for Black and Native American women. The report does not address abortion bans or their impact on birth rates.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he has no plans to dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite his repeated criticisms of the Fed's monetary policy. While expressing a desire for Powell to be more proactive in lowering interest rates, Trump affirmed his optimism regarding improved trade relations with China. This statement follows earlier reports suggesting Trump was exploring the possibility of removing Powell, which had previously caused market instability. Trump also indicated a willingness to negotiate with Beijing, suggesting tariffs would decrease if a trade agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>Six major auto industry groups have jointly lobbied the Trump administration to reconsider imposing 25% tariffs on auto parts, warning that the levies could severely disrupt U.S. automotive production. The groups, representing automakers, suppliers, and dealers, argue that many auto suppliers are already financially strained and unable to absorb the additional costs. They highlight the interconnectedness of the supply chain, noting that the failure of a single supplier could halt production across the industry, leading to layoffs and bankruptcies.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and work with the food industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in various food products. The plan follows the Biden administration's earlier ban on Red No. 3 and aims to address concerns about the health effects of these dyes, though some scientists remain skeptical about the evidence of significant health risks.</p>

          <p>Gunmen opened fire on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, resulting in numerous fatalities and injuries. The attack, which occurred in Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination, is considered unusual as tourists have rarely been targeted in the region's long-running insurgency. World leaders, including President Trump and President Putin, have condemned the attack. Indian Prime Minister Modi has vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice, and security measures have been intensified in the area.</p>

          <p>Campaigners claim that Instagram continues to pose serious risks to children, even with the introduction of new Teen Accounts designed to offer enhanced protection. Researchers were able to create fake accounts using false birthdays and were subsequently exposed to sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations to follow adult accounts. The 5Rights Foundation's research highlights concerns about age verification, algorithms promoting harmful content, and exposure to commercialized material. Meta, Instagram's parent company, maintains that the new accounts provide built-in protections for teens.</p>

The Real ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to enhance the security of state-issued identification.

The sector is also grappling with a price war resulting from overproduction, which has driven down export prices. BESS are crucial for storing energy from renewable sources.</p>
