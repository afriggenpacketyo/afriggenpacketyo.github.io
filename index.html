          <p>Following an alleged sexual assault of a girl, disorder broke out in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, as crowds gathered near the location of the incident. Youths, masked and gloved, were observed throwing masonry, and a police car sustained damage with smashed windows. Clonavon Terrace was blocked off by police Land Rovers, and the windows of a house were also smashed during the unrest. The incident has heightened tensions in the community and prompted a police response to maintain order and investigate the alleged crime. The community is concerned about the safety of the area, and the police are working to restore calm.</p>

          <p>President Trump authorized the deployment of 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles, escalating tensions with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is suing the administration over the initial deployment. Newsom criticized the move as a reckless ego stroke, while the ACLU condemned the mobilization of Marines. The troops are intended to protect federal personnel and property during protests over immigration enforcement actions. Newsom claims the first 2,000 troops were given no food or water and remain largely unused, while Trump supports arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement. The legal battle and escalating rhetoric highlight the deep divisions between the state and federal governments.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have clarified the rules of force for the National Guard and Marines deployed in Los Angeles, stating that their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition, and they will not engage crowds unless necessary. Their primary task is to protect federal buildings and personnel, not to patrol streets or detain protesters. These rules are subject to change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act. The Los Angeles Police Department emphasized the need for clear communication between all agencies to ensure a coordinated and lawful response, while retired military officials stressed the importance of clarifying the rules of engagement for the troops.</p>

Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician, has expressed concern that the ACIP will be filled with unqualified individuals and plans to discuss the matter with Kennedy.

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles without Governor Newsom's consent, calling it an unprecedented power grab. The lawsuit argues that the situation does not meet the legal criteria for federalizing the National Guard and that local law enforcement is capable of managing the protests. Attorney General Rob Bonta stated that the deployment stokes tensions and creates unnecessary provocation. The suit also argues that the federalization of the California National Guard deprives the state of resources needed to protect citizens, particularly in the event of an emergency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former chair of the Environment Agency has warned that successive governments have failed to address the threat of toxic chemicals in sewage sludge spread on farmers' fields. About 3.5 million tonnes of sludge are spread annually as cheap fertilizer, but it can be contaminated with cancer-linked chemicals and microplastics. Efforts to update regulations have been continually frustrated, leading to concerns about long-term soil contamination and potential harm to human health. The water industry is reportedly concerned that farmers may stop accepting the sludge, potentially leading to costly alternative disposal methods.</p>

          <p>Japan has confirmed the first instance of two Chinese aircraft carriers operating simultaneously in the Pacific Ocean. The Shandong was spotted near Japan's southernmost Okinotori island, while the Liaoning was observed near Japan's easternmost Minamitori Island. The Chinese Foreign Ministry defended the activities as consistent with international law, but Japan has expressed concerns over China's growing maritime activity and is stepping up surveillance. The Liaoning was observed beyond the "second island chain," which China considers its defense line, prompting further scrutiny from Japanese officials. This development underscores the ongoing tensions and strategic competition in the region.</p>

          <p>Over 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration for politicizing research, interrupting global collaboration, and cutting budgets and staff. The letter expresses concerns that these policies undermine the NIH's mission and harm public health. Scientists claim they have repeatedly raised concerns internally without success, prompting them to speak out publicly. The letter calls for the reversal of delayed or terminated grants, the reinstatement of essential staff, and the allowance of work with foreign collaborators.

          <p>Families and lawyers are struggling to contact workers arrested in recent ICE raids in Los Angeles, describing the situation as a kidnapping. Those detained include sole breadwinners and long-term employees, with at least 14 being members of the Episcopalian Diocese of Los Angeles. Lawyers report that immigrants were initially held in deplorable conditions without food, water, or beds, and some were immediately deported without paperwork. The ACLU held a rally demanding humane treatment and access to lawyers for all detainees, highlighting concerns about violations of basic human dignity and due process.</p>

          <p>Dr. Phil's presence during ICE raids in Los Angeles, alongside Trump's border czar, has sparked criticism and questions about the Trump administration's approach to immigration policy. As neither a journalist nor an immigration expert, McGraw's role in covering the raids is seen as part of a made-for-TV event. McGraw's presence during immigration raids, and his choice as the person who should interview Homan even as things escalated in L.A., most certainly underlines the criticism that these raids, and the fallout they will inevitably cause particularly in sanctuary states and cities, are being conducted with maximum spectacle awareness.</p>

Union leaders and local officials gathered in Grand Park to demand the release of a union leader arrested during an immigration raid.

          <p>A columnist argues that Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles will not end well, as it escalates tensions and plays into the president's hands.

Trump's administration has been pushing for wartime powers, and the deployment of troops aligns with his desire to use the military to quell domestic unrest. The author believes this situation is leading to a contest of competing theories of the propaganda of the deed, which will likely end poorly for the United States.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Trump's actions toward California, including cutting federal funding and deploying the National Guard, exemplify a hostile relationship with the states. Trump's vision of federalism is a one-way street, where states are on their own if they need help but face federal intervention even if they don't want it. The author contends that Trump is using these actions to provoke a confrontation and expand federal control, marking a shift from the traditional conservative defense of states' rights.
