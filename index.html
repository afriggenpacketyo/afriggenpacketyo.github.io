          <p>A British man, John Miller, and a Chinese national, Cui Guanghai, have been indicted in the US for allegedly conspiring to smuggle sensitive American military technology, including missiles and drones, to China. The pair were arrested in Serbia and face extradition to the US, where they could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Court documents suggest they discussed exporting encryption devices and allegedly harassed an anti-Chinese government protester by installing a tracking device on their car. US authorities have accused them of a blatant assault on national security and democratic values, vowing to prosecute foreign repression on US soil. The Foreign Office is providing consular assistance to the British national.</p>

          <p>South Korean women who played a key role in protests leading to the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol express feeling invisible as the country prepares to elect a new president. Despite their significant participation in anti-Yoon rallies, the two main candidates have remained largely silent on gender equality issues, with a third candidate gaining popularity for his anti-feminist stance. These women fear their voices are being erased and that little has improved despite their efforts to create a better world. The previous president appealed to young men who felt marginalized by pro-women policies, leading to a rollback of women's rights and a backlash against feminism.</p>

The first trial resulted in a guilty verdict, but it was later overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct; the second trial ended in a hung jury.

          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn the nomination of commercial astronaut Jared Isaacman to be the next NASA administrator, just days before he was scheduled to get a confirmation vote in the Senate. Isaacman, a business partner of Elon Musk's, had previously worked to alleviate concerns from legislators regarding his closeness to the Tesla CEO. Trump stated he will announce a new nominee who aligns with his America First agenda, while Isaacman expressed gratitude for the opportunity. The decision comes as Space.com found that the presidentâ€™s budget proposal would see funding cuts for the agency as well as reductions in its workforce.</p>

          <p>A Hollywood film, "Mission: Impossible â€“ The Final Reckoning," topped ticket presales for Chinaâ€™s Dragon Boat Festival, but overall box office revenue is projected to be subdued, reflecting a broader trend of underwhelming performances in the Chinese film market. The film outperformed domestic animated features despite earlier announcements of curbs on American film imports. China's box office revenue declined last year, totaling 42.5 billion yuan, down 22.6 per cent from 2023, as the country struggles to stimulate domestic consumption. Observers remain optimistic about the long-term resilience of Chinaâ€™s film market due to improved domestic productions.</p>
