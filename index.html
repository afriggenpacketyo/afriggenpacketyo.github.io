          <p>Israeli forces conducted deadly attacks in Gaza, with an airstrike on a crowded cafe killing at least 30 people, including women and children. Separately, witnesses and health officials reported that Israeli troops fired on Palestinians attempting to access food aid, resulting in another 23 fatalities. These incidents are part of a broader pattern of violence around aid distribution points, which have become increasingly chaotic and dangerous. The Israeli military stated it is reviewing the events and maintains it only targets militants, blaming Hamas for operating in civilian areas.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her duties while it considers a petition for her dismissal. The case stems from a leaked phone call in which she was heard criticizing a military commander, sparking public anger and accusations of undermining the nation's military. This development places her ruling coalition in a precarious position and continues a pattern of political turmoil for the powerful Shinawatra family. If dismissed, she would be the third member of her clan to be removed from power before completing a full term.</p>

          <p>A previously reached agreement between Republican senators to regulate state-level artificial intelligence rules has been withdrawn from President Trump's major spending package. The deal would have prevented states from enacting new AI regulations for five years in exchange for federal infrastructure funding. Senator Marsha Blackburn announced her withdrawal of support, citing concerns that the provision would empower Big Tech and fail to protect children and consumers from potential AI abuses. This collapse follows criticism from Democratic senators and a group of Republican governors who argued against stripping states of their regulatory power over the rapidly evolving technology.

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon voting session on President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill," a massive legislative package combining tax cuts with increased spending on border security and defense. The process, known as a "vote-a-rama," allows for unlimited amendments, which Democrats are using to force votes on controversial topics ahead of midterm elections. Republicans are aiming to pass the bill through budget reconciliation before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, despite projections that it will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade. The bill's passage remains uncertain, with a few Republican senators expressing opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's major spending bill is receiving mixed reactions from the financial sector, with some institutions like the American Bankers Association supporting it as a necessary economic stimulus. Proponents argue that by extending expiring tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the bill prevents a significant fiscal contraction and could boost investment. However, critics, including some analysts and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, raise serious concerns about its fiscal irresponsibility, projecting it will add over $3 trillion to the federal deficit. The debate highlights a deep divide on the long-term economic consequences of the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iowa has become the first U.S. state to formally remove gender identity from its civil rights code, a law that took effect Tuesday. The new legislation eliminates non-discrimination protections for transgender and nonbinary individuals in areas like employment and housing, which had been in place for nearly two decades. The law also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and bars changes to sex designations on birth certificates. This move, part of a broader trend in Republican-led states, has been condemned by LGBTQ+ advocates who fear it will lead to increased hostility and discrimination.</p>

The facility, which can hold up to 5,000 detainees, has drawn strong criticism from immigrant activists and Native American leaders over its location and the harsh message it sends.

Setting benchmarks is challenging, as goals that are too high can discourage lower earners, while goals that are too low may give higher earners a false sense of security. Analysis from Hargreaves Lansdown reviewed different measures, including fixed income levels and relative "replacement rates" based on pre-retirement earnings. The article concludes that relative measures may be more effective, as they better reflect an individual's established lifestyle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pakistan is set to take over the rotating, one-month presidency of the United Nations Security Council at a time of significant global and regional instability. While the role is largely procedural, it provides a platform for Islamabad to shape the council's agenda. Pakistan's ambassador indicated a commitment to peaceful conflict resolution but also acknowledged the challenging geopolitical landscape. The presidency is expected to see Pakistan raise the issue of its recent conflict with India over the disputed Kashmir territory, a move that New Delhi is reportedly preparing to counter diplomatically.</p>

          <p>China is preparing for a major military parade on September 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, an event that is expected to showcase its most advanced weaponry. While the parade's official theme is not Taiwan, analysts believe it will be used to send a powerful strategic message to the self-ruled island. The People's Liberation Army is likely to display new fifth-generation fighter jets, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and carrier-based aircraft, many of which are designed with a potential Taiwan conflict in mind. The event will be closely watched for signals about China's military capabilities and foreign policy direction.</p>

          <p>A commentary in The Guardian questions why French cinema has been slow to depict the country's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade, in contrast to Hollywood's numerous films on the subject. The article notes that for many in France, American productions like "12 Years a Slave" are the main cinematic reference for slavery. It highlights recent, though marginalized, French films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" that are finally telling these stories from a French colonial perspective. The author argues that while audiences are ready for these narratives, the French film industry still pushes them to the margins.</p>

The expansion was supported by the fastest production growth since November, though new export orders continued to decline.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed two major bills aimed at accelerating housing construction by reforming the state's stringent environmental review process. The legislation exempts most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often blamed for delaying development. Newsom forced one of the bills through the legislature by tying it to the state budget, overcoming opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions. Experts believe these changes could be the most significant reforms to CEQA in its 55-year history, potentially unblocking numerous housing projects across the state.</p>

The proposal would shift 200 of the roughly 4,000 troops who were federalized by President Trump to respond to protests against immigration enforcement. The initial deployment was highly controversial and legally challenged by California's governor, who warned it could interfere with the state's ability to fight fires. This potential move highlights the competing demands for the Guard's resources amid political disputes and natural disaster preparedness.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has delayed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was wrongly deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. His lawyers requested the delay, citing conflicting statements from the Trump administration about whether he would be immediately detained and deported again upon release from federal custody. Abrego Garcia's initial removal was deemed an administrative error, as he held a legal status protecting him from deportation to El Salvador due to gang threats. The case highlights significant confusion and legal challenges within the U.S. immigration and justice systems.</p>
