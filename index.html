          <p>Authorities in New Orleans have increased the cash reward to $50,000 per escapee for information leading to the arrest of the two remaining inmates who broke out of the Orleans Justice Center on May 16. Derrick Groves, convicted of murder, and Antoine Massey, charged with domestic abuse, are still at large. Law enforcement agencies believe the fugitives may have fled Louisiana with the help of accomplices, despite potentially limited resources. Over 700 tips have been received, leading to multiple arrests and the promise of rewards for tipsters; authorities are also investigating possible internal failures that allowed the escape. The focus remains on apprehending Massey and Groves and holding accountable anyone who aided their escape.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a warning after anti-ICE protesters attempted to disrupt a federal immigration arrest in New York City. According to Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, one person attempted to forcibly interfere with ICE agents, resulting in a brief detention and a U.S. district court violation notice. Separately, nearly two dozen protesters were detained by the NYPD for blocking traffic outside a DHS building. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons reported a significant rise in assaults against ICE officers, attributing some blame to politically motivated rhetoric. The DHS emphasizes that obstructing law enforcement will lead to consequences, including potential arrest.</p>

          <p>Friday's newspaper headlines are dominated by the man charged in the Liverpool victory parade incident, with The Guardian reporting Paul Doyle's charge of "grievous bodily harm" and the UK's potential Â£1.6 billion trade agreement with Gulf states. The Daily Telegraph highlights the Liverpool suspect and Attorney General Lord Hermer's comparison of politicians' threats to abandon international law to "1930s Nazi Germany." The Times also leads with Lord Hermer's "Nazi jibe" against Tory and Reform politicians, while the Daily Mail features the Liverpool suspect and Kemi Badenoch's criticism of Nigel Farage. The Financial Times reports Donald Trump's pledge to "fight on" after a trade court ruling against his tariff scheme. The Metro covers Sir Keir's warning about Farage's potential economic impact, and the Daily Express reports on a "revolutionary" blood test for cancer being rolled out by the NHS.</p>

This year's bloom was the longest, most toxic, and deadliest experienced, pushing the center to its limits as it treated over 400 marine animals.

          <p>Despite sanctions, Russia continues to profit from fossil fuel exports to the West, funding its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Data indicates that Western allies have paid Russia more for hydrocarbons than they have provided in aid to Ukraine. Loopholes, such as refining Russian oil in third countries and importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), allow revenue to flow into the Kremlin's coffers. Experts argue that stronger enforcement of sanctions and closing these loopholes are crucial to limiting Russia's ability to finance its war efforts. The reliance on Russian energy, driven by fears of higher prices, undermines efforts to isolate Russia economically.</p>

          <p>Sable Offshore Corp.'s plans to restart oil drilling off Santa Barbara County have been challenged by a court ruling ordering the company to cease coastal construction until it obtains official approvals. The court sided with the California Coastal Commission, upholding a cease and desist order due to Sable's failure to secure necessary permits. The company argues it is only repairing existing pipelines, not constructing new ones, and therefore doesn't need new permits. Sable plans to appeal the ruling, but it remains unclear how this will impact their oil operation. The action reflects ongoing tensions between environmental regulations and oil production in California.</p>
