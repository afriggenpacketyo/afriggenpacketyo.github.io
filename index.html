          <p>U.S. immigration authorities have arrested several undocumented immigrants with criminal records in a nationwide enforcement operation. The Department of Homeland Security stated the action targets the "worst of the worst" criminals, highlighting individuals with convictions for offenses like firearm possession, burglary, domestic assault, and indecency with a child. This operation reflects the Trump administration's heightened focus on deporting non-citizens with criminal histories, a policy that has faced opposition from some local officials. The administration asserts these efforts are necessary to ensure public safety in American communities.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed its Dark Eagle long-range hypersonic weapon system to Australia for the first time, a move viewed as a strategic signal towards China. This land-based missile can travel at over 3,800 mph and strike targets up to 1,700 miles away, demonstrating the U.S. military's capacity for rapid deployment of advanced capabilities. A commander from the U.S. Army's 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force called the deployment a "major milestone" in supporting allies. Analysts interpret the action as a demonstration of military strength and a reinforcement of the U.S.-Australia defense alliance.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given China two weeks to clarify why sections of its plans for a new large-scale embassy in London are redacted. The proposed embassy, located near the city's financial district, has raised concerns about potential espionage and security risks for local residents. The plans, which include a cultural center and staff housing, also feature basement rooms with no specified purpose. This governmental intervention follows the local council's previous rejection of the plans, which were resubmitted after the recent change in government.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 21:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by World Weather Attribution scientists concludes that climate change likely intensified the monsoon rains that caused deadly floods across Pakistan. Researchers found that rainfall was approximately 10% to 15% heavier due to global warming, as a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. The severe weather has resulted in at least 300 deaths, with many victims crushed by collapsing buildings in vulnerable, rapidly urbanized areas. This disaster follows the catastrophic floods of 2022, highlighting the nation's susceptibility to extreme weather events exacerbated by a changing climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) indicates that councils in inner London are poised to be the most affected by a government plan to update funding rules. Some boroughs like Camden and Westminster could see funding drop by up to 12% after accounting for inflation. The proposed changes, set to be phased in from 2026, aim to redistribute funds based on local needs, redirecting money towards areas with more lower-band council tax properties. While some outer London and other urban areas are expected to benefit, the plan has been criticized as "robbing Peter to pay Paul." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple will increase its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total four-year commitment to $600 billion. The investment is expected to create 20,000 new jobs and includes plans for a smart glass manufacturing line in Kentucky and a server facility in Houston. President Trump praised the move as a significant step toward ensuring iPhones sold in the U.S. are also made in the country.

While the orchestra's rendition of Ellington was praised for its energy, the review notes that the vastness of the Bowl was less suited to the subtleties of Ravel's work.

          <p>President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could deliver a multi-billion dollar blow to India's economy, though some key sectors may be insulated. The tariffs, imposed over India's oil trade with Russia, will disproportionately affect sectors like gems and jewellery, textiles, and chemicals, which constitute an estimated $8 billion in vulnerable exports. However, India's large IT services and pharmaceutical exports to the U.S. are not targeted by the current duties on goods.

          <p>A 62-year-old British man has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly trying to drown his daughter-in-law in a swimming pool during a family holiday in Florida. Mark Raymond Gibbon reportedly held the 33-year-old woman underwater multiple times following an argument about his grandchildren. The attack was stopped when neighbors called the police and the victim's nine-year-old daughter jumped into the pool to intervene. The incident occurred at a rental home in Davenport, Florida, and Gibbon was arrested and taken to Polk County Jail.</p>

          <p>The signing of South Korean superstar Son Heung-min is being viewed as a strategic move by LAFC to significantly expand its global brand, similar to how Carlos Vela connected the team with the local community. Son's immense popularity in South Korea and across Asia presents a major opportunity for the MLS club to increase its international name recognition and commercial reach. While he is expected to be a world-class performer on the field, his value extends to building a global fanbase and attracting international attention. This move solidifies LAFC's ambition to be a prominent club on the world football stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts that a record number of 18-year-old students will be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their required grades. Dr. Jo Saxton stated that uncertainty around international student numbers is making universities keen to enroll domestic undergraduates, who offer more financial stability. This increased flexibility from universities means more offers have been made this year, which will likely translate into more direct acceptances and fewer places available through the clearing process for students receiving their results next week.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his rare two-way talent in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, delivering his best pitching performance as a Dodger and hitting a home run. Ohtani pitched four innings, allowing only one run and striking out a season-high eight batters, while also hitting his 39th homer of the season. Despite his strong effort, the team's bullpen could not secure the win, giving up four runs in the final five innings, leading to a 5-3 loss. The performance highlights the ongoing challenge for Ohtani to excel as both a pitcher and hitter, a feat rarely attempted since Babe Ruth.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer characterized the current stock market as being "all over the map," driven by unusual individual stock narratives rather than cohesive group movements. He observed that expensive stocks continue to rise while solid companies with good earnings are often ignored, creating a tricky environment for investors. Cramer cited Palantir and Arista Networks as examples of stocks propelled by short-sellers being forced to buy, while companies like Disney and Honeywell go unrewarded for strong performance. He concluded that in this market, narratives and momentum often outweigh fundamental value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of empty homes across England is steadily increasing, with over 700,000 properties now vacant, including more than 264,000 classified as long-term empty. This trend is causing concern for local councils and residents, who see the derelict properties as magnets for crime, pests, and anti-social behavior, as well as a wasted resource amid a housing shortage. The article profiles a Bristol resident whose life is negatively impacted by a collapsing, rat-infested house next door. Local governments and charities are calling for stronger powers to bring these properties back into use.</p>

          <p>Financial markets are anticipating that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4% on Thursday, which would be its fifth reduction since last August. A lower base rate would decrease monthly mortgage costs for homeowners on variable-rate deals but would also result in lower returns for savers. The expected cut comes despite inflation being above the Bank's 2% target, but signs of a cooling UK labor market may be influencing the decision. The Bank will also release new economic forecasts alongside its rate announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following an assault on a former administration staffer, President Trump has stated he is considering federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force and potentially overturning the city's half-century of home rule. The threat came after a 19-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee was injured in an attempted carjacking. While Trump cannot unilaterally repeal the Home Rule Act, he can exert significant pressure on the city's government and has done so in the past. Critics suggest the incident is being used as a political opportunity to justify a long-held desire to exert more federal control over the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have found new evidence indicating that people returned to live in Pompeii after its devastation by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The research suggests that some survivors, unable to relocate, came back and established a precarious settlement among the ruins, possibly living there until the 5th century. These inhabitants likely lived in the upper floors of buried homes and salvaged valuable materials from the site. This discovery challenges the long-held image of Pompeii as a city completely abandoned after the eruption, revealing a more complex history of survival and reoccupation.</p>

Robbins' departure was anticipated, as Skydance had already announced its own senior management team to lead the studio. During his tenure, Robbins oversaw major franchises like "Top Gun: Maverick," "Sonic the Hedgehog," and "Mission: Impossible."
