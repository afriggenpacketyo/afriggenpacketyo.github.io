          <p>An immigration judge has ordered the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent pro-Palestinian protest leader and former Columbia University student, to Algeria or Syria. The ruling states he willfully misrepresented facts on his green card application, a claim his lawyers intend to appeal. Khalil, who is married to a US citizen, asserts the deportation order is retaliation from the Trump administration for his activism and exercise of free speech. His legal team is challenging the decision, citing procedural irregularities and arguing the claims are baseless and pretextual.</p>

This meeting signals a significant thaw in relations, which had deteriorated to the point of mutual sanctions in 2021 over human rights concerns in Xinjiang. The discussions, led by German lawmaker Engin Eroglu on the European side, are expected to re-establish a biannual exchange between the two legislative bodies.

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has exposed and deepened the severe political divisions within the United States. This article analyzes the current climate of hatred and violence, arguing that the political and media incentive structures reward extremism over reconciliation. While some leaders, like Utah Governor Spencer Cox, call for de-escalation, the broader trend points towards further polarization, fueled by social media and partisan narratives. The piece questions whether the nation can overcome its internal divisions, which are seen as a significant national security threat.</p>

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air for an indefinite period following controversial comments from its host linking the man charged with killing Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The decision came after pressure from the FCC and a move by Nexstar Media Group, a major ABC affiliate owner, to preempt the show. While President Trump praised the suspension, the move has been widely condemned by free speech advocates, Democratic politicians, and entertainment unions as an act of corporate cowardice and state censorship. A source indicates Kimmel has not been fired but will discuss the situation with Disney executives.</p>

          <p>At a global public security forum in Lianyungang, China is showcasing advanced police equipment, including AI-enhanced body cameras, to officials from developing countries. The technology integrates real-time facial recognition, allowing officers to identify individuals flagged as high-risk and relay information instantly to a central command center. A vendor demonstrated how the system can pinpoint a suspect's location on a map and dispatch nearby officers for an arrest.

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Currently, the storm is moving over open waters and does not pose an immediate threat to land, though forecasters predict it could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. The storm's projected path shows it tracking north of the Caribbean, but it may approach Bermuda by next week as it continues to strengthen. This season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA, with Gabrielle being only the second storm to form since the historical peak of hurricane season.</p>

Economists suggest that a slower pace of rate cuts by the PBOC compared to the Fed will help narrow the interest rate gap between the two countries.

The announcement, made via social media, also called for an investigation into the movement's funders. Legal experts note that designating a domestic group as a terrorist organization is complex due to First Amendment protections, as there is no domestic equivalent to the State Department's list of foreign terror organizations. FBI Director Christopher Wray has previously described antifa as an ideology rather than a structured organization, complicating such a designation.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative called AI Fluency, which will require all undergraduate students to receive training in artificial intelligence, regardless of their major. Starting with the class of 2029, students must take a foundational course in generative AI and participate in workshops focused on real-world applications of the technology. The program aims to equip graduates with essential skills for a job market where demand for AI expertise has surged dramatically. The university hopes this requirement will give its students a competitive advantage in the workforce, even as public skepticism about AI's impact on creativity persists.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has introduced the new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the company's first smart glasses featuring a built-in, high-resolution display, priced at $799. The device can be controlled with hand gestures via a neural-powered wristband, allowing users to watch videos or respond to texts. The new product bridges the gap between the company's audio-only glasses and its more advanced, experimental augmented reality projects. Meta also launched an updated version of its original audio glasses and a new sports-focused model under the Oakley brand, continuing its long-term partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica.</p>

          <p>During a ceremony marking its 75th anniversary, Germany's Central Council of Jews called on Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government to continue its "unconditional" support for Israel. Council President Josef Schuster urged Berlin not to be swayed by criticism from other European nations or internal political voices. Chancellor Merz, who was in attendance, affirmed that criticism of the Israeli government must be possible but should never serve as a pretext for antisemitism. He emphasized the importance of Jewish life to Germany's future and reiterated the nation's commitment to standing with Israel.</p>

          <p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has published a report strongly refuting the Trump administration's dismissal of climate change dangers, stating the evidence is "beyond scientific dispute." The report affirms the validity of the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding," which classified greenhouse gases as a public health threat requiring regulation. This comes as the EPA, under administrator Lee Zeldin, is attempting to revoke that finding, citing economic costs. The National Academies' report concludes that the scientific evidence for climate change is even stronger now than in 2009 and warns of a future with worsening climate-induced harm.</p>

          <p>American tennis star Taylor Townsend has issued a sincere apology for social media posts in which she criticized unfamiliar foods offered at a tournament in Shenzhen, China. Townsend had expressed shock at seeing dishes like bullfrogs and turtles, which led to a backlash on Chinese social media, with many accusing her of cultural insensitivity. In a subsequent video, the world's top-ranked doubles player stated there was no excuse for her comments and that she was privileged to experience different cultures through her travels.

          <p>In her upcoming book, former Vice President Kamala Harris reveals that Pete Buttigieg was her "first choice" for a running mate in 2024, but she ultimately decided against it, deeming the pairing "too big of a risk." Harris writes that asking America to accept a ticket with a Black woman and a gay man was a significant consideration, leading to her "mutual sadness" with Buttigieg over the decision. She instead chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a decision that this article suggests highlights a broader debate within the Democratic party about prioritizing electability versus identity politics. Harris praised Buttigieg's political talents and their personal friendship.</p>

          <p>The University of California's board of regents has approved requests from five UC campuses to acquire additional weapons and surveillance equipment, including thousands of rifle rounds, pepper-ball projectiles, and drones. The purchases are part of an annual report on equipment classified as "military," though officials state the items are standard for law enforcement and often used for de-escalation. The approval comes amid heightened scrutiny of UC's handling of campus protests, with recent reports detailing the use of such equipment against pro-Palestinian demonstrators at UCLA. Critics, including faculty members, voiced concerns that the new acquisitions could have a chilling effect on free speech.</p>

          <p>Frank Somerville, a former longtime news anchor for KTVU in Oakland, was arrested on suspicion of assault following a physical altercation with his adult daughter.

This marks Somerville's fourth arrest in recent years, following previous incidents including DUI charges and an altercation at a family home. His attorney described the situation as a delicate family matter that they hope to resolve outside of court.</p>

          <p>The popular Prime Video series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" will end with a feature film rather than a fourth season, the studio has announced. Jenny Han, the author of the book trilogy on which the show is based, will write and direct the concluding movie, which she described as the proper way to handle the final milestone in the protagonist Belly's journey. The series, a global hit, follows the love triangle between Belly and two brothers, Conrad and Jeremiah, and has cultivated a passionate fanbase.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume fruit with a low alcohol content, amounting to a daily intake equivalent to nearly two human cocktails. Scientists tested the figs and plum-like fruits the chimps eat, finding an average alcohol content of about 0.3% by weight. While this steady, low dose is not enough to cause intoxication, it supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the primate attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in fruit-eating habits. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in fruits regularly consumed by wild chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Education Select Committee has advised against scrapping the individual care plans, known as EHCPs, for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). Instead, the committee calls for establishing new national minimum standards for Send support in all schools and providing more training for teachers. The recommendation comes as the government prepares to announce reforms for the Send system in England, which has been criticized as financially unsustainable. Parent campaign groups have strongly supported keeping the legally binding EHCPs, viewing them as a crucial "backstop of accountability" for ensuring children receive necessary support.</p>
