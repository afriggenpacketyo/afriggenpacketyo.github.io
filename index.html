          <p>The FDA has approved Teal Health's Teal Wand, the first at-home test for cervical cancer screening, allowing individuals to collect samples themselves. Clinical trials showed the self-administered test has a 96% accuracy rate, comparable to in-office screenings. Teal Health plans to launch the wand in California first, aiming to increase access to care, especially for women in rural areas who face challenges attending in-person appointments. The company has raised $23 million from investors, reflecting growing interest in women's health technology, and is in discussions with carriers about insurance coverage for the test.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved and expanded the use of three natural color additives in response to the Department of Health and Human Services' push to eliminate artificial food dyes. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that this move aims to promote healthier choices by replacing synthetic, petroleum-based dyes with natural alternatives. The approved additives include Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate, which can now be used in a wider range of food products. Some manufacturers, like Tyson Foods, have already begun phasing out artificial dyes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is reportedly proceeding with a second round of firings for probationary employees after previous terminations were temporarily halted by court orders. Thousands of recently hired or promoted workers had received termination letters in February, which were later reversed, and many have been on paid leave since. The firings are attributed to a finding that the employees' abilities and skills do not fit the agency's current needs, although some supervisors and workers dispute this claim, citing high performance ratings and critical vacancies. The February firings are separate from the broader layoffs occurring as part of a department-wide restructuring.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced another air traffic control outage, lasting approximately 90 seconds, causing further disruptions for travelers. The outage occurred less than 24 hours after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system due to outdated equipment. United Airlines is limiting flights to and from Newark due to the ongoing issues, with the CEO stating that the airport cannot handle the scheduled number of planes. Duffy hopes that the issues will be resolved by the summer, and the FAA insists that Newark airspace remains safe despite the delays.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased its oversight of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), requiring the agency to submit new reactor safety rules to the White House for review and potential modification. This marks a significant shift from the NRC's historical independence. A draft executive order proposes further changes, including reducing staff, revising regulations in coordination with the White House and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team, and potentially loosening radiation exposure standards. Critics argue that these changes could compromise safety by making the agency vulnerable to political and industry influence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consolidating multiple debts into a single monthly payment can simplify finances and potentially lower costs by reducing interest rates. Several methods exist, including personal consolidation loans, balance transfers to credit cards with promotional 0% APR periods, home equity loans or lines of credit, and debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies. Each option has its own advantages and risks, such as the potential for higher interest rates after promotional periods or the risk of losing a home if payments are not made. Careful evaluation of the total cost over the life of the loan is essential before proceeding.</p>

Pirro replaces Ed Martin, who was removed after facing opposition in the Senate, and Martin will now serve as director of the "weaponization working group" within the Justice Department.

Bush in 1990, Souter often aligned with liberal justices on key decisions, including upholding abortion rights in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. He dissented in Bush v. Gore, which halted the vote recount in Florida. Souter's retirement allowed President Barack Obama to appoint Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and he continued to serve as a judge on the U.S Circuit Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit after his retirement.</p>

          <p>A former model testified in Harvey Weinstein's retrial, alleging that he sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old and later forcibly performed oral sex on her. The witness described feeling scared and violated during the encounters, stating that Weinstein boasted about his power to make or break careers. The testimony includes a new accusation not included in the original trial, which was overturned on appeal. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is already serving a 16-year sentence for a sexual-assault conviction in California.</p>

          <p>Radar screens at Newark Liberty International Airport went black again early Friday morning, with the outage lasting approximately 90 seconds. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) attributed the incident to a telecommunications outage impacting communications and radar display at Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which covers the airspace around Newark. This outage follows a similar incident last week that caused air traffic controllers to take medical leave, further exacerbating existing staffing shortages. The Department of Transportation recently announced plans for a new air traffic control system to replace the antiquated system.</p>

          <p>New evidence has implicated the son of the former Kenyan president, Jonathan Moi, in the 1988 murder of Julie Ward, a young British woman. A witness statement from a safari camp official places Moi in the Masai Mara game reserve around the time of Ward's disappearance, contradicting his previous alibi. The Ward family believes the Metropolitan Police concealed this evidence to preserve good relations with Kenya, and they have filed a complaint against the police for alleged failures in the investigation. While Moi denied involvement before his death in 2019, the newly emerged documents shed light on the unsolved case.</p>

          <p>Despite cultural nostalgia for factory jobs, the American manufacturing sector has significantly declined since its peak in 1979. While 80% of Americans believe the country would be better off with more manufacturing jobs, salaries are now in the bottom half of all jobs, and automation has reduced the need for human labor. President Trump's tariffs have not significantly impacted employment in protected sectors, and immigration policies could further affect the sector. Despite political appeal and potential national security arguments, the reality of American manufacturing today does not align with the nostalgic vision of the past.</p>
