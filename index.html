Health organizations have hailed the injectable drug as a potential 'miracle' due to its nearly 100% effectiveness in trials, which could significantly advance the fight against new infections.

The move, which includes 12,000 white-collar positions, is an acceleration of a pre-existing cost-saving program and was met with a positive market reaction, causing the company's stock to jump nearly 9%. This restructuring comes after a period of leadership turmoil and aims to address underperformance in key markets like China.</p>

          <p>An Arkansas man from India is seeking to restore his visa status after being wrongfully arrested and detained for a month by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Police initially arrested him after mistaking a bottle of Yves Saint Laurent's 'Opium' perfume in his car for illegal narcotics. Although a state crime lab confirmed the substance was perfume and charges were dropped, the arrest triggered an immigration issue that led to his prolonged detention and the revocation of his work visa.</p>

          <p>In Nairobi, Kenya, a public viewing for the body of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga descended into chaos when police fired gunshots and tear gas into a stadium packed with mourners. The security forces' actions were an attempt to control a surge after a large crowd breached a gate, causing a stampede that resulted in several injuries. The event underscored the deep public grief for the towering political figure, whose body had been flown back from India, drawing massive crowds from the airport to the stadium.</p>

          <p>Beijing has accused Washington of deliberately creating panic and misunderstanding by exaggerating the impact of China's new controls on rare earth mineral exports. Despite the sharp rhetoric and the U.S. viewing the move as a threat to global technology supply chains, China's Commerce Ministry has indicated it is open to trade talks to resolve the dispute. This escalation has heightened tensions, with the U.S. threatening 100% tariffs and working to establish a domestic supply chain independent of China.</p>

          <p>Gun safety groups and law enforcement officials are raising alarms over a rapid increase in 3D-printed firearms recovered from crime scenes, warning of a new wave of untraceable 'ghost guns.' As 3D printers become cheaper and more advanced, and weapon blueprints proliferate online, police are seeing a year-over-year surge in these homemade weapons. The trend is prompting calls for new legislation and voluntary industry action to prevent the technology's misuse, mirroring the earlier regulatory battle over ghost gun assembly kits.</p>

          <p>Japan has officially recorded its hottest summer since record-keeping began in 1898, with average temperatures 2.36 degrees Celsius above normal, exacerbating public fears about the future. Scientists link the extreme heat to global warming and abnormal ocean temperatures, which have led to severe impacts including agricultural damage, a record number of heatstroke hospitalizations, and more powerful typhoons. Experts warn that this trend could lead to the effective disappearance of Japan's traditional spring and autumn seasons within decades.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing backlash for describing migration as a 'problem in the cityscape' during a public appearance. Opposition leaders from the Green and Left parties have condemned the remark as hurtful, discriminatory, and racially insensitive, arguing it fuels social division and questions the belonging of people with migration backgrounds. They have called on the chancellor to apologize for the comment, which a government spokesman later attempted to downplay.</p>

Reeves emphasized that national security comes first but stressed the need to balance challenging China with maintaining access to its markets.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors are monitoring the debate in Congress over Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, as their potential expiration after 2025 could significantly affect retirement tax strategies. The current, enhanced subsidies allow early retirees to perform larger Roth IRA conversions without losing eligibility for affordable health insurance. If these subsidies revert to stricter income limits, many retirees may have to choose between converting less to their Roth accounts or facing substantially higher healthcare premium costs.</p>
