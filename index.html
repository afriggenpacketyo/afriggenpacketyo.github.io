        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new World Bank report, Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking the highest growth rate in ten years, primarily driven by the oil and gas sector recovery and the tech and finance industries, while also expecting a slight increase to 3.7% in 2025. Despite this economic expansion, poverty remains high, with nearly half of Nigerians living in poverty, and inflation is expected to stay above 20% throughout the year. The report also highlighted the slow growth in the agriculture sector due to insecurity and high input costs, and the World Bank praised the government reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, while also emphasizing the need for more and better job creation to achieve a $1 trillion economy by 2030.</p>

Captured in 1966, Peterson spent six and a half years in the "Hanoi Hilton" and made a conscious decision to leave his hate behind after his release. As ambassador, he focused on reconciliation, seeking accountability for missing Americans, and fostering economic ties, including negotiating a key trade agreement. Peterson also initiated the "Safe Vietnam" program to improve safety awareness, and after his ambassadorship, he dedicated himself to preventing accidental childhood injuries throughout Asia, showing a commitment to transforming hate into hope and building bridges between former adversaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs due to factors like unpredictable US trade policies, geopolitical uncertainty, and rising inflationary pressures. Investors are increasingly viewing gold as a safe haven asset amidst recessionary risks and downgrading of economic forecasts by institutions like the IMF. Central banks are also contributing to the surge by increasing their gold reserves, possibly due to fears of weaponization of the dollar system. However, experts caution that gold is not immune to price fluctuations, and major surges have historically been followed by significant falls, raising concerns about a potential market bubble.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at the Philadelphia facility that manages Newark Liberty International Airport's air traffic led to significant flight delays, some lasting up to seven hours. The FAA acknowledged the shortage, stating that at least three controllers were scheduled per hour, but sources indicated that the number of fully certified controllers on duty was sometimes as low as one or two. The FAA moved Newark's air traffic management to Philadelphia last summer to address staffing issues, but the relocation has faced challenges, and training new controllers takes years. The FAA plans to reduce flights at Newark to mitigate delays and is upgrading infrastructure to prevent future outages.</p>

          <p>Experts are debating the appropriate use of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, emphasizing that changes in health, not just weight, should be the primary goal. While these medications are effective, they are expensive, often not covered by insurance, and intended for long-term use, with potential side effects. The focus should be on reducing visceral fat, which is linked to cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses. Doctors need better ways to identify individuals with excess visceral fat, as BMI is a poor measure, and they need more data on safely discontinuing the drugs and adjusting dosages long-term.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a U.S.-Israeli hostage held in Gaza, was released by Hamas as President Trump departed for a trip to the Middle East. Hamas stated the release was unconditional, aiming to foster a lasting ceasefire and renew humanitarian aid, with Alexander being transferred to the Red Cross and then the Israel Defense Forces. The Israeli government has committed to assisting in his absorption and supporting him and his family. However, Israel has been preventing food and medical aid from entering Gaza for nearly three months, and Israeli strikes were reported on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza, killing 16 people, mainly women and children.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring drugmakers to lower their prices within a month to align with those charged in other high-income countries, threatening steep Medicare caps if they fail to comply. The administration plans to approach pharmaceutical companies to negotiate a "most favored nation" price based on available data, aiming to reduce prescription drug prices by 50% to 90%. The White House seeks price reductions across federal and private health insurance, targeting drugs with the biggest disparity between U.S. and foreign prices. The pharmaceutical industry opposes this approach, arguing it would stifle innovation and give foreign governments undue influence, while pharmacy benefit managers support efforts to lower drug prices.</p>

The transportation sector is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide, while the electric power sector has significantly reduced its emissions by incorporating more renewable energy.
