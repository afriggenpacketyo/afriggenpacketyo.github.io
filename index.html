          <h2>Japanese Exports Decline for Second Consecutive Month Amid US Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 21:52:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports contracted for the second consecutive month in June, falling by 0.5% and fueling fears of a potential recession. The decline was driven by a significant drop in shipments to the U.S. and China, with the auto sector being particularly hard-hit by a 25% U.S. tariff. Economists note that Japanese carmakers appear to be absorbing the tariff costs to maintain market share, which is squeezing their profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

Her firing occurs amid a history of conflict between President Trump and her father, who was also terminated from his position during his first term.</p>

          <p>Shares in Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings plummeted after Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion takeover offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the bid. The failure of the deal highlights the challenges foreign companies face with acquisitions in Japan, with some analysts pointing to a strong sense of national corporate protectionism.

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula was canceled after a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast. The initial quake prompted a tsunami warning and led to evacuations in some coastal towns like Seward as a precaution. However, authorities later downgraded and then canceled the alert, stating that the shallow depth of the earthquake meant large, widespread waves were not expected, and no significant damage was reported.</p>

The joke referenced Clark's on-court altercations and drew a mixed reaction from the audience. Clark was not in attendance at the awards show as she was being evaluated for an injury sustained in a recent game, which has put her All-Star Game participation in question.</p>

          <h2>Scrutiny Mounts Over Trump Administration's Justification for Foreign Aid Cuts</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's rationale for clawing back nearly $8 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid is facing significant scrutiny. Officials justified the cuts by citing widespread "waste, fraud and abuse," but former and current officials, including a fired USAID inspector general, say the administration has provided little to no evidence. Critics allege the cuts were politically motivated, targeting programs related to climate, gender, and family planning.</p>

          <p>The average cost for six weeks of summer holiday childcare in Great Britain has risen to £1,076 per child, according to new research from the charity Coram. This represents a significant financial burden for working parents, with prices varying by region and some areas seeing hikes of up to 13% over the last year. The charity attributes the rising costs to high demand and a lack of more affordable council-run activities.</p>
