          <p>Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump recently addressed top U.S. military officers, outlining plans to reshape the armed forces with an emphasis on traditional masculinity and loyalty to their agenda. Chinese state media has reacted with mockery, portraying the meeting not as a strategic session but as a 'Make America Great Again' loyalty test. Outlets like Kankan News questioned the necessity of flying commanders long distances for what they described as a public loyalty pledge, suggesting more efficient communication methods exist for critical military decisions. This international reaction highlights a perception of the event as being more political than strategic in nature.</p>

          <p>A small group calling themselves the 'Kingdom of Kubala' has been evicted by police from a camp they established on council-owned land near Jedburgh, Scotland. The three individuals, originally from Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Texas, claimed they were reclaiming ancestral land and had gained a significant online following. After refusing to leave, police and immigration officials cleared the encampment, which local councillors stated had put pressure on nearby businesses. The eviction followed court orders banning the group from the area, bringing an end to a situation that had attracted worldwide media attention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global airline industry is confronting a severe pilot shortage, driven by a wave of early retirements during the pandemic and a backlog in training for new aviators. As air travel demand surges, airlines are struggling to fill cockpits, leading to increased pilot salaries, signing bonuses, and discussions about raising the mandatory retirement age. Experts estimate a need for hundreds of thousands of new pilots worldwide in the coming decades, a challenge compounded by the high cost of training. The situation is expected to take several years to normalize, potentially impacting ticket prices and flight availability for passengers.</p>

          <p>This article examines pressing questions in European football, focusing on Manchester United's struggles under manager Ruben Amorim and Christian Pulisic's standout performances for AC Milan. Despite a poor record, with more losses than wins, United's leadership has not yet fired Amorim, a decision linked to the political implications for the club's new Ineos ownership. In contrast, American player Christian Pulisic is described as operating at an unprecedented level for a male U.S. player, excelling as a key creator and scorer in Italy's Serie A. The piece also touches on Arsenal's recent significant victory over Newcastle as a potential catalyst for their title challenge.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is directly affecting hundreds of thousands of federal employees, with many deemed 'non-essential' being furloughed without pay. Essential workers, such as military personnel and TSA screeners, are required to work without immediate compensation, though back pay is guaranteed by law. The shutdown also impacts the public, with agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) ceasing much of their work, potentially worsening the housing crisis and halting thousands of home closings. The widespread furloughs vary by agency, with the EPA and Department of Education seeing nearly 90% of their staff sidelined.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A historical analysis of over one hundred past societal crises reveals a common driver: a 'wealth pump' that transfers wealth from the general population to a small elite. This process leads to rising economic and political inequality, popular discontent, and an overproduction of elites competing for a fixed number of power positions, creating an unstable coalition of alienated elites and angry masses. While most historical crises ended in decades of violence or collapse, the article notes that some societies, like the U.S. during the New Deal, avoided disaster through significant reforms that rebalanced wealth and power. The analysis suggests that resolving modern crises requires shutting down this wealth pump.</p>

The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances and fund improvements. The plan, presented by London & Valley Water, aims to turn the company around without taxpayer funding but suggests that current performance targets for leaks and pollution are unachievable and need adjustment.

Stracke explained that corporate borrowers have increased their leverage since the 2008 financial crisis, while consumers have deleveraged, creating a divergence in balance sheet health.

          <h2>China's Extensive Preparations Credited for Zero Fatalities During Super Typhoon Ragasa</h2>

          <p>Mainland China recorded no fatalities from Super Typhoon Ragasa, one of the world's strongest storms this year, a stark contrast to deadly typhoons in previous years. The successful outcome is attributed to extensive and proactive disaster preparedness measures, particularly in the southern province of Guangdong. Authorities evacuated over one million people, deployed tens of thousands of rescue personnel, and opened nearly 900 temporary shelters in the city of Shenzhen alone. This response reflects significant improvements in China's disaster management capabilities since past events like the 2018 Typhoon Mangkhut, which killed several people in the same region.</p>

          <p>Beijing has clarified its standards for what qualifies as a 'domestically made product' for government procurement, a move aimed at reassuring foreign companies. Under the new policy, goods meeting the 'Made in China' criteria will receive a 20% price preference in government contract bidding. Crucially, the policy will apply equally to state-owned, private, and foreign-owned companies operating in China, as long as their products meet a prescribed threshold for domestic component costs. An analyst noted that the revised definition is more transparent, creating a more predictable environment for foreign firms and mirroring similar practices in the U.S. and EU.</p>

          <p>Stubborn inflation is altering how Americans travel, with the overall cost of travel up 20% since 2019. While luxury travel remains strong, many middle- and lower-income households are feeling squeezed by higher prices for gas, lodging, and food, on top of increased costs for daily necessities. In response, travelers are opting for shorter trips, driving instead of flying, and choosing domestic destinations over international ones. Many people report forgoing vacations altogether, while others are exploring more creative, low-cost options like camping in less-known locations to satisfy their desire for travel amidst tighter budgets.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation into the January Eaton fire in Los Angeles County has uncovered evidence of electrical problems in the Altadena neighborhood hours before the main fire was officially reported. While lawsuits have focused on high-power transmission lines, data shows that local distribution lines in Altadena malfunctioned as early as 11 a.m. on the day of the fire. Firefighters were dispatched to the area for electrical issues multiple times that day, and at least one resident reported a fire starting from sparking utility equipment hours before the main fire front reached the area, raising new questions about the fire's origins and the utility's response.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Waking up with a sore back, neck, or shoulders can often be traced to improper sleep posture, which creates gaps between the body and the mattress, causing muscles to tense up overnight. Medical experts recommend maintaining a neutral spine alignment, similar to good standing posture, with ears, shoulders, and hips in a straight line. This can be achieved by choosing the right pillows for your head and using smaller pillows to support any gaps, such as under the knees for back sleepers or between the knees for side sleepers. Sleeping on one's stomach is generally discouraged as it can easily strain the neck and back.</p>

          <p>Mississippi's public health officer has declared a state of emergency after the infant mortality rate reached its highest level in over a decade, with nearly 10 babies dying for every 1,000 live births. The crisis is particularly severe for Black babies, with preterm birth being a significant factor. Health advocates warn that the situation could worsen nationwide as millions are projected to lose Medicaid coverage due to spending cuts, limiting access to the prenatal and preventative care crucial for healthy pregnancies. The state's response includes measures to transport high-risk babies to specialized facilities to provide immediate, intensive care.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, the nation's commercial aviation system faces potential disruptions due to its reliance on air traffic controllers, who are required to work without pay. During the last major shutdown in 2019, a slight increase in sick leave among controllers at just two facilities caused cascading delays at major East Coast airports, a factor believed to have pressured lawmakers to end the standoff. With the current controller workforce already facing staffing shortages and low morale, there is concern that even uncoordinated absences could quickly slow down the aviation system, as safety margins would require reducing aircraft in the air.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has significantly escalated its drone strikes on Russian oil refineries in recent months, successfully hitting over 20 large facilities since the beginning of the year. This campaign, which targets plants deep inside Russian territory, has caused disruptions leading to fuel shortages and price increases in some regions of Russia. Verified videos show long queues at petrol stations, and some independent stations have reportedly shut down. While Russia has extended a ban on petrol exports to stabilize the domestic market, the attacks are seen by Ukraine as a key strategy to restrict Russia's war-funding capabilities and pressure Moscow economically.</p>
