        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the first quarter of the year, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports, as revealed by preliminary government data. This contraction surpassed economists' expectations, who had predicted a 0.1% decrease. While domestic demand showed resilience with a 0.6% growth, it was insufficient to offset the negative impact of the export decline. The Bank of Japan has maintained its rates at 0.5% and anticipates a moderate economic recovery, contingent on improvements in jobs and wages.</p>

          <p>A transit strike initiated by locomotive engineers has shut down New Jersey Transit's rail network, impacting tens of thousands of commuters in the New York metropolitan region. The strike, the first in the state since 1983, stems from a dispute over pay, with the union demanding wages on par with other regional railroads. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan involving additional bus service and cross-honoring of tickets on buses and light rail lines, but capacity is limited. The strike has also affected travel to events at MetLife Stadium, prompting cancellations of train and bus service.</p>

A judge in 2023 ruled that news articles alleging the Victoria Cross recipient had murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, but Mr Roberts-Smith had argued the judge made legal errors. The civil trial was the first time in history any court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces. A panel of three Federal Court judges unanimously upheld the original judgement, though Mr Roberts-Smith has said he will appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia.</p>

          <p>US singer Chris Brown has been arrested and charged with inflicting 'grevious bodily harm' due to an alleged assault incident that happened at a London nightclub in February 2023, British authorities said. The 36-year-old was arrested Thursday at a hotel in Manchester in relation to the 2023 London nightclub incident, the London Metropolitan Police's statement said. On that night over two years ago, he allegedly attacked music producer Abe Diaw with a bottle at the exclusive Tape nightclub in the UK capital city. Brown will be presented in a magistrate's court on Friday.</p>

Traders are looking forward to the trading debut on Tuesday of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world’s largest maker of battery packs for electric vehicles. CATL’s US$5.3 billion stock offer is the world’s largest this year, and the biggest sale in Hong Kong in four years.</p>

The document said that staffing limitations, hiring, and a lack of coordination with states will also impact FEMA's operations heading into hurricane season.</p>

The number 86 is a slang term whose definitions include 'to reject' or 'to get rid of', according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, which also notes that it has more recently been used as a term meaning 'to kill'.

          <p>China is experiencing the world’s fastest rise in dementia cases, with projections indicating up to 115 million cases by 2050. In 1990, the country had about 4 million patients with dementia, a number that rose to 17 million by 2021, according to research published in PLOS One. The study did not highlight a specific reason for this increase, but the country is already grappling with a range of challenges caused by its rapidly ageing population, and this trend threatens to compound the problem. The incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of dementia cases have doubled globally between 1990 and 2021, but over the same period, the number of cases rose threefold in China.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat from migrating endangered humpback whales, which are swimming in the same waters where crabs are caught, leading to entanglements in fishing ropes. Fisherman Brand Little is using a high-tech system with remote-controlled pop-up devices to limit rope usage, allowing him to continue fishing while others cannot. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has shortened the season given the heightened risk of migrating whales. The pop-up gear has critics among some fishermen who say it shouldn't be used, rooted in tradition and finance.</p>

They are shown to have a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. In the latest study, the scientists found that horses undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges between North America and Eurasia in both directions.</p>

The plan is likely to be ultimately struck down, as it directly contradicts the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States'.</p>
