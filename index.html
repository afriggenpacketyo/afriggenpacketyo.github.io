          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 24 fatalities and a declared "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise. Officials report that between 23 and 25 campers from Camp Mystic remain unaccounted for, prompting extensive search and rescue operations involving helicopters and drones. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, mobilizing state resources to aid in the response to the unexpected and severe weather event.</p>

          <p>The death toll from severe flooding in central Texas has risen to 24, with children among the deceased and about 23 campers still missing. Officials acknowledged that the weather forecast significantly underestimated the rainfall, which led to the "extraordinary catastrophe." State emergency management had prepared for up to 8 inches of rain, but the actual amount was far greater, causing the Guadalupe River to swell rapidly. Over 237 people have been rescued, many by helicopter, as search operations continue through the night for an unknown number of unaccounted for individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy. Initially feared to be season-ending, the injury was diagnosed as a bone bruise with an expected recovery time of about six weeks. This timeline would allow Muncy to return more than a month before the playoffs. The team's management expressed relief and will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim. The front office feels confident they can weather his absence without making a desperate trade.</p>

          <p>Several New York City beaches in Queens were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to shore. Drones operated by the city's emergency management agency confirmed the sharks' proximity to beachgoers in the Far Rockaway area. Officials credited the drone technology and lifeguard response for ensuring public safety during the holiday. The beaches were reopened after about an hour, with authorities continuing to monitor the waters to keep swimmers safe from potential encounters.</p>

          <p>South Korea and Japan are intensifying efforts to support their shipbuilding industries as the United States increases pressure on China's dominance in the sector. South Korea's new administration has labeled its industry as being in a "major crisis" and has outlined policies to foster growth and innovation. The government's guidelines aim to promote the development of advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through digitalization and improved working conditions. These moves are seen as a strategic response to global trade dynamics and an attempt to reclaim market share from China's shipbuilding powerhouses.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge in Massachusetts has denied a last-ditch effort to halt the deportation of eight migrants to South Sudan, clearing the way for their removal by the Trump administration. The men, who have all been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., were scheduled to be flown to the war-torn country on Friday. Their lawyers argued they could face "perilous conditions," as the U.S. government itself advises against travel to South Sudan due to civil war. This ruling follows a complex legal battle that reached the Supreme Court, ultimately allowing the administration to proceed with the controversial deportation.</p>

          <p>A Connecticut law is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell towed vehicles just 15 days after seizure, a practice critics label as predatory. Residents in working-class neighborhoods report being targeted by operators who tow cars for minor infractions like expired registrations, which were difficult to renew during the pandemic. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, was allegedly responsible for towing 1,000 cars from a single apartment complex in two years. The company owner defends the practice as enforcing the rules of the property, while affected residents argue it exploits people who cannot afford the high, short-notice fees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's newly signed "big, beautiful bill" does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts clarify that this provides some tax relief but is not a repeal of the tax on benefits. The deduction applies to a senior's total income, not just Social Security, and is set to expire in 2028, with critics noting it primarily benefits higher-income seniors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the path for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records from a naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. The ruling clarified an earlier order, effectively nullifying a lower court's injunction that had required the government to provide the men a chance to contest their removal. Dissenting justices, including Sonia Sotomayor, expressed grave concerns, stating the men could face torture or death in South Sudan.

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the major tax and spending bill recently signed into law by President Trump will add approximately $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. This projection is a key point of contention for critics of the legislation, who argue that the permanent extension of the 2017 tax cuts is not adequately paid for. The bill's supporters dispute these forecasts, arguing that the economic growth spurred by the tax cuts will offset the costs, a claim many economists view with skepticism.

However, some acknowledge a lingering bias in certain workplaces where crying could be perceived as instability and potentially affect promotion prospects.

These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters into the deep ocean to burn that fat over winter. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars, preventing it from re-entering the atmosphere. Scientists call these overlooked animals "unsung heroes" but warn that their populations are facing growing threats.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's new tax-and-spending package reveals that the wealthiest 1% of U.S. households will receive the largest benefits, with the size of the tax cut varying significantly by state. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the top 1% in states with no personal income tax, such as Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, will see the biggest windfalls, with average tax cuts exceeding $100,000. This is because they benefit from federal tax reductions without being negatively impacted by the new, higher cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, which primarily affects high-tax states.

          <p>President Trump's newly enacted legislation introduces sweeping financial changes for Americans by making the 2017 tax cuts permanent and adding new provisions. The bill increases the standard deduction, child tax credit, and estate tax exemption, while also raising the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000. It creates temporary deductions for tip income, overtime pay, and car loan interest, along with a "senior bonus" deduction. However, the package also makes deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food stamps, ends many clean energy tax credits, and overhauls the federal student loan system.

          <p>An Arizona-based, Harvard-educated economics professor, Dr. Bishara Bahbah, has emerged as a key backchannel negotiator between Hamas and the U.S. in Gaza ceasefire talks. After being contacted by a senior Hamas official in April, Dr. Bahbah, who has connections to the Trump administration, began relaying messages to help secure a deal. His involvement is credited with building trust and facilitating the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander in May as a "good faith" gesture. This unusual diplomatic channel highlights the unconventional methods being used to navigate the complex and intractable conflict.</p>

          <p>Panic and desperation are spreading among families as more than 20 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp in Texas Hill Country, are missing after sudden, intense flooding.

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. Zoo experts entrusted them with one of two eggs laid by another penguin couple to improve the chances of both chicks successfully fledging. This is part of a successful breeding season for the vulnerable species at the zoo, which welcomed 10 new chicks this year. Same-sex penguin parenting, while not common, has been observed in other zoos, with both parents typically sharing the duties of incubating the egg and feeding the chick.</p>

These include a U.S. guarantee that Israel will not resume hostilities if talks for a permanent end to the war fail, and that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. Israel and the U.S. have not yet responded, but have been reluctant to agree to similar demands in the past.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to rally against the Trump administration's immigration raids and the recent passage of a budget bill that significantly funds them. Many attendees said they were forgoing traditional holiday celebrations to voice their opposition, with some dressing as a shackled Lady Liberty or in Revolutionary War attire. The march went from City Hall to the federal building, where protesters chanted against deportations and what they called an "occupation." The demonstration reflects ongoing tensions in the city, which has been the site of aggressive ICE raids and a subsequent National Guard deployment.</p>

It also allocates a monumental $170 billion to immigration enforcement to support mass deportations.
