          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily from Newark Liberty International Airport, representing about 10% of its schedule, after experiencing significant flight disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the cancellations to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers and technological problems within the Federal Aviation Administration. Kirby stated that the airline had no other choice but to reduce flights to protect customers, urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. The FAA acknowledged staffing issues were causing delays at Newark, and Kirby noted that 20% of air traffic controllers for Newark had recently left their positions after technology failures.

          <p>Radio Free Asia (RFA) is initiating mass layoffs, affecting approximately 90% of its staff and shutting down several language services, due to funding cuts from the Trump administration. President Trump directed the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to minimize operations, leading to the termination of RFA's grants. Despite a federal judge's order to reinstate funds, a D.C. appeals court granted a stay, freezing the order. RFA's president, Bay Fang, expressed deep concern over the situation, emphasizing the organization's role in providing uncensored news to audiences in repressive societies, and reporting on critical issues like China's treatment of Uyghurs and the civil war in Myanmar.

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has launched a campaign to protect Medicaid, targeting four House Republicans deemed "vulnerable." The DNC is encouraging voters to engage in social media activism, host town halls, and contact their representatives to express their opposition to potential Medicaid cuts. Republicans have responded by accusing the DNC of dishonest tactics and fear-mongering, asserting that they are committed to protecting Medicaid for those who rely on it. Some Republicans argue that reforms are needed to eliminate wasteful spending and ensure eligibility requirements are enforced, but Democrats warn that any cuts would harm vulnerable populations.
