          <p>Shares of Japanese investment firm SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a new record after reporting a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, far surpassing analyst estimates. This marks the company's second consecutive profitable quarter, a significant turnaround from the loss reported in the same period last year. The strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, fueled by investments in companies like Grab and Swiggy, with several portfolio companies also preparing for public offerings.

          <p>Senator JD Vance's office has stated that neither the senator nor his staff were aware of a Secret Service request to raise the water level of Ohio's Little Miami River. The request was made to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ensure safe navigation for the security detail's motorized boats during a family boating trip for Vance. The Secret Service confirmed the decision was made independently during standard planning for operational necessity after a public safety boat allegedly ran aground during a scouting mission. The incident has drawn some political criticism and comparisons to a similar event involving former Vice President Al Gore.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, an Australian politician, has resigned from the New South Wales parliament moments before a vote to expel him. Ward was recently found guilty of sexually assaulting two young men between 2013 and 2015 and is currently in custody awaiting sentencing. He had attempted a legal challenge to prevent his expulsion from his role as an independent member for Kiama, arguing it was an "affront to democracy," but the court dismissed his bid. His resignation triggers a by-election and ends his parliamentary salary, a move the state's premier said should have happened earlier.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order halting further construction on a controversial immigrant detention center in Florida, known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling follows a lawsuit from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening the sensitive Everglades ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the facility can continue to house detainees, the 14-day pause on construction is intended to prevent further potential harm. The state of Florida has vowed to fight the ruling, which scrutinizes the facility's ambiguous jurisdictional status between state and federal control.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Science Advances quantifies that California's fire season is beginning significantly earlier and lasting longer, a shift primarily attributed to human-caused climate change. Researchers found that in some regions, like the Cascade Range, the season starts 46 days earlier than it did in the early 1990s. The primary drivers are earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of flammable vegetation due to rising temperatures, rather than an increase in human-ignited fires. This year, California is already on pace for more burned acreage than last year, highlighting the growing and near-constant threat of wildfires in the state.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the increase, alleging Maduro works with cartels and terrorist groups to smuggle drugs into the U.S. Maduro was first indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020, and the reward for his capture was previously $25 million. Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the new reward as "pathetic" political propaganda and a desperate distraction from other U.S. political issues.</p>

          <p>A private war game simulation held in Singapore explored the scenario of a Chinese military blockade of Taiwan, revealing the critical role Singapore could play in evacuating foreign nationals. The exercise, attended by current and former officials and scholars, concluded that Southeast Asian nations would heavily rely on a Singaporean-led airlift to rescue their citizens. This is attributed to Singapore's discreet but long-standing security presence and training operations in Taiwan, which provide unique access and logistical capabilities. The simulation underscores the growing need for regional contingency planning as tensions between the U.S. and China over Taiwan escalate.</p>

The allegations, which were suppressed during her trial, claim she used tainted food, including cookies and a curry, in a years-long campaign that once left him in a coma. Mr. Patterson stated he became suspicious and stopped eating her food, believing he was the sole target.

The tariffs exempt companies with a significant manufacturing presence in the United States, but the specifics of this requirement remain unclear.

          <p>Instagram's launch of a new "Map" feature has triggered a backlash from users concerned about geolocation privacy. The tool, similar to Snapchat's Snap Map, allows users to share their location with friends, but many users expressed fear that it was exposing their location without their consent. Instagram head Adam Mosseri responded by stating that location sharing is an opt-in feature and that the company was investigating to ensure no one's location is shared without explicit, double consent. Despite these assurances, some users claimed their location was being shared even with their phone's location settings for the app turned off.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm, resolving the wrongful termination lawsuit she filed after being fired from the show "The Mandalorian" in 2021. Carano was dismissed following controversial social media posts where she compared the U.S. political climate to Nazi Germany and was accused of mocking transgender people. In her lawsuit, which was financially backed by Elon Musk's X, she alleged discrimination for her political opinions. The details of the settlement were not disclosed, but a Lucasfilm spokesperson expressed hope for future work with Carano.</p>

          <p>The UK government is drafting legislation to impose new restrictions on serious sexual and violent criminals upon their release from prison. The plan would move beyond current exclusion zones, which bar offenders from specific areas, to a system of "restriction zones" that would confine them to a designated geographical area. Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, these zones would be tailored to each case in consultation with victims to provide them greater peace of mind. Critics have raised concerns that the plan will place additional strain on an already pressured probation service.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders have harshly criticized Republicans after Texas Senator John Cornyn claimed the FBI would assist in locating Democratic state lawmakers who fled to Illinois. The lawmakers left Texas to block the passage of a gerrymandered congressional map, and their absence denies Republicans the necessary quorum to vote. Democrats, including Hakeem Jeffries and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, condemned the potential use of federal law enforcement to track political opponents as authoritarian. The FBI has declined to comment, and legal experts have questioned the federal government's authority to intervene in the state-level political dispute.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at allowing higher-risk assets like private equity and cryptocurrency to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. The order directs federal agencies to rewrite regulations, a process that could take months, to expand investment choices for millions of American workers. This move could grant the private equity and crypto industries access to trillions of dollars in retirement funds. While investment firms have applauded the order for providing more options, it marks a shift from the previous administration's cautious approach to volatile assets in retirement accounts.

His departure comes as Musk reportedly ordered a shutdown of the Dojo project, with its engineers being reassigned to other initiatives.

The company saw a robust 5.8% increase in same-store sales, driven primarily by higher customer traffic, a positive sign for the brand's appeal.

An intense price war, driven by overcapacity and weak consumer demand, had pushed industry-wide discounts to a record high of over 17% in recent months. While the reduction in discounts is seen as an encouraging sign of alignment with Beijing's goal to protect the vital EV sector, analysts remain cautious.

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's ban on "roving patrols" used by immigration agents in Southern California. A federal judge had restricted the tactic, which involves agents apprehending individuals based on factors like race or location, finding it likely violates the 4th Amendment. In its appeal, the administration argues the injunction harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in a district with nearly two million undocumented immigrants. Civil rights groups counter that lifting the ban would effectively bless indiscriminate, racially-motivated arrests of anyone who appears to be Latino.</p>

Data shows a significant increase in last-minute searches for UK trips, with some campsite bookings being made just two days in advance.
