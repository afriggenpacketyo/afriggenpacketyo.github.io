          <p>Following the United States' strikes on Iran, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany issued a joint statement urging Iran to engage in negotiations. The leaders reiterated their commitment to regional peace and stability, affirming their support for Israel's security and emphasizing that Iran must never possess nuclear weapons or threaten regional security. They called on Iran to participate in negotiations towards an agreement addressing concerns about its nuclear program and to refrain from actions that could destabilize the region. The joint statement underscores a unified European stance on de-escalation and diplomatic resolution to the ongoing tensions. The European powers are focused on achieving a peaceful resolution. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, American officials, including President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth, called for Iran to pursue diplomatic solutions rather than retaliate. Trump stated that Iran must make peace or face greater consequences, while Hegseth emphasized that the strikes were limited to nuclear capabilities and not aimed at regime change. Vance clarified that the U.S. is at war with Iran's nuclear program, not with Iran itself. Despite these signals, Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi stated that diplomacy was already underway when the strikes occurred, making a return to negotiations seem irrelevant. The situation remains tense as the U.S. hopes for a peaceful resolution. </p>

          <p>The United States and Iran have historically avoided direct military confrontation, but President Trump authorized strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites, marking a significant escalation. This unprecedented move has caused alarm globally, and Iran's response will be crucial. Khamenei's decisions will shape his legacy and the future of the Islamic Republic, with the potential for significant consequences. While Iran does not desire war, the pressure to respond is mounting, particularly given the damage inflicted by recent Israeli strikes. The situation is precarious, requiring careful calculations to avoid further escalation. </p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at lowering energy costs for businesses and stimulating economic growth. The plan includes scrapping green levies, potentially reducing energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms. The strategy also focuses on upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending, with specific attention to sectors like advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and digital technologies. This comprehensive plan seeks to create over one million new jobs and provide long-term certainty for businesses. </p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal the aftermath of U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The images show damage to the mountainside at Fordo, where the underground nuclear site is located, with large diameter holes and blocked tunnel entrances. At Isfahan, extensive building damage is visible, while Natanz shows a crater directly over part of the underground complex. The IAEA reported no increase in off-site radiation levels, but emphasized the need for dialogue and diplomacy. The U.S. military used decoy B-2 bombers and other deception tactics to protect the bombers during the strikes. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Rubio called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil trade route. This appeal follows warnings from Iran that it reserves all options to defend its sovereignty after U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz could severely impact the global economy, with oil prices potentially exceeding $100 per barrel. While the U.S. maintains options to address such a scenario, Rubio emphasized that it would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as its own oil exports rely on the waterway. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is stationed in Bahrain to protect maritime trade in the Persian Gulf. </p>

The protest is backed by 35 groups, including pro-Palestinian organisations and the Stop the War Coalition. While acknowledging the right to protest, the police chief emphasized that actions supporting Palestine Action exceed legitimate protest. Although the group has not yet been proscribed, the Met intends to impose conditions on the protest to prevent disorder and disruption. The home secretary is reportedly preparing a written statement to proscribe the group, effectively branding it a terrorist organisation. </p>

          <p>The Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, is under renewed focus due to potential Iranian retaliation following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strait is a vital chokepoint for global oil trade, with millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products transiting daily. Disruption of oil flows through the strait could severely impact international energy markets and economies. The U.S. has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait, while Iran has long used the threat of closing it as a way to ward off Western pressure. </p>

Administration officials argue the attack was a limited engagement to disrupt Iranian nuclear capabilities, not a broader conflict. Some lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Massie, question the legality of the strikes, arguing there was no imminent threat to the U.S. that would authorize such action. Other Republicans, like House Speaker Johnson, praised Trump's decision. Top Democrats were kept in the dark about the mission until after U.S. forces left Iranian airspace. </p>
