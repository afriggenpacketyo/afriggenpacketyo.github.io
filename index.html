        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant flight delays and cancellations, with disruptions entering their second week. The issues stem from a combination of factors, including air traffic controller staffing shortages, runway construction, and adverse weather conditions. The article notes that communication breakdowns between air traffic control and planes occurred, leading to absences among controllers and further exacerbating the situation. Senator Chuck Schumer has called for an investigation into the problems, blaming mismanagement and budget cuts for the staffing issues, while United Airlines, Newark's largest carrier, attributed cancellations to equipment failures. Optimism score should be 35, as there are issues but they are being addressed.</p>
