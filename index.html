          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, secretly shed its public benefit corporation status in Nevada, a designation committing it to positive societal impact, even as Musk pursued a lawsuit against OpenAI for allegedly abandoning its own mission for humanity's benefit. This change coincided with xAI's use of dozens of natural gas turbines for its Memphis data center, contributing to air pollution and drawing a lawsuit from the NAACP. Critics suggest the company leveraged the PBC status for public relations before prioritizing profit, reflecting a broader industry challenge with transparency, AI safety, and environmental responsibility. The article highlights concerns over xAI's chatbot, Grok, for spreading harmful content.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has voiced significant apprehension regarding the U.S. labor market, indicating a potential for interest rate cuts in response to a marked slowdown in job growth over recent months. The article highlights three critical warning signs: a substantial decline in monthly hiring, a worrying increase in long-term job seekers, and growing difficulties for young professionals to secure initial employment, partly due to the integration of artificial intelligence. Labor experts maintain a pessimistic outlook, anticipating further challenges for job seekers in the near future.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran national, was re-detained by U.S. immigration authorities in Baltimore shortly after his release from criminal custody, prompting his lawyer to allege the action is punitive and violates his constitutional rights. Garcia had been mistakenly deported to El Salvador, held in a notorious prison, and then returned to the U.S. facing human smuggling charges, which he has contested. His legal team has filed a new lawsuit, challenging his confinement and potential deportation to any country without a fair trial. Maryland officials, including Governor Wes Moore and Senator Chris Van Hollen, have publicly advocated for Garcia's due process rights amidst threats of deportation to Uganda.</p>

This diplomatic shift is largely driven by concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's unpredictable foreign policy and closer ties between North Korea, China, and Russia. Despite historical disputes, President Lee has adopted a friendlier stance, and public sentiment in South Korea is increasingly positive towards Japan.

          <p>Scotland, renowned for its rainfall, is currently experiencing severe water scarcity due to its driest spring since 1964 and a hot summer, with rivers in areas like Ythan and North Fife reaching critical levels. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has imposed restrictions on water abstraction for industry and agriculture, while Scottish Water is exploring emergency measures, including diverting water from other sources, to maintain supplies. Reservoir levels in eastern Scotland are significantly below seasonal averages, raising concerns for future availability. Experts attribute these extreme conditions to climate change, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced water conservation and long-term adaptation strategies across the nation.</p>

          <p>U.S. midfielder Weston McKennie was subjected to racist abuse by individuals in the away section following Juventus's 2-0 Serie A victory over Parma, prompting the Italian club to issue a strong condemnation.

This incident is the latest in a concerning series of racism allegations within European football, with FIFA President Gianni Infantino recently describing similar events in German Cup games as "unacceptable." McKennie has faced such abuse before, underscoring the persistent and systemic challenge of racism that continues to plague the sport.</p>

          <p>A new report defines "quiet cracking" as a pervasive and often less visible feeling of workplace unhappiness that can precede "quiet quitting," ultimately leading to disengagement, diminished performance, and a heightened desire to leave. Unlike traditional burnout, it doesn't always manifest as exhaustion, and its immediate impact on performance metrics is less apparent, making it "just as dangerous" for organizations. Over half of surveyed employees indicate experiencing some level of quiet cracking, contributing to an estimated $2 trillion in lost productivity in the U.S. Experts stress the importance of strong leadership and addressing factors like unclear goals and poor workplace relationships to combat this growing trend.</p>

The surge has, however, raised new concerns regarding student safety, particularly with military-style vehicles and troops visible at Metro stations, which many students use for commuting. The article highlights the ongoing tension between local and federal authorities over public safety in educational settings.</p>

          <p>The search for Russian climber Natalia Nagovitsyna, who has been stranded with a broken leg on Kyrgyzstan's 24,406-foot Victory Peak for nearly two weeks, has been indefinitely suspended due to treacherous weather conditions. This tragic development follows the death of an Italian climber, Luca Sinigaglia, who perished during an earlier rescue attempt on August 15. Although a drone confirmed Nagovitsyna was alive on Tuesday, subsequent flights found no signs of life, leading authorities to conclude she is likely deceased given the extreme sub-zero temperatures and high altitude, from which no one has ever been successfully evacuated. The article highlights the immense dangers inherent in high-altitude mountaineering and rescue operations.</p>

          <p>The UK hospitality industry reports that more than half of the nation's job losses since the last budget, amounting to approximately 89,000 positions, have occurred within its sector. UKHospitality attributes these significant cuts to the cumulative impact of higher taxes and escalating operating costs, including increases in the minimum wage and National Insurance contributions, which have deterred investment and hiring. Amidst a broader cost-of-living crisis that has reduced consumer spending, the industry group warns of potential widespread business failures and accelerated job losses, possibly reaching 100,000, and calls for urgent government intervention such as cuts to business rates and VAT.

          <p>The Trump administration's intensified immigration crackdown in Washington D.C., characterized by federal agents patrolling streets and making arrests, has instilled widespread fear among families and childcare workers. Reports of unmarked cars near daycares and detentions have prompted undocumented parents and caregivers to avoid specific city areas, with some nannies even calling out of work due to safety concerns. Childcare centers are implementing new security protocols, and parents are drafting legal documents to ensure children's protection if caregivers are detained. Critics argue this aggressive enforcement creates an environment detrimental to children's well-being and learning, underscoring the significant social disruption caused by the federal surge.</p>

          <p>Unions are strongly opposing a proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads, asserting it would heighten the risk of catastrophic train derailments, lead to job losses, and increase costs for consumers. Drawing parallels to the East Palestine, Ohio, toxic derailment, workers fear that consolidating two major carriers would empower an already dominant industry to further prioritize profits over safety and workforce retention. The Smart Transportation Division criticizes Union Pacific's safety record and labor practices, arguing that such a merger would grant immense market power, potentially resulting in more service disruptions, reduced employment, and adverse impacts on communities and the supply chain.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is exerting a significant, albeit controversial, influence over New York City's mayoral election, reportedly weighing an endorsement despite his pronounced unpopularity in his hometown. The race is currently dominated by Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, prompting wealthy New Yorkers to seek ways to counter his lead, with Trump reportedly engaging in discussions with former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams also shares connections with Trump, notably benefiting from the dismissal of corruption charges by a Trump-appointed Justice Department official.

          <p>This article advocates strongly for implementing phone bans in schools, asserting that constant smartphone access significantly distracts students, exacerbates social anxiety, and impedes both emotional and intellectual development. The author, a former teacher and researcher, highlights how phones undermine student autonomy and prevent essential in-person interactions critical for growth. With a growing number of U.S. states now mandating or recommending phone limits, international precedents like Australia demonstrate positive outcomes, including reduced classroom distractions, enhanced learning, and increased student socializing. The article encourages parents to overcome their discomfort and support these policies, thereby enabling children to cultivate resilience and problem-solving abilities without relying on digital escape routes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's executive order addressing homelessness, which advocates for expanded involuntary commitments and increased criminalization, mirrors controversial policies that have been implemented for years in many "blue states." While Trump seeks to compel unhoused individuals into mandatory drug or mental health treatments, experts like Alex Barnard argue that such commitments have a mixed track record and are only truly effective when integrated with accessible housing solutions. The article highlights California's high rates of civil commitments alongside its large unsheltered population, underscoring that housing affordability, not a lack of coercion, is the fundamental issue. This approach, framed as "coercion as compassion," reveals broad, albeit contested, bipartisan support.</p>
