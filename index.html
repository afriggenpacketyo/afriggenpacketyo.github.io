          <p>A wave of protests has occurred across the United Kingdom against the government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers. The demonstrations, often organized by local residents including concerned mothers, are fueled by safety fears and community impact, particularly after a sexual assault charge against a hotel resident in Epping. While some far-right activists are present, the movement also involves individuals new to activism, reflecting a shift in public mood. The situation highlights deep community divisions and criticism of the government's lack of transparency and sustainable solutions for the asylum system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by author Andrew Lownie, titled "Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York," presents a deeply unflattering portrait of Prince Andrew. The book details his alleged arrogance, poor judgment, and extensive connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, using hundreds of interviews to support its claims. Royal commentators suggest the detailed account of scandals involving sex and money effectively seals his fate, preventing any potential return to public royal duties. The biography also explores his character's complexities, suggesting vulnerability and insecurity beneath a bombastic exterior.</p>

After an opening-round 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under 64, bringing his total to 13 under par as he seeks his first PGA Tour victory. At the time of the suspension due to lightning, Collin Morikawa and Akshay Bhatia were tied for second place at nine under. Twenty-one players, including Justin Rose who was also at nine under, were still on the course and will complete their rounds once play resumes.</p>

Rhymes has categorically denied all accusations, describing them as an "attempted shake-down" by a disgruntled former employee.

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration has taken steps to terminate its collective bargaining agreement with its unionized employees. The move affects around 8,000 workers represented by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). This action is part of a broader administration effort to weaken federal unions, which would make it easier for agencies to discipline or dismiss employees. The union's president has stated they are planning a legal challenge in response to the decision, which aligns with President Trump's goal of downsizing the federal government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, August 15. The summit comes as a deadline imposed by Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine was set to expire, with the administration threatening heavy secondary tariffs on countries trading with Moscow. The meeting follows a visit by U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to Moscow, which Trump described as "highly productive." The discussions aim to find a negotiated end to the war, though the specific terms of a potential peace deal remain a point of contention.</p>

The plan is opposed by both the Israeli security establishment and a majority of the public, but it appeases the hard-right, anti-Arab parties in his narrow coalition, whose support is crucial for him to remain in power. These far-right partners advocate for the ethnic cleansing and annexation of Gaza, a goal not shared by most Israelis.

The lower court judge, James Boasberg, had found probable cause for contempt, but the D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled 2-1 to vacate his decision. The ruling is a significant victory for the administration in a case that highlights the escalating tensions between the executive and judicial branches over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected the idea of U.S. military intervention against drug cartels on Mexican soil. Her statement came in response to reports that President Trump had secretly directed the Pentagon to develop plans for action against Latin American cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on security, its sovereignty is "inalienable" and a U.S. military presence will not be accepted. The issue is sensitive in Mexico, where fears of U.S. intervention have grown since the Trump administration labeled several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.</p>

The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance with President Donald Trump at the White House, where Cook announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. Trump stated that because of this domestic investment, Apple would be exempt from future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about potential impacts on profitability. This successful meeting, combined with strong recent earnings, has significantly boosted investor confidence in the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating another investigation into the origins of the inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. This move comes after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified documents and accused the Obama administration of pushing a false narrative to undermine Trump's campaign. Attorney General Pam Bondi has now authorized a new probe into the original investigation of the 2016 campaign's ties to Russia. This article questions what new information could be learned, given the numerous investigations that have already been conducted on the subject over the past decade.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that median home listing prices are falling in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops since the market peak in 2022, largely due to higher housing inventory from a pandemic-era building boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and tight inventory, with cities like Milwaukee and New York seeing notable increases. The data reveals a divided housing market, where supply and demand dynamics are creating very different conditions for buyers and sellers across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

Coach Lincoln Riley confirmed Brown would be out for at least the first few games, a significant blow to the Trojans' defense. Brown was considered a leading candidate to start at the slot corner position, and his absence will put more pressure on younger defensive backs to step up. The injury timeline remains uncertain, but the team is hopeful for his return at some point during the season.</p>
