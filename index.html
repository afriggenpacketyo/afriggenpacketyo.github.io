          <p>A personal essay highlights the link between environmental toxins and reproductive health issues, particularly impacting Black families who are more likely to live near industrial facilities and breathe polluted air. The author shares her struggles with endometriosis and infertility, connecting it to the toxic environment of her childhood neighborhood near factories. She also recounts stories of other Black women facing similar challenges, emphasizing the need to connect pollution to Black maternal health discussions. The author criticizes the lack of investigation into contamination concerns and the impact of policy rollbacks on environmental studies and reproductive health research.</p>

          <p>As the May 7th deadline approaches for REAL ID implementation, the Trump administration is firm on no extensions, despite Kentucky lawmakers' request for a delay due to access issues for residents. Kentucky officials are concerned that many residents, especially in rural areas, are unaware of their options, and many Americans remain non-compliant, raising concerns about potential delays at TSA checkpoints. The REAL ID Act, enacted in 2005, has faced opposition over cost, states' rights, and privacy concerns, with some viewing it as a form of mass surveillance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to hinder the wind energy industry, the sector is finding new opportunities through "repowering" aging wind farms. This involves upgrading or replacing older turbines with more efficient models, increasing electricity output and extending lifecycles. Companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa are benefiting from this trend, with revenue increases reported in 2024. Repowering offers economic benefits by avoiding the need to acquire new property and reducing the number of turbines needed while generating more electricity.</p>
