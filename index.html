            <p>A recent poll by the NASUWT teaching union in the UK indicates that social media influencers are contributing to increased misogyny and sexism in schools. Almost 60% of teachers believe social media negatively impacts student behavior, with Andrew Tate specifically named by several teachers. The Department for Education acknowledges this "damaging impact" and is supporting teachers in addressing the issue, as some students are adopting sexist views promoted by these influencers. Union members are set to discuss motions addressing the influence of far-right movements on social media and online gaming platforms at their annual conference. </p>

            <p>The ACLU is seeking emergency intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court and other courts to halt the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused of being foreign gang members, arguing the Trump administration is violating due process. These detainees, transferred to a Texas detention facility, are allegedly being deported to El Salvador, where hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants are already held in a mega-prison. The ACLU contends that these individuals are not being given a fair chance to challenge their cases and are being pressured to sign removal notices. The Supreme Court previously ruled that while the wartime authority invoked by the administration could resume, immigrants must be given proper notice and a chance to make their case.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring the US bond market due to recent volatility sparked by trade tariffs, indicating a potential loss of confidence in the US economy. When governments sell bonds, it's essentially an IOU, and in return they pay interest. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs has led investors to demand higher returns for buying US government bonds, impacting borrowing rates for households and businesses. This situation draws parallels to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK, where unfunded tax cuts caused market turmoil. The bond market's reaction prompted President Trump to pause higher tariffs, highlighting its influence on economic policy.</p>

            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 20:51:21 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the term "woman" legally refers to a biological woman, providing clarity that had been missing from equality law discussions. This ruling clarifies that for the Equality Act to be consistent, the term woman has to mean a biological woman and does not include biological males, even if they have certificates to say they have changed gender. This means that where there are, for instance, women-only spaces, then a biological man who identifies as a woman cannot use them. The judgement is intended to draw a line under that, while the ruling has been praised by women's groups, it has also been met with concern by trans rights advocates who fear it will lead to increased discrimination.</p>

            <p>Artists are expressing concern over the increasing use of AI to generate images of people as toys, fearing it devalues creativity and threatens their livelihoods. The #StarterPackNoAI movement has emerged as a response, with artists sharing examples of their handcrafted work to highlight the difference. They argue that AI-generated images lack the personality and effort that go into human-made art. While some acknowledge AI's potential as a tool, they caution against its use for creating digital fluff instead of addressing real-world problems.</p>

Despite asking for a reason, agents provided no explanation and allegedly requested access to his phone. CBP officials assert that their officers acted according to established protocols, but Atallah fears retaliation for speaking out about the incident.</p>

            <p>A prolonged bin strike in Birmingham has highlighted the divide between wealthy and poor areas, with densely populated, lower-income areas experiencing the worst waste accumulation. While wealthier neighborhoods remain relatively unaffected, inner-city areas are struggling with overflowing bins and reports of rat infestations. The strike, now in its sixth week, has led to accusations of a two-tier waste collection system, with residents claiming poorer areas are consistently underserved. Efforts to resolve the strike are ongoing, but the dispute has exacerbated existing inequalities in the city.</p>

Migrants at a Texas detention facility are allegedly being loaded onto buses for removal, despite lacking adequate notice or the opportunity to challenge their removal. The ACLU has asked the Supreme Court for an emergency injunction, arguing that the government's actions violate the Court's previous ruling. A federal judge expressed concerns about the inadequacy of the notices but stated that he lacked the power to halt the deportations.</p>
