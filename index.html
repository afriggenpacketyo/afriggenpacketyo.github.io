          <p>Kemi Badenoch has denied any rift with Robert Jenrick regarding potential collaboration with Reform UK, despite leaked recordings revealing Jenrick's desire for a "united fight" against Labour. Badenoch's spokesperson clarified that there would be no electoral pact with Reform, emphasizing Jenrick's aim to defeat the party and unite center-right voters. Badenoch also responded to criticism from Sir Keir Starmer, while Nigel Farage dismissed Jenrick's call for a coalition. The Conservative leader maintained a relaxed stance, asserting that Jenrick's comments did not undermine her leadership and that the party needed to win back voters from Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Opening statements have commenced in Harvey Weinstein's retrial in New York, where he faces accusations of sexual assault by three women. Prosecutors depicted Weinstein as abusing his power in Hollywood to sexually harass and abuse women, while the defense argued the women had mutually beneficial relationships with him and are motivated by money. The retrial centers on allegations from Jessica Mann, Miriam Haley, and Kaja Sokola, with the case previously overturned due to the inclusion of testimony about uncharged conduct. Weinstein, already convicted of sexual assault in California, faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, claiming it harms peace negotiations. Trump stated a deal to end the war was "very close," but Zelenskyy's stance would prolong the conflict. This follows US Vice-President JD Vance's proposal for a deal that would "freeze the territorial lines" and require both sides to cede territory. The comments highlight a fracture between the US and Ukraine, as Zelenskyy insists on not giving up Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.</p>

The states argue that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law cited by Trump to justify his tariff policy. This legal action follows a similar lawsuit filed by small businesses and argues that the tariffs disrupt the constitutional order and harm the American economy. The states are seeking a court order to declare the tariffs unlawful and prevent their enforcement.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's proposed plan for peace between Ukraine and Russia is being criticized as a reward for Moscow's aggression and war crimes. The plan involves lifting sanctions against Russia, accepting a cease-fire that leaves Russian troops on conquered Ukrainian territory, and recognizing Crimea as part of Russia. This would leave Ukraine as a vulnerable state, shorn of territory and control over its foreign policy, and would likely lead to further Russian aggression in the future. Critics argue that Trump is acting as a de facto Russian ally and making demands as Moscow's proxy.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire in New Jersey forced thousands to evacuate temporarily and sparked small blazes near a decommissioned nuclear power plant. The Jones Road wildfire in Ocean County has burned thousands of acres, but evacuation orders have been lifted and highways have reopened. Power was cut to many customers, with restoration efforts underway. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and officials expect it to continue burning for several days until rain arrives.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a surge fueled by comments from President Trump and other officials regarding tariffs, trade, and the Federal Reserve. Investors reacted positively to Trump's statement that he had "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, reversing earlier concerns about the Fed's independence. The market pared back some gains after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed speculation about unilaterally lowering tariffs on Chinese goods. The market's volatility reflects investors' sensitivity to headlines amid uncertainty about the White House's policy intentions. (not investment advice)</p>
