          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon voting session on President Trump's major legislative package, titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill." Republicans are pushing to pass the bill, which includes tax cuts, increased border security, and defense spending, before a self-imposed July 4th deadline. The legislation, which also contains cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over ten years. Democrats are using the "vote-a-rama" procedure to force votes on numerous amendments, highlighting controversial aspects of the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a method for savers to protect their money's buying power. This article outlines current national average CD rates and contrasts them with higher rates available from online banks and for shorter-term CDs. It explains the concept of an inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are higher than long-term ones, and suggests strategies like laddering CDs to take advantage of the current rate environment. The piece emphasizes that CDs offer a safe, insured way to lock in returns that can outpace inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China appears close to finalizing another substantial aircraft order with Europe's Airbus, potentially for 100 to 200 new planes, further isolating U.S. competitor Boeing. Boeing has not received a major order from China since 2017, a situation exacerbated by U.S.-China trade tensions and recent reputational issues for the American manufacturer. This potential deal follows a $20 billion Airbus purchase two years ago, signaling a strategic shift by Beijing towards European and domestic aircraft. Analysts note this move could create challenges for Chinese airlines that operate Boeing-only fleets, highlighting the geopolitical and commercial factors influencing the aviation industry.</p>

          <p>The e-commerce sector is facing its most significant slowdown in over a decade, largely attributed to President Trump's trade tariffs, according to a new survey. Online purchases for home delivery have seen double-digit declines across most major categories, with consumers delaying purchases due to price uncertainty or seeking domestic alternatives. The survey indicates that tariffs are materially influencing consumer behavior, while retailers are simultaneously tightening shipping and return policies to combat rising delivery costs. This marks a notable pullback in online shopping growth, with groceries being one of the few exceptions. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump asserted that Mamdani's political ideology is wrong for New York and the country.

Watson lost to the 23rd seed, Clara Tauson of Denmark, in a three-set match with a final score of 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. Despite a strong start where she won the first set, Watson was unable to maintain her momentum against her higher-ranked opponent. Her defeat marked a disappointing start to the second day of the tournament for British players, following a historically successful opening day for the home contingent.</p>

          <h2>The Decline of Children Biking Independently Signals a Loss of a Key Childhood Experience</h2>

          <p>The number of American children who regularly ride bicycles has fallen by nearly half since the 1990s, marking the decline of a classic childhood pastime. This trend is attributed not to a lack of interest from kids, but to parental safety concerns over busier roads, faster traffic, and larger vehicles. The article argues that this shift represents a significant loss, as independent biking fosters decision-making, spatial awareness, and resilience in children. While infrastructure like separated bike lanes could help, the piece suggests that parents can still find safe spaces for their children to learn and gain the invaluable freedom of mobility.</p>

          <p>This article presents a deeply critical analysis of President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," arguing it is a regressive policy that benefits the wealthy at the expense of the poor. The author contends the bill's $4 trillion in tax cuts, which primarily favor the top 1% of earners, are financed by devastating cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and food assistance programs. The piece projects these changes will cause millions to lose health coverage, increase healthcare costs for poor seniors, and lead to thousands of preventable deaths annually. It concludes the legislation destabilizes the American medical system while failing to address the cost-of-living crisis.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread criticism over its projected impact on the federal deficit, some financial institutions view President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" as a potential positive for the U.S. economy. Banks like Citi and Nomura argue that the bill's extension of the 2017 tax cuts would prevent a significant fiscal contraction and stimulate short-term growth and business investment. However, critics, including the Tax Foundation, label the legislation as fiscally irresponsible, projecting it will add at least $3 trillion to the deficit. They also point to poorly designed and complicated tax provisions that create administrative burdens. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks another instance of judicial intervention in Thai politics, as Paetongtarn's predecessor was also removed by the court, and the progressive Move Forward party was disbanded.

A Citi report analyzing credit card data shows that spending on luxury jewelry surged 10.1% year-over-year in May, and it was the only luxury category to see an increase in the number of individual customers. Analysts suggest this resilience is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment, its sentimental value, and the recent run-up in gold prices, making it a more attractive purchase than other high-end items.

          <p>A long-lost novel titled "Parting," written in 1932 by the then-24-year-old journalist Sebastian Haffner, has become an unexpected bestseller in Germany. The manuscript was discovered by the author's son after his death in 1999 but was only published recently, nearly a quarter-century later. Haffner, who fled Nazi Germany, is renowned for his incisive historical and political analysis, particularly his memoir "Defying Hitler." The rediscovered novel, an autobiographical love story set against the backdrop of the collapsing Weimar Republic, offers a lighter, more hopeful tone that contrasts with the doom of his later non-fiction works.</p>
