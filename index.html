          <h2>New Biography Claims Gwyneth Paltrow Found Brad Pitt Unsophisticated During Their Relationship</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 13:44:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by author Amy Odell alleges that Gwyneth Paltrow had doubts about her relationship with Brad Pitt in the 1990s, believing she was more sophisticated and educated than him. The book claims Paltrow felt their different upbringings, with Pitt from Missouri and her from Manhattan, created a cultural gap. Despite her father and friends loving Pitt, Paltrow reportedly expressed that he wasn't the right fit for her, leading to their eventual split in 1997 after a two-year engagement.</p>

          <p>Following growing bipartisan pressure, former President Trump has called for the Department of Justice to release grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. The DOJ subsequently filed a motion to unseal the records, subject to redactions to protect victim identities. The move comes as Trump distances himself from Epstein and faces a defamation lawsuit from The Wall Street Journal over a separate report. Lawmakers from both parties have voiced strong support for transparency, arguing it is crucial for restoring public trust.</p>

          <p>Despite South Carolina's status as a non-competitive state in general elections, its first-in-the-nation primary position is attracting significant early attention from potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidates. High-profile figures like governors and senators are making appearances to connect with local party officials and kingmakers. However, the state's premier spot on the calendar is not secure, with other states like North Carolina and Georgia also vying for the influential lead-off position in the next presidential cycle.</p>

          <h2>Fatal South Africa Building Collapse Was 'Entirely Preventable,' Government Report Finds</h2>

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the building collapse in the town of George that killed 34 construction workers in May 2024 was "entirely preventable." The investigation found multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and the deliberate ignoring of serious safety red flags that were raised a year before the tragedy. The public works minister has called for criminal accountability for those found negligent, as survivors and victims' families continue to deal with trauma and financial hardship.</p>

          <p>A weather pattern is set to bring severe thunderstorms and the risk of flash flooding to a large area of the United States, from the Plains and Midwest to the East Coast.

Meteorologists are particularly concerned about the potential for life-threatening flash floods in the Midwest, Appalachians, and mid-Atlantic, where some localized areas could see rainfall totals approaching 13 inches.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has reportedly revoked the visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges, escalating a campaign of pressure related to the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is facing charges for allegedly plotting a coup, and the U.S. action is widely seen as an attempt to support him. The move was denounced by Brazilian President Lula da Silva as "unacceptable external interference" and an affront to Brazil's sovereignty, further straining diplomatic relations between the two nations.</p>

This new "sun worship" frames sun avoidance as unnatural and aligns with a conspiracist mistrust of science, even as dermatologists continue to warn about the well-documented dangers of skin cancer.</p>
