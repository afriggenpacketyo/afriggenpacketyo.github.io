          <p>The CEO of technology firm Astronomer, Andy Byron, has resigned after a video of him embracing a female colleague at a Coldplay concert went viral. The footage, captured on the venue's large screen, showed the married CEO and the company's chief people officer appearing to hide once they realized they were on camera. The incident prompted the company to launch a formal investigation and place the CEO on administrative leave. In accepting his resignation, the company stated that its leaders are expected to set a standard of conduct that was not met.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating the death of a 61-year-old man who was fatally injured after being pulled into an active MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. The man reportedly entered the MRI room wearing a large metallic chain, which was attracted by the machine's powerful magnetic field. This resulted in a medical episode, and he succumbed to his injuries the following day. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that the strong magnetic fields of MRI machines pose significant physical hazards, necessitating careful screening of all people and objects entering the environment.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Clippers Strongly Considering Reunion with Veteran Guard Chris Paul</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are giving strong consideration to signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. The move would mark a return to the franchise for the 40-year-old, who was instrumental in the team's "Lob City" era from 2011 to 2017. Frank emphasized the team's desire to enhance its ball-handling and playmaking capabilities, viewing Paul as a valuable addition to a roster that includes James Harden and newly signed Bradley Beal. The team believes Paul could accept a reserve role and provide crucial depth and experience.</p>

          <p>Germany's women's national football team secured a spot in the Euro 2025 semifinals by defeating France 6-5 in a dramatic penalty shootout. The German squad played with only ten players for over 100 minutes after an early red card was issued to defender Kathrin Hendrich. Despite the numerical disadvantage and falling behind on an early penalty, Germany equalized before halftime and held on through extra time. Goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger emerged as the hero, making a crucial save in the shootout after having scored a penalty of her own.</p>

          <p>Recent data from several Western countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and New Zealand, indicates a significant decline in the popularity of learning Mandarin. In the U.S., university enrollments for the language have dropped by 25% from their peak in 2013, with similar downward trends seen in other nations. Once touted as the language of the future due to China's economic rise, interest has waned. This shift reflects a broader change in geopolitical and cultural dynamics, as the appeal of other languages grows in comparison.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch.

The lawsuit calls the report false and defamatory, accusing the Journal of journalistic failures.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that Kyiv has formally proposed a new round of peace negotiations with Moscow, suggesting the talks be held next week. In his nightly address, Zelenskyy emphasized the need to increase the momentum of negotiations and do everything possible to achieve a ceasefire. This proposal comes as Ukraine continues to face intense attacks, with Russia reportedly launching around 300 drones and 30 missiles in a single night. The attacks caused at least one death and damaged critical infrastructure in several regions.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has killed three deputies who were handling explosive materials. The deputies were identified as veterans of the department's bomb squad with many years of service. The investigation into the cause of the blast has led authorities to a Santa Monica apartment, where a grenade was recovered the day before the incident. Investigators are trying to determine if the explosives from the apartment are connected to the fatal blast at the training center.</p>

          <p>The defense team for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson, claims that Manhattan prosecutors illegally obtained his confidential medical records. His attorneys allege the District Attorney's office used a fraudulent subpoena to compel Aetna to turn over the information, violating health privacy laws like HIPAA. The DA's office sources contend they requested limited information and that Aetna sent additional materials in error, which were then deleted. The defense is requesting a hearing and sanctions, including the potential dismissal of the charges.</p>

          <p>Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing visa restrictions on Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is involved in the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. President Trump's administration enacted the sanctions, calling the case against his ally Bolsonaro a "political witch hunt." Lula described the U.S. action as unacceptable interference in another country's justice system and a violation of national sovereignty. The sanctions target the justice, his family, and other unnamed court officials, escalating tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Protesters in several cities, including London and Bristol, were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses for displaying placards expressing support for the group. The UK government banned Palestine Action earlier this month under the Terrorism Act, making support for the group a criminal offense. The ban followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and damaged military aircraft.</p>

          <p>Former major champions Henrik Stenson and Bryson DeChambeau have voiced criticism of the R&A's management of slow play during the third round of The Open. Both golfers were warned by rules officials about their pace, with Stenson calling the enforcement inconsistent after play had been significantly slower in the first two rounds. DeChambeau, who was put on the clock late in his round, argued for a more modern and fair system that times every shot for every player. The complaints highlight ongoing frustration among professional golfers regarding the inconsistent application of pace-of-play rules.</p>
