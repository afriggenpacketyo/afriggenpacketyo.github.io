          <p>A travel guide highlights twelve scenic islands across the United States that can be visited without needing to fly. Destinations like Jekyll Island, Georgia, and the Florida Keys offer a more affordable and less crowded alternative to traditional tourist spots. The article, citing a Tripadvisor expert, emphasizes the diversity of landscapes and local cultures available within driving distance. This approach provides a chance to slow down and appreciate the journey as much as the destination.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods have devastated the Texas Hill Country, resulting in at least 13 fatalities and leaving more than 20 people, including children from a summer camp, unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose by an unprecedented 26 feet in under an hour after the area received up to 12 inches of rain, triggering a massive search and rescue operation. Officials have described the situation as a "catastrophic level" flood, with emergency crews working to locate survivors in the inundated region. The state has mobilized resources to assist with the ongoing emergency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a major legislative package into law, introducing significant tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy while imposing new restrictions on social safety net programs. The bill cuts funding and access to Medicaid and SNAP, potentially leaving millions without healthcare and food assistance. It also allocates substantial funds to enhance immigration enforcement for mass deportations and rolls back green energy incentives. Critics have condemned the law, while proponents argue it will stimulate the economy and reduce waste. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a potential UFC event on White House grounds for the nation's 250th anniversary, fighter Conor McGregor has shown keen interest in participating. On social media, McGregor stated he would be "honoured" to be part of such an event and even humorously predicted he would compete as the reigning President of Ireland. The proposal involves hosting a full championship fight for a large crowd as part of the America250 celebrations. The announcement highlights the close relationship between President Trump and UFC CEO Dana White.</p>

          <p>Germany began their Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory against Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was a positive start, the team's performance was marred by an injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears with a suspected knee injury. Gwinn has a history of serious knee injuries, and her potential absence casts a shadow over the team's tournament prospects. The victory highlighted the scoring potential of Brand and Schüller, who are stepping into larger roles.</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the scene of a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The discovery was made after coroner's personnel gained access to the site of the blast, which occurred at a facility operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics. Seven people had been reported as "unaccounted for" following the incident, which leveled several structures and sparked multiple grass fires. The cause of the explosion is under investigation by multiple agencies, including Cal Fire and the ATF.</p>

          <p>President Trump used the term "shylocks" to describe some lenders during a speech, drawing criticism from groups like the Anti-Defamation League, which called it a "centuries-old antisemitic trope." The word references a greedy Jewish moneylender character from Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." When questioned, Trump stated he had never heard the term used in an antisemitic way and understood it to simply mean a moneylender who charges high interest rates. The ADL and some Democratic politicians condemned the remark as "troubling and irresponsible."</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most significant events in world history because it introduced the novel concept of a "citizen." He argued that the revolution "turned the world upside down" by shifting power away from monarchs and subjects, inspiring movements for equality for centuries. Burns emphasized that understanding America's complicated history, including the flaws of its founders, enriches its story and makes its ideals more accessible. His upcoming film aims to explore these complexities.</p>

          <p>A trial has begun for two brothers accused of assaulting three police officers at Manchester Airport in a violent confrontation captured on CCTV. Prosecutors allege that the incident in the terminal's car park was preceded by one of the brothers, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, head-butting and punching another man inside a Starbucks. The court heard that when armed police attempted to arrest Amaaz, he and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, resisted and a brawl ensued, resulting in one officer suffering a broken nose. The defendants deny the charges, claiming self-defense.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from the Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows opposition from biologists and environmental groups who warned the project would severely harm the 14 species of seabirds that nest on the atoll. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth within 90 minutes. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the military logistics program.</p>
