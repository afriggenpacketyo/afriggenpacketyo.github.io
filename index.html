          <p>UFC CEO Dana White publicly called for national unity and a return to normalcy in the aftermath of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk's assassination. During an interview on Fox News, White articulated his profound difficulty in processing the tragic event, noting its significant emotional toll on his own children and many young people who admired Kirk. He passionately urged an end to the pervasive political infighting and finger-pointing that has gripped the nation, advocating instead for collective cohesion and a restoration of stability. The article underscores White's heartfelt appeal for the country to heal and prioritize shared national values during this tumultuous period.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order establishing a "Gold Card" visa program, offering expedited immigrant visas for non-Americans who donate at least $1 million to the Commerce Department. Corporations can sponsor individuals for $2 million, with 80,000 such cards planned. This initiative, which replaces existing EB-1 and EB-2 visa programs, aims to attract high-value individuals, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The administration is also considering a $5 million "Platinum Card" for extended tax-free stays, requiring congressional approval. Additionally, an executive order imposed a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, impacting tech industries and sparking debate over its legal authority and economic implications (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A 45-year-old Argentinian hiker tragically lost his life after falling approximately 2,000 feet down a glacier on California's Mt. Shasta. Matias Augusto Travizano had successfully reached the summit but veered off the Clear Creek Trail during his descent, a path known for its hidden dangers despite being considered an easier route. He lost control while attempting a controlled slide on a steep, icy surface, colliding with a boulder and subsequently falling further down. This incident underscores the mountain's inherent risks, prompting officials to issue renewed warnings about the critical importance of climbing with a partner, carrying high-quality GPS, and remaining vigilant about rapidly changing weather conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Speaker of the UK House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, voiced significant concern that parliament remains vulnerable to espionage after charges against two men accused of spying for China were unexpectedly dropped. Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash, who consistently denied the allegations, were released because the Crown Prosecution Service determined the "evidential threshold" had not been met, a decision that drew criticism from the Home Office. Sir Lindsay expressed his profound "unhappiness," fearing this outcome effectively leaves the door open for foreign actors to infiltrate the House. Beijing had previously dismissed the allegations as "malicious slander," adding to the diplomatic tension surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz strongly criticized FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, accusing him of acting like a "mafioso" in the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz condemned Carr's threats to revoke ABC's broadcast license over Kimmel's comments about the Charlie Kirk assassination, calling them "dangerous as hell." While expressing his dislike for Kimmel's remarks, Cruz emphasized the critical importance of free speech and warned against government regulation of media content, fearing it could ultimately harm conservatives. President Trump, however, defended Carr, disagreeing with Cruz despite their usual alliance, highlighting the divisive nature of the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Japanese defense researcher has expressed significant concern that the U.S.'s waning interest in regional relations and its weakening ties with India are actively eroding American-led alliances across Asia, thereby creating strategic openings for China. From Japan's perspective, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) — which includes Australia, India, Japan, and the United States — is considered a vital diplomatic instrument for maintaining a crucial balance against China. However, President Trump's perceived disinterest in the Quad and the deteriorating U.S.-India partnership, evidenced by his decision not to attend a scheduled summit, are deeply troubling for Japan regarding regional stability and the delicate balance of power.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a third U.S. lethal kinetic strike on an alleged drug trafficking vessel in international Caribbean waters, resulting in three fatalities. Trump stated the strike was ordered against a boat linked to a Designated Terrorist Organization, which he claimed was transporting illicit narcotics intended to "poison Americans." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a video showing the vessel being struck by an apparent missile and engulfed in flames. This action follows Trump's earlier reclassification of drug cartels as terrorist organizations, a move that enables the use of military force but has drawn criticism regarding its legal justification and potential implications for international law.</p>

Shoppers like Mary May received fake supplements, and CNBC found at least 43 vendors impersonating legitimate businesses, including a pizza parlor selling luxury face cream. Critics argue Walmart's vetting process became lax to compete with Amazon, prioritizing growth over safety, despite the company's "zero-tolerance policy." Following CNBC's reporting, Walmart tightened vetting for health and beauty products, but the issue highlights the challenges of policing large online marketplaces and the ongoing debate over platform liability for harmful goods.</p>

The core issue remains the ownership of TikTok's powerful algorithm. Trump, who has previously delayed a ban, now views the platform as key for his 2024 campaign, while U.S. lawmakers continue to express national security concerns over ByteDance's links to the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

Judge Steven Merryday stated the 85-page filing was a "megaphone for public relations" rather than a serious legal document. While not ruling on the legal merits, the judge granted Trump's lawyers 28 days to refile an amended complaint, emphasizing it must be professional and concise. The Times welcomed the ruling, reiterating its view that the lawsuit was an attempt to stifle independent reporting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing an annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, a move expected to significantly impact the U.S. tech industry. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the policy aims to encourage companies to train and hire more Americans, asserting that "all the big companies" are on board. Critics, including venture capitalists and immigration experts, question the executive branch's legal authority to impose such a high fee, warning it could deter top global talent and reduce U.S. innovation and economic growth. This marks the latest effort by the Trump administration to curb or monetize legal immigration (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement agencies are implementing extensive security measures for the upcoming memorial service of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, anticipating over 100,000 attendees. The event, expected to host President Trump and Vice President Vance, has been designated a Special Event Assessment Rating Level 1 (SEAR-1), a classification on par with the Super Bowl. While a security assessment identified "several threats of unknown credibility," it confirmed no verified plots against the event. Security protocols include uniformed and plain-clothes officers, drones, 300 surveillance cameras, and counterterrorism sniper teams, underscoring the high-stakes and politically charged environment surrounding the gathering.</p>

          <p>President Trump and FCC Chair Brendan Carr have threatened to revoke broadcast TV station licenses, particularly after ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel following his comments on the Charlie Kirk assassination. This article explains that networks obtain spectrum licenses from the federal government, requiring them to operate in the "public interest." While the FCC has regulatory power over local stations, revoking a license is a complex process involving investigations and legal challenges, typically for issues like obscenity or children's programming, not political content. The situation highlights mounting pressure on broadcasters, especially those seeking government approval for mergers, like Nexstar, which preempted Kimmel's show.</p>
