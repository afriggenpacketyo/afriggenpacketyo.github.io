        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a top-10 college football game, No. 9 LSU secured a 17-10 road victory over No. 4 Clemson in a game dominated by defense. Both offenses struggled to find consistency, with multiple punts, fumbles, and field goal attempts marking the initial drives. LSU's Garrett Nussmeier completed 28 of 38 passes for 230 yards, while Clemson's Cade Klubnik completed 19 of 38 passes, also for 230 yards, but the ground game was largely ineffective for both teams. The game remained close until late, when LSU capitalized on Clemson's offensive struggles to secure the win, with Clemson failing to convert on a crucial fourth down in the final minutes. The final score was 17-10. </p>

          <p>Tyler Glasnow of the Dodgers pitched impressively, carrying a no-hitter into the sixth inning and a shutout into the seventh, but ultimately suffered a 6-1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Glasnow's strong outing was undermined by the Dodgers' offensive struggles, who failed to provide adequate run support. Eduardo Rodriguez of Arizona pitched well too, limiting the Dodgers to minimal hits through four innings. With the Padres winning, the Dodgers' lead in the NL West is now down to a single game, despite Glasnow throwing 100 pitches in seven innings and striking out six. </p>

          <p>Thousands of people marched across Mexico to protest the more than 130,000 disappearances, demanding government action to address the crisis.

          <p>A showpeople family in Glasgow is fighting eviction from their yard on Water Row, where they have lived for over 40 years. Glasgow City Council is seeking to redevelop the area, which is part of a multi-million pound regeneration plan. The family, led by 76-year-old Jimmy Stringfellow, claims the council has threatened them with eviction more than 20 times. The case will be heard at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, with the family arguing their eviction would violate the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p>

          <p>Konami has released a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, years after the series' creator, Hideo Kojima, left the company. The Metal Gear series, known for its cinematic storytelling and complex themes, has sold over 60 million copies. The split between Kojima and Konami in 2015 left the series directionless, but this remake marks a return for the franchise. The remake is said to be faithful to the original, with improved graphics and audio, while retaining the essence of the original game. </p>

          <p>A 10-year-old survivor of the Annunciation Catholic Church shooting in Minneapolis, Weston Halsne, was found to have a bullet fragment lodged in his neck.

          <p>The Bayeux Tapestry, documenting the Norman invasion of England in 1066, will be closed to the public in France before being moved to London. The move has faced opposition from the French art world, with experts fearing the delicate tapestry is too fragile to be transported. A petition against the loan has garnered 60,000 signatures, criticizing President Macron's decision. The tapestry will be displayed at the British Museum from next autumn until July 2027, in exchange for treasures from Sutton Hoo and the Lewis chess pieces traveling to Normandy. </p>

          <p>UK government scientists are using drones, sniffer dogs, and nuclear waste models to combat the spread of the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, which poses a significant threat to UK forests. The beetle has caused widespread damage in Europe, and government efforts to control its spread include surveying forests with drones and using dogs to detect infestations. While the UK claims to have eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas, climate change could make the job more challenging in the future. The efforts are aimed at protecting the UK's spruce forests. </p>
