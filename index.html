          <p>This article provides a retrospective on the 40th anniversary of the Live Aid concert, covering its massive global reach, fundraising goals for Ethiopian famine relief, and iconic musical moments. It also critically examines its flaws, such as the lack of African performers and the "white savior" complex accusations against organizer Bob Geldof. The article concludes by reflecting on the event's lasting legacy and whether such global unity could be replicated in the modern, social media-driven age.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney General has ordered the dismissal of all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore Jr., a Utah plastic surgeon accused of destroying COVID-19 vaccines and providing fake vaccination cards. Dr. Moore was indicted in 2023 for allegedly defrauding the U.S. government by providing over 1,900 fraudulent vaccine certificates and giving saline shots to children at their parents' request. The dismissal was framed by supporters as a move against the "weaponization of government," highlighting a deep political and social divide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Campaigners in the UK are calling for cosmetic and skincare ingredient lists to be in English, not Latin, to protect consumers with allergies. The current system, using the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), relies on Latin-based names that are difficult for the public to understand, potentially leading to life-threatening allergic reactions. While the industry association argues that INCI provides a globally consistent standard, individuals and politicians are pushing for clearer labeling similar to food products to mitigate risks for allergy sufferers.</p>

          <p>North Korea has publicly vowed to provide "unconditional support" for Russia's war in Ukraine, reinforcing the deepening ties between the two nations. The pledge came after a meeting between North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, where they signed a "2026-2027 exchange plan." This follows a mutual-defense pact from the previous year and reports from the Pentagon that North Korea has already supplied Russia with troops and significant quantities of arms, including ballistic missiles.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's decision to withhold further records from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation and state that a "client list" never existed has created a rift among President Trump's supporters. The move sparked a reported confrontation between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, disappointing far-right figures who expected bombshell revelations. In response to the infighting, Trump posted on social media expressing support for Bondi, whom he said was doing a "fantastic job," and urged his followers not to "waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein."</p>
