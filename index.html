          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City and New Jersey area on Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the minor tremors were felt across the region but resulted in no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Officials reassured the public that while quakes are rare on the East Coast, this event was not considered significant. The incident was contrasted with a larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that had rattled the same area in April 2024.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly rejected a potential deal with Democrats that would have advanced a block of his nominees in exchange for unfreezing certain funds, urging Republicans on social media to refuse the offer. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of scuttling the bipartisan progress, stating the president "took his ball and went home" after not getting his way. The exchange highlights the intense political friction over federal appointments as the Senate prepared to break for its August recess. The specific details of the proposed deal were not made public, leading to conflicting narratives from both sides.</p>

          <p>In a detailed interview from prison, David Berkowitz discusses the 1976-1977 killing spree that terrorized New York City, where he murdered six people and wounded seven. Berkowitz, now in his late 60s and serving six life sentences, describes his actions as being influenced by dark, demonic forces and expresses remorse for the pain he caused. He reflects on his troubled childhood, his conversion to Christianity in prison, and his current life, stating he despises the "Son of Sam" moniker. The article contrasts his present-day claims of faith with the brutal reality of his crimes and the lasting trauma for his victims.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for allegedly violating the Hatch Act, which prohibits government employees from engaging in political activities. This non-criminal probe follows a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who argued that Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were intended to harm his 2024 election prospects. The OSC is an independent federal agency separate from the special counsel role Smith held. Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland have consistently maintained that their actions were not politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Over three decades after four teenage girls were murdered in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, continuing to torment their families and the original investigators. The 1991 crime involved the victims being tied up, shot, and the shop set on fire, destroying evidence. Although four men were arrested and two were convicted years later, the convictions were overturned due to constitutional issues and new DNA evidence that did not match any of the suspects. The case is now at a standstill, with lingering questions about two unidentified men seen at the shop that night and hopes resting on advancements in DNA technology.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare technique using a swarm of drones to create a protective bubble for allied forces. By precisely coordinating the signals from multiple drones, the system can generate a targeted 'null' zone where enemy jamming signals are effectively canceled out. This creates a 'storm eye' of clear communication for friendly units while simultaneously disrupting adversary systems. The technology represents a shift from traditional brute-force jamming, which often causes indiscriminate interference affecting both friend and foe.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in entertainment. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for the profession and recalled feeling 'completely out of my depth' when breaking tragic news to patients. His stepfather's death at age 54 made him realize he did not want to spend his life in a career he wasn't passionate about. He subsequently found widespread fame with shows like 'Harry Hill's TV Burp,' though he admits he does not miss the stress of its weekly production schedule.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 19:01:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for a fee of around £30 million, just two years after signing him. The potential sale is linked to the club's ongoing interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While United sources state they can acquire Sesko without first selling players, an exit like Hojlund's would help ensure compliance with financial regulations. Hojlund recently expressed his desire to stay at the club, but his position would likely be marginalized if another top striker were to arrive at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more 'careful' with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift comes as China's tech companies are rapidly advancing and releasing their own powerful open-source models. Renowned computer scientist Andrew Ng suggests that China's competitive 'Darwinian' open-source ecosystem may be its path to surpassing the U.S. in AI. Recently, Chinese firms like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have launched new open-source video and language models, claiming they are among the most advanced in the world.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia in 1943 has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during World War II, but perished just days before reaching England. For decades, it was rumored the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, recent archival research by students at the University of Sydney revealed logbooks showing the platypus was exposed to prolonged high temperatures as the ship crossed the equator, suggesting it likely died from heat stress.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using large-scale theme parks as a strategy to boost its domestic economy and fuel consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest addition to a rapidly growing attractions industry, which is forecast to expand by 19% annually over the next three years. According to the global association for the theme park industry, these attractions serve as significant economic drivers for local economies. For every one yuan of operating revenue a park generates, it creates an estimated 3.8 yuan of broader economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

A musician, composer, and playwright, Rahbani was known for his sharp social and political commentary, often criticizing the country's sectarian leaders. Born to a famous musical family, including his mother, the legendary singer Fairuz, he forged his own path by blending jazz and samba with traditional Arab music. His work, particularly his collaborations with his mother, transformed her iconic image and brought a new, more human dimension to her music.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, President Trump's foreign policy approach, which views allies as a burden, is dangerously isolating the United States. In a recent analysis, Schake argues that this strategy reduces American power by discouraging cooperation from other nations, who may begin to hedge against U.S. influence. She points to examples like Japan and South Korea considering a trade agreement with China for greater predictability. Schake contends that while costly, sustaining the current international order is less expensive than having to protect U.S. interests without the help of allies.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who use social media and other online platforms to advertise illegal Channel crossings. The proposed law, part of a broader crackdown on small boat migration, could result in up to five years in prison for those creating material that promotes or facilitates breaches of UK immigration law. Home Office analysis indicates that around 80% of migrants arriving by small boat used social media during their journey. The National Crime Agency already works to remove such content but believes the new offense will provide more power to disrupt criminal gangs.</p>
