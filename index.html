          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, Israel claims Iran violated the agreement by launching more missiles. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to continue attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures in response to the violation. Iran denies launching missiles after the ceasefire took effect, while Israeli first responders report casualties from an Iranian missile strike in Beersheba. The conflict between Israel and Iran began on June 13, with escalating strikes and counterattacks resulting in numerous casualties on both sides. Optimism is low given the renewed violence and broken ceasefire.</p>

The columnist argues that the administration's policies have not yet produced solid results and that the claim is misleading.

          <p>Proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration, including reductions to indirect costs for research, threaten the scientific enterprise, according to UC Santa Barbara professor David L. Valentine. Indirect costs support essential services and infrastructure that enable scientists to conduct research. A proposed reduction to 15% would cripple research support and hinder future discoveries, breakthroughs, and life-changing advances. Valentine argues that the scientific greatness of the United States is fragile and that these cuts risk irreparable harm to it.</p>

          <p>The UK has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. While the government argues that measures on energy and tackling smuggling could be classified as security spending, critics like Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel argue that the target should be reached sooner. The decision comes amid increased pressure on NATO members to boost defense spending due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Trump's call for allies to increase their contributions.</p>

To fully utilize the $10,000 deduction, a loan of approximately $112,000 would be needed, typically associated with luxury cars. The tax break is also limited by income thresholds, making it unlikely for most households to claim the full benefit. The legislation has passed the House and may be voted on in the Senate, aiming to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to provide a tax break on car loan interest. (not investment advice)</p>
