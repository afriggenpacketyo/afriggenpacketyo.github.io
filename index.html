        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, one focused on streaming and studios, and the other on global networks including TNT Sports, which raises questions about the future of TNT's live sports rights. CEO David Zaslav indicated that the Global Networks division will decide how to monetize TNT Sports' streaming and digital rights, which could involve licensing deals or a merger with another entity. The current agreement sees TNT Sports content on HBO Max, but Zaslav suggested that sports haven't been a major driver for HBO Max sign-ups in the U.S., so the company will evaluate its options. The separation is expected to be completed by mid-2026, giving the Global Networks team ample time to consider various strategies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and The New York Times. Baldoni, who directed and co-starred in the movie *It Ends With Us* with Lively, filed the suit after Lively alleged sexual harassment during the film's production, which coincided with a New York Times article detailing Baldoni's public relations efforts. Judge Lewis J. Liman ruled that Baldoni failed to demonstrate actual malice in Lively's allegations and that the Times reported on the available evidence, though possibly in a dramatized manner. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication, calling Baldoni's lawsuit a sham.</p>

          <p>Following immigration raids in Los Angeles, which led to riots, Democratic politicians are walking back their pro-law enforcement rhetoric from the post-January 6th era. Figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have condemned the raids as authoritarian overreach, contrasting their previous support for law and order after the Capitol riot. President Trump has authorized the deployment of the National Guard to quell the violence, bypassing Newsom, who has been criticized by the White House for failing to control the situation. This shift highlights a divide in how Democrats address civil unrest depending on the political context.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt remaining a significant concern for many Americans, it is important to proactively reduce debt and understand the impact of various debt relief solutions. Rather than waiting for potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which may have a negligible impact, borrowers should explore options like credit card debt forgiveness and debt management programs. Each debt relief solution has different criteria, so it is important to research eligibility requirements and gather necessary documentation.

Demand for these minerals is projected to increase significantly by 2040, but their uneven distribution across the world raises concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities. Countries are exploring ways to secure more mineral supplies, including ocean mining and space mining, while also investing in research and development to find alternative materials. The challenge lies in ensuring a sustainable and equitable supply of these resources to power a greener world.</p>

          <p>The ongoing dispute between the Trump administration and Harvard University over international student visas could have a significant economic impact, potentially costing the Boston economy $180 million. International students contribute substantially to the U.S. economy, with Harvard supporting over 1,125 local jobs through its international student population. A ban on international enrollment could destabilize a vital revenue stream for the university and the surrounding region. The dispute highlights the economic importance of international students and the potential consequences of restrictive visa policies.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres cautioned against the dangers of unregulated deep-sea mining, warning that it could turn the seabed into a "wild west." At the UN Ocean Conference, Guterres highlighted threats to the oceans, including pollution and rising sea temperatures, while urging ratification of the High Seas Treaty. French President Emmanuel Macron echoed these concerns, advocating for a moratorium on deep-sea mining. The US, China, and Russia are among those interested in exploiting mineral wealth on the ocean floor, raising concerns about environmental damage.</p>

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old who was groomed before being charged with terrorism offences, found there were missed opportunities by authorities to help her. The coroner concluded there were chances for the police and Derbyshire County Council to refer Rudd earlier for consideration as a potential victim of modern slavery. The inquest found no organization was to blame for her death, but highlighted missed opportunities to provide mental health support sooner. The case underscores the challenges in managing vulnerable young people involved in radicalization.</p>
