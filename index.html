          <p>Ian Cleary has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a fellow college student in 2013, a decade after the attack. The case gained national attention after Cleary sent his victim, Shannon Keeler, a Facebook message in 2019 stating, "So I raped you." Keeler's persistent efforts to seek justice led to Cleary's extradition from France in 2024. As part of a proposed plea deal, he faces a potential sentence of four to eight years in prison, bringing a long-awaited conclusion to the victim's fight for accountability.</p>

          <p>Netflix reported strong financial results for the second quarter, beating analyst expectations with a 16% year-over-year jump in revenue to $11.08 billion. The company also raised its full-year revenue and free cash flow forecasts, citing healthy member growth and increased ad sales. This marks the second quarter that Netflix has not released its subscriber numbers, instead focusing on metrics like revenue and operating margin. Despite the positive report, shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading, potentially due to warnings of higher costs in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has launched a sustained social media campaign criticizing the Trump administration for not releasing more files related to Jeffrey Epstein. In numerous posts on his X platform, Musk accused the administration of a "cover up," suggesting powerful people want the information suppressed. This follows the administration's decision not to release additional documents after previously indicating it would. The White House has largely dismissed the attacks, while President Trump has labeled the controversy the "Epstein Hoax."</p>

          <p>The White House has stated that President Trump will not recommend appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case, despite calls from some of his own supporters. This decision comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that no further files would be disclosed, angering many who expected more transparency. The move has intensified criticism of the administration's handling of the matter, which President Trump has dismissed as a politically motivated "hoax" by his opponents.</p>

          <p>A new legislative proposal from Republican Senator Bernie Moreno aims to impose harsher penalties on executives of publicly traded companies who knowingly hire undocumented workers. The SAFE HIRE Act would require CEOs to certify their compliance with employment verification laws in annual SEC reports. Knowingly making false certifications could lead to up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine, with even steeper penalties for violations involving the employment of undocumented individuals. The bill is part of a broader push for stricter immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has secured an agreement to access the federal Medicaid database, which contains personal information on 79 million low-income Americans. The stated purpose is to identify and locate non-citizens, though critics decry the move as a dangerous "weaponization of data" that violates privacy.

          <p>This article explores the history of commercial air travel, challenging the popular myth of a mid-century "golden age" of glamour. It argues that while flying has certainly changed, it has always been fraught with challenges, from the physical dangers of early flights to the crowding and discomfort of later decades. The piece suggests that the perceived glamour was more about the novel idea of flight and the privilege it represented than the actual experience. It concludes that the transformation of this miracle into a mundane, often tedious, form of transit is a remarkable human achievement in itself.</p>

          <p>The reunited members of the rock band Jane's Addiction are suing each other following an onstage altercation that led to the cancellation of their 2024 tour. Singer Perry Farrell and his bandmates, including guitarist Dave Navarro, have filed dueling lawsuits in Los Angeles. Each side presents a wildly different account of the fight, with both alleging assault, battery, and breach of contract. The lawsuits expose the deep-seated antagonism within the band and place the blame for the tour's collapse on opposing parties.</p>

The mariner was one of several crew members rescued by the Yemeni navy after the vessel was attacked with sea drones and grenades over two days. While ten of the 25 people aboard were rescued, the remaining 15 are still considered missing. The attack is part of a broader campaign by the Iran-aligned Houthis targeting commercial shipping in the region.</p>

          <p>Recent Supreme Court rulings indicate a strong tendency by the conservative majority to support President Trump's assertions of executive authority over federal agencies. The court has repeatedly issued brief, unexplained orders allowing the administration to proceed with staff cuts and dismissals of officials that lower courts had blocked. This trend is rooted in the 'unitary executive theory,' which posits that the president has full control over the executive branch. Critics warn this shift is enabling an accumulation of power in the presidency without sufficient checks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation announced it is rescinding $4 billion in federal funding for California's ambitious high-speed rail project. The administration cited a lack of a viable path forward, citing missed deadlines, significant budget shortfalls, and the state's failure to secure the additional $7 billion needed for the initial segment. This move reverses a decision made under the previous administration to restore the funds. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the decision, which represents a major setback for the long-delayed infrastructure project.</p>

          <p>A review of the new animated "Smurfs" movie suggests it is a modest, child-friendly film that offers little beyond a celebrity voice cast and a new song from Rihanna. The film is described as light and unambitious, with a plot about a Smurf searching for his defining characteristic. The reviewer notes that the movie's attempts at humor for adults often feel forced and dated. Ultimately, the article concludes that this latest attempt to reboot the classic cartoon franchise is unlikely to leave a lasting impression.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor and daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, was abruptly fired by the Justice Department. Her dismissal is widely seen as politically motivated due to President Trump's long-standing animosity towards her father.

In a message to colleagues, she warned against fear, calling it "the tool of a tyrant" used to suppress independent thought.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the federal Stafford Act. This change would allow states and local governments to request and receive FEMA funding for heat-related emergencies, such as operating cooling centers or undertaking heat adaptation projects. The proposal comes after a deadly heat dome broke records across the U.S. in June. Proponents argue federal policy must evolve to address the growing physical and economic risks posed by rising global temperatures.</p>

The comments were criticized by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, while some colleagues defended Abbott, urging people to listen to the full interview.</p>

Several theaters in the U.S. have sold out their initial early showings for the star-studded adaptation of Homer's epic. This high demand reflects the powerful draw of Nolan's filmmaking and the Imax format, which together turned his previous film, "Oppenheimer," into a global box office phenomenon.

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria, ostensibly to protect the Druze minority during sectarian clashes, may serve broader strategic goals, according to analysts. The article suggests Israel aims to maintain a weak and fragmented Syria, create an informal buffer zone in the south, and prevent the new government from consolidating power. Some experts also believe the timing of the strikes could be a tactic by Prime Minister Netanyahu to deflect from domestic political pressures and project an image of strength amid ongoing legal and coalition troubles.</p>
