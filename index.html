          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow thunderstorm warning for parts of northern England, the Scottish Borders, and Wales. The warning is in effect from Saturday afternoon into Sunday, with potential for localized flash flooding, large hail, and frequent lightning due to the humid weather conditions. An amber heat-health alert is also in place until Monday, raising concerns about pressures on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. Firefighters have responded to a significant surge in wildfires, and scientists emphasize that climate change is making heatwaves hotter and longer. Optimism remains moderate as authorities take precautions and cooler air is anticipated to bring relief soon.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is advocating for the House of Lords to pass the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would grant terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill, already approved by MPs, faces scrutiny in the Lords, with some peers raising concerns about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasizes the bill's rigorous safeguards, including multiple declarations and assessments by independent doctors and a multi-disciplinary panel. Critics, like Lord Shinkwin, fear the bill could pressure disabled and older individuals to end their lives, despite assurances that disability or mental disorder will not qualify anyone for assisted dying. Despite her support, Rantzen acknowledges the bill is unlikely to become law in her lifetime.</p>

          <p>Kris Jenner's recent youthful appearance has sparked speculation about a possible deep plane facelift, with experts weighing in on the potential procedures involved. While a representative for Jenner confirmed that Dr. Steven Levine performed the work, the specific type of procedure was not disclosed. Experts suggest that the structural elements of her face were lifted, possibly with a fat transfer, to achieve a natural and youthful look. They also discussed the differences between traditional and deep plane facelifts, as well as the risks and recovery associated with each procedure. Experts emphasize the importance of choosing a board-certified facial plastic surgeon and discussing medical history, lifestyle, and aesthetic goals before undergoing surgery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been conducting increasingly frequent and intense military maneuvers around Taiwan, evolving from occasional sorties to a coordinated campaign for combat training and strategic signaling. These operations fall into three categories: near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises, each varying in scale, intensity, and purpose. The near-daily patrols have sharply increased since 2024, after William Lai Ching-te assumed office as Taiwanese leader. These actions are seen as a way for China to assert its claims over Taiwan and signal its displeasure with the island's government. The tempo and intensity of these maneuvers have steadily increased in recent years.</p>

          <p>Reporters for Voice of America and other U.S.-funded networks are expressing concerns about their safety and job security following mass layoffs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media. The layoffs, initiated by the Trump administration, have led to the termination of contracts for many foreign journalists who risk political retribution in their home countries. The situation is compounded by the imprisonment of journalists in countries like Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Vietnam. Some VOA journalists are seeking asylum in the U.S. due to fears of persecution if they return home, while others are scrambling to find new jobs as their visas expire. The U.S. government's commitment to protecting these journalists is now in question.</p>

          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a prolonged slump, exacerbated by the country's shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates a significant decrease in demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities, projecting it to remain suppressed at under 5 million units per year, a fraction of the 2017 peak. China's population has been declining for the past three years, contributing to the crippled home demand by 0.5 million units every year in the 2020s and a lead to a bigger dent of 1.4 million units annually in the 2030s. Despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, stagnant incomes, job instability, and a poor social security system continue to dissuade young people from having more children.

          <p>Japan has been proactively addressing supply chain resilience, particularly in response to China's dominance in rare earth minerals. Following a 2010 export ban by China, Japan invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects, reducing its dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. The country has focused on stockpiling, recycling, and promoting alternative technologies. Despite these efforts, Japan still faces challenges in cutting its dependency on China, especially for heavy rare earth elements. As Western nations seek to diversify their critical mineral supply chains, Japan's experience serves as both a template and a reminder of the difficulties involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article examines the current state of feminist critique of celebrities, arguing that it has devolved into snide and often puritanical tellings-off. It critiques the online platforms that amplify extreme views and the tendency to chastise women for expressing their sexuality. The author contrasts this with the rich arguments of the 1970s sex wars, advocating for a more nuanced and economically aware approach to critiquing images of sexual subordination. The article suggests that policing women's sexuality under the guise of safety is a dangerous and ignorant approach that restricts women's expression.</p>

          <p>The NHS is planning to DNA test all newborn babies in England to assess their risk of hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness, with £650m invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The plan aims to ease pressure on NHS services by using genomics and AI to provide faster diagnoses and early warnings for diseases. The screening will involve sequencing the complete DNA of newborns using blood samples from their umbilical cord.</p>
