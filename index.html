          <h2>Understanding Market Circuit Breakers Amid Trade Tension-Induced Volatility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 23:04:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global trade tensions escalate due to unexpectedly high tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump, exchanges are implementing trading halts to prevent market crashes. These halts, known as 'circuit breakers,' are triggered by rapid declines in stock prices and futures. During non-U.S. trading hours, a 7% drop in S&P futures results in a trading halt until buyers emerge at the 'limit down' level, with Russell 2000 futures briefly hitting this threshold overnight. These measures are designed to provide a cooling-off period during times of extreme market volatility, similar to those seen during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 22:56:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asian markets experienced a significant downturn following a major sell-off on Wall Street triggered by President Trump's tariff increases and China's retaliatory measures. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell nearly 8%, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also saw substantial losses. The market declines reflect investor concerns about a potential trade war between the U.S. and China, with the Commerce Ministry in Beijing announcing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. Some analysts fear that the trade war could lead to a global recession, while others hold out hope that Trump will lower tariffs after negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he will not consider making a deal regarding his sweeping tariffs against China unless America's trade deficit with the country is resolved first. Speaking to reporters, Trump emphasized the significant trade deficit with China, asserting that it amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars a year. He also mentioned the TikTok deal being in limbo due to China's disapproval, which he attributes to the tariffs. Trump suggested that a slight reduction in tariffs could swiftly lead to the deal's approval, highlighting the perceived influence of tariffs in negotiations.</p>

          <p>An Illinois family emerged unharmed after lightning struck their car while driving on a highway. The family reported hearing a loud noise resembling a gunshot before the vehicle filled with smoke. The lightning strike disabled the car's electrical system and caused an explosion that damaged the rear bumper and exhaust system. Authorities closed several roads due to flooding and warned drivers to exercise caution near rising water. The family's vehicle was towed from the scene and there were no reported injuries.</p>

          <p>Overseas financial markets plunged early Monday, while U.S. stock futures came under renewed selling pressure after leading indexes crumbled last week amid investor fears over the economic fallout from the Trump administration's latest tariff salvo. Japan's Nikkei 225 index tumbled nearly 8% shortly after the market opened in Tokyo, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped more than 6%. South Korea's Kospi lost 4.4%. The average U.S. tariff rate on imported goods is now at its highest level since 1909, according to the Yale Budget Lab. Despite last week's market rout, some Wall Street economists expect the Trump administration to ease tariffs on certain countries in the months ahead in return for their lowering trade barriers.</p>

The race was last held in 2019, with 950 foreigners participating. North Korea has been slow to reopen since the pandemic, allowing only Russian tourists into its capital since last year, making this event a notable step towards re-engagement with the international community.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has deemed the U.S. government's decision to deport a Maryland man to a notorious prison in El Salvador as "wholly lawless." Judge Paula Xinis stated that there was little to no evidence to support the allegation that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was in the MS-13 street gang. She also noted that an immigration judge had barred the U.S. from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in 2019. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the deportation and likened the comments of a now-suspended Justice Department attorney to "a defense attorney walking in, conceding something in a criminal matter."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering closing the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office created in the 1960s during the civil rights movement. The office is tasked with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions and civil disorders. Former leaders of the Community Relations Service worry that shuttering the office could lead to a surge in disputes between police departments or city leaders and minority communities nationwide. The Justice Department memo indicates some of the current Community Relations Service staff would be reassigned to federal prosecutors' offices nationwide.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson and Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna have reached an agreement to end the fight over proxy voting for new parents, which will re-open the House floor after nearly a week of legislative paralysis. House Republican leaders will formalize "vote pairing," a procedure that allows a member who is absent during a vote to coordinate with a present member on the other side of the matter to offset the absence. Luna thanked President Donald Trump for his "support" of new mothers. Johnson is still looking at ways to increase accessibility for new mothers in Congress like adding a room off the House floor for nursing mothers, sources said.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump said Sunday evening that he is not intentionally engineering the ongoing stock market sell-off, but said little to try and dissuade it. He cited the trade deficit with China as his rationale for pressing on with his tariffs plan despite the recent pain in the markets. Trump's comments echo those made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said the administration will remain steadfast in its plans for reciprocal tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, even in the face of the global stock market sell-off.</p>

The state pension has gone up by 4.1%, to match rising wages, under the so-called triple-lock. However, income tax thresholds remain frozen, potentially drawing more people into higher tax brackets.</p>

          <p>The new BBC drama, This City Is Ours, featuring James Nelson-Joyce, has been dubbed the 'Scouse Sopranos' due to its exploration of a gangster balancing criminal life with family. Nelson-Joyce plays Michael Kavanagh, working for drug lord Ronnie Phelan (Sean Bean), and struggles with his desire for domestic bliss with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The drama explores themes of vulnerability and changing masculinity. Creator Stephen Butchard drew inspiration from Shakespeare to explore ambition, greed, love, and betrayal.</p>

          <p>Newly-qualified medical students in the UK are facing uncertainty over their job locations, with some being told their placement only weeks before starting. This is due to a new system of allocating foundation jobs randomly, which has led to a higher proportion of students not getting their preferred placements. The British Medical Association (BMA) has accused the government of failing to plan for an increase in resident doctors after increasing the number of medical school places, leading to concerns that students may move abroad.&#x20;</p>
